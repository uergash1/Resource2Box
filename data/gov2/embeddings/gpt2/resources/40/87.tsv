The new law gives state and tribal governments broad latitude to meet   specified work requirements. However, requirements of other laws affecting   workers and the workplace also must be met.      In an effort to help you better understand the requirements of these   other laws, the United States Department of Labor has prepared a guide entitled    ""How Workplace Laws Apply to Welfare Recipients""  that   is attached. In addition, the United States Department of Agriculture has   developed additional guidance to clarify the use of food stamps as a means to   meet the requirements of the minimum wage law that is also attached.      If you have questions concerning the application of workplace laws to   the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, please direct inquiries to   the  U.S. Department of Labor or other designated   contact.                                           How Workplace Laws Apply to Welfare     Recipients                   The passage of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity   Reconciliation Act of 1996 (PRWORA) in August 1996 increased emphasis on the   need to move welfare recipients from welfare to work. Under the Act, the Aid to   Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program was replaced with the Temporary   Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program. The new welfare law gives state   and tribal governments broad latitude to meet specified work   requirements. (1)  However, requirements of other laws affecting workers and   the workplace also must be met.      Work Activities and   Requirements        The welfare law requires that a designated percentage   of all TANF families have an adult engaged in work activities (families with no   adults are exempted). States have the option of exempting single parents of   children under one from the work requirement. The required participation rates   increase each year, culminating at 50 percent for all families with an adult   and 90 percent for two-parent families in FY 2002.        In order to be counted towards the work participation rate, a single   parent is required to be engaged in a work activity, as defined by the law, for   25 hours in FY 1999 and 30 hours beginning in FY 2000. For an adult in a   two-parent family, 35 hours of work are required. Qualifying work activities   include a range of subsidized and unsubsidized, private and public sector   employment.        In addition, a limited number of TANF recipients can meet the work   requirement by participating in vocational training and high school education   programs. (2)      About This Guide        This guide contains general questions and answers on   how workplace laws enforced by the Department of Labor apply to welfare   recipients. It is an effort to answer fundamental questions about the   relationship between welfare law and workplace laws such as the Fair Labor   Standards Act (FLSA), the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA),   Unemployment Insurance (UI) and anti-discrimination laws. States should   consider the applicability of these laws as they design and implement their   work programs. The guide also addresses the relationship between the tax   treatment of welfare benefits and workplace laws.        This guide is simply a starting point. It cannot provide the answers to   the wide variety of inquiries that could be raised regarding specific work   programs. The impact of workplace laws on work programs for welfare recipients   and the answers to many questions will be determined by the specific facts of   the particular situation. Many questions will have to be answered on a   case-by-case basis.       Employment Laws      1. Do federal employment laws apply to welfare recipients   participating in work activities under the new welfare law in the same manner   they apply to other workers?         Yes. Federal employment laws, such as the Fair Labor Standards Act   (FLSA), the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA), Unemployment Insurance   (UI), and anti-discrimination laws, apply to welfare recipients as they apply   to other workers. The new welfare law does not exempt welfare recipients from   these laws.       The Fair Labor Standards Act      2. Does that mean that welfare recipients engaged in work   activities under the new welfare law will have to be paid the minimum   wage?       The minimum wage and other FLSA requirements apply to welfare   recipients as they apply to all other workers. If welfare recipients are   ""employees"" under the FLSA's broad definition, they must be compensated at the   applicable minimum wage. (3)         Welfare recipients would probably be considered employees in   many, if not most, of the work activities described in the new welfare law.   Exceptions are most likely to include individuals engaged in activities such as   vocational education, job search assistance, and secondary school attendance,   because these programs are not ordinarily considered employment under the   FLSA.        3. Are welfare recipients who participate in job training exempt   from the minimum wage laws?      An individual in training that meets certain criteria under the FLSA and   is not otherwise an employee, is considered a trainee and is not entitled to   the minimum wage. Similarly, a welfare recipient engaged in training that meets   those criteria would not be an employee covered by the minimum wage   requirements of the FLSA. The relevant criteria for such training are:        • Training is similar to that given in a vocational   school;   • Training is for the benefit of the   trainees;  • Trainees do not displace regular employees;    • Employers derive no immediate advantage from trainees' activities;     • Trainees are not entitled to a job after training is   completed; and   • Employers and trainees understand that   trainee is not paid.       4. How does the FLSA affect ""workfare"" arrangements that require   welfare recipients to participate in work activities as a condition for   receiving cash assistance from the state?      Welfare recipients in ""workfare"" arrangements, which require recipients   to work in return for their welfare benefits, must be compensated at the   minimum wage if they are classified as ""employees"" under the FLSA's broad   definition.       Where the state is the employer of a workfare participant who is   an employee for FLSA purposes, the state may consider all or a portion of cash   assistance as wages for meeting the minimum wage so long as the payment is   clearly identified and treated as wages, the payment is understood by all   parties to be wages, and all applicable FLSA record keeping criteria are met.   Where a private company or local government agency is the employer of the   workfare participant, the state welfare agency may use the recipient's welfare   benefits to subsidize or reimburse that employer for some or all of the wages   due.       5. Could states that operated Community Work Experience Programs   (CWEP) for welfare recipients under the predecessor JOBS program continue to   operate such programs in the same manner under the new welfare law?           The ability of states to operate programs like CWEP will depend on the   details of their particular programs. The old welfare law specifically stated   that a CWEP participant was not entitled to a salary or any other work or   training expense provided under any other law. Under CWEP, the welfare grant   divided by the hours worked was required to meet or exceed the minimum wage.   The new welfare law eliminated CWEP and the entire JOBS program. As a result,   welfare recipients must be compensated at the minimum wage if they are   classified as ""employees"" under the FLSA's broad definition. However, if   welfare recipients are participating in activities where they are not   ""employees"" under the FLSA definition, they will not have to be compensated at   the minimum wage. Thus, while states may be able to continue programs similar   to those that existed under CWEP, they may need to modify the programs to   reflect changes in the law.      6. May food stamps be counted towards meeting minimum wage   requirements?       Under two programs created by the Food Stamp law, food stamp benefits   (coupons or their cash value) may contribute towards meeting minimum wage   requirements for TANF recipients in work activities.       Under the Food Stamp work supplementation program ,    employers may receive the value of the food stamp allotment as a wage subsidy   for new employees hired as part of the work supplementation program. As with   other wage subsidy programs, the value of the Food Stamp benefit is converted   to a cash wage subsidy paid by the employer as a wage and is counted towards   the minimum wage. This program is restricted to recipients of TANF or other   public assistance and contains specific worker protections and non-displacement   provisions.      The Food Stamp law specifically permits states to establish Workfare   programs (to be approved by the U.S. Department of Agriculture) under which   certain welfare recipients are required to perform work in return for   compensation in the form of food stamps. In other words, participants may be   required to ""work off"" the value of their food stamps. The state or other   employers participating in the workfare program may then credit the value of   the food stamps towards its minimum wage obligations. The number of hours that   a food stamp recipient may be required to work is determined by dividing the   value of the food stamp allotment by the state or federal minimum wage   (whichever is higher), up to a maximum of 30 hours per week       Participation in Food Stamp Workfare programs may be counted towards   TANF participation requirements, so that a participant who is employed by the   state may receive food stamps as compensation for certain hours and receive   welfare benefits as compensation for other hours of employment. In all cases,   total compensation must equal or exceed the minimum wage for each hour worked.   Additional guidance on the use of food stamps towards the minimum wage will be   provided by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Stamp Program Office.        7. Aside from food stamps, may noncash benefits provided by the   state, such as child care services or transportation, be credited toward   meeting FLSA minimum wage requirements?         Only under limited circumstances. Such benefits may be credited   as wages only when the state is the employer and  all  of the following   criteria are met:            Acceptance of noncash benefits must be voluntary;          Noncash benefits must be customarily furnished by the employer     to its  employees, or by other employers to employees in similar     occupations; and        Noncash benefits must be primarily for the benefit and     convenience of the employee.            Because these criteria are quite strict, it is likely that these   benefits will not count as wages in most circumstances.        Credit may not be taken for pensions, health insurance (including   Medicaid), or other benefit payments otherwise excluded under the FLSA.          Occupational Safety and Health Act      8. How does the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) apply   to welfare recipients participating in work activities under the new welfare   law?       The new welfare law does not exempt employers from meeting OSH Act   requirements. Therefore, OSH Act coverage applies to welfare recipients in the   same way that it applies to all other workers. However, because the OSHA does   not have direct jurisdiction over public sector employees in many states, the   question of who is the responsible ""employer"" is an important one. This is   particularly true in cases where work activities are administered as part of a   public-private partnership. In these situations, OSHA will determine whether   the employee is in the public or private sector on a case-by-case basis.   Generally, case law under OSHA tends to place compliance responsibility on the   party most directly controlling the physical conditions at a worksite.       9. Does that mean that welfare recipients in work activities   deemed to be public employees are exempt from health and safety regulations?            It depends on the state. OSHA does not have direct jurisdiction over   public sector employees in many states. Yet, in the 23 states and two   territories where there are OSHA-approved state plans, the states are required   to extend health and safety coverage to employees of state and local   governments. To the extent participants in these states and territories are   employees of public agencies, they would be protected by the applicable health   and safety standards. In the other states and territories, there would be no   OSHA coverage of participants who are public sector employees.      Unemployment Insurance      10. Are welfare recipients participating in work activities   covered by the Unemployment Insurance (UI) System ?      Generally, unemployment insurance laws apply to welfare recipients in   work activities in the same way that they apply to all other workers.   Unemployment insurance coverage extends only to workers who are considered   ""employees,"" according to definitions provided by state UI laws. Consequently,   if welfare recipients are in work activities where they would be classified as   employees, they will be covered by the UI system.       There are some exceptions. While federal law requires states to extend   UI coverage to services performed for state governments and non-profit   employers, services performed as part of publicly funded ""work-relief""   employment or ""work training"" programs may be excluded by states and, in fact,   are excluded by all states except Hawaii. Under the new welfare law, a number   of community service-related activities could fall within the ""work-relief""   exception to UI coverage.       An Unemployment Insurance Program Letter (UIPL 30-96) issued in August   1996 clarified the criteria applicable to the ""work-relief"" and ""work training""   exceptions. In order to fall within the exception, activities must primarily   benefit community and participant needs (versus normal economic considerations)   and services must not otherwise normally be provided by other employees. If   such activities do not fall within the exception, participants providing   services for these entities would likely be covered by the UI program.      11. What about welfare recipients who are working for private   sector employers? Will they be covered by the UI program?      The ""work relief"" and ""work training"" exceptions for UI do not apply to   the private sector. For private employers the question of UI coverage will   hinge on whether a participant is deemed an ""employee."" The tests for making   these determinations are made by the states and are generally similar to the   common law test which is based on ""the right to direct and control work   activities.""       Anti-Discrimination Laws      12. Would federal anti-discrimination laws apply to welfare   recipients who participate in work activities under the new welfare   law?      Yes. Anti-discrimination issues could arise -- primarily under titles VI   and VII of the Civil Rights Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, section   504 of the Rehabilitation Act, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, and   the Equal Pay Act. Furthermore, if participants work for employers who are also   federal contractors, discrimination complaints could be filed under Executive   Order 11246, Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, or the Vietnam Era   Readjustment Assistance Act. As with the other laws discussed above, these laws   would apply to welfare recipients as they apply to other workers. Additional   guidance on these laws, many of which are not within the jurisdiction of the   Department of Labor, will be forthcoming.      Tax Treatment of TANF Benefits      13. Does the Notice issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)   on December 17, 1999 (Notice 99-3) addressing the federal income and employment   tax consequences of TANF payments made to welfare recipients engaged in TANF   work activities mean that such individuals are not employees under the   workplace laws?       No. The IRS Notice addresses the conditions under which TANF payments   received by individuals engaged in TANF work activities are not income, earned   income, or wages for federal income and employment tax purposes. (See IRS   Notice 99-3).      As the Notice expressly recognizes, the tax treatment of TANF payments   received does not determine whether a welfare recipient engaged in a work   activity (including work experience and community service) under TANF is an   employee for purposes of the FLSA or the other workplace laws. Rather, the tax   determination was based upon considerations unique to federal tax liability.   Indeed, the Notice specifically assumes for purposes of its analysis that the   recipients of TANF are common law employees.      The Notice also recognizes that TANF payments may have two purposes: to   promote the general welfare and to serve as compensation for services. Thus,   the notice is consistent with the Department's view that TANF participants   engaging in most TANF work activities, including work experience and community   service, are likely to be employees under the workplace laws.      The courts have recognized that the FLSA has a broader definition of   employment than exists under the traditional common law. In order to determine   whether someone is an employee under the FLSA, it is important to consider all   of the circumstances relating to the economic realities of the workplace   relationship. The common law test of employment status, which is the test of   coverage utilized by most of the other laws the Department administers,   similarly requires an assessment of all aspects of the worker's relationship to   the potential employer, with no one factor being determinative. Whether or not   the payments received by a worker are subject to income and employment taxes   has no bearing on the economic realities of the relationship test under the   FLSA and little bearing on the common law analysis.          1.   This guide refers only to state governments,   although it is possible that county or local government entities will be   responsible for implementing state and tribal welfare programs. Information in   the guide concerning the role of a state agency in implementing the welfare   program, paying out the benefits, and, where relevant, employing welfare   recipients, would apply to a county or local government agency, where that   agency, not the state, implements welfare, pays out the benefits and employs   welfare recipients.       2.   Indian Tribes may choose to run their own Tribal   TANF programs separate from the state. While these programs must incorporate   time limits and work requirements, participation rates are determined on a   case-by-case basis according to economic need.       3.   The FLSA establishes federal minimum wage,   overtime pay (for hours worked over 40 in a workweek), child labor, and   recordkeeping requirements for covered employees. The law affects full-time and   part-time workers in the private sector and in federal, state and local   governments. For the FLSA to apply, there must be an employment relationship   between an employer and an employee. To ""employ"" under the FLSA means to   ""suffer or permit to work."" This is a broader definition of employment than   exists under the traditional common law. To determine if there is an employment   relationship for purposes of the FLSA, one must consider all the circumstances,   including the economic realities of the workplace relationship.                 This guide is for general information and is not to be   considered in the same light as statements of position contained in   Interpretive Bulletins published in the Federal Register and the Code of   Federal Regulations, or in official opinion letters of the Department of Labor.           USDA Guidance      The Department of Labor has concluded that the Fair Labor Standards Act   (FLSA) applies to participants in the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families   (TANF) program in the same way as it applies to other workers. This means that   in many cases participants will have to be paid the minimum wage.      In calculating the minimum wage, States can combine food stamp benefits   and TANF grants. This can be done in either workfare or a wage supplementation   program. Under a wage supplementation program, the value of benefits are cashed   out and provided to an employer who in turn pays the money to participants as a   wage.      Furthermore, for those TANF households normally exempt from food stamp   workfare because they include parents or caretakers of a dependent child under   6 years old (between 1 and 6 in some States), States may use the Simplified   Food Stamp Program to ensure that food stamps count toward the minimum wage.   The simplified program was designed to be the vehicle for creating conformity   between TANF and the Food Stamp Program States can include parents or other   caretakers of a dependent child under the age of six food stamp workfare simply   by adopting TANF rules relating to workfare exemptions. Simplified programs   must be cost neutral. Because removing the workfare exemption for parents or   caretakers of dependent children will not increase program costs, we will   provide expedited approval to such requests.      To make this change, States need only send a letter to the Food and   Consumer Service (FCS) indicating their wish to avail themselves of the   simplified program. A cost neutralizer analysis is not required.      For additional information on the Simplified Food Stamp Program, States   should contact FCS at (703) 305-2519. FCS' mailing address is Food and Consumer   Service - Food Stamp Program, 3101 Park Center Drive, Alexandria, VA 22302.        How  Workplace Laws Apply to   Welfare Recipients        If you have questions concerning the application of   workplace laws to the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, please   direct inquiries to the U.S. Department of Labor or other designated contact   for your appropriate region - [ Northeast ], [  Southeast ],   [ Midwest ], [ Southwest ],   [ West ], [ California,   Hawaii, & Pacific Territories ], [ Occupational   Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) ],[  Unemployment Insurance (UI) ], or[    Non-discrimination Laws ].                 1.

The FLSA establishes federal minimum wage,   overtime pay (for hours worked over 40 in a workweek), child labor, and   recordkeeping requirements. The law affects full-time and part-time workers in   the private sector and in federal, state and local government. For the FLSA to   apply, there must be an employment relationship between an employer and an   employee. To ""employ"" under the FLSA means to ""suffer or permit to work."" This   is a broader definition of employment than exists under the traditional common   law. To determine if there is an employment relationship for purposes of the   FLSA, one must consider all the circumstances, including the economic realities   of the workplace relationship.

ACTION: Interim final rule; request for comments.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  SUMMARY: The Employment and Training Administration hereby issues an  Interim Final Rule implementing the  Welfare -to-Work (WtW) grant  provisions of Title IV, Part A of the Social Security Act as amended by  the recent enactment of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. The Interim  Final Rule provides an administrative framework for the WtW program  which is being coordinated with the closely-related Temporary  Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program administered by the  Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). While the use of WtW  funds should occur within the larger framework of the TANF program in  each State, these funds have a purpose that is distinct from that of  the TANF program. The purpose of WtW is to provide transitional  assistance which moves hard-to-employ  welfare  recipients living in high  poverty areas into unsubsidized employment and economic self- sufficiency.  DATES: Effective Dates: This Interim Final Rule shall become effective  on November 18, 1997. However, affected parties do not have to comply  with the information collection requirements in Sec. 645.240 (reporting  requirements for WtW programs) until DOL publishes in the Federal  Register the control numbers assigned by the Office of Management and  Budget (OMB). Publication of the control numbers notifies the public  that OMB has approved this information collection requirement under the  Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995.     Comment Period: Comments must be submitted by January 20, 1998. The  Department will not consider comments received after this date.  Comments that are less than 10 pages in length may be transmitted via  facsimile at (202) 219-0376, provided that submission of written text  follows.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  Paperwork Reduction Act      Pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, information  collection requirements which would be imposed as a result of the  Interim Rule are being submitted separately to the Office of Management  and Budget.  I. Background      On August 22, 1996, President Clinton signed the Personal  Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA), a  comprehensive  welfare  reform bill, under which the TANF program was  established to supersede the Aid to Families with Dependent Children  (AFDC)  welfare  program, the Job Opportunities and Basic Skills (JOBS)  Training program and the Emergency Assistance (EA) Program. The TANF  program at section 401(a) of the Social Security Act (Act) established  the following objectives:        Provide assistance to needy families so that children may  be cared for in their own homes or in the homes of relatives;       End the dependence of needy parents on government benefits  by promoting job preparation, work, and marriage;      Prevent and reduce the incidence of out-of-wedlock  pregnancies and establish annual numerical goals for preventing and  reducing the incidence of these pregnancies; and       Encourage the formation and maintenance of two-parent  families.      The TANF provisions substantially changed the nation's  welfare   system from one in which cash assistance was provided on an entitlement  basis to a system in which the primary focus is on moving  welfare   recipients to work and promoting family responsibility, accountability  and self-sufficiency. In general, adult  welfare  recipients are expected  to become self-sufficient within a 60-month period of time. In support  of this ``work-first'' objective, the TANF provisions established an  overall work participation rate for all households and a work  participation rate for two-parent families that must be met by each  State starting in fiscal year (FY) 97 and in each fiscal year  thereafter through FY 2002. States that do not meet the TANF- established work participation rates face significant financial  penalties.     The reference to ``work-first'' refers to the TANF concept that the  primary focus is on placing individuals in employment activities.  Nevertheless, the work-first approach also recognizes that individuals  may be provided, as appropriate, education and skills training related  to the job, as well as other services to ensure lasting employment and  the achievement of self-sufficiency. Since the enactment of PRWORA, the  Administration and Congress have been concerned that those  welfare   recipients who have the least skills, education, employment experience  and who live within high poverty areas may need additional assistance  to obtain lasting jobs and become self-sufficient.     On August 5, 1997, the President signed the Balanced Budget Act of  1997. This legislation amended certain TANF provisions of the Social  Security Act and authorized the Secretary of Labor to provide WtW  grants to States and local communities for transitional employment  assistance to move the hard-to-employ TANF  welfare  recipients into  unsubsidized jobs and economic self-sufficiency. Approximately 75  percent of the funds in each fiscal year will be distributed as formula  grants to the States, with 85 percent to be passed through to local  service delivery areas (SDAs) (generally, one or more units of local  government with a population of 200,000 or more) in the States to be  administered by the  [[Page 61589]]  Private Industry Council (PIC) for the SDA, or an alternate  administering entity approved by the Secretary of Labor according to  the statutory requirements. The funds distributed through the WtW grant  program will assist States and PICs to meet their  welfare  reform  objectives by providing additional resources targeted to hard-to-employ   welfare  recipients residing in high poverty areas within the State.     WtW activities should be coordinated with those undertaken through  TANF, as hard-to-employ  welfare  recipients constitute a significant  portion of the TANF eligible population. Therefore, the ability of  State/County TANF agencies, the PICs under the Job Training Partnership  Act (JTPA), local governments and a variety of other entities (e.g.,  One-Stop systems, private sector employers, labor organizations,  business and trade associations, education agencies, housing agencies,  community development corporations, transportation agencies, community- based and faith-based organizations, disability community  organizations, community action agencies, and colleges and universities  which provide some of the assistance needed by the targeted population)  to implement WtW programs that move these individuals into employment  and self-sufficiency will be a major factor in the success of the  national initiative to reform the  welfare  system.     The Interim Final Rule provides a framework for the administration  of WtW programs, in coordination with the closely-related TANF program.  The Employment and Training Administration (ETA) has coordinated its  WtW regulatory efforts with the rulemaking being initiated by the  Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) for the TANF program.  The Interim Final Rule supplements TANF's emphasis on moving  welfare   recipients into work, and on improving program evaluation and  performance.     Section 403(a)(5)(A)(ii)(I) of the Act indicates that the States'  WtW formula plans are an ``addendum'' to the State TANF plans. In  keeping with the Congressional intent to allow States maximum  flexibility in implementing TANF requirements, the WtW regulations  provide States and local governments with broad discretion to design  and implement WtW programs that meet the needs of the hard-to-employ  population in the individual States. This approach is consistent with  PRWORA's statutory intent to provide States with maximum discretion.  The PRWORA Conference Report, H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 725 104th Cong. 2nd  Sess. (1996), states that the legislation establishes ``broad cash   welfare  and child care block grants providing maximum flexibility so  that States can reform  welfare  in ways that are appropriate for them,  and can move families into jobs.''     The WtW statute contains several provisions designed to encourage  creative and effective use of grant funds. In particular, section  403(a)(5)(B) provides that approximately 25 percent of WtW funds shall  be distributed through a competitive grant process which are designed,  in part, to expand the base of knowledge about programs to successfully  move hard-to-employ recipients to unsubsidized employment and self- sufficiency. In addition, section 403(a)(5)(E) sets aside $100 million  as a successful performance bonus, to be distributed in FY 2000 among  States who most effectively place hard-to-employ individuals in lasting  employment at increased earnings.     The format, as well as the substance, of the Interim Final Rule  reflects the Administration's commitment to regulatory reform. The  current Federal Register Document Drafting Handbook encourages Federal  agencies to produce regulations that are reader-friendly. The  Department has made every effort to make these regulations clear and  easy to understand, as well as to anticipate issues that may arise and  to provide appropriate direction. To this end, the Part 645 regulatory  text is presented in a ``question and answer'' format.     Section 403(a)(5)(C)(viii) of the Act requires the Secretary of  Labor to prescribe regulations implementing the WtW program within 90  days of enactment, after consultation with the Secretaries of DHHS and  Housing and Urban Development (HUD). Pursuant to Secretary of Labor's  Order No. 4-75, the Assistant Secretary for Employment and Training has  been delegated the responsibility to carry out WtW policies, programs,  and activities for the Secretary of Labor.     Given the short time frame imposed on the Department, the  Employment and Training Administration (ETA) has moved quickly to  initiate coordination with the other Federal agencies that have related  concerns. In particular, the Department established a Federal Policy  Committee composed of officials from the Departments of HHS, HUD,  Transportation and Labor. The Policy Committee reviewed and provided  policy recommendations to the Department on issues that arose during  the development of the Interim Final Rule.     In addition, ETA requested and received input from a broad range of  interested parties regarding guidance to be provided by the Agency on  how to comply with a number of WtW statutory provisions, e.g.,  allowable matching funds, expenditure time limits, reallocation policy,  Governors' authority to select the State administrative agency,  conditions under which the Governor may select an alternate  administrative agency (other than the Private Industry Council) at the  local level, eligible grant applicants for competitive WtW grants,  allowable activities, post-employment and job retention services, job  creation through public or private sector employment wage subsidies,  community services and work experience programs, limits on  administration costs, and performance standards and bonuses.     The Agency has determined that this Interim Final Rule, as  promulgated, complies with the WtW statutory mandate and will provide  effective direction for the implementation of WtW programs. ETA will  review all comments received in response to the Interim Final Rule, as  well as program experience, in considering what further action is  necessary and promulgating a Final Rule.  II. Summary and Explanation      This section describes and explains the individual provisions of  the Interim Final Rule. The explanatory text, in general, adheres  closely to the corresponding WtW statutory language. The supporting  rationale is provided for those instances where the rule provides  direction not prescribed by the WtW statute.     ETA has set regulations only where they are necessary to clarify or  to explain how the Agency intends to interpret the WtW statute.  Consistent with the Act, the Interim Final Rule provides the States and  local governments with the primary responsibility to initiate and  develop program implementation procedures and policy guidance regarding  WtW administration. For example, while 20 CFR 645.230 indicates that  the OMB Circular A-102 ``Common Rule'' requirements apply to WtW  programs, the Department has not defined what constitutes WtW  ``allowable activities'' which are used under section 403(a)(5)(C) of  the Act.     Pursuant to Section 411(a)(1) of the Social Security Act, DHHS has  the responsibility to issue WtW participant and program data reporting  requirements, after consultation with other appropriate parties.  Accordingly, this Interim Final Rule does not address such reporting  requirements in detail. Consistent with the purpose of WtW, which is to  move  welfare  recipients into  [[Page 61590]]  unsubsidized employment and economic self-sufficiency, the statute  anticipates reporting on these measures: placements in unsubsidized  employment; placements in unsubsidized employment that last at least  six months; placements in the private and public sectors; earnings of  individuals who obtain employment; and average expenditures per  placement.  Subpart A--Scope and Purpose  What Does This Part Cover? (Sec. 645.100)     This section of the Interim Final Rule indicates that Part 645  provides regulatory provisions applicable to WtW formula grant funds  that are to be used to carry out State-level programs and programs  conducted by the PICs at the Service Delivery Area (SDA) level. This  part of the regulations also provides general guidance on WtW  competitive grants, but it should be clear the Department intends to  publish specific Solicitations for Grant Applications (SGAs) in the  future. The SGAs to be published will be disseminated widely and will  contain specific information about purpose, application requirements,  funding amounts, and submission instructions for competitive grant  awards. What Are the Purposes of the  Welfare -to-Work Program? (Sec. 645.110)     This section of the Interim Final Rule describes what the  Department believes to be the statutory objective of the WtW program,  which complements the overall objectives of the TANF program. For  example, the WtW statutory provisions indicate that the ultimate  objective to be achieved through the various allowable activities is to  ``* * * move individuals into and keep individuals in lasting  unsubsidized employment * * *''. In this regard, the WtW program  complements the TANF objective to ``* * * end the dependence of needy  parents by promoting job preparation, work * * *''. The WtW Program  focuses on assistance on hard-to-employ  welfare  recipients living in  high poverty areas.     Although the section requires only that WtW grant funds be  coordinated with the State TANF expenditures, the Department also  intends that WtW grant funds be coordinated with available resources  from the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA), the Employment Service,  the Child Care and Development Block Grant, One-Stop systems, private  sector employers, labor organizations, business and trade associations,  vocational rehabilitation and other education agencies, housing  agencies, community development corporations, transportation agencies,  community-based and faith-based organizations, disability community  organizations, community action agencies, and colleges and universities  and other sources that provide assistance to the WtW targeted  individuals. What Definitions Apply to This Part? (Sec. 645.120)     This section of the Interim Final Rule includes a limited number of  definitions of terms, acronyms and phrases important to the  implementation of the WtW programs. This section is not intended to be  an all-inclusive listing of definitions provided within the WtW  legislation and WtW regulations.     This section includes definitions for the terms ``adult'',  ``minor'', and ``TANF MOE'' found in the TANF statute. The Department  also relied on the definitions provided in the JTPA regulations at 20  CFR Part 626 for the terms ``PIC'' and ``SDA.'' The definition for  ``Chief Elected Official'' comes from Section 103(c) of the Job  Training Partnership Act, as amended.     States and PICs (and alternate agencies) should keep in mind that  additional definitions applicable to the WtW program, but not listed in  this section for the sake of brevity, can be found in the definitions  section(s) of the pertinent OMB Circulars on Uniform Administrative  Requirements and the OMB Cost Principles Circulars. For example, 29 CFR  97.3 contains definitions for terms and acronyms relating to  administration of the WtW programs operated by State, local and Indian  tribal organizations, unless otherwise specified. Similarly, 29 CFR  Part 95 contains other administrative definitions relating to non- profit organizations.  Subpart B--General Program and Administrative Requirements  What Does This Part Cover? (Sec. 645.200)     This subpart provides general program and administrative  requirements for WtW formula grant funds, including Governors' funds  for long-term recipients of assistance, and for competitive grant  funding.     Of the total amount of WtW funds available for allotment (after  reserving an amount for Indian tribes, evaluation, and performance  bonuses), 75 percent is allotted to the States on a formula basis.  Generally, the States are required to distribute at least 85 percent of  this amount, pursuant to a statutory formula, to service delivery  areas. The Governor of a State may reserve up to 15 percent of the  State's allotment for projects to help long-term recipients of  assistance. The roughly 25 percent of the funds that is not allotted to  the States by formula is available for the Secretary to award through a  competitive grant process. The regulations which appear in this subpart  apply to these funds. What Is Meant by the Terms ``Entity'' and ``Project'' in the Statutory  Phrase ``An Entity that Operates a Project'' With  Welfare -to-Work  Funds? (Sec. 645.210)     This section defines the terms ``entity'' and ``project'' in the  phrase ``an entity that operates a project'' with WtW funds, as used in  section 403(a)(5)(C)(ii) of the Act.     For WtW substate formula funds, ``entity'' means the PIC (or the  alternate agency designated by the Governor and approved by the  Secretary) which administers the WtW formula funds in a service  delivery area(s). This entity is referred to in Secs. 645.211 through  645.225 as the ``operating entity''. The term ``entity'' does not refer  to subrecipients, contractors, vendors, or other parties to which the  PIC or alternate agency may choose to distribute WtW formula funds to  provide specific services. The term ``project'' means all activities,  administrative and programmatic, supported by the total amount of the  WtW formula funds allotted to an entity as described above. Therefore,  the requirement relating to the expenditure of 70 percent WtW funds on  hard-to-employ individuals, as described in Sec. 645.211, applies to  all of the funds allotted to the PIC/alternate administering agency.  The entity need not impose these expenditure requirements on each  individual subrecipient, contractor, vendor or other party to whom it  may choose to distribute WtW funds. However, the entity must ensure  that, in the aggregate, it complies with the 70 percent expenditure  requirement.     For Governors' funds for long-term recipients of assistance,  ``entity'' means the agency, group, or organization to which the  Governor has distributed such funds, as described in Sec. 645.410 (b)  and (c). This entity is referred to in Secs. 645.211 through 645.225 as  the ``operating entity''. The term ``project'' means all activities,  administrative and programmatic, supported by the total amount of any  one award of Governor's funds made to an entity as described above.  Therefore, should the entity receive more than one award from the  Governor, the 70 percent expenditure requirement, as described in  Sec. 645.211, applies individually to each award. The entity need not  impose the expenditure requirement on each individual  [[Page 61591]]  subrecipient, contractor, vendor or other party to whom it may choose  to distribute WtW funds. However, the entity must ensure that in the  aggregate it complies with the 70 percent expenditure requirement.     For competitive WtW grants, ``entity'' means an eligible applicant,  as described in Sec. 645.500, which is awarded a competitive WtW grant  by the Secretary. This entity is referred to in Secs. 645.211 through  645.225 as the ``operating entity''. The term ``entity'' does not refer  to subrecipients, contractors, vendors, or other parties to which the  competitive grant recipient may choose to distribute WtW funds. The  term ``project'' means all activities, administrative and programmatic,  supported by the total amount of any one competitive grant award.  Therefore, should the same entity receive more than one competitive  grant, the 70 percent expenditure requirement, as described in  Sec. 645.211, applies individually to each competitive grant. The  entity need not impose the expenditure requirements on each individual  subrecipient, contractor, vendor or other party to whom it may choose  to distribute WtW funds. However, the entity must ensure that in the  aggregate it complies with the 70 percent expenditure requirement. How Must  Welfare -to-Work Funds Be Spent by the Operating Entity?  (Sec. 645.211)     This section restates the statutory provisions, at section  403(a)(5)(C)(ii) and (iii) of the Act, which require that an operating  entity, as described in Sec. 645.210 of this part, expend not less than  70 percent of the WtW funds allotted or awarded to it for the benefit  of hard-to-employ individuals, as described in Sec. 645.212, and which  provide that up to 30 percent of the funds may be spent to assist  individuals with characteristics associated with long-term  welfare   dependence, as described in Sec. 645.213. If less than 30 percent of  the funds are spent to assist individuals with long-term  welfare   dependence characteristics, as described in Sec. 645.213, the remaining  funds shall be spent to benefit hard-to-employ individuals, as  described in Sec. 645.212. This requirement applies to all WtW funds,  i.e., to substate formula funds, Governors' funds for long-term  recipients of assistance, and competitive funds. It should be noted  that the requirement does not apply to the proportion of WtW  participants served; rather, as noted above, it applies to the  percentage of WtW funds expended on the participants in each category  of eligibility. Who May be Served as a Hard-to-Employ Individual Under the 70 Percent  Provision? (Sec. 645.212)     The WtW legislation targets those  welfare  recipients who will have  the most difficulty transitioning into employment. Specifically, the  Act, at sections 403(a)(5)(C)(ii) and (iv), establishes three different  categories of individuals who may be served under the 70 percent  provision. An individual is eligible if (s)he meets the criteria of any  one of the following three eligibility categories. (1) To be eligible  under the first category, individuals: (a) must be recipients of TANF  assistance; and (b) must have two of the three specified barriers to  employment; and (c) must be long-term recipients of TANF assistance or  will become ineligible for TANF assistance within twelve months. (2) To  be eligible under the second category, an individual must be a  noncustodial parent of a minor whose custodial parent meets the three  criteria of the first eligibility category. (3) To be eligible under  the third category, an individual must have the specified barriers to  employment and no longer be receiving TANF assistance because (s)he has  reached either the Federal five-year lifetime limit on receipt of  assistance, or a State-imposed lifetime limit. The regulations  paraphrase the statutory language.     Eligibility: Category One. To be eligible to be served under  category one of the 70 percent provision, an individual must meet each  of the following three eligibility criteria:     Criterion a: Recipients of TANF Assistance. The individual must be  a current recipient of TANF assistance. The Act, at section  403(a)(5)(C)(ii), uses the term ``recipients of assistance under the  program funded under this part.'' In order to facilitate coordination  at the local level, the Department has consulted with DHHS regarding  interpretations for ``the program funded under this part'' and  ``assistance''. Provisions in the statute which use the term ``the  program funded under this part'' refer to the State's program of family  assistance that is operated in accordance with the TANF statute,  regardless of its funding source. Thus, any individual receiving TANF  assistance under the State TANF program (whether funded with State or  Federal funds) is deemed to meet this criterion of eligibility under  the 70 percent provision.     ``Assistance'' means every form of support provided to families  under TANF (including child care, work subsidies, and allowances to  meet living expenses), except: (a) services that have no direct  monetary value to an individual family and that do not involve implicit  or explicit income support, such as counseling, case management, peer  support, and employment services that do not involve subsidies or other  forms of income support; and (b) one-time, short-term assistance (i.e.,  assistance which is paid no more than once in any 12 month period, is  paid within a 30 day period, and covers needs that do not extend beyond  a 90-day period, such as automobile repair to obtain employment and  avoid  welfare  receipt, and appliance repair to maintain living  arrangements). The Secretary notes that she may issue further rules to  conform this provision to similar provisions in forthcoming final  regulations governing the TANF program.     Criterion b: Barriers to Employment. The Act, at section  403(a)(5)(C)(ii)(I), states that as the second criterion of eligibility  under category one of the 70 percent provision, an individual must face  at least two of the three following barriers to employment: (1) the  individual has not completed secondary school or obtained a certificate  of general equivalency, and has low skills in reading or mathematics;  (2) the individual requires substance abuse treatment for employment;  or (3) the individual has a poor work history.     We are defining the phrase ``has low skills in reading or  mathematics'', which is used in the first barrier in criterion b, to  mean having reading or mathematics skills at or below grade level 8.9.  This definition is consistent with the definition which is used in the  Job Training Partnership (JTPA) program. We are also defining the  phrase ``has a poor work history'' to mean having worked no more than  three consecutive months in the last 12 calendar months. In this way  individuals who have taken the initiative to try employment but have  not been successful for more than a brief period of time, are eligible  for assistance. These definitions reinforce the intent of the WtW  legislation to focus assistance on hard-to-employ individuals. However,  we provide PICs flexibility for each of these definitions for up to 10  percent of participants to recognize individual circumstances,  specialized needs, including individuals with disabilities, and local  labor market conditions.     TANF agencies are required to perform an initial assessment of the  skills, prior work experience and employability of each TANF recipient  who is at least 18 years old, or who has not completed high school (or  equivalent) and is not attending  [[Page 61592]]  secondary school. It is likely that this assessment may identify the  above-noted barriers, and we do not want to require further assessment  for the purposes of establishing eligibility where it is not needed.  Additionally, in relation to the criterion ``requires substance abuse  treatment for employment,'' we note that DHHS is suggesting that the  optional individual responsibility plan which the TANF agency develops  based on the initial assessment may require the individual to undergo  appropriate substance abuse treatment. We do not want to impose an  additional Federal definition which would cause a local WtW program  operator to ``second-guess'' this determination.     Criterion c: Long-Term/Duration-Impacted TANF Recipients. The third  eligibility criterion under category one of the 70 percent provision  requires that individuals be long-term recipients of TANF assistance or  will become ineligible for TANF assistance within 12 months. The  regulations paraphrase the statutory requirements, at section  403(a)(5)(C)(ii)(II), which states that an individual: (1) must have  received assistance under a State TANF program, and/or its predecessor  program, for at least 30 months, whether consecutive or not; or (2)  will become ineligible for assistance within 12 months due to Federal  or State-imposed durational time limits on receipt of TANF assistance.  This includes individuals who have been exempted from the durational  limits due to hardship pursuant to section 408(a)(7)(C) of the Act, but  would have faced termination within 12 months without the exemption.     Eligibility: Category Two: Noncustodial Parents. The regulations  paraphrase the statutory requirement at section 403(a)(5)(C)(ii). A  noncustodial parent of a minor child whose custodial parent meets the  eligibility criteria of category one, as specified in Sec. 645.212(a)  of this part, is eligible under the 70 percent provision. In order to  facilitate coordination at the local level, we are not defining the  term ``noncustodial'' any further. We are allowing States to develop  and employ their own definition of the term, which we understand States  generally use to mean a parent who is absent from the child's  household. Under TANF, States can extend employment services to  noncustodial parents by including them in their definition of  ``eligible family''. In these cases, the States are already using their  own non-Federal definition of ``noncustodial.'' Further, States are  required by statute to report to DHHS on the number of noncustodial  parents participating in work activities. We do not want to impose a  definition which would be at odds with those already existing in the  States. If a State does not have a definition for ``noncustodial''  parent for TANF purposes, it should develop one in order to serve  noncustodial parents in WtW projects.     Eligibility: Category Three: Exceeding Durational Time Limits. The  regulations interpret the statutory provision at section  403(a)(5)(C)(iv) to apply to individuals who have reached State-imposed  time limits on receipt of TANF assistance in addition to individuals  who have reached the five-year Federal limit on receipt of Federal  assistance. This interpretation is consistent with the purpose of the  WtW funds to assist those who have the most difficulty making the  transition from  welfare  to work. Therefore, an individual who has  barriers to employment, as specified in Sec. 645.212(a)(2) of this  part, and who would otherwise be eligible to receive TANF assistance  but is no longer receiving TANF assistance because (s)he has reached  either the Federal five-year lifetime limit on receipt of assistance,  or a State-imposed lifetime limit, is eligible. Who May be Served as an Individual With Long-Term  Welfare  Dependence  Characteristics Under the 30 Percent Provision? (Sec. 645.213)     The Act, at sections 403 (a)(5)(C)(iii) and (iv), establishes three  different categories of individuals who may be served as individuals  with characteristics associated with long-term  welfare  dependence under  the 30 percent provision. An individual is eligible if (s)he meets any  one of the following three eligibility categories: (1) To be eligible  under the first category, individuals must be recipients of TANF  assistance and have characteristics associated with, or predictive of,  long-term  welfare  dependence. (2) To be eligible under the second  category, an individual must be a noncustodial parent of a minor whose  custodial parent is receiving TANF assistance, and the noncustodial  parent must have characteristics associated with, or predictive of,  long-term  welfare  dependence. (3) To be eligible under the third  category, an individual must have characteristics associated with, or  predictive of, long-term  welfare  dependence, be otherwise eligible to  receive TANF assistance, but no longer be receiving TANF assistance  because (s)he has reached either the Federal five-year lifetime limit  on receipt of assistance, or a State-imposed lifetime limit.     Eligibility: Category One. To be eligible under category one of the  30 percent provision, an individual must meet both of the following  criteria:     Criterion a: Recipients of TANF Assistance. The individual must be  a current recipient of TANF assistance. The Act states, at section 403  (a)(5)(C)(iii)(I), that individuals with long-term  welfare  dependence  characteristics under the 30 percent provision must be ``recipients of  assistance under the program funded under this part''. The regulations  paraphrase the statutory requirement. In order to facilitate  coordination at the local level, the Department has consulted with DHHS  regarding interpretations for ``the program funded under this part''  and ``assistance''. For a fuller discussion of this approach, refer to  the discussion regarding recipients of TANF assistance in the preamble  for Sec. 645.212.     Criterion b: Characteristics Associated With Long-Term  Welfare   Dependence. The Act states, at section 403 (a)(5)(C)(iii)(I), that an  individual must have characteristics associated with long-term  welfare   dependence, such as having dropped out of school, teenage pregnancy, or  having a poor work history. We are interpreting ``associated with'' to  include characteristics ``predictive of'' long-term  welfare  dependence.  In order to facilitate coordination at the local level, we will not  further define the characteristics associated with long-term  welfare   dependence. It is likely that the TANF assessment may identify the  above-noted characteristics, and we do not want to require further  assessment for the purposes of establishing eligibility where it is not  needed. Moreover, the regulations interpret the statutory phrase ``such  as'' to mean that, in addition to the characteristics listed in the  statute, States and PICs may designate other characteristics associated  with, or predictive of, long-term  welfare  dependence, including having  a disability. In order to provide the State and local areas with  flexibility to design the WtW program to support the goals and  objectives of their overall program of assistance for  welfare   recipients, we are not imposing any further restrictions in this area.  Starting with the FY99 State WtW formula plans, States will be asked to  include examples of characteristics which the State and PICs consider  to be predictive of long-term  welfare  dependency.     Eligibility: Category Two: Noncustodial Parents. The Act states, at  section 403(a)(5)(C)(iii)(II), that noncustodial parents of minors who  have the characteristics associated with,  [[Page 61593]]  or predictive of, long-term  welfare  dependence, as described under  category one, are eligible to participate under the 30 percent  provision if the custodial parent is receiving TANF assistance. In  order to facilitate coordination at the local level, we are not  defining the term ``noncustodial'' any further. For a fuller discussion  of this approach, refer to the discussion regarding noncustodial  parents in the preamble for Sec. 645.212.     Eligibility: Category Three: Exceeding Durational Time Limits. The  regulations interpret the statutory provision at section  403(a)(5)(C)(iv) to apply to individuals who have reached State-imposed  time limits on receipt of TANF assistance in addition to individuals  who have reached the five-year Federal limit on receipt of Federal  assistance. This interpretation is consistent with the purpose of the  WtW funds to assist those who have the most difficulty making the  transition from  welfare  to work. Therefore, an individual who has  characteristics associated with, or predictive of, long-term  welfare   dependence, as specified in Sec. 645.213(a)(2) of this part, and who  would otherwise be eligible to receive TANF assistance but is no longer  receiving TANF assistance because (s)he has reached either the Federal  five-year lifetime limit on receipt of assistance, or a State-imposed  lifetime limit, is eligible to participate under the 30 percent  provision. How Will  Welfare -to-Work Participant Eligibility be Determined?  (Sec. 645.214)     The regulations state that the operating entity is accountable for  ensuring that WtW funds are spent on individuals who are eligible for  WtW projects. The regulations acknowledge, however, that the operating  entity may not be in the best position to determine all aspects of WtW  eligibility, particularly those associated with receipt of TANF  assistance. Therefore, the regulations require that the operating  entity ensure that there are mechanisms in place to establish WtW  eligibility based on the criteria in Secs. 645.212 and 645.213. We urge  that the mechanisms for determining WtW eligibility address how the PIC  or other WtW operating entity and the TANF agency will work together to  facilitate the exchange of eligibility information. The actual scope of  the mechanisms, operating procedures, and roles and responsibilities of  the cooperating parties are best left to local determination given the  myriad of circumstances that exist in local areas.     Since receipt of TANF assistance will be the single most critical  WtW eligibility criterion in the majority of cases, it is critical that  the TANF agency be the source of information about whether an  individual is receiving TANF assistance, the length of such receipt,  and applicable time limits on such receipt. At a minimum, therefore,  for TANF recipients, WtW eligibility determination mechanisms must  include arrangements with the TANF agency to ensure that such a  determination is based on information, current at the time of the WtW  eligibility determination, for the factors specified in  Sec. 645.214(b)(1) of this part.     In establishing WtW eligibility for the criteria of barriers to  employment, pursuant to Sec. 645.212(a)(2), and characteristics  associated with long term- welfare  dependency, pursuant to  Sec. 645.213(a)(2) of this part, the regulations seek to minimize  duplication of effort and encourage coordination of TANF and WtW  resources. Specifically, the regulations state that for TANF  recipients, the operating entity may base a determination of WtW  eligibility for these factors on information that was collected up to  six months prior to the WtW eligibility determination, by or through  the operating entity for JTPA or for other purposes, or by the TANF  agency for the TANF assessment or individual responsibility plan (IRP).  This mechanism provides an efficient method to minimize duplication of  effort and utilize existing, reliable information while ensuring that a  WtW eligibility determination will not be made on the basis of outdated  information. This six-month window is intended to provide flexibility  to the operating entity to customize its mechanisms for determining WtW  eligibility to address the unique circumstances of its local area. In  some cases, the operating entity may determine that a shorter time  period is preferable. In others, the operating entity may determine  that for some characteristics, such as the possession of a high school  diploma, the individual's status immediately prior to determination of  eligibility should be used in the determination. We recognize that the  information previously collected by the operating entity or in the TANF  assessment and IRP: (1) may be sufficiently comprehensive to allow for  making the WtW eligibility determination; or (2) may not necessarily  provide sufficient information to determine WtW eligibility in all  categories. In either case, we urge close coordination between the TANF  agency and the operating entity to develop a coordinated mechanism for  eligibility determination.     The operating entity must also have mechanisms in place to  determine WtW eligibility for individuals who are not receiving TANF  assistance (i.e., noncustodial parents and individuals who have reached  the time limit on receipt of TANF). Mechanisms may include approaches  such as: (1) using staff from the operating entity to determine WtW  eligibility (utilizing information from TANF and other appropriate  agencies); (2) entering into agreements with local agencies, such as  the TANF agency, and other appropriate entities, such as One-Stop  systems and substance abuse treatment providers, which foster  coordination and facilitate the exchange of eligibility information  among parties at the local level; and/or (3) performing joint WtW  eligibility determination with other appropriate agencies, including  the TANF agency. The TANF agency should be able to provide information  about assistance received by the custodial parent of minors or by  exhaustees to permit the PIC to determine whether an individual  qualifies as a noncustodial parent or about individuals who are no  longer receiving TANF assistance.     In determining whether someone requires substance abuse treatment  for employment, the operating entity can benefit from coordinating with  the local recipients of funds from the Substance Abuse Prevention and  Treatment (SAPT) Block Grant. In some States, SAPT funds substance  abuse awareness and identification programs for TANF case workers. In  others, substance abuse counselors supported by SAPT funds are co- located in TANF offices. We urge close coordination by the operating  entity with efforts of SAPT and other agencies to identify and address  substance abuse among the TANF population.     The regulations also state that once an individual begins to  receive WtW services, the operating entity is not required to  redetermine WtW eligibility. For instance, if someone ceases to receive  TANF assistance due to increased earnings, that individual may continue  to participate in appropriate WtW services (such as occupational  training offered as a post-employment service or job retention  services, if such services are not otherwise available). What Activities Are Allowable Under This Part? (Sec. 645.220)     The ultimate objective for each  welfare  recipient is placement into  an unsubsidized job which provides the potential for achieving economic  self-sufficiency. Activities conducted with  [[Page 61594]]  WtW grant funds must be grounded in the ``work first'' philosophy which  is a fundamental tenet of the Act. Although a variety of activities are  authorized under WtW, these activities should be viewed as employment- based developmental steps for helping individuals secure and retain  unsubsidized employment.     Section 403(a)(5)(C)(i) specifies the allowable activities which  can be funded under WtW grants. The statute prescribes the following as  allowable activities: job readiness, placement, and post-employment  services financed through job vouchers or through contracts with public  or private providers; community service or work experience programs;  job creation through public or private sector employment wage  subsidies; on-the-job training; and job retention or support services  if such services are not otherwise available. Congress did not define  these activities further. Some activities have commonly understood  meanings from their use over time or from operational definitions  adopted by other employment and training programs, but others may not.     We consulted with a variety of groups to determine what others  thought about how these activities should be defined. A major theme  they expressed is the need for maximum State and local flexibility to  design programs to successfully move the hardest to employ  welfare   recipients into unsubsidized employment leading to economic self- sufficiency.     Another major theme expressed by those with whom we consulted is  the need for flexibility to provide to the WtW eligible population,  training in basic educational and occupational skills, English as a  second language training, and referral to vocational rehabilitation  services. Indeed, one of the eligibility factors is the lack of a high  school or secondary school diploma or a certificate of general  equivalency, coupled with low skills in math or reading. In order to  make it possible for these educationally disadvantaged individuals to  begin to achieve economic self-sufficiency, they need access to tools  for developing the skills necessary for achieving their employment  goal.     The regulations address these concerns. They provide maximum  flexibility to provide transitional assistance which moves  welfare   recipients into unsubsidized employment providing good career potential  for achieving economic self-sufficiency. They also encourage effective  linkages of  welfare  agencies, other agencies serving people with  disabilities, adult education, and the workforce development system at  the State and local operational levels to maximize the use of all  available resources and to focus resources on direct assistance to  recipients. Additionally, they encourage the use of training  interventions only after an individual begins to work to help  participants retain their jobs and move toward economic self- sufficiency.     Specifically, in order to facilitate coordination between WtW and  TANF activities at the State and local level, the regulations do not  define or describe the activities which are common to both WtW  allowable activities and TANF work activities. That is, the regulations  provide no definitions or description for community service, work  experience, job creation through public or private sector employment  wage subsidies, on-the-job training, or job readiness activities. Job  readiness may, however, include training for WtW participants starting  their own businesses. It is expected that operating definitions for  these activities will be arrived at through partnership between the  State and local administering agencies, taking into consideration  applicable statutory and regulatory provisions.     The regulations do provide examples of post-employment services.  Whether an individual is working in a subsidized or unsubsidized job,  including self-employment or participation in a registered  apprenticeship program, that individual may be allowed to receive post- employment services, which may include basic education, English as a  second language, occupational skills training, and mentoring. While the  legislation does not permit stand-alone training activities independent  of a job, allowing them as post-employment activities only while the  participant is working in a subsidized or unsubsidized job reflects the  basic ``work first'' thrust of the legislation, while recognizing the  critical importance of continuous skills acquisition and lifelong  learning to economic self-sufficiency. These examples of post- employment services are not intended to imply that only educational,  training, or mentoring services are allowable as post-employment  services.     The regulations incorporate the statutory requirement that job  readiness, placement, and post-employment services be provided through  job vouchers or contracts with public or private providers.  Additionally, the requirement, at Sec. 645.230(a)(3), that contracts or  vouchers for job placement must include a provision to require that at  least one-half of the payment occur after an eligible individual has  been placed into the workforce for six months, is referenced.     Given the needs of the target group for this assistance, the  provision of adequate job retention and support services will be  critical. Each participant engaged in a job readiness activity, an  employment activity, or in any other subsidized or unsubsidized job,  including participation in a registered apprenticeship program, will  also be allowed to receive appropriate job retention and support  services, if such services are not otherwise available. These could  include transportation assistance, substance abuse treatment, child  care, emergency or short-term housing assistance, disability-related  services, or other supportive services. However, these services can be  provided with WtW funds only where they are not otherwise available to  the participant. For instance, in the area of child care, the operating  entity should ensure that WtW funds are not substituted for child care  services available from the Child Care and Development Block Grant,  TANF funds, and other State and local funds.     The availability of transportation services, to get  welfare   recipients to work, training, and child care, is a significant factor  in obtaining and retaining employment. Historically, DHHS and DOL  programs have defined transportation in terms of the individual client,  and allowed reimbursement for services used rather than for service  availability. However, client reimbursement will not work where  services do not exist. WtW funds may be used for both purposes. For  instance, WtW funds may be used to reimburse individual participants  for transportation costs, to enable an administering agency to purchase  additional needed services from transportation providers, or  alternatively to support, in combination with other funding sources,  the development of new transportation services that may be needed in  order to connect individuals to jobs. Such services could include: late  night and other off peak hour services, shuttle service, guaranteed  ride home, van pooling and ridesharing, and specialized transportation  services provided by non-profit agencies. WtW funds cannot be  substituted for services available or already provided through other  sources. However, this is not meant to preclude funding of an  individual's access to existing sources. For example, although a  transit service may exist, an individual may need financial assistance  to afford such transportation.  [[Page 61595]]      Substance abuse treatment is specifically provided as an example of  a job retention service because one of the eligibility factors under  the hard-to-employ criteria is the need for substance abuse treatment  for employment. In arranging for substance abuse treatment, States and  localities should coordinate with the Single State Authority (SSA) (and  its subcontractors) designated by the Governor to receive and  administer the Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment (SAPT) Block  Grant administered by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services  Administration, DHHS. This grant, totaling $1.23 billion in FY 1998,  accounts for approximately 40 percent of all substance abuse treatment  provided through State agencies. The SSA and its county or regional  subcontractors also coordinate with, or actually provide, substance  abuse treatment funded through other sources. It is imperative that use  of WtW funds for substance abuse treatment be coordinated with other  funding sources to provide only services not otherwise available. It is  equally important that the expertise of SAPT block grant recipients be  utilized in developing a strategy to provide WtW participants with  substance abuse treatment services.     Regarding substance abuse treatment, States and localities need to  be aware that section 408(a)(6) of the Act, which bars the use of  Federal TANF funds for medical services, also applies to WtW funds. In  many, but not all, instances the treatment of alcohol and drug abuse  involves not just ``medical services,'' but other kinds of social and  support services as well. Allowing States to use Federal WtW funds for  substance abuse treatment is programmatically sound since it addresses  the need of a particular target group and may help clients make  successful transitions to work. Therefore, WtW funds can be used for  drug and alcohol abuse treatment services to the extent that such  services are not medical and not otherwise available to the  participant. States and localities will have to look at the range of  services offered and differentiate between those that are medical and  those that are not. For instance, an evaluation of a substance abuser,  to determine the appropriate level of care, performed by a member of  the medical profession is considered a medical service, as is a  medically supervised detoxification program. However, services  performed by those not in the medical profession, such as counselors,  technicians, social workers, and psychologists, and services not  provided in a hospital or clinic, including 24 hour care programs, may  be considered non-medical. In short, as in TANF, States and localities  cannot use Federal WtW funds for services that the State identifies as  medical; they may only use Federal WtW funds for services that are non- medical. States may, however, use their own funds or other funds to  provide these services as long as they do not commingle State and  Federal funds. Medicare and Medicaid funds may provide another source  of funding for medical substance abuse treatment.     Individual development accounts (IDAs) are authorized by section  403(a)(5)(C)(v)(I) of the Act. They are described in detail at section  404(h) of the Act, which gives States the option to fund IDAs with  TANF, and by extension, WtW funds, for WtW participants. An IDA is an  account established by or for an individual to allow the individual to  accumulate funds for specific purposes enumerated in the Act, i.e.,  postsecondary educational expenses, first home purchase, and business  capitalization. The Secretary of DHHS is authorized to establish  regulations regarding IDAs. Therefore, we are not regulating or  providing further guidance in this area. An entity that funds IDAs with  WtW grant funds must comply with Section 404(h) of the Act and the  applicable DHHS regulations.     Lastly, the regulations state that intake, assessment, eligibility  determination, the development of an individualized service strategy,  and case management are allowable and may be incorporated in the  program design of any of the allowable activities. How Do  Welfare -to-Work Activities Relate to Activities Provided Under  TANF and Other Related Programs? (Sec. 645.225)     The regulations require that activities provided through WtW be  coordinated effectively with activities being provided through the TANF  grant and other related programs. The WtW grants provide a critical  tool to help States and local governments achieve their own  welfare   reform goals and to meet their responsibilities under the Act to reduce   welfare  caseloads and move  welfare  recipients into permanent employment  and off  welfare . WtW must be an integral part of the States' and local  governments' overall program of assistance to move  welfare  recipients  into unsubsidized employment. WtW formula grants are intended to work  through the operating entity to supplement and enhance their overall  capacity for assisting  welfare  recipients find work and progress toward  self-sufficiency.     Coordination of resources should include not only those available  through WtW and TANF grant funds, and the Child Care and Development  Block Grant, but also those available through other related activities  and programs, such as the JTPA programs, the State employment service,  One-Stop systems, private sector employers, labor organizations,  business and trade associations, education agencies, housing agencies,  community development corporations, transportation agencies, community- based and faith-based organizations, disability community  organizations, community action agencies, and colleges and universities  which provide some of the assistance needed by the targeted population.     The regulations require that an assessment of skills, prior work  experience, employability, and other relevant information be in place  for each WtW participant. This is consistent with the TANF requirement,  at section 408(b)(1) of the Act, that an assessment be developed for  each recipient of TANF assistance who has attained 18 years of age or  has not completed high school or obtained a certificate of high school  equivalency, and is not attending secondary school. In order to  maximize coordination and minimize duplication of effort, we urge the  use of the TANF assessment to meet this requirement where feasible in  order to avoid duplicative assessments and unnecessary use of WtW  resources.     The regulations require that an individualized strategy for  transition to unsubsidized employment should be in place for each  participant. This requirement is similar to the TANF provision, at  section 408(b)(2) of the Act, regarding an individual responsibility  plan (IRP). This strategy should take into account the individual's  circumstances reflected in the TANF assessment, JTPA individual service  strategy or any participant assessment which may have been performed by  the operating entity or its agent. The individualized strategy should  also include information regarding disabilities since the  characteristics associated with long-term  welfare  dependence can be  caused, or contributed to, by a physical, emotional or cognitive  disability. The strategy should assure that activities funded through  WtW are effectively coordinated with similar activities (e.g.,  assessment, case management, supportive services, work activities)  being funded through TANF and other related programs to address the  [[Page 61596]]  individual's needs so that (s)he can obtain and retain unsubsidized  employment. In order to maximize coordination and minimize duplication  of effort, the regulations also state that, where appropriate, the TANF  IRP may be used for this purpose. It is our understanding that most, if  not all, States have exercised their option under TANF of implementing  an IRP requirement. The statutory guidelines for the content of an IRP,  at section 408(b)(2) of the Act, include an employment goal for the  individual and a plan for moving the individual into unsubsidized  employment as quickly as possible, and for increasing the  responsibility and amount of work the individual is to handle over  time. The statutory guidelines also include a description of the  obligations of the individual and the services to be provided so that  the individual will be able obtain and retain employment. In order to  avoid duplicative strategies and unnecessary use of staff resources, we  urge the use of the TANF IRP as the WtW individualized service strategy  where feasible. What General Fiscal and Administrative Rules Apply to the Use of  Federal Funds? (Sec. 645.230)     This regulation identifies the appropriate DOL regulations which  specify the rules applicable to WtW grants in the areas of fiscal and  administrative requirements, audit requirements, allowable cost/cost  principles, debarment and suspension, drug-free workplace, restrictions  on lobbying, and nondiscrimination. In addition, paragraph (a)(3) of  this section specifically indicates that the provision at section  403(a)(5)(C)(i) of the Act is a requirement that is imposed in addition  to the procurement provisions applicable to an entity awarding a  contract or voucher for job placement services. That provision requires  that contracts or vouchers for job placement services must include a  provision to require that at least one-half of the payment occur after  an eligible individual placed into the workforce has been in the  workforce for at least 6 months. Consistent with the purpose of the  Act, we have interpreted this provision to apply to placement in  unsubsidized jobs. We have done this to avoid the unintended  consequence of having all subsidized employment last a minimum of six  months.     Paragraph (a)(4) of this section adds a provision to address PIC  conflict of interest which is not addressed by the uniform  requirements. Paragraph (a)(5) of this section specifies the  requirement that the addition method will be required for the use of  program income and that the cost of generating any program income may  be deducted in determining the amount of program income earned. In  paragraph (c) of this section, the authority to grant or deny prior  approval for those selected items of cost which require such approval  has been delegated to the Governor. Paragraph (g) of this section sets  forth restrictions on nepotism related to individuals being hired into  WtW subsidized employment, work experience, on-the-job training  positions and the like. What Are the Time Limitations on the Expenditure of  Welfare -to-Work  Grant Funds? (Sec. 645.233)     The regulation specifies the time limitation rules for expenditure  of the two types of Federal WtW grant funds:     (a) Formula funds--The general rule is that these funds will be  available for expenditure for a ``maximum'' period of three years which  commences with the effective date of the grant to a State. The grant  period will be specified in the Department's formula grant document for  each fiscal year of funds provided to the State.     (b) Competitive funds--The general rule is that these funds have  the potential for being granted for the ``maximum'' three-year period  from the effective date of the grant award but are subject to the terms  and conditions of the specific grant.     For both types of grant funds, any remaining funds unexpended at  the end of the approved grant period must be returned to the Department  in accordance with the applicable closeout rules and procedures. For  purposes of determining the time limitations for expenditure of  ``performance bonus'' grants, the provisions applicable to formula  funds (excluding match) will apply. What Types of Activities Are Subject to the Administrative Cost Limit  on  Welfare -to-Work Grants? (Sec. 645.235)     Paragraph (a) of the regulation restates the fact that the statute  imposes a 15 percent limitation on administrative costs for formula  grants to States. For competitive grants, the regulation permits a  different limitation, up to a maximum of 15 percent, to be specified in  the grant agreement. If no limitation is specified, then the 15 percent  limitation on administrative costs will also apply to competitive  grants.     Paragraphs (b) & (c) spell out the definition of administrative  costs for these WtW grants and provide some additional cost  classification guidance. Because the local JTPA system is the presumed  delivery system for these grants, the regulation uses the JTPA  definition of ``administrative costs'' except that paragraph (c)(3) of  the regulation incorporates an exception specified at Section 404(b)(2)  of the Act. The exception specifically excludes from the administrative  cost category the costs of computer hardware and software that is used  for tracking and monitoring under a WtW grant. It is only the cost of  the assets, however, and not the salaries or wages of staff who use the  computers, that is excluded. The regulation also requires that all  information technology purchased for WtW grants must be ``year 2000  compliant.'' To meet this requirement, information technology must be  able to accurately process date/time data (including, but not limited  to, calculating, comparing and sequencing) from, into, and between the  twentieth and twenty-first centuries, and the years 1999 and 2000. The  information technology must also be able to make leap year  calculations.     These Interim Final WtW regulations adopt the JTPA definition of  the term ``Administrative Costs'' to minimize the burden on PICs. The  Secretary notes that she may issue further rules to conform this  provision to similar provisions in forthcoming final regulations  governing the TANF program. Comments on this subject are invited and  would be helpful in assessing the advantages and disadvantages of such  a change. What Are the Reporting Requirements for  Welfare -to-Work Grants?  (Sec. 645.240)     This regulation indicates that DOL will issue instructions and  formats for financial reporting, that DHHS will issue the instructions  for participant reporting, and that DOL will issue supplemental  participant reporting requirements for competitive grants.     With respect to participant reporting, DOL will, as an interim  measure, revise the Standard Program Information Report (SPIR) to  incorporate identification of WtW enrollees and WtW activity categories  to facilitate the use of a SPIR-based management information system by  PICs who choose to use it to manage their WtW funded activities.  However, DOL will not require the use or submission of SPIR for WtW. Who is Responsible for Oversight and Monitoring of  Welfare -to-Work  Grants? (Sec. 645.245)     The Secretary of Labor is authorized to provide WtW grants to  States and local entities through formula allocations and a competitive  process,  [[Page 61597]]  respectively. To ensure that Federal funds are accounted for and used  in a permissible manner, the Secretary is responsible for oversight of  grant activities and expenditure of grant funds, and may monitor any  WtW grant recipient or subrecipient. The regulations provide for  Federal and State oversight responsibilities.     For formula grants, the Department's monitoring of the States will  include a sample of subrecipients. States funded under this program  shall develop a statewide monitoring plan and shall make the monitoring  plan available for Federal review. In the event that the Secretary  determines that a State grant recipient is not in compliance with  Federal statutory or regulatory requirements, the Department may  provide technical assistance as part of the corrective action process.     The Governor is responsible for oversight of formula grants at the  substate level. The State monitoring plan shall provide for adequate  oversight and should include State policies and procedures for the  implementation, operation and management of the program, as well as  State monitoring of reporting requirements for WtW substate grants. The  State shall ensure compliance with statutory and regulatory  requirements of WtW at the substate level. The State monitoring plan  should include an annual monitoring schedule and should describe its  process for providing technical assistance to substate grantees that  are not in compliance with State or Federal requirements. What Procedures Apply to the Resolution of Findings Arising From  Audits, Investigations, Monitoring and Oversight Reviews?  (Sec. 645.250)     The regulation assigns to the Governor the responsibility to  resolve subrecipient findings that arise from audits, investigations,  monitoring reviews, and the like. If the States have procedures in  place that are used for audit resolution, debt collection and appeal  for other grant programs, then the existing processes may be used.  Otherwise the State must develop and implement such procedures.     The regulation reserves to the Secretary the authority for  resolution of findings that arise from Federal audits, investigations,  incident reports, and monitoring reviews, as well as recipient level  OMB Circular A-133 audits. The process that will be used is the grant  officer initial and final determination process used for other grant  programs which is codified at 29 CFR 96.503. Appeals of grant officer  final determinations are to be made to the Department's Office of  Administrative Law Judges in accordance with the procedures found at 29  CFR 96.603(b).     So as to avoid confusion about which procedures apply to  nondiscrimination findings, paragraph (c) specifies that findings  arising from investigations or reviews conducted under  nondiscrimination laws are to be resolved in accordance with those  nondiscrimination laws and the applicable implementing regulations. What Nondiscrimination Protections Apply to Participants in  Welfare -to- Work Programs? (Sec. 645.255)     Section 645.255 of the regulations provides that participants in  WtW programs have such rights as are available under any applicable  Federal, State or local law prohibiting discrimination, including, but  not limited to: the Age Discrimination Act of 1975 (42 U.S.C. 6101 et  seq.); Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1975 (Section 504)(29  U.S.C. 794); the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) (42  U.S.C. 12101 et seq.) and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964  (Title VI)(42 U.S.C. 2000d et seq.). ETA is not responsible for  administering any civil rights laws. Rather, it is the Civil Rights  Center (CRC), formerly the Directorate of Civil Rights, within the  Office of the Assistant Secretary for Administration and Management,  that has the responsibility to enforce such laws as the Age  Discrimination Act of 1975, Section 504 and Title VI, with respect to  recipients of federal financial assistance from the Department.  Additionally, the CRC is responsible for processing complaints alleging  violations of the ADA by all State and local government programs,  services, and regulatory activities relating to labor and the  workforce.     Section 645.255 of the regulations further provides that complaints  alleging discrimination, except for those alleging gender  discrimination in violation of Sec. 645.255(d), shall be processed in  accordance with applicable regulations. For example, WtW recipients who  are not also JTPA grant recipients should process complaints that  allege discrimination based on race, color or national origin in  violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 in accordance  with the Department's Title VI regulation at 29 CFR part 31 by  forwarding all such complaints to the CRC (Address at the end of this  paragraph.). Similarly, WtW recipients who are not also JTPA grant  recipients should process complaints that allege discrimination based  upon disability in violation of Section 504 in accordance with 29 CFR  32.45(b), i.e., using the complaint procedures established pursuant to  that section. WtW recipients who are also JTPA grant recipients should  process complaints of discrimination under procedures established  pursuant to 29 CFR 34.42.     29 CFR 34.42 establishes the procedures under which JTPA grant  recipients shall process complaints involving violations of the JTPA  nondiscrimination and equal opportunity provisions. Since many WtW  grant recipients will be PICs and other entities with experience  operating programs under JTPA, the Department has determined that, in  order to avoid administrative burdens, such entities shall process WtW  discrimination complaints under these procedures rather than require  that they comply with two different sets of procedures. (Recipients of  financial assistance from the Department should be aware that the DOL  regulations, at 29 CFR Parts 31, 32, and 34, also require that programs  and activities meet certain administrative obligations. Among those is  the responsibility to notify participants of their rights under  nondiscrimination laws (e.g., Title VI, Section 504 and the Age  Discrimination Act), including the right to file a complaint with the  CRC. Individuals with questions about the requirements of these  nondiscrimination laws, or concerns about compliance by individual WtW  programs with these laws, should address their comments or concerns to  the Director, Civil Rights Center, U.S. Department of Labor, 200  Constitution Avenue, NW, Room N4123, Washington, D.C. 20210.)     Both Section 408(d) of the PRWORA and its legislative history, as  reflected in H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 725, 104 Cong., 2nd Sess. 293 (1996),  clarify that recipients are subject to Federal enforcement mechanisms.  The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 amended the PRWORA. It provides for,  among other things, a new civil rights protection against gender  discrimination. This provision ensures that participants who may not be  covered under either Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 or Title  IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, are protected against gender  discrimination. The PRWORA, as amended, requires States to have  grievance procedures to process complaints alleging gender  discrimination. The legislative history makes clear that gender-based  discrimination is the only civil rights matter that the legislation  required to be resolved through a State grievance procedure. See H.R.  Conf. Rep. No. 217, 105th Cong., 1st Sess. 935-937 (1997). Other civil  rights matters are to be resolved in accordance with the  [[Page 61598]]  applicable statutes and regulations listed in the preceding paragraph. What Health and Safety Provisions Apply to Participants in  Welfare -to- Work Programs? (Sec. 645.260)     The regulation restates the health and safety provisions which are  found in section 403(a)(5)(J)(ii) of the Act and specifies that  participants alleging a violation of these standards may file a  complaint using the State's legislatively mandated grievance system.  The Department interprets the statutory phrase ``work activity'' to  refer to the allowable employment activities provided for at  Sec. 645.220(b) of this part. What Safeguards Are There to Ensure That Participants in  Welfare -to- Work Employment Activities do not Displace Other Employees?  (Sec. 645.265)     Section 403(a)(5)(J) of the Act provides protections to ensure that  employees are not displaced by WtW participants engaged in a work  activity. The Department interprets the phrase ``work activity'' to  refer to the allowable employment activities provided for at  Sec. 645.220(b) of this part.     The regulation incorporates the statutory prohibition, in section  403(a)(5)(J)(i) of the Act, against allowing WtW participants to be  enrolled in employment activities which violate existing contracts for  services or collective bargaining agreements. Where an employment  activity would violate a collective bargaining agreement, the  regulations provide that the appropriate affected labor organization  and employer must provide written concurrence before the employment  activity can be undertaken.     The regulations also incorporate the statutory prohibition against  allowing an individual participating in employment activities under the  WtW program from displacing another employee. Employment activities  shall not result in the employment or assignment of a WtW participant  or the filling of a position when any other person is on layoff from  the same or substantially equivalent job within the same organizational  unit. The use of the phrase ``within the same organizational unit''  further clarifies the parameters for the concept of ``a substantially  equivalent job''. The employment or assignment of a WtW participant or  the filling of a position is prohibited when an employer has terminated  any regular, unsubsidized employee or otherwise reduced its workforce  with the intent of filling the vacancy with a WtW program participant.  In addition, a WtW participant may not be employed or assigned to a  position where the employer has caused an involuntary reduction to less  than full time in hours of an employee in the same or substantially  equivalent job.     Consistent with the goal of this program, which is to place  participants in employment which will eventually lead to their economic  self-sufficiency, we encourage the States to safeguard the current  workforce, while aggressively promoting the creation of employment  opportunities for  welfare  recipients. The State's goal should be the  expansion of its workforce through the creation of additional new jobs.     The regulations also specify that grievances regarding displacement  may be filed using the State's legislatively mandated grievance system. What Procedures Are There To Ensure That Currently Employed Workers May  File Grievances Regarding Displacement and That  Welfare -to-Work  Participants in Employment Activities May File Grievances Regarding  Displacement, Health and Safety Standards and Gender Discrimination?  (Sec. 645.270)     The regulations reflect the statutory language concerning the  requirement that a State must establish a grievance system for regular,  unsubsidized employees regarding displacement and for participants in  the WtW program regarding displacement, health and safety standards and  gender discrimination.     The statute requires that the grievance system must provide an  opportunity for a hearing, an appeal, and a final determination within  120 days of the original filing date of the complaint. The regulations  give the State the option of including in the grievance system an  opportunity for informal resolution prior to the formal hearing. The  regulations also provide that in developing its grievance system, the  State must specify the time period and format for the hearing and the  appeal portions of the procedure. The informal resolution and hearing  steps in the grievance procedure may occur at either the State or SDA  level. This section of the regulations also restates the statutory  provision concerning the designation of a State agency, independent of  the State or local agency responsible for administering or supervising  the administration of State TANF and WtW programs, to hear appeals.  Subpart C--Additional Formula Grant Administrative Requirements and  Procedures  What Constitutes an Allowable Match? (Sec. 645.300)     A State will be awarded a total of $2 in WtW formula grant funds  for each $1 in State matching expenditures up to the maximum amount  that the State is entitled to receive under the WtW allotment formula.  If the State chooses to propose a lesser amount of match than would be  required in order for it to receive the full allotment, it may do so.  In such cases, the amount of the Federal WtW grant will be reduced  accordingly.     The regulation authorizes the States to use the uniform financial  and administrative requirements, codified at 29 CFR 97.24 (the Common  Rule), regarding match allowability and documentation, except that no  more than one-half of the match may be in the form of in-kind  contributions. We will allow 50 percent of the required match to be in- kind contributions in order to encourage the participation of private  non-profit and faith-based organizations in efforts to assist  individuals transition from  welfare  to unsubsidized employment and  economic self-sufficiency. These organizations can offer significant  resources, especially in-kind services, to assist WtW program  participants.     Cash donations from non-Federal third parties that are used to pay  for allowable costs of the WtW grant program will be considered as cash  match, and not counted as in-kind contributions. Matching funds include  those State and local dollars in excess of funds spent to meet the TANF  MOE requirement when those funds are spent on WtW eligible individuals  and activities. Matching requirements may not be met by the use of  employers' share of participant wage payments, e.g., the employer's  share of OJT. The planning guidance issued for FY98 reiterated the  legislative provision requiring that the total matching funds must be  expended during the FY in which the WtW grant is awarded. A legislative  amendment eliminating this requirement and permitting the expenditure  of matching funds over the same three-year period as Federal funds is  being considered by Congress. The final rule will reflect the action  taken by the Congress with respect to this amendment. If match  expenditures do not satisfy the requirement for the full level of  Federal funds, the grant amount will be reduced by an appropriate  corresponding amount.  [[Page 61599]]      Paragraph (c)(7) of the regulation indicates that the burden-of- proof for substantiating match expenditures is to be borne by the  recipient of a WtW grant based on its own records and/or those of its  subrecipients. What Assurances Must a State Provide That It Will Make the Required  Matching Expenditures? (Sec. 645.310)     This regulation restates the planning guidance which requires a  State to provide a written estimate of planned matching expenditures in  its State plan and to describe the process by which the funds will be  tracked and reported to ensure that the State meets its projected  match. What Actions Are To Be Taken if a State Fails To Make the Required  Matching Expenditures? (Sec. 645.315)     This regulation requires the Department to implement an annual  reconciliation and grant adjustment process for WtW grants. The  reconciliation will be based on reported match expenditures made  through the end of the FY, as specified in the required report due 45  days after the end of each fiscal year. If the end-of-fiscal-year  report has not been received by December 1 of that year, then the  reconciliation will be based on the most current report received.     In addition, each FY the Department will evaluate second quarter  matching expenditures to determine the status of each State's  expenditures compared with planned match. DOL will alert and consult  with States that appear to be underexpending matching funds concerning  the possibility of reducing the grant to reallot funds if match  requirements are not met. When Will Formula funds be Reallotted and What Reallotment Procedures  Will the Secretary Use? (Sec. 645.320)     This section describes the reconciliation process that the  Department will use for determining whether or not a State has expended  the required level of matching funds and the process for reallotment of  funds that become available as a result of underexpenditure of the  required match or failure to fully obligate funds by either States or  substate entities. Funds are fully obligated by States when they are  awarded to the substate entities.  Subpart D--State Formula Grants Administration  Under What Conditions May the Governor Request an Alternate  Administering Agency at the Local Level? (Sec. 645.400)     The regulations reflect the WtW legislative intent to assign PICs,  in cooperation with Chief Elected Officials (CEOs), a presumptive role  as the administering agencies for the WtW program at the local level.  The Act also provides the Governor authority to select an alternate  administrative agency and to request from the Secretary a waiver of the  statutory provision that PICs have the sole authority to expend funds  for the program at the local level. The Governor may request such a  waiver in the State's annual plan and must provide information  indicating how the selection of the alternate agency will improve the  effectiveness or efficiency of the program in each substate area. In  presenting the rationale, pursuant to section 403(a)(5)(A)(vii)(III) of  the Act, the Governor shall provide such information as (s)he deems is  necessary to establish that the designated alternate agency would  improve the effectiveness or efficiency of the administration of the  funds in each SDA.     The Department intends for the Governors to have maximum  flexibility on what should be included in their presentation(s) of the  reason(s) for the selection of an alternate administering agency at the  local level. While no specific format is provided, it is suggested the  Governor include, as part of the rationale for the selection of an  alternate administering agency, information regarding the PIC's  performance, administrative capacity, or whether the PIC has turned  down the WtW role; and information on the alternate agency's capacity  and fiscal integrity. In addition, the Governor is to provide copies of  any comments from the CEOs regarding the Governor's selection of the  alternate agency.     In addition, the Governor must request a waiver if, during the  operation of the local WtW program, s(he) determined that the PIC, or  alternate agency, which is administering WtW has not coordinated its  expenditures with expenditure of funds provided to the State under  TANF. Whenever the Governor requests a waiver, the Governor is to  provide a copy of such request to the PIC and CEO of the affected SDA.     The Governor shall bear the burden of proving that the proposed  designated alternate agency, rather than the PIC, would improve the  effectiveness or efficiency of the administration of WtW funds in the  SDA. The Secretary shall assess the information provided by the  Governor, as well as any input from the affected CEOs, in reaching a  decision on the granting of the waiver requested. The regulations  provide the PIC and CEO 15 days in which to respond to the Governor's  waiver request and submit written comments to the Department. The  Secretary's decision on the Governor's request constitutes final agency  action and is not subject to further administrative review.     It is the Department's position, consistent with section  403(a)(5)(A)(vii)(I) of the Act, that in WtW programs the PICs have the  same policy guidance and oversight functions as the PICs have under the  JTPA. In service delivery areas where, pursuant to the PIC/CEO  agreement, the PIC is not the ``administrative entity'' or the ``grant  recipient'' (see JTPA sections 4(2) and 103(b)(1)(B)), the PICs will  exercise the authority specified in the WtW legislation. In such  situations, consistent with section 403(a)(5)(A)(vii)(I) of the Act,  the PIC can use the current JTPA administering agency or grant  recipient to disburse WtW funds and manage the program. Finally, in  situations where the alternate administering agency selected and  approved by the Secretary is neither the SDA's administrative entity  nor the SDA's grant recipient entity, the Department intends for the  alternate agency to take steps to ensure the CEO(s) continues to be  consulted on WtW service strategies and activities planned for the SDA. What Elements Will the State Use in Distributing Funds Within the  State? (Sec. 645.410)     The regulations follow closely the statutory provisions concerning  the Governor's responsibility to distribute funds to the SDAs in the  State. The Act requires the Governors to establish a formula to  distribute funds to the SDAs in the State and specifies the use of up  to three formula factors described at section 403(a)(5)(A)(vi)(I) of  the Act. The Governor's formula cannot contain any additional formula  factors.     In developing the Governor's formula, the statute requires that a  weight of no less than 50 percent be given to the following factor: the  number by which the population of the area with an income less than the  poverty line exceeds 7.5 percent of the total population of the area,  compared to all such numbers for all SDAs in the State. This means that  at least 50 percent of the funds must be distributed to SDAs based on  this factor. If the Governor  [[Page 61600]]  chooses not to use this factor in distributing the rest of the funds,  these funds may be distributed to an SDA based on one or both of the  following factors: an SDA's share of the number of adults receiving  assistance under TANF, or the predecessor program, in the SDA for at  least 30 months (whether consecutive or not), relative to the number of  such adults residing in the State; or an SDA's share of the number of  unemployed individuals residing in the SDA, relative to the number of  such individuals residing State. If the Governor chooses to use one or  both of these additional factors, s(he) may not distribute more that 50  percent of the funds on the basis of these factors. In circumstances  where the Governor's formula allocation to an SDA is less than  $100,000, those amounts are added to the funds retained at the State  level, thereby increasing the amount of funds which may be retained at  the State above the 15 percent level. However, in cases where the  distribution formula would allocate at least $100,000 to an SDA, those  amounts must be allocated to the SDA within 30 days of the date the  State receives its Federal allotment.     For guidance in determining the number of individuals with income  less than the poverty line, the regulations point the States to section  403(a)(5)(D) of the Act. This section instructs States to use the  methodology used by the Bureau of the Census to produce and publish  intercensal poverty data for States and counties. The Department is  aware that the Bureau of the Census in March of 1997 produced an  intercensal report containing State and county data estimates of the  number of individuals in poverty and poverty rates for 1993. States  should use this data, or comparable more recent data published by the  Bureau, to determine the number of individuals below the poverty line  who exceed 7.5 percent of the total population of the area. For areas  for which 1993 intercensal data is not produced and published by the  Bureau of the Census, Governors may use 1990 Census poverty data, in  conjunction with the intercensal poverty data for related  jurisdictions, where appropriate, as a basis for determining the  poverty data for those areas. The Governor is to use the most recent  year for which poverty data is available when determining the number of  individuals below the poverty line and should use data for the most  recent 12-month period when determining the number of adults receiving  assistance for at least 30 months.     This section also sets forth the statutory authority of the PICs  (or alternate administering agency) to determine, within their  respective service delivery areas, the eligible individuals and the  allowable activities upon which to expend their within-State fund  allocation. The Department expects that a PIC's targeting of eligible  individuals and the selection of service strategies will reflect the  needs of the target population and the local employment opportunities,  and are coordinated with State TANF expenditures.     Up to 15 percent of the funds allotted to the State may be retained  by the State for projects to transition long-term recipients into  unsubsidized jobs. For a full discussion of what other requirements are  applicable to funds retained by the State, please refer to the preamble  discussions of Secs. 645.210 through 645.225. The regulations clarify  that the Governor may utilize PICs, as well other entities, such as  One-Stop systems, private sector employers, labor organizations,  business and trade associations, education agencies, housing agencies,  community development corporations, transportation agencies, community- based and faith-based organizations, disability community  organizations, community action agencies, and colleges and  universities, to operate projects for long-term recipients to enter  unsubsidized jobs. The Department intends for the Governors to develop  guidelines on such matters as project application criteria, project  design criteria, project outcome goals, project placement expectations,  project duration, etc. The Department intends for the Governors to have  maximum flexibility in the management and operation of the funds  retained by the State, consistent with statutory requirements, to  enable the Governors to fund projects that support and complement the  Governors' and the PICs' strategies to transition  welfare  recipients  into unsubsidized jobs and economic self-sufficiency. What Planning Information Must a State Submit in Order to Receive a  Formula Grant? (Sec. 645.415)     The regulation follows section 403(a)(5)(ii) of the Act and  specifies that a State must provide an annual plan to the Secretary for  each fiscal year it wishes to receive funding. The format of the State  plan, as well as the date for submission, will be established by the  Secretary and provided to the States. The plan will be an addendum to  the TANF plan and will be submitted to the Secretaries of Labor and  Health and Human Services.     The Department will review the State plan and will accept it as  complete if the plan demonstrates compliance with the WtW legislation.  Once the plan is accepted, the Department will provide funding to the  State. Where a State includes in its plan a request to use an agency  other than the PIC to administer the program locally, the Secretary  will carefully assess waiver requests for each local jurisdiction and  will grant a waiver if the Secretary determines that the designated  alternate agency will more effectively or efficiently administer the  WtW grant funds for that area. The Secretary will use the information  submitted by the Governor as well as input from the affected PICs and  CEOs in the decision-making process. The Secretary's decision whether  to grant a waiver shall be considered final agency administrative  action. What Factors Will Be Used in Measuring State Performance?  (Sec. 645.420)     This regulation advises that the Secretary will develop and issue a  formula that will be used to measure State performance and to serve as  the basis for the award of performance grants in FY 2000. The formula  will be developed in consultation with DHHS, the National Governors  Association (NGA), and the American Public  Welfare  Association (APWA),  and will be published in mid-1998. As required by section 403(a)(5)(E),  the formula will be the basis used to measure the success of States in  placing individuals in private sector employment or any kind of  employment, the duration of such placements, any increase in earnings  of such individuals, and other additional factors that the Secretary of  Labor deems to be appropriate. What Are the Roles and Responsibilities of the State(s) and PIC(s)?  (Sec. 645.425)     This section of the regulations enumerates a number of State and  PIC roles and responsibilities embedded in the WtW statute. During the  consultation process conducted by the Department to gather input on WtW  policy development, there were a number of requests for the Department  to explain and clarify the State and PIC roles. The Department believes  this section of the regulation is responsive to those requests and  highlights the key responsibilities at the State and local level. It  does not attempt to create arbitrary divisions since it is our view  that coordination among State agencies and programs (e.g., TANF,  employment service, One-Stop centers), and local agencies and programs  (e.g., PICs, JTPA Title IIA) is essential to meeting the goals of the  WtW legislation and that the methods and mechanisms established to  [[Page 61601]]  combine resources and mount a coordinated effort to serve WtW  participants will necessarily vary according to State/local needs and  established relationships. In general, it is our view that, under the  Act, the State has the primary responsibility for ensuring that WtW  programs are consistent with and well coordinated with services under  TANF, and that local entities are in the best position to decide the  participants to be targeted and the service mix most appropriate for  the participants. Consistent with statutory provisions, the State may  not restrict PICs from exercising their authority to expend funds on  the statutorily eligible populations. PICs, therefore, have authority  to determine the individuals to be served in the service delivery  areas.  Subpart E-- Welfare -To-Work Competitive Grants  Who Are Eligible Applicants for Competitive Grant Funds? (Sec. 645.500)     According to the Act, in order to be eligible to apply for  competitive grant funds, an organization must be a PIC for an SDA in a  State, a political subdivision of a State (e.g., cities, counties), or  a private entity applying in conjunction with the PIC or political  subdivision. The proposal must be developed in consultation with the  Governor. The Department defines the term ``in conjunction with'' to  mean that the application submitted by a private entity must include a  signed certification by both the applicant and either the applicable  PIC or political subdivision that the relevant PIC/political  subdivision has been consulted during the development of the  application and that the activities proposed in the application are  consistent with, and will be coordinated with, the WtW efforts of the  PIC/political subdivision.     We believe that this definition of ``in conjunction with'' provides  sufficient flexibility for private nonprofit entities, such as  community development corporations, community-based and faith-based  organizations, disability community organizations, community action  agencies, and public and private colleges and universities, to apply  for funds, while ensuring that adequate coordination with the ongoing  WtW formula program occurs. Our requirement for consultation and  certification reiterates the Department's emphasis on collaboration and  integration of resources at the local level.     We are also interpreting ``private entity'' to be any qualified  organization, public or private, which is neither a PIC nor a political  subdivision of a State. The legislative intent, however, is that  competitive grants are for projects which are community based and  responsive to the circumstances in a local community. Therefore, an  application for competitive grant funds will be judged for its  connection and responsiveness to a local community.     Although the Department considers local collaboration to be  critical to the development of a WtW proposal, in some limited cases,  providing evidence of such a collaborative effort may not be possible.  In these cases, where a private entity cannot obtain certification from  the PIC/political subdivision, the applicant must certify, and provide  information indicating, that the PIC/political subdivision has been  provided a sufficient opportunity to cooperate in the development of  the application and has not acted within a reasonable period of time.  The Department believes that 30 days is a sufficient period of time in  which a private entity can expect a response from the PIC or political  subdivision.     This requirement applies to all PICs or political subdivisions  included in the area to be served by the proposed project. What Is the Required Consultation With the Governor? (Sec. 645.510)     All applicants for competitive grants, including PICs and political  subdivisions, must submit their application to the Governor or the  designated State administrative entity for the WtW program for review  and comment prior to submission of the application to the Secretary. We  have defined sufficient time for review and comment at the State level  to be at least 15 days. For applications from private entities, the 15  day comment period must be consecutive to the 30 day period for  obtaining evidence of collaboration and support from the PIC or  political subdivision. What Are the Program and Administrative Requirements That Apply to Both  the Formula Grants and Competitive Grants? (Sec. 645.515)     The regulations indicate that all of the general program and  administrative requirements that apply to the WtW formula grants also  apply to the competitive grants. Competitive grants will be subject to  additional reporting and monitoring requirements, however, which will  be tailored to the scope of work of the specific grants. What Are the Application Procedures and Timeframes for Competitive  Grant Funds? (Sec. 645.520)     The Secretary shall establish appropriate application procedures,  selection criteria and an approval process to ensure that grant awards  accomplish the statutory purposes of the competitive grant funds and  that available funds are used in an effective manner. We anticipate  that more than one application and award process will occur in each  fiscal year of the WtW program. Grant application procedures will be  published in the Federal Register for each round of competitive grants. What Special Consideration Will Be Given to Rural Areas and Cities With  Large Concentrations of Poverty? (Sec. 645.525)     Competitive grant awards will be targeted to areas of significant  need, especially rural areas and cities with large concentrations of  residents living in poverty.  Subpart F--Administrative Appeal Process  What Administrative Remedies Are Available Under This Part?  (Sec. 645.800)     The WtW statute contains provisions (e.g., those addressing the  allowable use of funds) which contemplate the exercise of discretion by  ETA. It is reasonable to anticipate that there will be instances where  parties will seek to overturn decisions made by the Agency.     This section sets the administrative procedures available where a  party seeks review of a Grant Officer determination that imposes a  sanction or corrective action, pursuant to Sec. 645.250(b) of this  part. Paragraph (a) provides that an adverse decision by a Grant  Officer may be appealed, within 21 days of the Grant Officer's final  determination, to the Department of Labor's Office of Administrative  Law Judges. The parties present their cases before an Administrative  Law Judge (ALJ) who develops the record for the proceeding, making  findings of fact and of law. Such proceedings are relatively informal,  utilizing relaxed rules of evidence. For example, a Notice of Appeal  functions simply as the invocation of a party's right to administrative  review of an Agency decision, rather than as a formal complaint.     Paragraph (b) of this section provides that the ALJ's decision  regarding a case arising under this section constitutes final agency  action for the purpose of judicial review, unless, within 20 days of  the ALJ's decision, a dissatisfied  [[Page 61602]]  party petitions the Administrative Review Board (ARB) for review.  Review by the ARB is discretionary, so paragraph (b) of this section  provides that the ALJ's decision constitutes final Agency action unless  the ARB notifies the parties, within 30 days of the filing of the  petition for review, that the case has been accepted for review.  Further, the ALJ's decision constitutes final Agency action if the ARB  has not decided the case arising under this section within 120 days of  acceptance for review.  III. Regulatory Flexibility and Executive Order      The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, as amended in 1996 (5  U.S.C. Chapter 6), requires the Federal government to anticipate and  minimize the impact of rules and paperwork requirements on small  entities. ``Small entities'' are defined as small businesses (those  with fewer than 500 employees, except where otherwise provided), small  non-profit organizations (those with fewer than 500 employees, except  where otherwise provided) and small governmental entities (those in  areas with fewer than 50,000 residents). ETA has assessed the potential  impact of the draft Interim Final Rule, consulting with a wide range of  small entities, in order to identify any areas of concern. Based on  that assessment, the Agency certifies that the Interim Final Rule, as  promulgated, will not have a significant impact on a substantial number  of small entities.     As indicated in the Background Section (Section I, above), the WtW  Interim Final Rule implements grant programs that enhance the resources  available to States and PICs or the additional WtW financial resources  targeted to hard-to-employ  welfare  recipients and which will assist in  efforts to move these individuals into lasting unsubsidized jobs.     ETA has minimized any potential burdens for grant applicants and  recipients in order to maximize the resources that will be applied to  achieve the purposes of the WtW program. The Agency has further  ameliorated any foreseeable burdens by providing (at Sec. 645.235 of  the Interim Final Rule) that a grantee can allocate up to 15 percent of  a grant award for management and administration of the grant, rather  than for the direct provision of services to participants. The Agency  has determined that the incremental costs of applying for or  administering WtW grants will be minimal, because applicants and  grantees will, in general, already be familiar with the grant process  due to involvement in existing TANF and JTPA programs. Further, ETA has  concluded that any such costs will not place small entities at a  disadvantage in relation to larger entities, with regard to obtaining  formula grants or competitive grants. Therefore, it is unnecessary to  set alternative requirements for small entities.     In addition, pursuant to the Small Business Regulatory Fairness Act  (SBREFA) (5 U.S.C. Chapter 8), the Agency has screened the Interim  Final Rule and has determined that it is not a ``major rule,'' as  defined in 5 U.S.C. 804(2).  IV. Executive Order 12866      Pursuant to Executive Order 12866, the Agency has evaluated the  Interim Final Rule and has determined its provisions are consistent  with the statement of regulatory philosophy and principles promulgated  by the Executive Order. The Department of Labor is required to  prescribe regulations for the WtW program within 90 days of the  enactment of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. Within this limited time  frame, the Department has made every reasonable effort to obtain input  in a purposeful manner from a variety of interested parties (State and  local government officials, community-based organizations, and the  general public). The WtW grant program increases the resources  available to the public and private organizations that promote long- term employment and family self-sufficiency. The Agency has determined  the Interim Final Rule will not have an adverse effect in a material  way on the nation's economy.     ETA has developed the Interim Final Rule in close consultation with  the Departments of HHS, HUD, and Transportation, and with other  responsible Federal agencies. Based on that consultation, the Agency  has determined the Interim Final Rule will not create a serious  inconsistency or otherwise interfere with any action taken or planned  by another agency.     The Agency has also assessed the impact of the WtW State match  requirement and has determined it will not materially alter the  budgetary impact of entitlements and grants. States will receive $2  dollars in WtW grant funds for each $1 in State matching expenditures  up to the State WtW fund allotment. Further, ETA has determined that up  to 50 percent of the State matching effort can be ``in kind'' (goods  and services provided in lieu of cash), allowing the States additional  flexibility in qualifying for formula funds.     Overall, as discussed above, the Department has determined that the  Interim Final Rule is not unduly burdensome and that the impacts and  consequences are non-material for States, local governmental entities  and other potentially interested parties.     The Agency finds that this Interim Final Rule raises novel policy  issues and thus constitutes a significant regulatory action which has  been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget for the purposes  of Executive Order 12866.  V. Unfunded Mandates      The Interim Final Rule has been reviewed in accordance with the  Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA) (2 U.S.C. 1501 et seq.) and  Executive Order 12875. Section 202 of UMRA requires that a covered  agency prepare a budgetary impact statement before promulgating a rule  that includes any Federal mandate that may result in the expenditure by  State, local and Tribal governments, in the aggregate, or by the  private sector, of $100 million or more in any one year.     If a covered agency must prepare a budgetary impact statement,  section 205 of UMRA further requires that it select the most cost- effective and least burdensome alternative that achieves the objectives  of the rule and is consistent with the statutory requirements. In  addition, section 203 of UMRA requires a plan for informing and  advising any small government that may be significantly or uniquely  impacted.     ETA has determined that the WtW Interim Final Rule will not  regulate the expenditure by the State, local, and Tribal governments,  in the aggregate, or by the private sector, of more than $100 million  in any one year (Tribal governments are covered by a separate Interim  Final Rule for which a separate Unfunded Mandates statement has been  prepared). Accordingly, the Agency has not prepared a budgetary impact  statement, specifically addressed the regulatory alternatives  considered, or prepared a plan for informing and advising any  significant or uniquely impacted small government.  VI. Effective Date and Absence of Notice and Comment      The Employment and Training Administration has determined, pursuant  to 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B), that the statutory mandate to promulgate  regulations within 90 days of the enactment of the statute constitutes  good cause for waiving notice and comment proceedings. In addition, the  Agency has determined, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3), that the WtW  statutory mandate provides good cause for waiving the customary  requirement to  [[Page 61603]]  delay the effective date of a final rule for 30 days following its  publication. The short statutory duration of the WtW program  underscores the importance of beginning the disbursement of WtW funds  at the earliest possible date. Accordingly, the issuance of a proposed  rule, rather than an interim final rule, (or delaying the effective  date for 30 days) would be contrary to the public interest. The Interim  Final Rule sets a comment period to elicit any concerns raised by the  Rule. ETA has limited the comment period to 60 days so that any input  is received in time for the Agency to review it in considering any  revisions to Part 645 while the WtW program is still in its early steps  of operation.

(c) An individual who has characteristics associated with, or  predictive of, long-term  welfare  dependence, as specified in paragraph  (a)(2) of this section, and who would be otherwise eligible to receive  TANF assistance but is no longer receiving TANF assistance because  (s)he has reached either the Federal five-year lifetime limit on  receipt of assistance, or a State-imposed lifetime limit, is eligible  to participate under the 30 percent provision (section 403(a)(5)(C) of  the Act).   Sec. 645.214  How will  Welfare -to-Work participant eligibility be  determined?      (a) The operating entity, as described in Secs. 645.210(a)(1),  (b)(1), and (c)(1) of this part, is accountable for ensuring that WtW  funds are spent only on individuals eligible for WtW projects.     (b) The operating entity must ensure that there are mechanisms in  place to determine WtW eligibility for individuals who are receiving  TANF assistance. These mechanisms:     (1) Must include arrangements with the TANF agency to ensure that a  WtW eligibility determination is based on information, current at the  time of the WtW eligibility determination, about whether an individual  is receiving TANF assistance, pursuant to Secs. 645.212(a)(1) and  645.213(a)(1) of this part, the length of receipt of TANF assistance,  pursuant to Sec. 645.212(a)(3)(i) of this part, and when an individual  may become ineligible for assistance pursuant to Sec. 645.212(a)(3)(ii)  of this part (section 403(a)(5)(A)(ii)(dd) of the Act).     (2) May include a determination of WtW eligibility for barriers to  employment, pursuant to Sec. 645.212(a)(2) of this part, and for  characteristics of long-term  welfare  dependence, pursuant to  Sec. 645.213(a)(2) of this part, based on information collected by the  operating entity or the TANF agency up to six months prior to the WtW  eligibility determination.     (c) The operating entity must ensure that there are mechanisms in  place to determine WtW eligibility for individuals who are not  receiving TANF assistance (i.e., noncustodial parents, pursuant to  Secs. 645.212(b) and 645.213(b) of this part, and individuals who have  reached the time limit on receipt of TANF, pursuant to Secs. 645.212(c)  and 645.213(c) of this part). Mechanisms may include, but are not  limited to:     (1) Using staff from the operating entity to determine eligibility;     (2) Entering into agreements with local agencies such as the TANF  agency and other appropriate agencies which foster coordination and  facilitate the exchange of eligibility information among parties at the  local level; and/or  [[Page 61606]]      (3) Performing joint eligibility determination with other  appropriate agencies, including the TANF agency.     (d) Eligibility for WtW need not be redetermined for an individual  after the individual begins to receive WtW services (section  403(a)(5)(C) of the Act).   Sec. 645.220  What activities are allowable under this part?

Sec. 645.225  How do  Welfare -to-Work activities relate to activities  provided through TANF and other related programs?      (a) Activities provided through WtW must be coordinated effectively  at the State and local levels with activities being provided through  TANF (section 403(a)(5)(A)(vii)(II) of the Act).     (b) The operating entity must ensure that there is an assessment of  skills, prior work experience, employability, and other relevant  information in place for each WtW participant. Where appropriate, the  assessment performed by the TANF agency or JTPA should be used for this  purpose.     (c) The operating entity must ensure that there is an  individualized strategy for transition to unsubsidized employment in  place for each participant which takes into account participant  assessments, including the TANF assessment and any JTPA assessment.  Where appropriate, the TANF individual responsibility plan (IRP) or  JTPA individual service strategy should be used for this purpose.     (d) Coordination of resources should include not only those  available through WtW and TANF grant funds, and the Child Care and  Development Block Grant, but also those available through other related  activities and programs such as the JTPA programs, the State employment  service, One-Stop systems, private sector employers, labor  organizations, business and trade associations, education agencies,  housing agencies, community development corporations, transportation  agencies, community-based and faith-based organizations, disability  community organizations, community action agencies, and colleges and  universities which provide some of the assistance needed by the  targeted population (section 402(a)(5)(A) of the Act).

(2) Institutions of higher education, hospitals, and other non- profit organizations are required to follow OMB Circular A-110 which is  codified in the DOL regulations at 29 CFR part 95.     (3) In addition to the requirements at 29 CFR 95.48 and 29 CFR  97.36(i), contracts or vouchers for job placement services supported by  funds provided for this program must include a provision to require  that at least one-half (\1/2\) of the payment occur after an eligible  individual placed into the workforce has been in the workforce for six  (6) months. This provision applies only to placement in unsubsidized  jobs (section 403(a)(5)(C)(i) of the Act).     (4) In addition to the requirements at 29 CFR 95.42 and 29 CFR  97.36(b)(3) which address codes of conduct and conflict of interest  issues related to employees, it is also required that:     (i) A PIC member shall neither cast a vote on, nor participate in,  any decision making capacity on the provision of services by such  member (or any organization which that member directly represents), nor  on any matter which would provide any direct financial benefit to that  member or a member of his immediate family.     (ii) Neither membership on the PIC nor the receipt of WtW funds to  provide training and related services shall be construed, by itself, to  violate these conflict of interest provisions.     (5) The addition method shall be required for the use of all  program income earned under WtW grants. The cost of generating program  income shall be subtracted from the amount earned to establish the  amount of program income available for use under the grants.     (b) Audit requirements. All governmental and non-profit  organizations are required to follow the audit requirements of OMB  Circular A-133.\1\ This requirement is imposed at 29 CFR 97.26 for  governmental organizations and at 29 CFR 95.26 for institutions of  higher education, hospitals, and other non-profit organizations. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \1\ OMB Circulars are available from: Executive Office of the  President Publications Service, 725 17th Street NW, Suite G-2200,  Washington, DC 20503; 202-395-7332. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      (c) Allowable costs/cost principles. The DOL regulations at 29 CFR  95.27 and 29 CFR 97.22 identify the Federal principles for determining  allowable costs which each kind of recipient and subrecipient must  follow. For those selected items of cost requiring prior approval, the  authority to grant or deny approval is delegated to the Governor.     (1) State, local, and Indian tribal government organizations must  determine allowability of costs in  [[Page 61607]]  accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular A-87, ``Cost Principles  for State and Local Governments.''     (2) Non-profit organizations must determine allowability of costs  in accordance with OMB Circular A-122, ``Cost Principles for Non-Profit  Organizations.''     (3) Institutions of higher education must determine allowability of  costs in accordance with OMB Circular A-21, ``Cost Principles for  Education Institutions.''     (4) Hospitals must determine allowability of costs in accordance  with the provisions of appendix E of 45 CFR part 74, ``Principles for  Determining Costs Applicable to Research and Development Under Grants  and Contracts with Hospitals.''     (5) Commercial organizations and those non-profit organizations  listed in Attachment C to OMB Circular A-122 must determine  allowability of costs in accordance with the provisions of the Federal  Acquisition Regulation (FAR), at 48 CFR part 31.     (d) Government-wide debarment and suspension, and government-wide  drug-free workplace requirements. All WtW grant recipients and  subrecipients are required to comply with the government-wide  requirements for debarment and suspension, and the government-wide  requirements for a drug-free workplace which are codified in the DOL  regulations at 29 CFR part 98.     (e) Restrictions on lobbying. All WtW grant recipients and  subrecipients are required to comply with the restrictions on lobbying  which are codified in the DOL regulations at 29 CFR part 93.     (f) Nondiscrimination. All WtW grant recipients and subrecipients  are required to comply with the nondiscrimination provisions which are  codified in the DOL regulations at 29 CFR parts 31 and 32. In addition,  recipients of WtW grants who are also recipients under JTPA are  required to comply with 20 CFR part 34. For purposes of this paragraph,  the term ``recipient'' has the same meaning as the term is defined in  29 CFR parts 31, 32, and 34. Participant rights related to  nondiscrimination may be found at Sec. 645.255 of this part.     (g) Nepotism. (1) No individual may be placed in a WtW employment  activity if a member of that person's immediate family is engaged in an  administrative capacity for the employing agency.     (2) To the extent that an applicable State or local legal  requirement regarding nepotism is more restrictive than this provision,  such State or local requirement shall be followed.   Sec. 645.233  What are the time limitations on the expenditure of   Welfare -to-Work grant funds?      (a) Formula grant funds. The maximum time limit for the expenditure  of a given fiscal year allotment is three years from the effective date  of the Federal grant award to the State. The maximum time limit will be  allowed and will be specified in the Department's formula grant  document for each fiscal year of funds provided to the State. Any  remaining funds that have not been expended at the end of the  expenditure period must be returned to the Department in accordance  with the applicable closeout procedures for formula grants.     (b) Competitive grant funds. The maximum time limit for the  expenditure of these funds is three years from the effective date of  award, but will, in all cases, be determined by the grant period and  the terms and conditions specified in the Federal grant award agreement  (including any applicable grant modification documents). Any remaining  funds that have not been expended at the end of the approved grant  period must be returned to the Department in accordance with the  applicable closeout procedures for competitive grants (section  503(a)(5)(C)(vii) of the Act).   Sec. 645.235  What types of activities are subject to the  administrative cost limit on  Welfare -to-Work grants?      (a) Administrative cost limitation (section 404(b)(1)). (1) Formula  grants to States. Expenditures for administrative purposes under WtW  formula grants to States are limited to fifteen percent (15%) of the  grant award.     (2) Competitive grants. The limitation on expenditures for  administrative purposes under WtW competitive grants will be specified  in the grant agreement but in no case shall the limitation be more than  fifteen percent (15%) of the grant award.     (b) The costs of administration are that allocable portion of  necessary and allowable costs associated with the overall management  and administration of the WtW program and which are not directly  related to the provision of services to participants. These costs can  be both personnel and non-personnel and both direct and indirect. Costs  of administration shall include:     (1) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, costs  of salaries, wages, and related costs of the recipient's,  subrecipient's or PIC's staff engaged in:     (i) Overall program management, program coordination, and general  administrative functions, including the salaries and related costs of  the executive director, WtW director, project director, personnel  officer, fiscal officer/bookkeeper, purchasing officer, secretary,  payroll/insurance/property clerk and other costs associated with  carrying out administrative functions;     (ii) Preparing program plans, budgets, schedules, and amendments  thereto;     (iii) Monitoring of programs, projects, subrecipients, and related  systems and processes;     (iv) Procurement activities, including the award of specific  subgrants, contracts, and purchase orders;     (v) Providing State or local officials and the general public with  information about the program (public relations);     (vi) Developing systems and procedures, including management  information systems (except as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this  section), for assuring compliance with program requirements;     (vii) Preparing reports and other documents related to the program  requirements;     (viii) Coordinating the resolution of audit findings;     (ix) Evaluating program results against stated objectives; and     (x) Performing administrative services, including such services as  general legal services, accounting services, audit services; and  managing purchasing, property, payroll, and personnel;     (2) Except as provided at paragraph (c)(3) of this section, costs  for goods and services required for administration of the program,  including such goods and services as rental or purchase of equipment,  utilities, office supplies, postage, and rental and maintenance of  office space;     (3) The costs of organization-wide management functions; and     (4) Travel costs incurred for official business in carrying out  program management or administrative activities.     (5) These Interim Final WtW regulations adopt the description of  the term ``Administrative Costs'' found in the JTPA regulations at 29  CFR 627.440 to minimize the burden on PICs. The Secretary reserves the  right to change the definition to be consistent with the TANF  definition when final TANF regulations are issued.     (c) Other cost classification guidance. (1) Personnel and related  non-personnel costs of the recipient's or subrecipient's staff,  including project directors, who perform both administrative and  programmatic services or activities may be allocated to the benefitting  cost objectives/categories based on documented distributions of actual  time  [[Page 61608]]  worked or other equitable cost allocation methods.     (2) Indirect or overhead costs normally shall be charged to  administration, except that specific costs charged to an overhead or  indirect cost pool that can be identified directly with a cost  objective/category other than administration may be charged to the cost  objective/category directly benefitted. Documentation of such charges  shall be maintained.     (3) The costs of information technology--computer hardware and  software--needed for tracking or monitoring under a WtW grant shall not  be charged to the administration of the grant (section 404(b)(2) of the  Act).     Only the costs of information technology that is ``year 2000  compliant'' shall be allowable under WtW grants. To meet this  requirement, information technology must be able to accurately process  date/time data (including, but not limited to, calculating, comparing  and sequencing) from, into and between the twentieth and twenty-first  centuries, and the years 1999 and 2000. The information technology must  also be able to make leap year calculations. Furthermore, ``year 2000  compliant'' information technology when used in combination with other  information technology shall accurately process date/time data if the  other information technology properly exchanges date/time data with it.   Sec. 645.240  What are the reporting requirements for  Welfare -to-Work  programs?      (a) General. All States and other direct grant recipients shall  report pursuant to instructions issued by DOL (financial data) and by  DHHS (participant data only). Reports shall be submitted no more  frequently than quarterly within a time period specified in the  reporting instructions. In addition, DOL will establish supplemental  reporting requirements for competitive grant recipients through the  grant agreements pursuant to Sec. 645.515 of this part.     (b) Subrecipient reporting. A State or other direct grant recipient  may impose different forms or formats, shorter due dates, and more  frequent reporting requirements on subrecipients. However, the  recipient is required to meet the reporting requirements imposed by DOL  and DHHS.     (c) Financial reports. Financial reports shall be submitted to DOL  by each grant recipient. Reported expenditures and program income must  be on the accrual basis of accounting and cumulative by fiscal year of  appropriation. If the recipient's accounting records are not normally  kept on the accrual basis of accounting, the recipient shall develop  accrual information through an analysis of the documentation on hand.     (d) Due date. Financial reports will be due no later than 45 days  after the end of each quarter. A final financial report is required 90  days after the expiration of a funding period or the termination of  grant support.     (e) Optional SPIR Reporting. DOL may also provide instructions for  an optional modified SPIR for internal program management (section  411(a) of the Act).   Sec. 645.245  Who is responsible for oversight and monitoring of   Welfare -to-Work grants?      (a) The Secretary may monitor all recipients and subrecipients of  all grants awarded and funds expended under WtW. Federal oversight will  be conducted primarily at the State level for formula grants and at the  recipient level for competitive grants.     (b) The Governor shall monitor PICs (or other approved  administrative entities) funded under the State's formula allocated  grants on a periodic basis for compliance with applicable laws and  regulations. The Governor shall develop and make available for review a  State monitoring plan.   Sec. 645.250  What procedures apply to the resolution of findings  arising from audits, investigations, monitoring and oversight reviews?      (a) Resolution of subrecipient level findings. (1) The Governor is  responsible for the resolution of findings that arise from the State's  monitoring reviews, investigations and audits (including OMB Circular  A-133 audits) of subrecipients.     (2) A State shall utilize the audit resolution, debt collection and  appeal procedures that it uses for other Federal grant programs.     (3) If a State does not have such procedures, it shall prescribe  standards and procedures to be used for this grant program.     (b) Resolution of State level findings. (1) The Secretary is  responsible for the resolution of findings that arise from federal  audits, monitoring reviews, investigations, incident reports, and  recipient level OMB Circular A-133 audits.     (2) The Secretary will use the DOL audit resolution process,  consistent with the Single Audit Act of 1996 and OMB Circular A-133.     (3) A final determination issued by a grant officer pursuant to  this process may be appealed to the DOL Office of Administrative Law  Judges under the procedures at Sec. 645.800.     (c) Resolution of nondiscrimination findings. Findings arising from  investigations or reviews conducted under nondiscrimination laws shall  be resolved in accordance with those laws and the applicable  implementing regulations.   Sec. 645.255  What nondiscrimination protections apply to participants  in  Welfare -to-Work programs?      (a) All participants in WtW programs under this part shall have  such rights as are available under all applicable Federal, State and  local laws prohibiting discrimination including:     (1) The Age Discrimination Act of 1975 (42 U.S.C. 6101 et seq.);     (2) Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794);     (3) The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12101 et  seq.); and     (4) Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000d et  seq.).     (b) Complaints alleging discrimination in violation of any  applicable Federal, State or local law, including those listed in  paragraph (a) of this section, shall be processed in accordance with  those laws and the implementing regulations.     (c) Questions about or complaints alleging a violation of the  nondiscrimination laws in paragraph (a) of this section may be directed  or mailed to the Director, Civil Rights Center, U.S. Department of  Labor, Room N4123, 200 Constitution Avenue, NW, Washington, D.C. 20210  for processing.     (d) Participants in job readiness and employment activities  operated with WtW funds, as defined in Sec. 645.220 of this part, shall  not be discriminated against because of gender. Participants alleging  gender discrimination may file a complaint using the State's grievance  system procedures as described in Sec. 645.270 of this part (section  403(a)(5)(J)(iii) of the Act).   Sec. 645.260  What health and safety provisions apply to participants  in  Welfare -to-Work programs?      (a) Participants in an employment activity operated with WtW funds,  as defined in Sec. 645.220 of this part, are subject to the same health  and safety standards established under State and Federal law which are  applicable to similarly employed employees, of the same employer, who  are not participants in programs under WtW.     (b) Participants alleging a violation of these health and safety  standards may file a complaint pursuant to the procedures contained in  Sec. 645.270 of this part (section 403(a)(5)(J)(ii) of the Act).  [[Page 61609]]  Sec. 645.265  What safeguards are there to ensure that participants in   Welfare -to-Work employment activities do not displace other employees?      (a) An adult participating in an employment activity operated with  WtW funds, as described in Sec. 645.220 of this part, may fill an  established position vacancy subject to the limitations in paragraph  (c) of this section.     (b) An employment activity operated with WtW funds, as described in  Sec. 645.220 of this part, shall not violate existing contracts for  services or collective bargaining agreements. Where such an employment  activity would violate a collective bargaining agreement, the  appropriate labor organization and employer shall provide written  concurrence before the employment activity is undertaken.     (c) An adult participating in an employment activity operated with  WtW funds, as described in Sec. 645.220 of this part, shall not be  employed or assigned:     (1) When any other individual is on layoff from the same or any  substantially equivalent job within the same organizational unit;     (2) If the employer has terminated the employment of any regular,  unsubsidized employee or otherwise caused an involuntary reduction in  its workforce with the intention of filling the vacancy so created with  the WtW participant; and,     (3) If the employer has caused an involuntary reduction to less  than full time in hours of any employee in the same or substantially  equivalent job within the same organizational unit.     (d) Regular employees and program participants alleging  displacement may file a complaint pursuant to Sec. 645.270 of this part  (section 403(a)(5)(J)(i) of the Act).   Sec. 645.270  What procedures are there to ensure that currently  employed workers may file grievances regarding displacement and that   Welfare -to-Work participants in employment activities may file  grievances regarding displacement, health and safety standards and  gender discrimination?      (a) The State shall establish and maintain a grievance procedure  for resolving complaints from:     (1) Regular employees that the placement of a participant in an  employment activity operated with WtW funds, as described in  Sec. 645.220 of this part, violates any of the prohibitions described  in Sec. 645.265 of this part; and     (2) Program participants in an employment activity operated with  WtW funds, as described in Sec. 645.220 of this part, that any  employment activity violates any of the prohibitions described in  Secs. 645.255(d), 645.260, or 645.265 of this part.     (b) Such grievance procedure should include an opportunity for  informal resolution.     (c) If no informal resolution can be reached within the specified  time as established by the State as part of its grievance procedure,  such procedure shall provide an opportunity for the dissatisfied party  to receive a hearing upon request.     (d) The State shall specify the time period and format for the  hearing portion of the grievance procedure, as well as the time period  by which the complainant will be provided the written decision by the  State.     (e) A decision by the State under paragraph (d) of this section may  be appealed by any dissatisfied party within 30 days of the receipt of  the State's written decision, according to the time period and format  for the appeals portion of the grievance procedure as specified by the  State.     (f) The State shall designate the State agency which will be  responsible for hearing appeals. This agency shall be independent of  the State or local agency which is administering, or supervising the  administration of the State TANF and WtW programs.     (g) No later than 120 days of receipt of an individual's original  grievance, the State agency, as designated in paragraph (f) of this  section, shall provide a written final determination of the  individual's appeal.     (h) The grievance procedure shall include remedies for violations  of Secs. 645.255(d), 645.260, and 645.265 of this part which may  continue during the grievance process and which may include:     (1) Suspension or termination of payments from funds provided under  this part;     (2) Prohibition of placement of a WtW participant with an employer  that has violated Secs. 645.255(d), 645.260, and 645.265 of this part;     (3) Where applicable, reinstatement of an employee, payment of lost  wages and benefits, and reestablishment of other relevant terms,  conditions, and privileges of employment; and     (4) Where appropriate, other equitable relief (section  403(a)(5)(J)(iv) of the Act).  Subpart C--Additional Formula Grant Administrative Standards and  Procedures   Sec. 645.300  What constitutes an allowable match?      (a) A State is entitled to receive two (2) dollars of Federal funds  for every one (1) dollar of State match expenditures, up to the amount  available for allotment to the State based on the State's percentage  for WtW formula grant for the fiscal year. The State is not required to  provide a level of match necessary to support the total amount  available to it based on the State's percentage for WtW formula grant.  However, if the proposed match is less than the amount required to  support the full level of federal funds, the grant amount will be  reduced accordingly (section 403(a)(5)(A)(i)(I) of the Act).     (b) States shall follow the match or cost-sharing requirements of  the ``Common Rule'' Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and  Cooperative Agreements to State and Local Governments (codified for DOL  at 29 CFR 97.24). Paragraphs (b)(1) (i) and (ii), (b)(3), (b)(4) and  (c)(1) of this section are in addition to the common rule requirements.  Also, paragraphs included in the common rule which relate to the use of  donated buildings and other real property as match have been excluded  from this provision.     (1) Only costs that would be allowable if paid for with WtW grant  funds will be accepted as match.     (i) Because the use of Federal funds is prohibited for construction  or purchase of facilities or buildings except where there is explicit  statutory authority permitting it, costs incurred for the construction  or purchase of facilities or buildings shall not be acceptable as match  for a WtW grant.     (ii) Because the costs of construction or purchase of facilities or  buildings are unallowable as match, the donation of a building or  property as a third party in-kind contribution is also unallowable as a  match for a WtW grant.     (2) A match or cost-sharing requirement may be satisfied by either  or both of the following:     (i) Allowable costs incurred by the grantee, subgrantee or a cost  type contractor under the assistance agreement. This includes allowable  cost borne by non-Federal grants or by others and cash donations from  non-Federal third parties.     (ii) The value of third party in-kind contributions applicable to  the FY period to which the cost-sharing or matching requirement apply.     (3) No more than one-half (\1/2\) of the total match expenditures  may be in the form of third party in-kind contributions.     (4) Match expenditures must be recorded in the books of account of  the entity that incurred the cost or received the contribution. These  amounts may be  [[Page 61610]]  rolled up and reported as aggregate State level match.     (c) Qualifications and exceptions. (1) The matching requirements  may not be met by the use of an employer's share of participant wage  payments (e.g., employer share of OJT wages).     (2) Costs borne by other Federal grant agreements. A cost-sharing  or matching requirement may not be met by costs borne by another  Federal grant. This prohibition does not apply to income earned by a  grantee or subgrantee from a contract awarded under another Federal  grant.     (3) General revenue sharing. For the purpose of this section,  general revenue sharing funds distributed under 31 U.S.C. 6702 are not  considered Federal grant funds.     (4) Cost or contributions counted towards other Federal cost- sharing requirements. Neither costs nor the values of third party in- kind contributions may count towards satisfying a cost-sharing or  matching requirement of a grant agreement if they have been or will be  counted towards satisfying a cost-sharing or matching requirement of  another Federal grant agreement, a Federal procurement contract, or any  other award of Federal funds.     (5) Costs financed by program income. Costs financed by program  income, as defined in 29 CFR 97.25, shall not count towards satisfying  a cost-sharing or matching requirement unless they are expressly  permitted in the terms of the assistance agreement. (This use of  general program income is described in Sec. 97.25(g)).     (6) Services or property financed by income earned by contractors.  Contractors under a grant may earn income from the activities carried  out under the contract in addition to the amounts earned from the party  awarding the contract. No costs of services or property supported by  this income may count toward satisfying a cost-sharing or matching  requirement unless other provisions of the grant agreement expressly  permit this kind of income to be used to meet the requirement.     (7) Records. Costs and third party in-kind contributions counting  towards satisfying a cost-sharing or matching requirement must be  verifiable from the records of grantees and subgrantee or cost-type  contractors. These records must show how the value placed on third  party in-kind contributions was derived. To the extent feasible,  volunteer services will be supported by the same methods that the  organization uses to support the allocability of regular personnel  costs.     (8) Special standards for third party in-kind contributions. (i)  Third party in-kind contributions count towards satisfying a cost- sharing or matching requirement only where, if the party receiving the  contributions were to pay for them, the payments would be allowable  costs.     (ii) Some third party in-kind contributions are goods and services  that, if the grantee, subgrantee, or contractor receiving the  contribution had to pay for them, the payments would have been an  indirect costs. Cost sharing or matching credit for such contributions  shall be given only if the grantee, subgrantee, or contractor has  established, along with its regular indirect cost rate, a special rate  for allocating to individual projects or programs the value of the  contributions.     (iii) A third party in-kind contribution to a fixed-price contract  may count towards satisfying a cost-sharing or matching requirement  only if it results in:     (A) An increase in the services or property provided under the  contract (without additional cost to the grantee or subgrantee) or     (B) A cost savings to the grantee or subgrantee.     (iv) The values placed on third party in-kind contributions for  cost-sharing or matching purposes will conform to the rules in the  succeeding sections of this part. If a third party in-kind contribution  is a type not treated in those sections, the value placed upon it shall  be fair and reasonable.     (d) Valuation of donated services. (1) Volunteer services. Unpaid  services provided to a grantee or subgrantee by individuals will be  valued at rates consistent with those ordinarily paid for similar work  in the grantee's or subgrantee's organization. If the grantee or  subgrantee does not have employees performing similar work, the rates  will be consistent with those ordinarily paid by other employers for  similar work in the same labor market. In either case, a reasonable  amount for fringe benefits may be included in the valuation.     (2) Employees of other organizations. When an employer other than a  grantee, subgrantee, or cost-type contractor furnishes free of charge  the services of an employee in the employee's normal line of work, the  services will be valued at the employee's regular rate of pay exclusive  of the employee's fringe benefits and overhead costs. If the services  are in a different line of work, paragraph (d)(1) of this section  applies.     (e) Valuation of third party donated supplies and loaned equipment  or space. (1) If a third party donates supplies, the contribution will  be valued at the market value of the supplies at the time of donation.     (2) If a third party donates the use of equipment or space in a  building but retains title, the contribution will be valued at the fair  rental rate of the equipment or space.   Sec. 645.310  What assurance must a State provide that it will make the  required matching expenditures?      In its State plan, a State must provide a written estimate of  planned matching expenditures and describe the process by which the  funds will be tracked and reported to ensure that the State meets its  projected match (section 403(a)(5)(A)(i)(I) of the Act).   Sec. 645.315  What actions are to be taken if a State fails to make the  required matching expenditures?      (a) The Department will implement an annual reconciliation and  grant adjustment for WtW grants.     (1) The reconciliation will be based on reported match expenditures  through the end of the FY report, which is due 45 days after the end of  the fiscal year.     (2) If the end of FY report has not been received by December 1 of  that year, then the reconciliation will be based on the most current  report received.     (b) If match expenditures do not satisfy the requirement of the FY  grant, the subsequent FY grant amount will be reduced by the  appropriate corresponding amount (i.e., the grant will reduced by two  (2) dollars for each one (1) dollar shortfall in State matching funds).   Sec. 645.320  When will formula funds be reallotted, and what  reallotment procedures will the Secretary use?      (a) No reallotment of funds among States will occur during FY 98;     (b) For subsequent fiscal years, a reconciliation will be made  during the first quarter of the fiscal year under Sec. 645.315 of this  part to determine whether or not a State has satisfied its required  level of matching funds for the prior year.     (c) If a State has failed to expend the required level of matching  funds, the required reduction in the State grant will be made during  the second quarter of the fiscal year.     (d) Also, any funds which become available as a result of  underexpenditures of required match, or failure to obligate 100 percent  of the funds by either States or substate entities by the end of the  fiscal year of the grant, will be reallotted among qualifying States  (i.e., those which have committed a sufficient match to qualify for  additional funds). The reallotment  [[Page 61611]]  will occur during the second quarter of the following fiscal year  (section 403(a)(5)(A)(i)(I) of the Act).  Subpart D--State Formula Grants Administration   Sec. 645.400  Under what conditions may the Governor request a waiver  to designate an alternate local administering agency?      (a)(1) The Governor may include in the State's WtW Plan a waiver  request to select an agency other than the PIC to administer the  program for one or more SDAs in a State; or     (2) When the Governor determines the PIC, or alternative agency,  has not coordinated its expenditures with the expenditure of funds  provided to the State under TANF, pursuant to section  403(a)(5)(A)(vii)(II) of the Act, the Governor shall request a waiver.     (b) The Governor shall bear the burden of proving that the  designated alternative agency, rather than the PIC or other  administering agency, would improve the effectiveness or efficiency of  the administration of WtW funds in the SDA. The Governor's waiver  request shall include information to meet that burden. The Governor  shall provide a copy of the waiver request and any supporting  information submitted to the Secretary to the PIC and CEO of the SDA  for which an alternative administering agency is requested.     (c) The PIC and CEO shall have fifteen (15) days in which to submit  his or her written response to the Department. The PIC and CEO shall  provide a copy of such response to the Governor.     (d) The Secretary will assess the waiver information submitted by  the Governor, including input from the PIC and CEO in reaching the  decision whether to permit the use of an alternate administrative  agency.     (e) The Secretary shall approve a waiver request if she determines  that the Governor has established that the designated alternative  administering agency, rather than the PIC or other administering  agency, will improve the effectiveness or efficiency of the  administration of WtW funds provided for the benefit of the SDA.     (f) Where an alternate administering agency is approved by the  Secretary, such administrative entity shall coordinate with the CEO for  the applicable SDA(s) regarding the expenditure of WtW grant funds in  the SDA(s).     (g) The decision of the Secretary to approve or deny a waiver  request will be issued promptly and shall constitute final agency  action.   Sec. 645.410  What elements will the State use in distributing funds  within the State?      (a) Of the WtW funds allotted to the State, not less than 85  percent of the State allotment must be distributed to the SDAs in the  State.     (1) The State shall prescribe a formula for determining the amount  of funds to be distributed to each SDA in the State using no factors  other than the three factors described in paragraphs (a)(2) and (3) of  this section;     (2) The formula prescribed by the Governor must include as one of  the formula factors for distributing funds the provision at section  403(a)(5)(A)(vi)(I)(aa) of the Act. The Governor is to distribute funds  to an SDA based on the number by which the population of the area with  an income that is less than the poverty line exceeds 7.5 percent of the  total population of the area, compared to all such numbers in all such  areas in the State. The Governor must assign a weight of not less than  50 percent to this factor;     (3) The Governor shall distribute the remaining funds, if any, to  the SDAs utilizing only one or both of the following factors:     (i) The SDA's share of the number of adults receiving assistance  under TANF or the predecessor program in the SDA for 30 months or more  (whether consecutive or not), relative to the number of such adults  residing in the State;     (ii) The SDA's share of the number of unemployed individuals  residing in the SDA, relative to the number of such individuals  residing in the State.     (4) If the amount to be distributed to a service delivery area by  the Governor's formula is less than $100,000, the funds shall be  available to be used by the Governor to fund projects described at  paragraph (b) of this section.     (5) States shall use the guidance provided at section 403(a)(5)(D)  of the Act in determining the number of individuals with an income that  is less than the poverty line.     (6) PICs (or alternate administering agency) shall determine,  pursuant to section 403(a)(5)(A)(vii)(I) of the Act, on which  individual(s) and on which allowable activities to expend its WtW fund  allocation.     (7) The State shall distribute the SDAs' allocations in a timely  manner, but not later than 30 days from receipt of the State's fund  allotment.     (b) Of the funds allocated to the State, up to 15 percent of the  funds may be retained at the State level to fund projects that appear  likely to help long-term recipients of assistance enter unsubsidized  employment. Any additional funds available as a result of the process  described at paragraph (a)(4)of this section, shall also be available  to be used to fund projects to help long-term recipients of assistance  enter unsubsidized jobs.     (c) The Governors may distribute the funds retained pursuant to  paragraph (b) of this section to a variety of workforce organizations,  in addition to PICs, and other entities such as One-Stop systems,  private sector employers, labor organizations, business and trade  associations, education agencies, housing agencies, community  development corporations, transportation agencies, community-based and  faith-based organizations, disability community organizations,  community action agencies, and colleges and universities which provide  some of the assistance needed by the targeted population.   Sec. 645.415  What planning information must a State submit in order to  receive a formula grant?      (a) Each State seeking financial assistance under the formula grant  portion of the WtW legislation must submit an annual plan meeting the  requirements prescribed by the Secretary. This plan shall be in the  form of an addendum to the TANF State plan and shall be submitted to  the Secretaries of Labor and Health and Human Services.     (b) The Secretary shall review the State plan for compliance with  the statutory and regulatory provisions of the WtW program. The  Secretary's decision whether to accept a State plan as in compliance  with the Act shall constitute final agency action.     (c) If the Governor has requested a waiver to permit the selection  of an alternative administering agency in the State plan, the  provisions of Sec. 645.400 of this part shall apply (section  403(a)(5)(A)(ii) of the Act).   Sec. 645.420  What factors will be used in measuring State performance?      (a) State performance will be measured by a formula issued by the  Secretary after consultation with DHHS, the National Governors  Association (NGA) and the American Public  Welfare  Association (APWA).     (b) The formula shall be the basis for measuring the success of  States in placing individuals in private sector employment or any kind  of employment, the duration of such placements, any increase in  earnings of such individuals and other additional factors that the  Secretary of Labor deems to be appropriate. The formula will provide  for adjustments due to general economic conditions on a State-by-State  basis.  [[Page 61612]]      (c) The formula shall serve as the basis for the award of FY 2000  bonus grants based on successful performance (section 403(a)(5)(E) of  the Act).

GX242-23-10583668	"UNITED STATES OF AMERICA  BEFORE THE NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD  FIRST REGION   In the Matter of MALDEN MILLS INDUSTRIES, INC. Employer and AREA TRADES COUNCIL, IUOE 877, NERCC LOCAL 51, PLUMBERS LOCAL 12, IBEW LOCAL 103, PAINTERS DISTRICT COUNCIL #35 Petitioner Case 1- RC- 21675  DECISION AND DIRECTION OF ELECTION  1  The Employer is a Massachusetts corporation engaged in the manufacture of textile products at two plants located in Lawrence, Massachusetts. The Petitioner seeks to represent a unit of maintenance and knit technicians employed at the Employer's two plants (""the Unit""). The parties stipulate that the following job classifications are in the Unit: commercialization knit technicians, lead pipefitters, lead mechanical group leaders, 1  Upon a petition duly filed under Section 9(c) of the National Labor Relations Act, as amended,   a hearing was held before a hearing officer of the National Labor Relations Board. In accordance   with the provisions of Section 3(b) of the Act, the Board has delegated its authority in this   proceeding to the Regional Director.   The Employer asserts that the ballot should only contain the name of the Area Trades Council and   objects to listing the individual constituent locals on any ballot that would result from this matter.   The hearing officer overruled the Employer's objection; I affirm the hearing officer's ruling.   Upon the entire record in this proceeding, I find that: 1) the hearing officer's rulings made at the   hearing are free from prejudicial error and are hereby affirmed; 2) the Employer is engaged in   commerce within the meaning of the Act, and it will effectuate the purposes of the Act to assert   jurisdiction in this matter; 3) the labor organization involved claims to represent certain   employees of the Employer; and 4) a question affecting commerce exists concerning the   representation of certain employees of the Employer within the meaning of Section 9(c)(1) and   Section 2(6) and (7) of the Act.   1    breakdown leadpersons, senior instrument technicians, lead senior instrument technicians/dye house, and general stockroom clerk. It is undisputed that the following classifications are excluded from the unit: the working supervisor breakdowns, the planner/maintenance, the stockroom supervisor, the boilerroom stationary engineers, the manager finishing/inspection, and the supervisor maintenance/dye house. At issue are eight lead knit technicians who the Employer claims are supervisors and should be excluded from the Unit and the Petitioner contends are non- supervisory employees who should be included in the Unit. I find that the lead knit technicians are supervisors within the meaning of Section 2(11), and I shall exclude all eight employees from the Unit. Background The Employer, a Massachusetts corporation, is a textile manufacturer, producing high- tech Polar Fleece, among other textile products. The Employer operates out of two plants located in Lawrence, Massachusetts. The two plants, the Lawrence Knitting Mill (""LKM"") and the Mariner Knitting Mill (""MKM""), are located adjacent to one another. A Knitting Technical Director (""the Director""), located primarily in the MKM, oversees the lead technicians in both buildings, as well as operations of the production unit.2 The Technical Manager (""the Manager""), located in the LKM, assists the Director. The knit technicians are classified as lead technicians, technicians I, and technicians II. The technicians work on various machines of different complexity. In the MKM, there are the Pallum, Double Knit, FLD, VX FLD, DF3, and 3F knitting machines. The Vanguard, FL4, and Camber knitting machines are located in the LKM building. The production workers operate the machines and the knit technicians monitor the quality of the product, make adjustment to machines, repair the machines, and otherwise take care of the technical aspects of the machines. The knit technicians I are entry level employees. They have the lowest technical skills; they perform the more basic jobs, including changing needles and working on barres. Most Knit Technicians I come from the production unit. Knit technicians II are either hired off the street or came from Bridgton, a mill which had been operated by the Employer but has since closed. Knit technicians II have more technical skill and greater experience in the maintenance of the machines. The Employer runs a four- shift operation.3 There are two lead knit technicians assigned to each shift, one in the LKM and the other in the MKM building. In each  2  The production employees have been and are currently represented by Local 311 of the Union of Needle Trades Industrial & Textile Employees (UNITE). There is a collective -bargaining agreement currently in effect from December 1, 2001 through November 30, 2004.  The A shift runs Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m.; the B shift Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m.; the C shift Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, from  3  2    building, approximately four knit technicians report to a lead knit technician for each shift. The technicians are paid according to their skill level. Knit technicians I are paid on average $15 per hour; knit technicians II are paid on average $17 per hour; and lead knit technicians are paid on average $20 per hour. Knit technicians I and II are paid weekly, whereas lead knit technicians are paid bi- weekly.4 Knit technicians I and II are paid a lump sum vacation amount about July of every year when the plant shuts down. Lead knit technicians accrue their vacation throughout the year. Knit technicians I and II earn 40 hours a year in sick pay, while the lead knit technicians earn 80 hours a year. Lead knit technicians spend approximately 30 percent of their time working with tools and performing knit technician work. The remainder of their time is spent assigning work to technicians and ensuring that the production operation runs smoothly. Lead knit technicians receive overtime compensation when overtime is available. However, unlike the other knit technicians, who receive overtime for hours worked in excess of a 36- hour workweek, lead knit technicians receive overtime compensation for hours worked in excess of a 40- hour workweek. Lead technicians do not wear uniforms. They use a different punch card than the technicians.5 Unlike knit technicians I and II, who receive their accrued vacation pay as a lump sum in July of each year, lead knit technicians can use their accrued vacation time throughout the year and get paid when they use it.6 Lead knit technicians have an office and use a computer to assist them in performing their duties. The knit technicians do not have access to the office and the computer. Lead knit technicians are appraised on their performance of their teams, as well as their own performance. I. Authority to assign, or responsibly to direct employees The Director relies on the lead knit technicians to ensure that production flows efficiently. On all night shifts, as well as on the weekends, the Director and the Manager are not present at the Mill buildings.7 Accordingly, lead knit technicians are responsible for the operation of the buildings and direct their teams of technicians. They are responsible for knowing the priorities of the company by customer order, quality, and production. If a priority changes during the day, the lead knit technicians reassign 7 a.m. to 7 p.m.; and the D shift Thursday, Friday, and Saturday from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. Occasionally, the employees work Sundays. 4  The record shows that the lead pipefitter, lead mechanic, and group leader electric, positions that the parties stipulated are included in this unit, are paid bi-weekly as well. The punch card they use is reserved for employees who get paid bi-weekly.  5  6  For example, lead technician Steven Hallett testified that if he uses a week vacation, he gets paid for that week when he uses it.  Generally, the Knitting Technical Director works from 5-6 a.m. until 4 p.m.; the Technical Manager works from 6:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.  7  3    technicians based on employees' skill level. In addition, when necessary, the lead knit technicians recommend training for technicians on their team. The lead knit technicians determine whether or not overtime is necessary. They also select the employees who will work overtime. Overtime is usually assigned on a rotating system based on seniority. There are times, however, when the work that needs to be done must be assigned to a technician with the appropriate level of expertise. In those situations, the lead knit technician can deviate from the rotation system and assign the work to a technician with an appropriate level of expertise. Thus, the selection of employees for overtime can depend on matching the complexity of the machine that is being worked on during overtime with the particular skills of individual knit technicians. II. Hiring, firing, laying off, recalling, promoting, and adjusting grievances The Employer has not hired anyone in recent years because of its financial situation.8 In the past, the Director had conducted the interviews and made the decisions regarding hiring. Lead knit technicians can recommend that technicians be fired, laid off, or recalled, but they do not have the authority to do so themselves.9 Before a significant personnel action is taken against an employee, the Director conducts an investigation to make sure that the personnel action is supported by facts warranting such action. Nonetheless, the record evidence is that the Director follows the lead knit technicians' recommendations. The undisputed record evidence is that lead knit technicians have the authority to approve an employee's request to leave early. In addition, unrebutted testimony asserts that lead knit technicians have authority to recommend promotions or pay increases and their recommendations are followed. Because of the Employer's difficult financial circumstances, however, employees have not received a pay increase since 2001. In explaining his deference to the recommendations of lead knit technicians, the Director testified that the lead knit technicians work very closely with the technicians and are in a better position to know their qualifications. Therefore, when there is an opportunity for promotion, the lead knit technicians are able to determine which technician I has progressed enough to warrant a promotion to Level II. The final decision regarding promotion rests with the Director. Lead knit technicians are responsible for performing annual evaluations of the knit technicians I and II, and these evaluations play some unspecified role in granting pay raises. Because of the Employer's financial circumstances, employees have not received a pay raise since 2001, and annual performance evaluations appear to have been informally suspended since that time. In addition to the written evaluations that are 8  The Employer is just now emerging from bankruptcy but is still in a dire financial situation since a fire that occurred in 1998.  9  Lead knit technician Steve Hallett testified that he recommended one of the technicians on his team be terminated for poor attendance and performance and his recommendation was followed.  4    nominally performed annually, lead knit technicians informally evaluate the knit technicians throughout the year by giving feedback and sending them to training, if necessary. 10 III. Authority to effectively recommend discipline During the day shift, when the Director and the Manager are present in the buildings, they get involved in the disciplinary process. Thus, if there is a problem during the day shift with the knit technicians I or II, a lead knit technician brings it to the Director's or the Manager's attention, an investigation ensues, and the employee is disciplined. Nevertheless, lead knit technicians can issue oral or written warnings for minor infractions without first checking with the Director or the Manager. Lead knit technicians on the night and weekend shifts act independently of the Director or the Manager. They have the authority to send technicians home early, when there is a problem, without first checking with anyone. In all cases, the technicians have the right to meet with the Director or the Manager to discuss the discipline imposed on them. There is no evidence, however, that a lead knit technician's disciplinary action has been rescinded. Lead knit technicians act as supervisors of the production employees when a production supervisor is not available. There is evidence that a lead knit technician on the D shift has filled in for a production supervisor for months while the supervisor was out. No evidence was introduced to delineate the duties of a lead knit technician who acts as a production supervisor. Analysis and Conclusion The Employer asserts that the eight lead knit technicians are supervisors and should be excluded from the bargaining unit. The burden of proving supervisory status rests squarely on the party asserting that claim. Bennett Industries.11 For the reasons set forth below, I find that the Employer has met its burden and that the lead knit technicians should be excluded from the unit. Supervisor is defined in Section 2(11) of the Act to mean any individual having the authority, in the interest of the employer, to hire, transfer, suspend, lay off, recall, promote, discharge, assign, reward, or discipline other employees, or responsibly to direct them, or to adjust their grievances, or effectively to recommend such action, if in connection with the foregoing the exercise of such authority is not of a merely routine or clerical nature, but requires the use independent judgment. An employee is a statutory supervisor if he or she has (1) the authority to engage in any of the supervisory functions, (2) his or her exercise of supervisory authority ""is not of a merely routine or clerical Employees have not received an evaluation since 2001, nor have they received raises or promotions since then. 11 10  313 NLRB 1363 (1994).  5    nature, but requires the use of independent judgment,"" and (3) the authority is held in the interest of management. NLRB v. Kentucky River Comm. Care, Inc.12 The Board has noted that the indicia of supervisory status contained in the statute are set forth disjunctively, and if a person meets any of those indicia, he must be considered a supervisor. Hydro Conduit Corp.13 Thus, a person need possess only one of the specific criteria listed, or the authority to effectively recommend, as long as the performance of that function is not routine but requires the use of independent judgment. Pepsi-Cola Co.14 The authority to hire or to effectively recommend hiring, using independent judgment, is itself sufficient to confer statutory supervisory status. Fred Meyer Alaska, Inc.15 I find that the record establishes that the lead knit technicians have the authority to direct and assign duties to technicians, and that authority is not merely routine or clerical in nature, and the authority is clearly exercised in the interest of management. On a daily basis, in assigning duties, lead knit technicians consider the individual technicians' skills and experience and match them to the demands imposed by machinery of varying complexity. In addition, lead knit technicians determine production priorities and demands, and maintenance requirements and make assignments, including overtime assignments, accordingly. I find that the lead knit technicians' assignment and direction of their respective teams involve the type of independent judgment contemplated by Section 2(11). Arlington Masonry Supply, Inc., 339 NLRB No. 99 (July 21, 2003)(Maintenance Supervisor Justice). In addition, the record evidence supports a finding that lead knit technicians effectively recommend pay raises, promotion, and discipline of technicians on their teams. Although there is not a great deal of evidence with respect to these indicia, there is nothing in the record calling this evidence into question. Specifically with respect to the suspension of annual appraisals and the granting of pay raises, it appears that these actions have been suspended only because of the Employer's financial difficulties. No record evidence suggests these authorities have been permanently removed from the lead knit technicians. See Fred Meyer Alaska, Inc.,16 in which the Board determined that a meat manager, who possessed the authority to hire but had not exercised that authority, was a supervisor within the meaning of Section 2(11). See also, Tesoro Petroleum Corporation,17 where the Board held that shift supervisors, who had a broad written 532 U.S. 706, 713 (2001) (citing NLRB v. Health Care & Retirement Corp. of America, 511 U.S. 571, 573-74 (1994)). 13 12  254 NLRB 433, 436 (1981). 326 NLRB 1062, 1063 (1999). 334 NLRB 646, 649 (2001).

Moreover, secondary indicia such as the lead knit technicians' pay differential, allotment of vacation and sick time per year, offices, and access to the Employer's computer system are circumstantial evidence indicative of statutory supervisory status. McClatchy Newspapers.18 Petitioner relies on North Shore Weeklies, Inc.19 to support its position that the lead knit technicians are not supervisors within the meaning of the Act. Petitioner's reliance is misplaced. In North Shore Weeklies, the Board affirmed a Regional Director's decision finding that the Employer's press supervisors were not statutory supervisors. The Board found that the press supervisors assigned work to their crewmembers from a scheduled work list prepared by management. The Board also found that the press supervisors' assignment or direction was not based on anything other than experience and knowledge of the craft skills necessary to operate the presses. North Shore Weeklies.20 That case is distinguishable. Here, the lead knit technicians are solely responsible for directing their teams. They have the responsibility to devise a work list based on their individual assessments of production requirements, maintenance demands, and the skills of the technicians on their teams. The assignment and direction of work performed by the lead knit technicians is neither as routine nor as constrained by employer guidance as was the case is North Shore Weeklies. Accordingly, based upon the foregoing and the stipulations of the parties at the hearing, I find that the following employees of the Employer constitute a unit appropriate for collective bargaining within the meaning of Section 9(b) of the Act: All full- time and regular part- time commercialization knit technicians, knit technicians I, knit technicians II, lead pipefitters, lead mechanical group leaders, breakdown leadpersons, senior instrument technicians, lead senior instrument technicians/dye house, and general stockroom clerk but excluding lead knit technicians, working supervisor breakdowns, the planner/maintenance, the stockroom supervisor, the boilerroom stationary engineers, the manager finishing/inspection, and the supervisor maintenance/dye house, and all other employees, managers, guards, and supervisors as defined in the Act. DIRECTION OF ELECTION An election by secret ballot shall be conducted by the Regional Director among the employees in the unit found appropriate at the time and place set forth in the notice of 18  307 NLRB 773 (1992). 317 NLRB 1128 (1995). 317 NLRB at 1128.  19  20  7    election to be issued subsequently, subject to the Board's Rules and Regulations.

It's a job that changes even as it stays the same. The department's mission is to advocate job creation and economic growth through workforce development. Our agenda is to support the economy, the employers and the workers of the Empire State through employment services, training, worker protection and delivery of benefits for those who are unemployed through no fault of their own. This annual report summarizes the ways we are doing our job. We recruit workers for businesses and match job seekers to available positions. Last year, the Labor Department hosted more than 2,500 job fairs or recruitments and attracted more than 250,000 people eager for work. Under the auspices of the Workforce Investment Act, the department is helping to develop training programs that enhance our workforce, reduce the dependency on welfare and move people into new and better jobs. We continue to fine-tune the apprenticeship programs that have been producing skilled artisans in this state since the 1890s. Our Linda Angello, Commissioner  partnership with business is targeting the needs of tomorrow with education and training today. Labor Department staff enforce State laws pertaining to working conditions, wages and hours, child labor, safety and health and public work. In the 90 years since the Triangle Shirtwaist Co. Fire, our staff has shouldered a wider responsibility for helping employers achieve a safer, more efficient workplace. In the wake of the September 11th terrorist attack on the World Trade Center, the State Department of Labor immediately mobilized to work with state, federal and New York City agencies to aid in the relief and recovery efforts, and to provide essential services to the thousands of innocent victims and dislocated workers. The tragedy produced more than 105,000 unemployment insurance claims and affected thousands of jobs in the metropolitan New York area.  2   2001 Annual Report  I. EMPLOYMENT AND TRAINING A. DIVISION OF EMPLOYMENT SERVICES (DOES) The Division of Employment Services (DoES) has responsibility for managing and administering employment related services to businesses and workers in the State of New York. In partnership with local agencies, the division's staff works within the mandates of the Workforce Investment Act (WIA) to meet the needs of New York's businesses and workforce. In addition, it is responsible for managing the job and talent banks used by partners in the Workforce Development System throughout the state. DoES provides assistance to employers, veterans, rural workers, Unemployment Insurance (UI) claimants, welfare recipients, youth and other job seekers to promote economic development and a healthy economy.  From September 11 through December 2001, the following numbers of people were served: NYC 15,693 12,847 28,540 Long Island 1,468 N/A 1,468 Hudson Valley 602 N/A 602 1,505 N/A 1,505 TOTALS 17,763 12,847 30,610 75,175 14,744 89,919  # Scheduled Walk-ins Total Served Reportable Services Phone Inquires Total Served  70,000 3,670 14,744 N / A 84,744 3,670  SEPTEMBER 11, 2001 WORLD TRADE CENTER DISASTER DoES responded immediately to meet the needs of employers and job seekers affected by the World Trade Center disaster on September 11, 2001. In NYC, Nassau, Suffolk, Westchester and Rockland Counties, our office hours and days were extended, affording customers the opportunity to access needed services in the evening and on weekends (including Sundays). DoES staff were placed at five additional itinerant sites to expand availability of services. Special effort was made to reconnect dislocated workers with jobs through targeted job development, informational sessions for affected workers and establishing a special job seeker hotline that was operated on evenings and weekends, as well as during regular business hours. In addition to employment-related services, the Division of Employment Services also helped some of the 105,000 individuals who filed UI claims as a result of the disaster with the filing process for UI benefits by taking paper claims when they were unable to file by telephone due to non-functioning phone lines. Staff also provided information on Disaster Unemployment Assistance (DUA).  Staff met with businesses and representatives of unions whose workers were adversely affected by the disaster. Staff also worked with Empire State Development on the Governor 's efforts to help affected small businesses. Services to employers were expanded; the Employer Services Hotline hours and days were extended to evenings and weekends to make it easier for employers to get information on available assistance and to allow them to list job openings for affected workers. DoES staff worked closely with the airlines, as this industry was adversely affected when air travel came to a halt and travel by air was drastically reduced.  LABOR EXCHANGE New York State Job Bank: Employers: Job Orders: Job Openings: 11,192 24,844 43,333  The New York State Department of Labor is the lead agency for workforce development in the State. One of its goals is to help businesses find workers and help people find jobs. During 2001, DOL held approximately 2,500 job fairs and recruitments. More than 27,000 employers participated and approximately 250,000 jobseekers attended. JOBLINE is an interactive telephone system that provides access to ""America's Job Bank"" for job seekers who are unable to use the Internet. It is provided through a partnership between the New York State Department of Labor, the New York State Education Department, and the NYS Commission for the Blind and Visually Handicapped in collaboration with the National Federation for the Blind and the U.S. Department of Labor. It was implemented in September 2001 and presents another option for job seekers to access job openings.  3   New York State Department of Labor  JOBLINE: Provides spoken instructions and job information to the user Is toll-free to job seekers Available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week Allows a personalized job search in your area of interest Is updated daily (new jobs added, filled jobs removed)  other support services available. During PY 2001, the program reached 11,176 migrant and seasonal farm workers. AGRICULTURAL RECRUITMENT SYSTEM  The program locates agricultural workers from areas outside New York State for the state's farm, landscaping and food processing industries. During PY 2001, 195 job orders were processed for 2,350 workers from outside the state.  UI TO WORK REEMPLOYMENT PROGRAM The UI to Work Reemployment Program greatly expands services to unemployment insurance benefit claimants to help them find new jobs more quickly. During calendar year 2001, 500,000 claimants were scheduled to report to a local office for job service orientation and other placement assistance such as resume writing, job search and interviewing skills workshops. Our resource rooms are equipped with personal computers and a variety of self-help software programs that greatly enhance our services. Periodic eligibility reviews were scheduled for 180,000 claimants as a benefit control measure where work search activities were examined and availability issues reviewed to insure compliance. An additional benefit control measure completed in late 2001 includes an automatic stop payment of weekly benefits for those claimants failing to report to the employment service. Since the inception of the UI to Work Reemployment Program in July 1999, unemployment insurance weekly benefit duration declined from 17.5 weeks to 15.3 weeks.  ALIEN LABOR CERTIFICATION An employer wishing to hire a non-immigrant alien must first obtain certification from USDOL that there are no able, willing, and qualified U.S. workers available for the job, and that the wages and working conditions offered to the alien are those prevailing for their occupation. DoES is responsible for processing initial requests for both permanent and temporary alien labor certification. Enactment of amendments to Section 245(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act in December 2000 triggered huge increases in the number of new applications for immigrant labor certification in the first four months of 2001. The unprecedented filings in that time span inundated the Alien Employment Certification Office (AECO), a unit within DoES located in New York City. The new legislation created a period of limited amnesty for immigrants who wished to begin the process of obtaining a green card. The amnesty period ended on April 30, 2001, which meant that applications had to reach AECO by that date. To publicize and clarify the legislation, Governor Pataki established a Citizenship Committee. Recognizing the complex nature of the immigration laws, the Governor wanted to ensure that immigrant groups understood the application process and the implications of newly amended Section 245(i). AECO staff played an active role in the outreach to immigrant communities by participating in publicity efforts and by joining with the Citizenship Committee in discussion groups and informational panels throughout the Metropolitan area. The reaction to 245(i) was much greater than expected. When a similar limited amnesty period was established in January 1998, about 40,000 new applications above normal filings were received nationwide. This time, over 40,000 new applications directly related to the amnesty program were received in New York State alone. In April of 2001, 38,970 applications were received in AECO compared to 432 new applications in April 2000.  RURAL EMPLOYMENT PROGRAM The mission of the Rural Employment Program is to provide the full range of employment services to rural and agricultural sectors. The program assists agricultural and rural employers in locating workers needed to successfully conduct business. They also help farm workers and other rural residents find productive employment in agriculture or non-farm jobs, according to their abilities, interests and needs. MIGRANT OUTREACH PROGRAM Operating since 1975, the program contacts migrant and seasonal farm workers to explain services available from the department as well as  4   2001 Annual Report  PERIODIC EMPLOYMENT AND ELIGIBILITY REVIEW (PEER) PROGRAM The PEER program continues to be used as a tool to keep UI duration down by monitoring compliance of UI claimants regarding work test. Periodic assessments assure that claimants are: ready, willing, and able to work, not otherwise employed and actively seeking employment.  seekers searching for employment opportunities in New York State. There is no cost to employers listing their job openings. This site was used by 1,031 employers in 2001. Department of Labor Assistance Line  1-800HIRE-992  This toll-free information line is available 7:30 am through 5 pm weekdays to assist employers and job seekers with labor-related questions and concerns. Following the World Trade Center disaster, help-line hours were extended to seven days a week to provide crucial information for affected employers and employees. In 2001, over 10,000 calls were received on this help line. Recruitments/Job Fair Promotions  Local office and regional recruitments, as well as job fairs, are listed on the Department of Labor website www.labor.state.ny.us by the Office of Employer Services. This has become a major marketing tool for the Department of Labor to meet the workforce needs of both the employer and job seeker. Job Service Employer Committees (JSEC)  www.nyjsec.org  This office coordinates the 50 local employer committees and provides support for the local JSEC Coordinators, the NYJSEC, Inc. Executive Committee and the Board of Directors. The JSEC Program provides a connection between the local office and the business customer and sponsors local events to help promote NYS Department of Labor programs and human resource issues.  PROJECT TRABAJO Project Trabajo (PT) offers unemployed Hispanic workers and recent immigrants orientations that include customized job readiness skills workshops to help them become ""job ready"" and able to compete in today's labor market. It also informs Hispanic small businesses and the professional business community about the employer services and programs of the Labor Department through the Latino Job Service Employer Committee business seminars and other involvement with different Hispanic Chambers of Commerce. PT conducted customized Resume Workshops for Hispanic and other English-speaking WTC displaced hotel workers at the NY Hotel Trades Council Union and worked with Verizon to train 350 Hispanics and other unemployed and WTC displaced workers. PT helped to develop a Hispanic Contractors Workshop and a Small Business Development Forum. During this year, PT participated in five Hispanic & Diversity Career Job Fairs, including the Labor Department sponsored event. Staff members also operated a toll-free hotline answering questions about jobs, the Labor Department's resources and unemployment insurance. Staff handled about 8,000 inquiries during 2001. PT staff also translated 19 unemployment insurance and labor exchange documents.  EMPIRE ZONES/ZONE EQUIVALENT AREAS PROGRAM (EZs) The Empire Zones program is designed to stimulate economic growth in the most distressed areas of New York State. By offering wide-ranging financial incentives and community-based workforce enhancement, the program has become a catalyst for new business development, existing business expansion and job creation. During the past five years, the program has expanded throughout the state and now provides a greater variety of incentives to foster economic growth, including Wage Tax Credits, utility rate reductions and property tax abatements. Similar incentives are offered in the Zone Equivalent Area (ZEA) program. These areas are based on census tract poverty indicators rather than a formal designation process.  OFFICE OF EMPLOYER SERVICES The Office of Employer Services provides technical assistance and support to local office staff and marketing representatives on employer directed programs and/or services available through the New York State Department of Labor. Services provided to employers and businesses during 2001 include: HightechNY  www.hightechny.com  This website was developed cooperatively by the New York State Department of Labor and Empire State Development to attract, assist and retain thousands of college students and other high-tech skilled job  5   New York State Department of Labor  Eight new EZs were designated in 2001, bringing the statewide total to 62. Four more will be named in 2002. Accompanying the increase in the number of zones was an increase in EZ-certified businesses. Over 1,200 businesses were certified in the program in 2001; nearly a 100 percent increase over last year 's total. The Department of Labor administers the EZ program jointly with Empire State Development and local zone officials.  (VESID); or be certified by the Office of Children and Family Services' Commission for the Blind and Visually Handicapped (CBVH). For Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC); Welfareto-Work Tax Credit (WtW); and Workers with Disabilities Employment Tax Credit (WETC), in 2001, DOL: Screened nearly 35,000 individuals for tax credit eligibility. Issued nearly 23,000 OTC certifications and created an equal number of new job opportunities for certified customers. Helped business in New York State potentially save $95.1 million in tax credits.  WORK OPPORTUNITY TAX CREDIT (WOTC) AND WELFARE-TO-WORK (WTW) TAX CREDIT The federal Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) is designed to promote the employment of the following economically disadvantaged individuals: TANF Recipients Qualified Veterans High-Risk Youth Living in an Empowerment Zone or Enterprise Community or Summer Hires Vocational Rehabilitation Recipients Qualified Food Stamp Recipients (at least 18 and not yet 25 years of age) Supplemental Security Income (SSI) Recipients Ex-felons Employers could earn a tax credit up to $2,400 for each WOTC-certified person hired. Employers hiring long-term TANF recipients  individuals who received TANF for 18 consecutive months before the time of hire  are eligible for the federal Welfare-to-Work (WtW) tax credit. The credit is worth $8,500 over a two-year period.  SPECIAL EMPLOYMENT SERVICES Services provided by the Special Employment Services Program include employment counseling, services to special customer groups, and testing. Staff offers employment counseling services at DoES offices to a broad range of customers including UI claimants, dislocated workers, youth, older workers, and social services recipients. Delivery methods for employment counseling to DoES customers include group counseling and group guidance, as well as individual counseling. Parole Vocational Rehabilitation Services (PVRS) is a contract program that finds jobs for ex-offenders who have been referred by the Division of Parole. Now in its 14th year, the PVRS program continues to exceed job entry performance goals. During Program Year 2000, 514 parolees from the five boroughs of New York City and three cities in Westchester County entered full-time competitive employment.  TESTING UNIT The Testing Unit supports occupational testing and assessment services offered by the Labor Department to individuals, employers and union Joint Apprenticeship Councils (JACs). In Program Year 2000 (July 1, 2000 to June 30, 2001) the department gave more than 8,000 tests, including VIP assessments used in group and individual counseling, Specific Aptitude Test Batteries (SATBs) used for selection by employers and JACs, the Basic Occupational Literacy Test (BOLT) and various interest measures.  WORKERS WITH DISABILITIES TAX CREDIT (WETC) The Workers with Disabilities Tax Credit (WETC) enables employers to earn a tax credit of $2,100 for each qualified individual hired. WETC is New York State's initiative to assist the disabled in securing employment. To qualify for the credit, an employee must meet the eligibility requirements for certification under the Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) program as a vocational rehabilitation referral, and be certified by the New York State Education Department's Office of Vocational and Educational Services for Individuals with Disabilities 6  VETERANS PROGRAM The Veterans Program provides preferential employment services to military veterans, giving priority to the needs of disabled veterans and veterans of   2001 Annual Report  the Vietnam era, as mandated by Title 38 of the United States Code. The Disabled Veterans Outreach Program Specialist/Local Veterans Employment Representative Program provides direct services to veterans statewide. The department offers assistance via the Transition Assistance Program, Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment Program, in cooperation with our Workforce Investment Act partners and through individual interviews and appointments. The Veterans Bill of Rights describes New York State's commitment to employment services for veterans and reflects priority in training opportunities for veterans. Veterans who come into a Community Service Center or local office receive a Veterans Bill of Rights Wallet Card outlining the law. The Veteran's Employer Hotline, 1-800-342-3358, refers military job seekers to employment services, provides information on veterans' issues to employers and refers employers to the Department to list job openings. Program Accomplishments in 2001: Throughout the Year 2001 New York State Department of Labor Veteran Staff have been actively involved in six Homeless Veterans Stand-Downs located throughout the state. Approximately 1,500 homeless and ""at risk"" of being homeless veterans and their families were provided extensive services such as necessary clothing, food, employment opportunities, medical screening and legal assistance. The Governor 's Program to hire workers with disabilities (Title 55B/C Program) continues, especially in the Title 55C Program, which helps disabled veterans obtain gainful employment with various state agencies within New York. In 2001, 30 veterans obtained gainful employment through the 55c program with the assistance of New York State's Disabled Veterans' Outreach Program staff (DVOPS) and Local Veterans' Employment Representatives (LVERS). On December 6, 2001, the Fort Drum Transition Assistance Program (TAP) was recognized for excellence in performance to our nation's veterans and received the Governor's Award for outstanding contributions to our men and women who are separating from military service. It also marked the 10th Anniversary of partnership between the New York State Department of Labor and the Department of Defense Transition Assistance Program at Fort Drum.  Program Activity: During Program Year (PY)-2000, which ended June 30, 2001, the Department of Labor through all WagnerPeyser Staff tallied 33,565 employments for veterans. Of these, the DVOP and LVER staff was responsible for 13,057 or 39%. The total figure of 33,565 represented a banner year for the department, resulting in the highest employment numbers accomplished over the last four years. So far during PY-2001, which began July 1, 2001, the department has entered 3,464 employments. The DVOP and LVER staff accomplished 2,837 or 82% of those entered employments. The ""Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment Program,"" or VR&E, provides Chapter 31 disabled veterans with prioritized case management services for an individual employment assistance plan with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Currently, we have two formal MOUs between the department and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Regional Office, to serve Chapter 31 participants. At the end of 2001, through efforts of the DVOP and LVER staff, we accomplished 108 placements of disabled veterans who completed their vocational training and were referred for intensive placement services.  SOCIAL SECURITY GRANT The purpose of the research and demonstration project, currently called New York WORKS, is to provide work incentives and remove barriers to employment for persons with disabilities, as well as to influence state and federal policy. Project efforts aim to significantly increase the number of persons with disabilities who enter or re-enter the workforce and become more self-sufficient. Work is seen as a vehicle to recovery. Pilot sites are located in New York City and Buffalo. To date, 29,611 letters of invitation to join the project have been sent to SSI and SSDI recipients and beneficiaries. Nearly 260 participants have been assigned to the fullservice treatment group, while 249 have been assigned to enhanced services. Full-service participants receive benefits advice, as well as vocational case management. Enhanced-services participants receive only benefits advice. Among participants in New York City, 30% are currently employed. Among participants in Buffalo, 44% are employed. In New York City, part of the New York WORKS staff is co-located in the Jamaica, Queens OneStop Career Center. An objective of the project is to learn  7   New York State Department of Labor  how to more effectively serve persons with disabilities through the One-Stop Career System, utilizing the resources and expertise of many community and state partners.  B. UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE DIVISION The Unemployment Insurance Division administers the State Unemployment Insurance Law, including both the unemployment insurance benefit payment program and the unemployment tax program. The Unemployment Insurance Program assists eligible workers who become unemployed through no fault of their own by providing weekly unemployment insurance benefit payments to partially offset the loss of income while seeking new employment. Under the program, eligible persons file an initial claim for benefits and certify weekly during their eligibility period to collect benefits. Eligibility for continuation of benefits is verified with the claimant on a periodic basis throughout the benefit period. The benefit portion of the program is financed through an employer payroll tax. Currently the tax is applied to the first $8,500 in wages paid by the employer for each covered employee. The tax rate varies according to the employer 's past experience in terms of taxes paid and benefits paid to former employees (experience rating). In addition to the normal contribution rate, employers are also assigned a subsidiary tax, depending on the balance of the general account and the size of fund index. Administrative costs for Unemployment Insurance are paid through the federal government from funds collected under the provisions of the Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA) paid by employers.  and Disaster Unemployment Assistance (DUA), and help speed benefits by expediting claims and resolving problems. There was also a team of central office staff reassigned to handle DUA claims. Staff implemented emergency procedures within days of the disaster. Presentations on DUA were made to numerous unions and governmental organizations; 4,855 applications were received for DUA benefits.  COMPLETED CONVERSION TO TELEPHONE CLAIMS During 2001, the department completed the conversion of the Unemployment Insurance program from in-person filing to the Telephone Claims Centers. The new filing system uses an Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system where claimants provide basic information by using a touch-tone telephone, after which the call is transferred to a claims specialist to clarify information and identify any problems. The TCCs have improved performance and met USDOL standards for First Payment Timeliness.  SINGLEFILE INITIATIVE SingleFile permits employers to submit quarterly reports for withholding tax, wage reporting and unemployment insurance purposes on one consolidated form and to submit one check. New employers are also able to register with both the Department of Labor and the Department of Taxation and Finance by providing information to either agency on the consolidated form. SingleFile has proven to be a savings to employers. It also helps to ensure that both agencies have the most upto-date information regarding the employer 's account and that unemployment insurance benefits are being charged to the correct employer 's account.  WORLD TRADE CENTER DISASTER Following the World Trade Center disaster, there was a tremendous increase in new claims for unemployment benefits. The department has maintained service levels despite this increase, by shifting priorities and by electronically moving NYC claims to the upstate call centers. Special services provided to employers affected by the attack included extension of reporting deadlines, waiving interest and on-line access to information and address change forms. Over 7,000 employers have notified DOL that they were affected by the disaster. More than 105,000 people filed claims against 6,200 disaster-affected employers. The department stationed UI staff at the 140 Worth St. Disaster Relief Center to help workers apply for UI 8  C. WELFARE-TO-WORK DIVISION The Welfare-To-Work Division is responsible for oversight of state and local Welfare-To-Work (WTW) programs under the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families Program (TANF), the Food Stamp Employment and Training Program (FSET), the Welfare-To-Work Block Grant Program and the Safety Net Program. Oversight includes policy development, technical assistance to local social services districts and provider agencies, contract development and monitoring. Operation of WTW programs remains the responsibility of local social services districts and the New York City Human Resources Administration.   2001 Annual Report  INDIVIDUAL VOCATIONAL EDUCATION AND SKILLS TRAINING (InVEST) The InVEST program can train individuals to get a job or upgrade the skills of workers to help them earn higher wages. Employers and training organizations prepare unemployed and underemployed TANF recipients and the ""200% of poverty"" population for jobs that are in demand within the local labor market. Local Workforce Investment Boards can help employers complete the necessary paperwork to participate in the program. As of January 2002, the Department of Labor has received over $100 million in funding requests. Awards have been made to 184 organizations, covering over 562 programs. InVEST has supported a wide range of industry clusters including health care, services, technology, manufacturing and office and clerical support. The InVEST initiative has provided job training and placement to over 5,000 New Yorkers and has the highest average wage, at placement, of any of the State's Welfare-To-Work (WTW) programs.  COMMUNITY SOLUTIONS FOR TRANSPORTATION (CST) This program encourages counties and regional areas to collaborate on efforts to develop transportation solutions that fill the unmet employment-related needs of persons eligible for federal TANF services, so they can find and keep jobs. In 2001, Governor Pataki announced grants totaling $24 million through CST to help individuals on public assistance obtain transportation so they can be more readily employed. CST funds were offered to the local social services districts by county using poverty data. Local districts and/or their contractors operate a variety of transportation projects. These include: transportation coordinators/mobility managers, driver training programs, car loan/donation programs, transit pass programs, van/shuttle services, guaranteed ride projects, and fixed route public transportation services. In total, over 150 individual transportation projects are supported with these funds.  BUILT ON PRIDE (BOP) THE WAGE SUBSIDY PROGRAM (WSP) This program provides wage subsidies to employers who hire and retain public assistance recipients and other low-income families who have not been successful in the labor market. This initiative engages the services of community-based organizations to recruit and place these individuals with private and public sector employers and reimburse participating employers for the wages and fringe benefits they have paid the new employees during the subsidy period. An RFP released in 2000 resulted in the creation of 50 WSP projects in 2001. These projects are expected to provide subsidized employment to approximately 6,400 participants. This effort is designed to increase the number of eligible economically disadvantaged individuals who enter the skilled trades. The three components of Built on Pride are Self-Sufficiency Training, Pre-Apprenticeship and Apprenticeship Training. Following the release of the RFP in late 2000, nine programs were selected to operate projects beginning March 1, 2001. These programs will serve a total of 1,740 individuals and help at least 1,038 individuals into registered apprenticeship positions.  CONSOLIDATED APPLICATION FOR STATE ADMINISTERED PROGRAMS (CASP) For the fifth consecutive year, the division helped local social services districts complete the application and planning process for $103.6 million in New York Works Block Grant funding. This funding is used to expand the WTW programs, services and activities needed by Family Assistance recipients and other lowincome households to gain employment. CASP gives local districts the flexibility to direct these resources to best meet the education, training and employment needs of their target populations.  WHEELS FOR WORK Demonstration projects help TANF-eligible participants obtain vehicles necessary for transportation to and from employment or other allowable work activities. Governor Pataki announced more than $5 million in grants to 23 organizations to operate Wheels for Work projects beginning in 2001. These programs are expected to provide a number of transportation-related services ranging from automobile insurance assistance, affordable car loans, donated cars, driver's education, vehicle registration assistance, vehicle repair assistance, and other forms of transportation support provided to eliminate each participant's transportation barriers. Wheels for Work demonstration projects are expected to serve at least 2,170 participants over the two-year project period.  TEEN WORKS This program helps at-risk high school students from low-income and Family Assistance families improve academic performance, remain in school through graduation, and develop necessary job skills. Teen Works programs supply services to participating youths 9   New York State Department of Labor  that include mentoring, tutoring, work experience and long-term guidance in coping successfully with school, work, and social situations. An RFP released in the summer of 2000 led to the selection of three organizations to operate Teen Works projects from 2001 through 2004. These programs are expected to assist a total of 2,153 at-risk youths over three years.  to serve over 2,000 families. Projects began in September 2001 and will end in August of 2003. In addition to family and workplace literacy, program components include adult basic education, GED preparation, English as a Second Language, Even Start, parenting skills.  BRIDGE The division is working with the University Center for Academic and Workforce Development of the State University of New York System Administration in continuing the Bridge Program for the tenth year. Bridge programs operate in selected Educational Opportunity Centers and Community Colleges, and offer TANFeligible individuals work-based training employment and post-employment services. This program served 10,691 people in 2001.  EDGE PLUS ENGLISH LANGUAGE INSTRUCTION (ELI) English language instruction is offered to Limited English Proficient (LEP) individuals. There are 26 agencies that will serve over 7,000 families. A total of $8 million was awarded. Projects began in July 2001 and are expected to end in June of 2002. Program components include ESOL, Basic Education in the Native Language (BENL), and Vocational English as a Second Language (VESL).  EDUCATION FOR GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT (EDGE) This program provides the pre- and post-employment activities that will help TANF recipients and those at or below 200% of poverty get and keep jobs. Division staff and representatives from the State Education Department developed, reviewed and approved plans submitted by local provider agencies from 45 counties. Program components include GED preparation, adult education, English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL), literacy and vocational/educational training. This program served 13,687 people in 2001.  WELFARE-TO-WORK (WTW) OPPORTUNITIES This program makes funding available to County Departments of Mental Health, community-based organizations and local workforce investment boards for innovative demonstration projects to help hard-to-serve WTW-eligible individuals become self-sufficient through employment and support services. There are 20 providers that will operate WTW Opportunities programs starting the last quarter of 2001. These programs are expected to serve approximately 3,100 eligible individuals in the one-year project period.  THE YOUTH PREPARATION INITIATIVE (YPI) Services are offered to help youth between the ages of 13-18 improve academic performance, remain in school, and develop skills needed to succeed in the workplace. The Alliance of Boys and Girls Clubs, Inc. was chosen to deliver services under YPI to 5,000 youth within 31 clubhouses across New York State. The project began on July 1, 2001.  THE EMPLOYMENT AGENCY INITIATIVE (EAI) The expertise of professional employment agencies is used to connect Family Assistance (FA) recipients with available jobs. The EAI contractors receive a fee each time they successfully place a candidate in a job. There are 12 employment agencies, which began serving 12 local districts in 2001. These projects may place up to 1,600 FA recipients in jobs.  FAMILY, ADULT AND WORKPLACE LITERACY (FAWL) This program expands existing literacy programs and creates new programs to help welfare recipients and other low-income households learn the basic skills and social/personal competence necessary to get jobs and be self-supporting. In 2001, Governor George E. Pataki awarded $5 million to nine agencies in seven counties 10  TEMPORARY ASSISTANCE FOR NEEDY FAMILIES (TANF) PROGRAM This program was established by Title I of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996. The Department of Health and Human Services administers the TANF program on the federal level. New York State receives about $2.4 billion in federal TANF funding annually since the program was created. The TANF program will require reauthorization in fiscal year 2002.   2001 Annual Report  TANF funds are used to support a variety of services for families including Temporary Assistance benefits and employment and training programs. The TANF program requires the state to achieve certain work participation rates for families receiving Temporary Assistance benefits. New York's TANF funds are used to provide employment and training services to Temporary Assistance recipients and families with incomes up to 200% of the federal poverty level. Families are limited to 60 months of TANF-funded Temporary Assistance benefits but are not limited in the length of time they may receive TANF funded employment services.  WELFARE-TO-WORK REGIONAL FORUMS These forums, instituted in 2001, convene local welfare-to-work providers to discuss employment issues and share promising practices. These forums have allowed division staff to relay department priorities and facilitate program improvement.  WELFARE-TO-WORK STAFF TRAINING Beginning in 2001, these intensive eight-day training sessions were provided to train social services district staff on welfare-to-work program policies, procedures and program practices. Additional training sessions were conducted including training for program providers on how to make eligibility determinations for TANF Services for families with incomes up to 200% of poverty.  FOOD STAMP EMPLOYMENT AND TRAINING (FSET) PROGRAM This effort is administered by the United States Department of Agriculture on the federal level. The FSET program, which is authorized by the Food Stamp Act, is designed to provide employment and training services to food stamp applicants and recipients.  WELFARE-TO-WORK BLOCK GRANT This program is administered by the United States Department of Labor at the federal level. New York State received $97 million in 1998 and $90 million in 1999 in federal funding to administer the program through September 2004. The grant is used to provide funds to local workforce investment areas throughout the state and other entities to provide ""work-first"" employment and training services to long-term TANF recipients, noncustodial parents of low-income children and others.  WELFARE-TO-WORK PROGRAM POLICY REVIEWS Reviews were conducted in each social services district to assess the extent to which local policies and procedures are consistent with department requirements. Reviews were completed related to both Temporary Assistance and Food Stamp programs.  D. WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AND TRAINING DIVISION The Workforce Development and Training Division oversees and administers a wide range of federal and state funded workforce preparation programs. Central to these efforts is the federally funded Workforce Investment Act (WIA) of 1998, which provides the framework for the national, state and local workforce preparation and employment system designed to meet the needs of business, job seekers and incumbent workers. In 2001, the department worked closely with the US Department of Labor to secure $25 million in National Emergency Grant funding. The federal grant is being used to provide support services and temporary jobs to workers who are temporarily or permanently affected by the September 11 disaster. The New York State Department of Labor is working with organizations in New York City under contract to provide dislocated worker services under WIA. Services will include instensive counseling and training services.  SAFETY NET PROGRAM Another aid program provides Temporary Assistance benefits and services to individuals not eligible for federal benefits, primarily those without children. The Department of Labor provides funds to social services districts and others to provide job placement and work programs for Safety Net recipients.  WELFARE-TO-WORK TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND TRAINING The Welfare-To-Work Division employs staff to serve as Technical Advisors to social services districts, local workforce investment areas and other providers of Welfare-to-Work programs. Additionally, the division provides formal staff training for social services districts to train local staff on welfare-to-work policies, procedures and program practices.  11   New York State Department of Labor  PROGRAM/PROJECT ACCOMPLISHMENTS WORKFORCE INVESTMENT ACT Implementation Update: State Workforce Investment Board (WIB) established and functioning. State Five-Year Plan developed, submitted, revised and approved by USDOL. 33 local Workforce Investment Areas established, certified and functioning with evolving local Workforce Investment systems. Local Workforce Investment Boards certified and functioning in all 33 local areas. Tentative Five-Year Local Plans submitted for all local Workforce Investment Areas. 17 local plans, including the required Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), have been fully approved; the rest are being finalized. Local One-Stop Centers are established and functioning, with at least one full-service Center operating in each of the 33 local areas. Through the end of this year, New York State had 62 full-service, comprehensive One-Stop Centers in operation. More are under development or planned for next year. While actual on-site partners will vary, each center will at least provide core services for all mandatory partner programs. Each center also will offer referrals to all services offered by the partner programs. Beyond comprehensive One-Stop Centers, the local workforce area system includes affiliate and satellite sites and electronic access points where customers can obtain core services via personal computers. Worked with the Division of Research & Statistics to develop the WIA Annual Report for program year 2000. Developed information on state and local accomplishments, statistical information and examples of best practices (both state and local) for the report.  ONE-STOP OPERATOR STATE CERTIFICATION PROCESS The Workforce Development & Training Division, in consultation with the New York State Workforce  Investment Board, developed a ""Guide to Certifying One-Stop Operators."" This guide outlines the critical elements for consideration when developing a local OneStop Operator Certification process. The guide also points out areas of concentration the State Workforce Investment Board will consider in awarding State Certification to local One-Stop System or Center Operators. The guide includes examples of other chartering or certification processes used around the country that local areas might emulate. Each local WIB must establish a one-stop operator certification process before applying for State-level certification. In addition, the local WIB must have a written agreement with each one-stop operator in the local system. This written agreement provides a basis for accountability, clarifies roles and responsibilities, and promotes inclusion of partners and integration of services. Consistent with the WIA principles of universal access, customer choice, increased accountability, and strong private sector involvement, the local certification process also should advance quality improvement methods, customer satisfaction measures, and staff development. The local certification process also must include provisions for an on-site review. This review gives the local board an opportunity to validate information provided in the operator 's application and ask questions that may arise after review of the written material. Once local certification has been awarded, the local WIB must sign a written agreement with each certified One-Stop Operator. State-level certification will use the local quality standards and criteria as its foundation. In addition to a paper review, State-level site visit teams will verify required elements, partner involvement, service integration and other quality indicators. If any elements are missing or inadequate, feedback and technical assistance will be provided to help the operator obtain State certification. State certification will be valid for two years. Local WIBs may apply for re-certification on behalf of their operators six months prior to expiration. State-level certification will be required for participation in future WIA Governor 's discretionary funded RFPs/RFAs. At the end of 2001, six applications were in various stages of review. Site visits were completed in three of these areas with State certification granted to one area and State certification pending additional action or paperwork in the other areas. Requests for certification are expected to increase dramatically during the early part of 2002.  12   2001 Annual Report  WORKFORCE NEW YORK LOGO The Workforce Development & Training Division, with the New York Association of Training and Employment Professionals, commissioned the development of a logo, tagline and other marketing materials for the State's workforce development system. Only State-certified operators may use the ""Workforce New York"" statewide one-stop logo, marketing campaign and promotional materials. This ""branding"" of New York's one-stop system will identify local systems and centers that have attained State certification as meeting the highest quality standards for workforce development services in their community. State-certified operators will enjoy the benefits of brand recognition and can customize marketing products to add their own area/center moniker and logo. The department has a web site dedicated to worforce development issues at www.workforcenewyork.org. It offers links to information on funding, WIA implementation, technical assistance, a calendar of events and other valuable data.  CAPACITY BUILDING/TRAINING New York Association of Training and Employment Professionals (NYATEP)  Through their contract with NYSDOL, NYATEP has provided 15 days of consultant training on topics such as: Successful One-Stop Strategies; Satisfying Your Customers; Partners in Performance; Marketing 101, etc. In addition, the department jointly held the spring (May 2001- approximately 500 in attendance) and fall (October 2001  approximately 480 in attendance) Workforce Development Conferences and the OneStop Institutes (March and November 2001  approximately 230 attendees at each Institute). An interagency workgroup was established that produced the Customer Flow Toolkit. Training on use of the Toolkit was held in Newburgh, Rochester and Utica during December 2001 and in Huntington, Long Island and Albany in January 2002. Local area teams participated, with 35-40 participants at each site. Center for Workforce Learning (CWL)  In November, CWL presented One-Stop Operator Certification training for review team members and secret shoppers. Participants on the team include state agency partners (Advocate for the Disabled, Office for the Aging, Empire State Development), a State Board member and DOL staff representing Workforce Development, Employment Services, Welfare-to-Work and Research (Labor Market Analysts). The Tompkins Workforce Investment Area was the first to apply and have its local certification process approved at the State level. It is anticipated that the stream of applications and review requests will intensify in early 2002. Technical Assistance and Training Corporation (TATC)  This contract will provide statewide customer satisfaction training for line staff; research and compilation of promising practices; and two or more days of consulting work with each of the 33 local Workforce Investment Areas. Promising Practices Incentive RFA  This RFA invites local WIBs to apply for incentive awards of up to $50,000 for innovative, results-based promising practices in five categories: Community Investment (e.g., for worker training activities that lead to business attraction and/or retention)  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE Created the local One-Stop System Resource Matrices to offer partner program funding data to each of the local workforce investment areas. Provided one-on-one WIA financial management training to LWIA fiscal managers and developed/provided fiscal manager training at the Fall NYATEP session. Provided extensive technical assistance to local WIAs to develop first year MOUs and cost allocation plans. Developed a Power Point presentation on USDOL/ETA financial management technical assistance group. Will provide this training at six regional sessions around the state in January 2002. Developed a new Customer Flow Toolkit, updated the existing Youth Resource Pack and OneStop System Building Toolkit. Developed Q&As on workforce development issues such as Dislocated Workers, Local Board Policies for On The Job Training & Customized Training, Governance Issues for Local Workforce Boards, and others.  13   New York State Department of Labor  Business Services in the One-Stop System Local Board Development/Practices One-Stop Partner Initiatives Performance/Customer Satisfaction Workforce Development Consultants RFP This is a Request for Proposals to secure the services of individual consultants who can help the New York State Department of Labor (NYSDOL) provide: curriculum design and delivery, train-the-trainer, facilitation and other capacity-building activities throughout the state. These activities will help New York State workforce development professionals to: deliver excellent service to businesses and jobseeking customers successfully carry out their roles as members of the One-Stop Career Center System successfully implement all aspects of the Workforce Investment Act (WIA) Successful bidders will design and deliver services directly to NYSDOL staff and its customers. NYSDOL's customers are defined as state and local workforce development professionals, service providers, state and local Workforce Investment Board members; federal, state and local government agency partners; community-based organizations; and, others considered by NYSDOL to be members of the workforce development community.  WIA GOVERNOR'S DISCRETIONARY PROJECTS High Tech RFA During 2001, the Workforce Development & Training Division, on behalf of the State Board, developed a Request for Applications targeting the high-tech training needs of businesses across the state. It awarded more than $15 million to 28 organizations throughout New York State to train workers in high-tech careers. The awards will benefit 4,000 workers statewide. They will help workers keep pace with rapidly changing technologies while helping businesses retain their current workforce, increase wages and reinforce efforts to attract new high-tech talent to New York State. Recipients are small, medium or large businesses, or business consortia that employ high-tech workers in high-demand occupations. The applicants must be headquartered or have at least one physical location in New York State. The grant award can be used to train current workers or new hires. Under the grant program, workers will receive training in a variety of high-tech careers such as CAD developer, systems engineer, web developer, Java script writer, system architect, NT system administrator, data communication engineer, Unix programmer and computer engineer. Manufacturers RFA During 2001, the Workforce Development & Training Division, acting on behalf of the State Board, developed a Request for Applications for training current and newly hired workers for demand jobs in the Manufacturing Industry in New York State. It awarded $15.6 million to 83 manufacturers and organizations throughout New York State to provide needed training to their employees. The grants will help manufacturing businesses ensure that their employees are provided with the opportunity to keep up with the latest developments in information technologies, processes and innovations. The funding will provide training to more than 35,000 workers. Recipients are small, medium or large manufacturing businesses or business consortia that employ workers in occupations that currently have a high demand in the marketplace. All businesses represented in a business consortia must be headquartered or have at least one branch of each represented business physically located in New York State. All funds awarded must be expended on workers at facilities in New York State. In addition to training initiatives, proposals that address changes in work processes were also considered, such as the  STATE BOARD ACTIVITIES In 2001, the New York State Workforce Investment Board met regularly, usually on a bimonthly basis. The State Board articulated its mission to develop a statewide system that produces a workforce with the skills to maintain and enhance the state's economy. This system encompasses the education/career preparation of the emerging worker, workforce development and worker enhancement for the incumbent and transitional worker. The State Board agreed to establish four Board committees: Emerging Workers, Incumbent Workers, Transitional Workers and Local Workforce Investment Board Liaisons. Each committee is co-chaired by one business and one public sector board member. These committees met during the past year to identify issues affecting their target group and discuss ways that the State Board can help to address those needs through policy guidance and the targeted use of Governor 's discretionary funds.  14   2001 Annual Report  introduction of lean manufacturing. These changes could lead to increased productivity, thereby helping manufacturers facing a worker shortage or aging workforce. Skills Shortage Assessment RFA During 2001, the Workforce Development & Training Division, acting on behalf of the State Board, developed a Request for Applications to local workforce investment areas across New York State to assess local critical occupational/skill shortages and to develop methods to monitor this information. The aims of this project were: To enhance local planning by raising policy questions that local boards must address in shaping their local workforce systems; To review information on the local labor market and identify information gaps; To identify the occupational and skills needs of local businesses; To establish methods to regularly collect skills needs requests. Local workforce investment areas each were awarded $25,000 to undertake this project. They will offer local data on skills shortages to the State Workforce Investment Board to help identify state-level policy and/ or additional funding needs. Local boards were also to prioritize their most critical local skill shortages and target industries for public resources. A second phase of this project will provide additional resources for those identified skill shortages. Youth Incentive Grants for Businesses RFP In 2001, the division worked through the Emerging Worker Sub-Committee of the State Workforce Investment Board on a Request for Proposals to foster innovative local partnerships that expose youth to realworld occupations and employment experiences. This RFP adheres to the mission statement of ensuring that all New York's youth are better prepared for employment by giving them a greater array of potential career opportunities, including current demand occupations. An effective way to fulfill this commitment is to create opportunities for cooperation among employers and employer associations, the educational community, and the local Workforce Investment Boards (LWIBs) and Youth Councils. The RFP emphasizes exposing WIA-eligible youth and professionals who guide job and career decisions in  young people (i.e., school counselors and teachers) to demand occupations in New York State. The proposed program activities would offer real-world work experiences, including employment and job retention for at least 6 months, leading to the attainment of a secondary education diploma (Regents, local, IEP or GED), gainful employment, entrance into the military, and/or enrollment in post-secondary education. Through their relationships with businesses (or business consortia), teachers will learn what employers want from workers and the skills needed to succeed in demand occupations. Awards totaling $1.29 million were made to six organizations to establish innovative programs that expose youth to meaningful employment and career opportunities. One-Stop Implementation Grants: During 2001, the Workforce Development & Training Division continued to implement and monitor grants to local areas under the One-Stop Career Center Implementation Grant Program. Round One awards were closed out while Round Two and Three awardees continued to use funding to foster service consolidation/ integration, expand existing services, enhance universal access and establish/support area-wide technology infrastructure. Funding continued to be used by awardees to meet their needs for office renovations, office equipment, furniture, technology and supplies to help create and further develop One-Stop Centers in their local workforce areas. Round Two Awards were made to 13 local workforce areas and totaled $3,761,241. Round Three Awards were made to an additional 13 local areas and totaled $3,799,579. The division continued to review and approve contract proposals and contract modifications as well as request federal pre-approval for any equipment expenditures over $5,000. The division continued to closely monitor contract expenditures to ensure proper and full use of funds is occurring. Reviews were completed on many of the One-Stop Demo and Implementation grants. America's Service Locator/Toll Free Help Line: Under a grant awarded by the USDOL to NYSDOL, the Workforce Development & Training Division continues to provide and update data on its various workforce development programs and service sites for the National Toll-Free Help Line. During this past year, the Toll-Free Help Line database, which contained state and local level workforce information, was transitioned over into the new America's Service Locator (ASL). The  15   New York State Department of Labor  ASL database, which is part of America's Career Kit, is operated and maintained by the USDOL in partnership with the states. During 2001, the division updated location, contact and services information for all of the comprehensive OneStop Centers across the state, as well as all remaining Employment Service Offices, which serve as affiliate sites in the new One-Stop system. Funds from this grant also were used to support marketing efforts for the State's new workforce system logo, tagline, and other materials, which incorporate the use of the Toll-Free Help Line.  Employee Stock Option Purchase Shared Work Program Solicitation of Buyer through Economic Development Partners During the past year, layoff aversion grants totaling over $3.4 million were awarded to seven companies located in six local workforce investment areas. This money is being used to retrain existing workers in new product lines/production techniques and help prevent the layoff of over 2,700 employees.  RAPID RESPONSE/LAYOFF AVERSION ACTIVITIES The division developed New York State's Rapid Response and Business Retention Plan, which combines both structural and visionary elements. Many of the items related to service delivery reflect successful fieldtested techniques. Other elements, such as the development of the business retention network, are new and must be evaluated. The statutory requirements of Rapid Response under the Workforce Investment Act are very similar to those under the Job Training Partnership Act. The Department of Labor, in collaboration with state/local partners, is placing an increased focus on averting layoffs, developing a business retention network and upgrading training efforts to help workers find or keep a job. One activity identified under Title I of the Workforce Investment Act is to assess the potential for averting layoff(s), in consultation with State or local economic development agencies. In New York State, Regional Rapid Response teams provide services tailored to the needs of the affected businesses and employees. Team members collaborate to help dislocated workers find jobs and develop strategies to avert layoffs within the local community. Funds for layoff aversion/business retention programs are available through the New York State Department of Labor. A comprehensive layoff aversion plan must be developed in consultation with the department's Regional Administrator. Plan strategies include: Evaluating Employee Skills Using Labor/Management Committees Upgrading Worker Training/Skills Customized Training/On-the-Job Training  STATE PROGRAMS STRATEGIC TRAINING ALLIANCE PROGRAM (STRAP) The State 1999-2000 Legislative budget appropriated $34,000,000 over three years for the Strategic Training Alliance Program (STRAP). To implement the STRAP program, the Department of Labor and Empire State Development Corporation developed a streamlined process that would allow a business to meet its training needs in real time. A referral process allows both agencies to review the project concept before application submittal. The notice of STRAP funding availability appeared in the New York State Contract Reporter on April 5, 2000. During referral reviews, staff from DOL might offer recommendations on appropriate funding sources. Also, the Workforce Investment Act provides leverage for local formula funds. Through 2001, 151 awards were made to employers/ consortia to train almost 17,500 new and existing employees, creating over 5,000 new jobs in the process. Both agencies have identified training needs common to certain industry sectors and are contacting community colleges to help build a consortium base. This will be a focus for both agencies in the upcoming year.  YOUTH EDUCATION EMPLOYMENT TRAINING PROGRAM (YEETP) During 2000-01 the YEETP continued its primary focus: to help youth gain the knowledge, skills and abilities that will help them make sound career, educational and employment choices. Each of the four program models, AVE, PAVE, ACHIEVE and YWS offered different paths to help transition youth from school to either work or further education.  16   2001 Annual Report  Due to a one-year only increase in the YEETP allocation, $1,000,000 was allocated to purchase computers and for bonus incentives. Based on this, two major enhancements were implemented. The first was the Internet version of CareerZone, which is a free career exploration and planning system designed by NYSDOL. It offers the most up-to-date labor market and career information for over 900 occupations. All YEETP contractors were given an additional $10,000 to purchase computers/ software in order to implement CareerZone. The second enhancement was the design and development of the new YEETP database. The database is a paperless system that provides real data, reduces errors and is directly input by the program operators. The database will replace the old Management Information System. All of the YEETP's began using the new system in 2001.  other areas throughout New York State. The planned enrollment for ACHIEVE was 520 participants; the program served 545 participants. The ACHIEVE sites are required to meet performance standards in the following areas: reading, math, vocational skills, education, and vocational training and unsubsidized employment.  YOUTH WORK SKILLS (YWS) The YWS program was implemented at 6 sites: 2 in the New York City area and 4 in other areas throughout New York State. The planned enrollment for YWS was 170 participants; the program served 193 participants. The YWS sites are required to meet performance standards in the following areas: reading, math, vocational skills, education, and vocational training and unsubsidized employment.  IN-SCHOOL YOUTH PROGRAMS JOBS FOR YOUTH TRAINING PROGRAM ADOLESCENT VOCATIONAL EXPLORATION (AVE) The AVE program was implemented at 17 sites: 10 in the New York City/Long Island area and 7 in other areas throughout New York State. The planned enrollment for AVE was 680 participants; the program served 704 participants. The AVE sites are required to meet performance standards in the following areas: reading, math, State Education Department (SED) evaluation, academic credit and remain in school. The Jobs for Youth Training Programs provided a range of career exploration, skills training, and educational and supportive services to 285 at-risk youth in seven programs across the state in Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse, Brooklyn, Bronx, Manhattan, and Queens. The program is a progressive two-year cycle, with 182 year one participants and 103 year two participants in the 2000-2001 program year. One of the most significant accomplishments of the program is the excellent job they did helping at-risk participants to remain in school and remain in the program: 55 participants earned their High School Diplomas or GEDs. 81 participants were placed in unsubsidized employment and 54 participants entered college or post-secondary training.  PROGRESSIVE ADOLESCENT VOCATIONAL EXPLORATION (PAVE) The PAVE program was implemented at 22 sites: 13 in the New York City/Long Island area and 9 in other areas throughout New York State. The planned enrollment for PAVE was 1,050 participants; the program served 974 participants. The PAVE sites are required to meet performance standards in the following areas: reading, math, State Education Department (SED) evaluation, academic credit and remain in school.  HEALTH CARE WORKER TRAINING PROGRAM The Health Care Worker Training Program is a small, one-year demonstration program that provides innovative and cooperative approaches to meet critical unmet shortages and personnel needs in the health care industry. Two programs funded in the 2000-2001 program year are not yet completed. One retention demonstration is providing training in Creating a Complimentary Healing Environment to 110 participants and the other cooperative state-wide demonstration program is providing Nurse Telephone Triage 17  OUT-OF-SCHOOL YOUTH PROGRAMS ANOTHER CHANCE INITIATIVE FOR EDUCATION, VOCATION OR EMPLOYMENT (ACHIEVE) The ACHIEVE program was implemented at 16 sites: 7 in the New York City/Long Island area and 9 in   New York State Department of Labor  training to some 1,000 participants who work in community rehabilitation facilities across the state.  CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OJT PROGRAM The New York State Chamber of Commerce Onthe-Job Training (OJT) program has operated for more than 25 years. All New York State businesses can participate if they can offer the trainee long-term employment in an occupation that is sufficiently skilled and in-demand. The program targets Unemployment Insurance recipients, economically disadvantaged individuals, and veterans, as those most in need of training. The following Chambers of Commerce were each awarded $104,728 in 2000 and 2001: Albany-Colonie Regional, Jamaica, Greater Olean, Inc., Plattsburgh, Poughkeepsie, Saratoga, and City of Yonkers. All Chamber programs met or exceeded the minimum standards for both outcome and operational performance. Achievements include: more than 150 businesses got financial assistance enabling them to hire and train some 250 individuals over 80% of the trainees were UI recipients, economically disadvantaged or veterans of the trainees who successfully completed the program, nearly 80% were retained in their jobs for 30 days or longer businesses participating in Chamber OJT programs created more than 180 new jobs in local areas throughout the state  A final analysis of programs in both June and September cycles and the Sr. program produced the following statistics: Planned Actual Average Enrollments 338 361 106% Placements 235 205 86% Completions 272 237 87% Returned to School 42 32 76%  DISPLACED HOMEMAKER PROGRAM Displaced Homemaker Centers have developed strong ties with local Departments of Social Services. Welfare recipients have difficulty re-entering the labor market similar to the traditional displaced homemaker. With minor program adaptations, local Displaced Homemaker Programs (DHP) are serving the needs of welfare recipients and assisting in the State's efforts toward welfare reform. Since its inception in 1978 as a 4-center pilot project, the Displaced Homemaker Program has provided vocationally related services to over 176,200 individuals. The most recent statistics show that in one year the Displaced Homemaker Centers served 8,279 individuals. Of these: 3,691 were minority group members 4,555 were on public assistance (TANF, Home Relief and Food Stamp) recipients 2,714 entered or upgraded employment in unsubsidized jobs received over 8,300 individual services to aid in gaining and retaining employment and over 20,000 services related to employment readiness. A program priority is to adapt program services to a displaced homemaker population that is less educated, less fluent in English, includes public assistance recipients and has more complex barriers to employment. Staff are spending significantly more time developing resources to help displaced homemakers with increasingly complex survival issues such as housing, childcare, and domestic violence.  GREEN TEAMS The Junior Green Team Program is a job placement program that focuses on environmental occupations for out-of-school youth ages 16-21. It provides tangible work experience in occupations broadly related to making the State of New York a more attractive place to live, work or visit. Under a ""school-to-work"" model, this experience is supplemented by relevant academic, preemployment skills training and supportive services. The goal of the Green Team program is to place participants into full-time jobs in occupations related to their work experience. Upon completion of the program, the participants' continued pursuit of their occupational goals through additional education is also considered a successful result. 18  HEALTH WORKER RETRAINING INITIATIVE The Health Worker Retraining Initiative (HWRI), administered by the New York State Department of Health in consultation with the Department of Labor, was established through HCRA 96 and HCRA 2000 legisla-   2001 Annual Report  tion to retrain and provide employment security for health industry workers who need new skills due to changes in the health care system. Marketplace changes have caused re-organization of services and re-design of jobs for industry workers. HWRI competitive funding supports retraining of eligible health workers to assist in transition to jobs both within and outside the health industry. Through a Memorandum of Understanding with DOH, the Department of Labor provides fiscal and outcome monitoring and support. According to the Department of Health, HCRA 96 cycles 1 and 2 awarded a total of $59,000,000 to retrain 32,000 workers. Many of these contracts will continue operating. $41,000,000 was awarded under HCRA 2000, Year One to train 25,000 workers. Year One cycle contracts are currently being executed. The Year Two RFP will be released in the near future and the focus will be to continue to prepare industry workers to meet constantly changing health industry needs.  II. PLANNING AND TECHNOLOGY A. PROGRAM TECHNOLOGY SUPPORT The Office of Program Technology Support (OPTS) consists of three units: Customer Support, Welfare to Work and Technology Management. The Customer Support and Welfare to Work units provide large-scale technology system support to the department's Employment Services (other than OSOS) and Welfare-to-Work programs. Representing the user needs of the program divisions, local offices and local social services departments, OPTS staff work with DOL Information Technology (IT) and Department of Family Assistance (DFA) staff and/or vendors to ensure new technology solutions and legacy systems meet business requirements including legislative and other mandates through development of business requirements and user specifications; and by conducting user tests, monitoring implementation and preparing reports and instructions for the established systems. The Technology Management unit provides services in the use of technology including: Facilitating the department's transition to a PC/ server-based environment. Managing the request, procurement and installation of IT equipment, software and services. Providing IT desktop and technical support to department employees. Managing the department's IT assets. Developing the department's web pages (Internet and Intranet). Overseeing the department's mail and finishing operations. After the events of September 11, 2001, Planning and Technology activities helped the Department of Labor to respond quickly and effectively. These were mostly operational efforts, which are not identified below, but they required extensive resources and time commitments.  APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM There were approximately 24,394 apprentices active in the New York State Apprenticeship Training Program in 2001, up nearly 1% from 2000. The percentage of women among the total number of active apprentices was 5.7%, which equals 1,393 women apprentices. The percentage of minority apprentices was 31.7%, broken down as follows: Blacks Hispanics Asian & Pacific Islanders Native Americans 4,274 2,973 241 245  In 2001, the Apprenticeship Training Central Office operation enhanced the automated systems needed to conduct background investigations on potential program sponsors via access of the Lexis/ Nexis online database search vehicle. This provides the ability to retrieve information that may not have been disclosed on an application but is critical to the approval decision process. The Apprenticeship Training Central Office upgraded its data reporting system from mainframe to a client-server mode to provide more efficient and effective data management and reporting. Central and field staff can directly access information and statistics relating to programs and apprentices.  19   New York State Department of Labor  B. LABOR PLANNING AND POLICY DEVELOPMENT DIVISION The Division of Labor Planning and Policy Development (LPPD) coordinates Department of Labor policy, planning and operations, and provides support to agency program and administrative units to ensure that the department accomplishes its mission in an effective and efficient manner. LPPD has separate units covering Unemployment Insurance, Worker Protection, Employment and Training and Administrative Policies and Procedures. LPPD's responsibilities include: Assisting the Commissioner and other department management in the development, analysis and implementation of state and federal legislative and policy initiatives, changes and other priorities. Reviewing agency structure, programs and staffing in the context of changing mandates, needs and funding constraints and recommending/assisting in implementation of policies and programs to meet changing mandates and conditions. Playing a major role in designing, coordinating and implementing new systems throughout the development cycle, including group facilitation to derive high level requirements; identifying and analyzing business requirements; developing detailed user requirements; workflow analysis; considering application of latest technologies; user testing; monitoring implementation; providing users with technical assistance, written instructions and reports. Improving operations and internal communication through preparation and department-wide coordination of written and electronic information.  In 2001, all sections of the Planning and Technology staff worked on numerous projects and initiatives. They revised and modernized the department's web site and link to the State web site; established technical support structure with liaisons and key users statewide; instituted a Lexmark document distribution system for network and virus alerts; implemented the One-Stop Operating System in all Employment Services offices; released the Welfare-to-Work Participant report to local social services districts; installed the Workforce Investment Act cash system that allows Workforce Investment Boards to access funds to pay contractors; modified the UI benefits processing system to reflect year 200 reform legislation; designed, developed and installed a new Telephone Claims Center network; designed, developed and deployed an Internet application for filing UI initial claims; and expedited the processing of Disaster Unemployment Assistance through an Intranet client server system.  D. AMERICA'S JOB BANK America's Job Bank (AJB) is a computerized national job resource of the State public employment services. The AJB Service Center is the development and processing center operated by the New York State Department of Labor for USDOL. Originally, the job listings were available only through individual State-run networks that linked more than 1,800 local employment service offices. Since 1995, the service has been available on the Internet; one of the most popular job sites in cyberspace.  CAREGIVERS JOBS CLEARINGHOUSE ASSOCIATION SITE This association site is a collaborative effort of AJB, the U.S. Department of Labor (USDOL) and organizations representing the long-term health care industry. It provides a web site focused on occupations in the health care industry. Association sites use a common architecture and design, while allowing the association to provide input for a limited set of customizations. Association sites for six other entities are in various stages of implementation.  C. INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY The Information Technology Division's mission is to provide support to maintain and enhance the Labor Department's information systems. The division works with users and business analysts to develop and construct efficient systems to address the needs of the department and its customers and help resolve application issues through coordination with the Enterprise Help Desk. Staff also ensure that department technical standards are followed and updated as new technology is introduced.  20   2001 Annual Report  III. DIVISION OF RESEARCH AND STATISTICS The Division of Research and Statistics is the primary source of labor market information in New York State. The division administers required federal statistical programs  including programs related to wages, local area unemployment and occupational and industrial employment. Division staff tailor the data obtained through these federal programs in order to meet the needs of the department, elected officials, businesses, job seekers and others. Labor Market Information staff in Albany monitor the state's economic climate, and prepare periodic reports on the employment situation in the state and its regions. The division also maintains a network of local Labor Market Analysts in ten regions across New York State. These analysts provide localized information based on local surveys or gleaned through contacts with the area business community. Research and Statistics also supports department operations in a number of ways, such as evaluating departmental programs and complying with federal reporting requirements including WIA, Unemployment Insurance programs, the UI Trust Fund, DoES and Welfare to Work.  department, but also assist local Workforce Investment Boards, area economic development officials, school personnel and others in need of labor market and careerrelated information.  UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE / EMPLOYMENT SERVICES The division continued to meet its federal and management reporting requirements on the activities of the New York State Unemployment Insurance and Employment Services programs. Staff developed actuarial reports on the status of the Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund. Additionally, division staff developed and provided prevailing wage data and expert testimony for the Unemployment Insurance Division as well as a variety of information tools to support the Division of Employment Services.  WORKFORCE INVESTMENT ACT (WIA) AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT Division staff provided continuing support to the State Workforce Investment Board and to the Workforce Development and Training Division. Staff provided economic data and analysis for state planning efforts and helped review plans and RFPs. The division conducted a series of workforce requirement surveys to elicit the skill needs and training requirements of area businesses. Staff worked with local Workforce Investment Boards to prepare and refine lists of demand occupations as well as an inventory of skills training requests and a database of Eligible Training Providers.  LABOR MARKET INFORMATION The division continued its long-term partnership with the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Employment and Training Administration in developing, analyzing and disseminating key local and statewide labor market statistics and economic data. Staff collected and provided monthly information on employment and unemployment, including jobs by industry, for the state, its labor areas and counties. Additionally, staff developed estimates of wages and employment by occupation for the state and selected areas, information on recently negotiated collective bargaining settlements, and annual estimates of occupational injuries and illnesses. The division also offered a new version of CareerZone, an online career information delivery system that features an updated electronic portfolio, interest assessment tools, information on New York colleges, and enhanced resources, including available job opportunities. The division maintained its network of local Labor Market Analysts, who serve as resources not only for the  WELFARE TO WORK The division continued to work with the Welfareto-Work Division to meet reporting requirements and assist in the design of reporting databases and management reporting needs.  WORKER PROTECTION The division provided information and technical support in a variety of areas, including the Survey of Occupational Injuries and Illnesses in the Public Sector, as well as research on minimum wage issues.  21   New York State Department of Labor  IV. WORKER PROTECTION A. DIVISION OF LABOR STANDARDS The Labor Department's Division of Labor Standards administers the New York State labor law concerning minimum wage, payment of wages and wage supplements, child labor, hours of work, migrant farm labor, industrial homework, record-keeping and conditions in the apparel manufacturing industry. In 2001, the Division of Labor Standards collected and distributed $6.5 million to 13,191 affected employees, including $1.8 million collected by the division's Apparel Industry Task Force for 4,834 employees. Staff also continued to enhance the Department of Labor homepage by adding Labor Standards documents including claim forms for unpaid wages, supplements, employer applications and posters. Bilingual Labor Standards staff assisted in Chinese, Korean, and Spanish translations of Department of Labor information on disaster relief for the September 11 attack, assisted in wage-related issues and helped distribute flyers and posters. Staff continued educational initiatives to employers, employer groups and associations on Labor Law compliance through speaking engagements and Labor Law seminars.  department has published the annual determination of prevailing rate schedules on the Internet, which allows New York State businesses and their employees to immediately obtain the most current prevailing rate information. This year for the first time, the department referred all parties to our web site for this information rather than print and mail out approximately 25,000 schedules on all active projects. This resulted in an estimated saving of $100,000 in printing costs. The enhanced web site also allows the department to communicate rapidly with the contracting community on any corrections or changes to the wage schedule. To make it even easier, corrections are posted to the web site the first business day of each month. This gives employers immediate and timely access to this information and saves them from having to constantly check the site for updates. Thanks to Governor Pataki's initiative, the Bureau was able to add 20 new investigator positions to enhance enforcement of Articles 8 & 9. This will further the goal of fair and effective enforcement. In a partnership with the Dormitory Authority of the State of New York (DASNY), a public work wage investigator in our NYC office was assigned to work full time on complaints filed against contractors on Dormitory Authority projects. This item is funded by DASNY and may become a prototype for future similar partnerships with other state agencies. Division of Labor Standards Data Establishments fined 4,655 Affected employees 13,191 Wages collected $6,525,628.00 Bureau of Public Work Data Cases opened 514 Cases closed 502 Money collected $7,147,719.34 Penalty imposed $440,860.63 Workers paid 3,197  B. BUREAU OF PUBLIC WORK The Labor Law requires contractors and subcontractors on public work projects to pay laborers, workers or mechanics employed in the performance of a public work contract not less than the prevailing rate of wage and supplements (fringe benefits) in the locality where the work is performed. The Bureau of Public Work is responsible for the administration of Articles 8 and 9 of the New York State Labor Law. Article 8 covers public construction and Article 9 covers building service contracts. The Labor Department issues wage schedules on a county-bycounty basis that contain minimum rates of pay for different work classifications. State law requires that these schedules be made part of all contracts between a government entity and a contractor. Restitution collected for workers in 2001 was in excess of $7 million. This is a record amount.  C. DIVISION OF SAFETY AND HEALTH (DOSH) The Division of Safety and Health is made up of units that perform a variety of tasks for the Labor Department. The Engineering Services Unit issues variances from various department Code Rules, approves window cleaning installations and provides engineering expertise to other Division of Safety and Health bureaus/units.  WEB SITE PUBLICATION The Commissioner of Labor is required to make an annual determination of the prevailing wage rates. The 22   2001 Annual Report  Engineering Staff reviewed and approved 21 applications for power-operated windowcleaning installations in New York City. This number represents a 100% increase in the number of approvals granted in 2000. The Licensing and Certification Unit issues licenses to companies involved with explosives and asbestos removal and issues certificates to asbestos handlers, individuals working with explosives, crane operators and workplace safety and health consultants. Staff conducted practical exams for some 245 temporary Line Truck Crane Operators, enabling them to receive their permanent Crane Operator Certificates of Competence. The Radiological Health Unit regulates commercial and industrial uses of radioactive materials and machine sources of radiation for the protection of employees and the public. The unit continues its policy of rewarding companies that have good radiation safety compliance histories with an exemption from a periodic inspection. The unit issued licenses for two relatively new business operations within the Capital District Region of the State. Two cyclotron facilities, which manufacture and distribute Positron Emission Tomography (PET), used for state-of-the-art diagnostic imaging for cancer, received their licenses for the use, manufacture and distribution of radioactive pharmaceuticals. The Public Employee Safety and Health Bureau oversees workplace protection of public employees at the state and local level. Protection guidelines are determined by standards set by the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration. The bureau also provides safety and health consultation services to public employers. During 2001, the bureau continued to implement the strategic plan for New York State. Last year, as a result of focused awareness and prevention/mitigation activities designed by the bureau, this effort resulted in the reduction of workplace injuries in the Heavy Construction Trade (by 8.3%), the Urban Rail Industry (by 37%), the Nursing and Veterans Home Industry (by 3.2%) and for fire fighters (by 16%). Collectively, this effort has resulted in a 16%  reduction in accidents & injuries for all four of these public employee worker categories. The Asbestos Control Bureau identifies hazards that affect the health and safety of the public during construction projects that disturb asbestos. Asbestos compliance conferences were conducted, which are designed to negotiate settlements with contractors found to be in violation of Code Rule 56. These conferences were held before a Department Hearing Officer and resulted in much quicker settlements of the violations. This pro-active effort has produced better compliance within the program. The Boiler Safety Bureau makes sure that high-pressure boilers are running safely and cost effectively. Almost 40,000 high- and low-pressure commercial boilers within the State were inspected. Boiler Safety Unit employees account for 18,105 inspections; the remaining 22,000 were conducted by the insurance industry. The On-Site Consultation Program provides quality safety and health assistance to businesses engaged in high hazard activities. The On-Site Consultation Program conducted over 1,300 visits to small and medium-sized business employers within the State. The visits were designed to assist employers in improving safety and health standards within their workplace. Emphasis was placed on providing assistance to employers in highhazard industries, such as construction, food processing, nursing homes, maritime and logging. The Industry Inspection Bureau has jurisdiction over ski tows and passenger tramways, places of public assembly (except New York City and other exempt communities), storage of explosives, amusement devices and temporary structures, coinoperated machines, aerial performers, glass doors, window cleaning devices, crane operators and elevators in factory and mercantile establishments. The Industry Inspection Bureau provided amusement ride operators with guidelines concerning new electrical requirements associated with Code Rule 45. Necessary training also was conducted for Safety and Health Inspectors.  23   New York State Department of Labor  The Mine Safety Training Program has been funded by the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration since 1981 and provides safety training to the Metal/Non-Metal Mining Industry of the state. The Workplace Safety and Loss Prevention Program was created in 1997 as a result of the New York State Employment Safety and Security Act of 1996. Under this legislation, employers that have payrolls in excess of $800,000 and an experience modification rating of over 1.2 must implement a safety and loss prevention program. The division developed Industrial Code Rule 59, establishing the standards necessary for certification as a Certified Safety and Loss Consultant. In addition, ICR 59 was placed on CD and distributed as necessary. The Occupational Safety and Health Training and Education Program (OSH T&E) supports a wide variety of training activities related to occupational safety and health for workers employed in New York State.  implemented safety plans by analyzing hospital reports issued on the nature of emergency worker injuries (cuts, eye irritations, limb injuries, etc); provided support to the State Agency Task Force that requested and received a $2.2 million federal grant for medical monitoring of employees involved in the response to the WTC; and, maintained a presence at the NYC Command Post to keep State and City officials apprised of the status of ongoing safety and health issues.  TECHNOLOGY ENHANCEMENTS Over the last few years, DOSH has obtained improved technology to support program requirements. The purchase and distribution of desktop and laptop computers to all staff who require them has improved our ability to communicate, track and distribute data electronically. The use of Personal Digital Assistants (Palm Pilots) has enhanced field inspection capabilities in the Boiler Safety Unit, where they are currently being tested. The addition of cell phones, pagers and hand-held radios aided the department's ability to provide a pro-active response to the World Trade Center incident, as well as a quicker response to normal day-to-day field activities.  WORLD TRADE CENTER RESPONSE Immediately following the news of the World Trade Center (WTC) incident, DOSH implemented a number of emergency readiness and response activities to ensure that necessary safety and health assistance was provided. Nearly 100 DOSH employees provided immediate support to New York State and City emergency responders. For example, DOSH: brokered the acquisition of a large quantity of respirators and other personal protective equipment; conducted respirator fit-testing for more than 20,000 responders; performed air quality sampling at selected buildings occupied by public employees; provided awareness information to public employee union officials; coordinated with building managers and contractors for inspection of power operated window-washing devices in lower Manhattan that may have sustained damage from the incident; provided necessary safety and health awareness information to public sector agencies and their response and recovery personnel;  V. OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL The Inspector General's Office provides investigative support for the state Attorney General's Office and for county district attorneys who will seek criminal prosecutions in unemployment insurance fraud cases. The bureau ensures the accuracy of unemployment insurance eligibility and monitors procedures at local offices. The office also performs internal audits and allocates the proper grants to families affected by natural disasters in New York State. The Inspector General's (IG) Office consists of the Investigations Section, UI Fraud Investigations, UI Fraud Prosecution, the Internal Audit Unit, the Internal Security Unit, the Contract Audit Unit, and Disaster Preparedness. The Investigations Section and the Internal Security Office cooperate to ensure the accuracy of unemployment insurance eligibility through a system of prevention, detection and investigation of fraud perpetrated against the Unemployment Insurance (UI) system. The IG investigators review allegations of impropriety or malfeasance by department employees, and assist the  24   2001 Annual Report  Investigations Section in larger examinations of mass unemployment insurance fraud. They also serve as support to the department's Office of Employee Relations during disciplinary proceedings. The IG Office is the department's liaison to all federal, state and local police agencies. The Internal Audit Unit assists Labor Department staff in the effective discharge of their responsibilities by focusing on management objectives relating to the reliability and integrity of information; compliance with policies, plans, procedures, laws and regulations; safeguarding assets; the economical and efficient use of resources; and meeting objectives and goals for the operation of programs. The department's Security Officers are responsible for the security of the department's facilities and employees. These collective units provide support for the county district attorneys who seek criminal prosecutions in cases involving crimes affecting the Department of Labor. In addition, the IG Office acts as the department's representative to the New York State Disaster Preparedness Commission and oversees relief programs for families affected by natural disasters in New York State.  C. UI FRAUD PROSECUTION The UI fraud prosecution program seeks criminal prosecution of UI claimants who have defrauded the UI Trust Fund to an egregious extent. In 2001, district attorneys prosecuted approximately 900 claimants for defrauding the department. A misdemeanor plea to Petit Larceny and restitution to the Department of Labor of the amount stolen was the typical disposition of each case. Jail sentences were infrequent, but were imposed if the claimant had a prior felony criminal record. There has never been an acquittal of a UI fraud prosecution. Prior to this program effort, claimants who defrauded the UI Trust Fund were pursued only through collection activity and charge-backs against future claims.  D. INTERNAL AUDIT UNIT The Internal Audit Unit is an independent appraisal function established within the Department of Labor to assist staff in the effective discharge of their responsibilities. To achieve its purpose, the Internal Audit Unit examines and evaluates department activities and provides analyses, appraisals, recommendations and information concerning the activities reviewed. When conducting its reviews and analyses, the Internal Audit Unit focuses on management objectives relating to the reliability and integrity of information; compliance with policies, plans, procedures, laws and regulations; internal control standards, safeguarding assets; economical and efficient use of resources; and accomplishment of established objectives and goals for the operation of programs.  A. INVESTIGATIONS UNIT The Investigations Section provides an agency capability to detect fraud, deter misconduct and criminal activities and protect the assets of the agency. In 2001, the Investigations Unit handled 112 investigation cases. Of the 112 cases, 95 were closed and 52 of them were closed as substantiated.  B. UI FRAUD INVESTIGATIONS The UI Fraud Investigation Section's primary mission is the deterrence, detection, investigation and prosecution of Unemployment Insurance fraud. With the advent of processing UI claims through Telephone Claims Centers, this section has become the paramount organization in the department effectuating the combating of fraud. The UI Investigation Section conducts investigations based on leads provided by employers, the public and other Labor Department operating units. In 2001, the section completed over 19,300 investigations. More than 50% resulted in overpayment determinations. Total fraud overpayments established for 2001 amounted to $16.4 million based on 10,601 overpayments. There were also 648,159 penalty days established as a result of these overpayments.  EXTERNAL AUDIT COORDINATION The Internal Audit Unit facilitated 12 audits, reviews and studies completed by external agencies on Department operations. There were four audits conducted by the Office of the State Comptroller, two studies conducted by the General Accounting Office at the request of Congress, and four reviews conducted by USDOL. The Department's portions of the NYS Single Audit and the financial statement audit were conducted by KPMG, Peat Marwick. Formal written responses were coordinated and prepared for six of the completed audits and reviews. In addition, there are 14 audits, reviews and studies currently in process and the department expects to schedule four more at a later date.  25   New York State Department of Labor  E. INTERNAL SECURITY UNIT The primary mission of the Internal Security Unit is to monitor UI operations to help detect and prevent fraud, waste and abuse within the Unemployment Insurance (UI) system. When the unit was created in the early 1980s, its focus was on the prevention and detection of Department of Labor employee fraud. That continues to be one of the unit's functions today, however, the role of the unit has greatly expanded over the years. In fact, currently, the Internal Security Unit expends most of its efforts on the detection of fraud by all types of claimants. During 2001, Internal Security's computer crossmatches led to the identification of 237 New York State employees who were working while collecting benefits. Nearly $250,000 of overpayment notices were issued to these employees and thousands of forfeit days were assessed.  2001, it was not necessary for the Contract Audit Unit to issue any audit determination letters on findings and no corrective action plans needed to be developed.  FINANCIAL AND COMPLIANCE AUDITS The Contract Audit Unit completed 14 financial and compliance audits of DOL contractors receiving state funds to conduct employment and training programs. The goal of these audits was to determine whether an entity's financial operations were conducted properly, the financial reports were presented fairly and that all applicable laws and regulations were complied with.  G. DISASTER PREPAREDNESS Individual and Family Grant Program The Individual and Family Grant (IFG) Program Branch of the Inspector General's Office was thrust into action following the events of September 11, 2001. The impact of the World Trade Center disaster was the greatest ever experienced. As 2001 ended, the program had received over 11,370 applications for assistance and provided approximately $2,500,000 in benefits to victims of the disaster. These benefits were paid to victims who were directly affected by the disaster and did not have the resources or ability to recover from their losses. The recovery process will continue into 2002 and it is anticipated that the program will pay benefits totaling more than $7,000,000 to the citizens of New York State. The scope of the disaster was such that the department, which oversees the program, was required to hire 50 hourly employees to staff the program and approximately 10 full-time department employees. The staff set up a processing center in the Public Safety Building on the State Campus complex in Albany. In addition to the payments that were made to the victims, the processing center staff handled approximately 34,000 pieces of outgoing correspondence and 15,000 pieces of incoming mail, as well as countless fax documents. The center also received over 3,500 phone calls from applicants. By the time the disaster registration period is done and the program is closed down, these numbers could double.  F. CONTRACT AUDIT UNIT SINGLE AUDITS The New York State Department of Labor (NYSDOL) has been designated the primary recipient of Workforce Investment Act (WIA) funds for New York State and has ultimate responsibility for these funds and successful management of the WIA program. The NYSDOL receives over $275 million annually from the United States Department of Labor to implement the WIA program. The NYSDOL transfers most of the funds to Local Workforce Investment Areas (LWIAs), in accordance with WIA regulations. New York State currently has LWIAs. The Single Audit Act and OMB circular A-133 established requirements for audits of governmental subrecipients. The A-133 circular states that the department must have internal controls to assure receipt of subrecipient audit reports. Where necessary, the department must issue audit determination letters on findings and ensure development of corrective action plans to address any reportable conditions. This process provides assurance concerning the $275 million in annual WIA expenditures in New York State. In 2001, this unit received all audit reports that had been issued by the subrecipient entities on a timely basis and performed reviews for all WIA-related audit findings. As there were no reportable conditions in  26   2001 Annual Report  VI. ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT OPERATIONS A. HUMAN RESOURCES The Human Resources Division of the Labor Department is comprised of four subdivisions: The Employee Relations Office administers the state's collectively negotiated agreements within the department, while maintaining a good working relationship with public employee unions. The office handles disciplinary actions, grievance procedures and workplace mediation. The office also addresses employee needs through ergonomics, ordering special equipment to meet medical and other requirements, resolving problems with office conditions and handling reasonable accommodation issues, such as alternate work schedules. The Office of Staff and Organizational Development provides leadership and guidance to the department's managers in planning, coordination and evaluation of training activities, especially to meet the needs of customers. Training in 2001 was provided on topics such as computer training, webbased training, leadership development, DoES training, security in the workplace, managing stress and teleconferencing technology. Personnel Program Teams prepare to process the positions of data processing employees who are moving from the Labor Department to the Office for Technology, as well as planning for the Data Center Consolidation there. To that end, the staff also have held interdepartmental exams and assisted in eligibility review of candidates for management positions at the Human Services Applications Service Center. The Division of Equal Opportunity Development develops and maintains an affirmative action program, promotes equal opportunity and ensures non-discriminatory policies and practices, and moniters compliance in the areas of Employment Services, Apprenticeships and Local Workforce Investment areas (LWIAs).  B. ADMINISTRATIVE FINANCE BUREAU The Administrative Finance Bureau (AFB) is responsible for the budgeting, management, accounting and expenditure of all department funds. It is also responsible for providing Property Management services covering leasing, space planning and project oversight, as well as building maintenance oversight. The AFB ensures that all resources are managed in a fiscally responsible and efficient manner and that all funds are expended in accordance with all appropriate state and federal rules and regulations. In addition, this bureau maintains and ensures the accuracy of the department's payroll system, and offers support operations services. These are the major accomplishments of the AFB during 2001. The Bureau: Assisted the department's response to the World Trade Center disaster by compiling projections of expected costs associated with disaster-related services. Some of the major tasks undertaken by the AFB during the critical period following the disaster included: Working with program staff to arrange emergency filing of claims for the Unemployment Insurance (UI), Disaster Unemployment Assistance (DUA) and Individual and Family Grant (IFG) programs. Working with program staff to arrange and track critical safety and health services and emergency Job Placement services. Assisting program staff in the expeditious awarding of National Emergency Grants (NEG) to Employment and Training providers in NYC. Coordinating the space requirements for staff dislocated from the Park Place office, which is located within the ""Red Zone.""  VII. COUNSEL'S OFFICE The Counsel's Office renders legal opinions and provides legal services to the Commissioner of Labor, Executive Deputy Commissioner, deputy commissioners, division directors and other department officials responsible for program activities as well as to the Legislature, regulated parties and the general public.  27   New York State Department of Labor  The office also handles all Freedom of Information Law requests submitted to the department. Staff from the Counsel's Office represent the department in administrative proceedings throughout the state. During 2000-2001, Counsel's Office represented the department in all administrative enforcement hearings and defended the department in employment discrimination and other matters; promoted the department's legislative program; represented the department in court to retrieve unpaid UI contributions; assisted the Attorney General in the preparation of cases in defense of the department or in affirmative litigation. With respect to administrative enforcement hearings, Counsel's Office added new staff to address a backlog in public work cases requiring hearings. The additional staff has been working diligently and has made progress in addressing this backlog. Counsel's Office worked with the Division of Safety and Health, Asbestos Control Bureau and the department's Administrative Adjudication Unit to develop a system to streamline the number of asbestos violation cases that require hearings. Violations are now the subject of informal compliance conferences where an Asbestos Control Bureau representative and a Hearing Officer from the Administrative Adjudication Unit attempt to work out a settlement of the matter. This has resulted in much faster resolution of these matters and fewer cases that require hearings. Counsel's Office also spent considerable time providing legal advice and assistance to department staff that were working on a number of programs as a result of the September 11, 2001 tragedy. These include the Disaster Unemployment Assistance program, the Individual and Family Grant program and the National Emergency Grant program under the federal Workforce Investment Act.  28   www.labor.state.ny.us 1-800-HIRE-992 P15 (8/02)"

HILLYARD              Administrative Law Judge                        RECOMMENDED DECISION AND ORDER         This matter arises under section 11 (c) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, 29 U.S.C. section 660 (c) (1) (OSHA), and section 7001 of the Solid Waste Disposal Act, 42 U.S.C. section 6971 (a) (SWDA). Both Acts prohibit employers from      discriminating against or discharging employees for engaging in certain protected activities.                           I.  STATEMENT OF THE CASE         Complainant, Keith E. Conaway (Conaway), filed a complaint on or about April 12, 1991 with the United States Department of Labor, alleging that Valvoline Instant Oil Change, Inc. (Valvoline) had discriminated against him by wrongfully terminating his employment. Specifically, Conaway charged that he was terminated  [Page 2]  because he complained to his superiors about 1) improper installation of a new storage tank for waste oil and other automotive fluids, and improper disposal of old storage tanks which resulted in the spillage of gallons of oil, and 2) unsafe working conditions at the working facility. After an investigation, the District Director of the Employment Standards Administration found that discrimination was not a factor leading to Conaway's discharge but that Valvoline had sufficient cause to terminate him based on his deficient work performance.        On May 21, 1991, the Complainant appealed the District    Director's findings and requested a hearing.  A hearing was conducted on August 20, 1991 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The parties were afforded full opportunity to be heard, to adduce     evidence, and to examine and cross-examine witnesses. Post- hearing briefs were filed by both parties.                                  II.  ISSUES         The issues presented in this matter are:        1.   Whether Complainant engaged in conduct which is protected by the SWDA or OSHA, and        2.   Whether Respondent discharged Complainant in retaliation      for complaints made under the SWDA or OSHA.                           III.  FINDINGS OF FACT         Complainant was hired as a management trainee by Valvoline      on July 2, 1990 (Tr. 24; CX 2). 1     At that time, he received a copy of Valvoline's Hourly Employee Handbook, which included the company's progressive discipline policy (Tr. 26-27). The handbook and the management training explained Valvoline's progressive discipline system that used oral, written and probation   warnings before termination. The company policies included a prohibition against smoking in the store, a prohibition against using the store facilities ""or personal car maintenance and fighting with customers or employees (Tr. 87-91; CX 3, 12, 13).        On August 12, 1990, Conaway was promoted to Store Manager at a Valvoline Instant Oil change facility in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. On September 4, 1990, Conaway took over management of store  [Page 3]  number 1-56, located at 832 E. Moreland Boulevard, Waukesha, Wisconsin (CX 6; Tr. 29).    Personnel File Documentation         Between the time that Conaway took over as manager of the   Waukesha store and March 14, 1991, the date that he was terminated, a number of incidents occurred which were documented in Complainant's personnel file.        1.   Sept. 26, 1990. Based on a complaint by a ""mystery      shopper,"" 2     Area Manager Jim Lein (Lein) warned Conaway      about being overly friendly with female customers.      Lein placed a handwritten memo of this discussion in      Conaway's file (CX 21, 26).        2.   October 8, 1990. Lein spoke to Conaway about the      stores slipping performance, slipping sales, failure to      follow proper procedure and told him that major improvement      needed to be made within thirty days (CX 22).        3.   October 12 or 18 (date partially illegible), 1990.      Regional Manager Lynn Hall (Hall) and Lein met with      Conaway to discuss his inappropriate angry management      style and poor presentation. Lein noted that he would      work with Conaway to see if this could be resolved (CX      23; RX 7).        4.   October 31, 1990. Lein met with Conaway to discuss      slipping sales and performance at the Waukesha store      and warned him of the need to show improvement within         30 days. Lein warned Conaway that the car counts at      the store were still declining and that inventory      sheets had not been completed since October 22 and      reminded him that they were to be done on a daily basis      (CX 18).        5.   November 12, 1990. Lein spoke to Conaway and told      him that his performance had improved but that more was      needed. Lein pointed out that the ""Mystery shopper""      evaluations were poor and that car counts were still      declining. Conaway was told that if he failed to      improve, it could result in some corrective action and  [Page 4]       possibly termination (CX 19).        6.   January 31, 1991. ""Mystery shopper"" reported that      Conaway's car was parked in one of the two bays in the      store in violation of Valvoline policy (RX 11).      Another ""mystery shopper"" reported that Conaway was      overly flirtatious and made her feel very uncomfortable      (RX 12).        7.   February 2, 1991. Based on the January 31 incidents,      Lein gave Conaway a written warning for closing      down one of the store's bays to work on his own car.      The written warning summarized the other dates of      warnings and stated that failure to follow Valvoline      policy and procedures to the letter would result in      suspension and possibly termination (RX 13).        8.   February 5, 1991. Another ""mystery shopper"" reported      that Conaway was overly flirtatious and that she      saw him turn away business (RX 14).        9.   February 22, 1991. Customer filed a written report      stating that Conaway refused to serve him because he      had ""burned"" his tires outside the store. The customer      also stated that Conaway told him, in a threatening      manner, never to return (RX 17).  This incident gave      rise to an argument between Conaway and a fellow      employee who objected to Conaway's treatment of the      customer. The employee filed a written protest with      Lein. The report stated that Conaway told him to      follow orders or that he would ""kick his fat ass up and      down the street."" (RX 18).        10.  February 25, 1991. Lein visited the store and      found that inventory sheets were a week behind and that      other customer invoice sheets were incomplete (CX 25).        11.  March 7, 1991. As a result of the incidents in      September, October, November, January and February,      Lein issued Conaway a Final Written Warning that put      him on 60 day probation. Lein stated that any additional      violation would result in termination (RX 19-      20).    [Page 5]   12.  March 12, 1991. ""Mystery shopper"" reported seeing      Conaway smoking before and after oil change on car in      violation of Valvoline policy (RX 30; Tr. 384-386).        13.  March 13, 1991. Customer filed a written complaint      stating that she had to wait 10 minutes outside      the store before being greeted and that another vehicle      was taken into the store out of turn, ahead of her      vehicle, and although placed in the second bay, this      other vehicle was not serviced (RX 31).        14.  March 14, 1991. Lein notified Conaway that he was      being terminated due to his continued violation of      Valvoline policies, including 1) smoking in store, 2)      running a one bay store and 3) turning away customers      (CX 11).    Alleged Safety Violations         The Complainant submitted copies of ""Job Work Orders"" dated during October and November of 1990 to show that he had brought   certain problems at the Waukesha facility to the attention of Lein. These ""Job Work Orders"" complained of poor lighting in the lower bay area, no emergency or exit signs in the building, weak garage door springs, an inoperative safety switch on the rear door and stopped up toilet (CX 8). Hall testified that he directed Conaway to exercise his managerial discretion in solving some of the problems such as purchasing supplies and cleaning the light fixtures to remedy the dark conditions in the building (Tr. 445-447; CX 10).        In January of 1991, new oil storage tanks were installed at the Waukesha store and the old oil drainage tanks were placed outside for removal. Conaway testified that he complained that the old storage tanks that were placed at the rear of the building were leaking oil onto the ground and parking lot. Conaway said that he used kitty litter and wrapped shop rags around a pipe that was protruding from the tanks but to no avail. He said the tanks were removed approximately two weeks later (Tr. 57-66). Lein testified that it was his understanding that the old storage tanks had been removed from the property when the new tank was installed. Once he learned that the tanks were still on the property, Lein called the maintenance supervisor who had them  [Page 6]  removed immediately. All that was necessary was to notify the people who did the work and they took care of the removal (Tr. 288).        I find that any excessive or prolonged oil leaking was due to the failure of Conaway to properly perform his job as manager and notify the maintenance personnel so that the tanks could be removed. His action of using kitty litter and a shop rag to stop the leak demonstrates a lack of initiative, imagination and attention to duty.        Conaway testified that he complained that the installation of new storage tanks for waste oil and other automotive fluids violated environmental regulations and that this opinion was  shared by the local fire marshall who had visited the site. Hall, regional manager of the Valvoline midwestern region, testified that the oil storage tank was UL approved, is similar to other tanks used in the Milwaukee area stores and the use of this tank was permitted by the fire marshall (Tr. 419-420, 428). I find that the evidence does not establish that any environmental regulations were violated.        Jeffrey Bombinski (Bombinski) worked at the Waukesha store with Conaway and recalled that in early February 1991, Conaway told him that he had a list of OSHA, EPA violations that was his ""ace in the hole"" and that if Valvoline was going to fire him then he [Conaway] had something to fall back on (Tr. 328-329, 354). Michael Walk (Walk) worked at the Waukesha store with Conaway and recalls that Conaway told him that he had a list of violations that he could use to his advantage if he was ever fired (Tr. 392-393, 405).        On February 22, 1991, Conaway expressed concern concerning his job and questioned Lein about whether a new management trainee who had recently been hired would replace him. Lein assured Conaway that he would not be terminated if he followed policy and procedure (RX 15). On the same day, Conaway presented Lein with a handwritten list of environmental and safety concerns (CX 9). This is the first time that Conaway mentioned OSHA violations to Lein. Conaway later met with Hall and Lein to discuss the list of safety concerns.        On March 14, 1991, Lein notified Conaway that he was being terminated because of two additional violations occurring since  [Page 7]  March 7, 1991, when he was placed on probation.    Poor Performance of Service Center       Valvoline has two methods to track performance of a service center, one is a car count report which tracks the number of vehicles being serviced and the other is a profit and loss statement (Tr. 430, 431). The number of vehicles serviced increased dramatically after Conaway was terminated. According to Walk, the number of cars serviced per week increased by 80 to 100 vehicles per week (Tr. 410). According to Hall, the car count increased by as much as thirty percent (Tr. 431).  At any rate, the number of cars serviced increased substantially after Conaway was fired and is further evidence of his poor management.    Credibility         Conaway testified that he never turned away a customer or told a co-worker to turn away a customer without a reason (Tr. 104). However, Walk and Bombinski both testified that Conaway had instructed them, on different occasions, to turn away customers for no particular reason other than Conaway did not feel like working on the cars at that particular time (Tr. 341, 348, 399-400). Conaway testified on direct examination that he never received oral or written warnings on certain particular dates concerning smoking in the store, running a one-bay store and turning away customers (Tr. 91-94). Conaway tended to give the impression that management never informed him of nor discussed any of its dissatisfaction with him concerning his violations of company practices and procedures. However, on cross-examination, Conaway admitted that management discussed with him the fact that his use of the company space to work on his personal car was a violation of company policy, about being overly friendly with female customers, about the slipping sales and performance of the store, failure to follow established practices and procedures, failure to complete inventory sheets, poor attitude and improper dress when servicing vehicles and being overly friendly to female customers (Tr. 118-140). Conaway denied ever making a  statement to Walk or Bombinski about having an ""ace in the hole"" or something to fall back on. Walk and Bombinski were both clear and emphatic about Conaway's statements in this regard. I find Conaway to be an evasive and unreliable witness and when his testimony conflicts with that of another witness, greater weight is given to the testimony of the other witness.  [Page 8]                           IV.  CONCLUSIONS OF LAW         To establish a prima facie case of discrimination in a whistleblower case, the alleged discriminatee must show that 1) he engaged in protected activity, 2) that the employer took adverse action against the employee and 3) that the adverse action taken was more likely than not the result of the protected conduct.  Texas Dept. of Community Affairs v. Burdine , 450 U.S. 245, 253 (1981). In order to rebut the prima facie case, the employer must demonstrate that it discharged the employee for a legitimate reason regardless of the protected activity. The employee may then show that the employer's proffered explanation for the discharge was either not relied upon or was a pretext.  Id . at 256.            A. Whether Complainant engaged in conduct protected            by SWDA and OSHA.         Valvoline argues that Conaway cannot establish a prima facie case of discrimination because he failed to make any complaints to government agencies but complained only to his immediate supervisors about possible safety and environmental hazards. Valvoline contends that in order to invoke the jurisdiction of the SWDA or OSHA, Conaway must have complained to a government agency. Section 660 (c) (1) of OSHA provides:                No person shall discharge or in any manner discriminate      against any employee because such employee has      filed any complaint or instituted or caused to be      instituted any proceeding under or related to this      chapter or has testified or is about to testify in any      such proceeding or because of the exercise of such      employee on behalf of himself or others of any right      afforded by this chapter.   Section 6971(a) of the SWDA provides:                No person shall fire, or in any other way discriminate      against, or cause to be fired or discriminated      against, any employee or any authorized representative      of employees by reason of the fact that such employee      or representative has filed, instituted, or caused to      be filed or instituted any proceeding under this chapter      or under any applicable implementation plan, or has      testified or is about to testify in any proceeding      resulting from the administration or enforcement of the      provisions of this chapter or of any applicable       inplementation plan.   [Page 9]       The Secretary of Labor has interpreted section 660(c) (1) of OSHA to include internal complaints made to the employer by the employee. 29 C.F.R. section 1977.9 (c),  Marshall v. Springville Poultry Farm, Inc. , 445 F. Supp. 2, 3 (M.D. Pa. 1977). The Secretary reasoned that the ""salutary principles of the Act would be seriously undermined if employees were discouraged from lodging complaints about occupational health and safety matters with their employers."" 29 C.F.R. section 1977.9 (c). This same reasoning should apply to complaints made pursuant to section 6971 (a) of the SWDA because of its similarity in language and purpose to section 660 (c) (1) of OSHA. The principles underlying SWDA would also be undermined if the Act did not protect employees against discharge or discrimination caused by complaints to the employer.        However, reading 29 C.F.R. section 1977.9 (c) in its entirety and applying it to the facts of this case leads to a different result.        (c)  Further, the salutary principles of the act would      be seriously undermined if employees were discouraged      from lodging complaints about occupational safety and      health matters with their employers. (Section 2 (1),(2),      and(3)). Such complaints to employers,  if made in good      faith , (emphasis added), therefore would be related to      the Act, and an employee would be protected against      discharge of discrimination caused by a complaint to      the employer.         If the Complainant presented complaints of possible occupational safety and environmental concerns to his immediate supervisors, in good faith, then he would have engaged in conduct protected by OSHA and the SWDA. However, the first time that Conaway every mentioned OSHA complaints to his employer was on February 22, 1991 when he orally mentioned several alleged ""environmental and safety concerns"" to Lein. A written list of ""concerns"" dated February 26, 1991 was later given to Lein. These complaints were made after numerous adverse entries had been made in Conaway's personnel file and after he had been notified of his violations of company practices and procedures; after Conaway had received a written warning and was placed on probation; and after Conaway had become concerned about losing  [Page 10]  his job and whether his replacement had been hired. This was also after Conaway told two other Valvoline employees that he had a list of violations and would use them ""to fall back on"" or as his ""ace in the hole"" in the event Valvoline was going to fire him. I find that Conaway's actions in notifying management of environmental concerns was not made in good faith but was an attempt to keep his employer from terminating or disciplining him.        The lack of good faith is further demonstrated by the fact that of these ""concerns"" most of them were apparently in existence for some time and possibly when Conaway took over management of the Waukesha store in September 1990. However, he did not bring them to management's attention until over five months later when he knew his job was in jeopardy. A review of the list of concerns does not reveal OSHA and environmental violations. Many of them represent no violation at all as the company was in compliance with local or state requirements. Several other of the alleged concerns (e.g., install eyewash station, improve lighting, install padding on support beams, insert 3-prong plug on benchgrinder, order new stepstools), were items that Conaway as manager of the store should have taken care of in the routine course of his duties. His failure to do so is a further example of his ineptitude as manager and further support for his  termination.        I find that the complaints by Conaway were not made in good faith and were therefore, not protected activity.         B.   Whether Respondent discharged Complainant in           retaliation for complaints made under SWDA or           OSHA.         Assuming arguendo that Complainant had been successful in establishing that his conduct was protected by SWDA and OSHA, he would still not be entitled to relief as he cannot establish that his termination was a result of protected activity.        Prior to informing management of environmental and OSHA concerns, Conaway had been repeatedly warned and counselled for his deficiencies as a store manager and for his violations of Valvoline practices and procedures. Furthermore, the evidence establishes that Conaway suspected that he would soon be terminated and created a list of environmental and safety concerns as  [Page 11]  his ""ace in the hole"" to prevent Valvoline from taking action. In any event, many of the safety and environmental concerns were complaints which Conaway himself, using his managerial office, should have remedied. Conaway, even after numerous warnings, showed no improvement nor did he even demonstrate any attempt or desire to improve his performance. Valvoline had ample cause for terminating Conaway's employment given his poor track record and performance as manager. Given these facts, Complainant has failed to show that his activity resulted in his discharge.        Even if Conaway had established a causal link between his termination and the internal complaints, Valvoline had a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason to fire him. Based on the numerous instances of performance problems documented in Conaway's personnel file, Valvoline had sufficient cause to terminate him even if he had shown that he was engaged in protected activity. Finally, Conaway has failed to show that Valvoline's reason for his discharge was a pretext for retaliation.                                V.  CONCLUSION         In light of the above facts, the Complainant has failed to establish that he was engaged in protected activity and has failed to establish a prima facie case of retaliatory discharge. Furthermore, assuming that a prima facie case could be established, the Respondent has set forth legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons to justify Complainant's discharge. Consequently, I find that the complaint is without merit.                            VI.  RECOMMENDED ORDER         Accordingly, it is ORDERED that the complaint of Keith E. Conaway is hereby  DISMISSED .                                        ROBERT L.

Under the program, Valvoline hires independent personnel evaluation agencies to send its employees to Valvoline locations for an oil change. Before a ""mystery shop"" is conducted, the mystery shopper is trained in Valvoline policies and procedures.

ACTION: Interim final rule; request for comments. AGENCY SUMMARY: The Employment and Training Administration hereby issues an Interim Final Rule implementing the Welfare-to-Work (WtW) grant provisions of Title IV, Part A of the Social Security Act as amended by the recent enactment of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. The Interim Final Rule provides an administrative framework for the WtW program which is being coordinated with the closely-related Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program administered by the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). While the use of WtW funds should occur within the larger framework of the TANF program in each State, these funds have a purpose that is distinct from that of the TANF program. The purpose of WtW is to provide transitional assistance which moves hard-to-employ welfare recipients living in high poverty areas into unsubsidized employment and economic self-sufficiency. DATES: Effective Dates: This Interim Final Rule shall become effective on November 18, 1997. However, affected parties do not have to comply with the information collection requirements in  645.240 (reporting requirements for WtW programs) until DOL publishes in the Federal Register the control numbers assigned by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Publication of the control numbers notifies the public that OMB has approved this information collection requirement under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. Comment Period: Comments must be submitted by January 20, 1998. The Department will not consider comments received after this date. Comments that are less than 10 pages in length may be transmitted via facsimile at (202) 219 0376, provided that submission of written text follows. ADDRESSES: Submit written comments to the Employment and Training Administration, Welfare-to-Work Office, 200 Constitution Avenue, NW, Room S5513, Washington, D.C. 20210, Attention: Peter E. Rell.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  Paperwork Reduction Act Pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, information collection requirements which would be imposed as a result of the Interim Rule are being submitted separately to the Office of Management and Budget. I. Background On August 22, 1996, President Clinton signed the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA), a comprehensive welfare reform bill, under which the TANF program was established to supersede the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) welfare program, the Job Opportunities and Basic Skills (JOBS) Training program and the Emergency Assistance (EA) Program. The TANF program at section 401(a) of the Social Security Act (Act) established the following objectives:  Provide assistance to needy families so that children may be cared for in their own homes or in the homes of relatives;  End the dependence of needy parents on government benefits by  promoting job preparation, work, and marriage;  Prevent and reduce the incidence of out-of-wedlock pregnancies and establish annual numerical goals for preventing and reducing the incidence of these pregnancies; and  Encourage the formation and maintenance of two-parent families. The TANF provisions substantially changed the nation's welfare system from one in which cash assistance was provided on an entitlement basis to a system in which the primary focus is on moving welfare recipients to work and promoting family responsibility, accountability and self-sufficiency. In general, adult welfare recipients are expected to become self-sufficient within a 60-month period of time. In support of this ``work-first'' objective, the TANF provisions established an overall work participation rate for all households and a work participation rate for two-parent families that must be met by each State starting in fiscal year (FY) 97 and in each fiscal year thereafter through FY 2002. States that do not meet the TANF-established work participation rates face significant financial penalties. The reference to ``work-first'' refers to the TANF concept that the primary focus is on placing individuals in employment activities. Nevertheless, the work-first approach also recognizes that individuals may be provided, as appropriate, education and skills training related to the job, as well as other services to ensure lasting employment and the achievement of self-sufficiency. Since the enactment of PRWORA, the Administration and Congress have been concerned that those welfare recipients who have the least skills, education, employment experience and who live within high poverty areas may need additional assistance to obtain lasting jobs and become self-sufficient. On August 5, 1997, the President signed the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. This legislation amended certain TANF provisions of the Social Security Act and authorized the Secretary of Labor to provide WtW grants to States and local communities for transitional employment assistance to move the hard-to-employ TANF welfare recipients into unsubsidized jobs and economic self-sufficiency. Approximately 75 percent of the funds in each fiscal year will be distributed as formula grants to the States, with 85 percent to be passed through to local service delivery areas (SDAs) (generally, one or more units of local government with a population of 200,000 or more) in the States to be administered by the   Federal Register / Vol. 62, No. 222 / Tuesday, November 18, 1997 / Rules and Regulations 61589 Private Industry Council (PIC) for the SDA, or an alternate administering entity approved by the Secretary of Labor according to the statutory requirements. The funds distributed through the WtW grant program will assist States and PICs to meet their welfare reform objectives by providing additional resources targeted to hard-toemploy welfare recipients residing in high poverty areas within the State. WtW activities should be coordinated with those undertaken through TANF, as hard-to-employ welfare recipients constitute a significant portion of the TANF eligible population. Therefore, the ability of State/County TANF agencies, the PICs under the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA), local governments and a variety of other entities (e.g., One-Stop systems, private sector employers, labor organizations, business and trade associations, education agencies, housing agencies, community development corporations, transportation agencies, communitybased and faith-based organizations, disability community organizations, community action agencies, and colleges and universities which provide some of the assistance needed by the targeted population) to implement WtW programs that move these individuals into employment and self-sufficiency will be a major factor in the success of the national initiative to reform the welfare system. The Interim Final Rule provides a framework for the administration of WtW programs, in coordination with the closely-related TANF program. The Employment and Training Administration (ETA) has coordinated its WtW regulatory efforts with the rulemaking being initiated by the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) for the TANF program. The Interim Final Rule supplements TANF's emphasis on moving welfare recipients into work, and on improving program evaluation and performance. Section 403(a)(5)(A)(ii)(I) of the Act indicates that the States' WtW formula plans are an ``addendum'' to the State TANF plans. In keeping with the Congressional intent to allow States maximum flexibility in implementing TANF requirements, the WtW regulations provide States and local governments with broad discretion to design and implement WtW programs that meet the needs of the hard-toemploy population in the individual States. This approach is consistent with PRWORA's statutory intent to provide States with maximum discretion. The PRWORA Conference Report, H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 725 104th Cong. 2nd Sess. (1996), states that the legislation establishes ``broad cash welfare and child care block grants providing maximum flexibility so that States can reform welfare in ways that are appropriate for them, and can move families into jobs.'' The WtW statute contains several provisions designed to encourage creative and effective use of grant funds. In particular, section 403(a)(5)(B) provides that approximately 25 percent of WtW funds shall be distributed through a competitive grant process which are designed, in part, to expand the base of knowledge about programs to successfully move hard-to-employ recipients to unsubsidized employment and self-sufficiency. In addition, section 403(a)(5)(E) sets aside $100 million as a successful performance bonus, to be distributed in FY 2000 among States who most effectively place hard-toemploy individuals in lasting employment at increased earnings. The format, as well as the substance, of the Interim Final Rule reflects the Administration's commitment to regulatory reform. The current Federal Register Document Drafting Handbook encourages Federal agencies to produce regulations that are reader-friendly. The Department has made every effort to make these regulations clear and easy to understand, as well as to anticipate issues that may arise and to provide appropriate direction. To this end, the Part 645 regulatory text is presented in a ``question and answer'' format. Section 403(a)(5)(C)(viii) of the Act requires the Secretary of Labor to prescribe regulations implementing the WtW program within 90 days of enactment, after consultation with the Secretaries of DHHS and Housing and Urban Development (HUD). Pursuant to Secretary of Labor's Order No. 475, the Assistant Secretary for Employment and Training has been delegated the responsibility to carry out WtW policies, programs, and activities for the Secretary of Labor. Given the short time frame imposed on the Department, the Employment and Training Administration (ETA) has moved quickly to initiate coordination with the other Federal agencies that have related concerns. In particular, the Department established a Federal Policy Committee composed of officials from the Departments of HHS, HUD, Transportation and Labor. The Policy Committee reviewed and provided policy recommendations to the Department on issues that arose during the development of the Interim Final Rule. In addition, ETA requested and received input from a broad range of interested parties regarding guidance to be provided by the Agency on how to comply with a number of WtW statutory provisions, e.g., allowable matching funds, expenditure time limits, reallocation policy, Governors' authority to select the State administrative agency, conditions under which the Governor may select an alternate administrative agency (other than the Private Industry Council) at the local level, eligible grant applicants for competitive WtW grants, allowable activities, post-employment and job retention services, job creation through public or private sector employment wage subsidies, community services and work experience programs, limits on administration costs, and performance standards and bonuses. The Agency has determined that this Interim Final Rule, as promulgated, complies with the WtW statutory mandate and will provide effective direction for the implementation of WtW programs. ETA will review all comments received in response to the Interim Final Rule, as well as program experience, in considering what further action is necessary and promulgating a Final Rule. II. Summary and Explanation This section describes and explains the individual provisions of the Interim Final Rule. The explanatory text, in general, adheres closely to the corresponding WtW statutory language. The supporting rationale is provided for those instances where the rule provides direction not prescribed by the WtW statute. ETA has set regulations only where they are necessary to clarify or to explain how the Agency intends to interpret the WtW statute. Consistent with the Act, the Interim Final Rule provides the States and local governments with the primary responsibility to initiate and develop program implementation procedures and policy guidance regarding WtW administration. For example, while 20 CFR 645.230 indicates that the OMB Circular A102 ``Common Rule'' requirements apply to WtW programs, the Department has not defined what constitutes WtW ``allowable activities'' which are used under section 403(a)(5)(C) of the Act. Pursuant to Section 411(a)(1) of the Social Security Act, DHHS has the responsibility to issue WtW participant and program data reporting requirements, after consultation with other appropriate parties. Accordingly, this Interim Final Rule does not address such reporting requirements in detail. Consistent with the purpose of WtW, which is to move welfare recipients into   61590 Federal Register / Vol. 62, No. 222 / Tuesday, November 18, 1997 / Rules and Regulations unsubsidized employment and economic self-sufficiency, the statute anticipates reporting on these measures: placements in unsubsidized employment; placements in unsubsidized employment that last at least six months; placements in the private and public sectors; earnings of individuals who obtain employment; and average expenditures per placement. Subpart A--Scope and Purpose What Does This Part Cover? ( 645.100) This section of the Interim Final Rule indicates that Part 645 provides regulatory provisions applicable to WtW formula grant funds that are to be used to carry out State-level programs and programs conducted by the PICs at the Service Delivery Area (SDA) level. This part of the regulations also provides general guidance on WtW competitive grants, but it should be clear the Department intends to publish specific Solicitations for Grant Applications (SGAs) in the future. The SGAs to be published will be disseminated widely and will contain specific information about purpose, application requirements, funding amounts, and submission instructions for competitive grant awards. What Are the Purposes of the Welfareto-Work Program? ( 645.110) This section of the Interim Final Rule describes what the Department believes to be the statutory objective of the WtW program, which complements the overall objectives of the TANF program. For example, the WtW statutory provisions indicate that the ultimate objective to be achieved through the various allowable activities is to ``* * * move individuals into and keep individuals in lasting unsubsidized employment * * *''. In this regard, the WtW program complements the TANF objective to ``* * * end the dependence of needy parents by promoting job preparation, work * * *''. The WtW Program focuses on assistance on hardto-employ welfare recipients living in high poverty areas. Although the section requires only that WtW grant funds be coordinated with the State TANF expenditures, the Department also intends that WtW grant funds be coordinated with available resources from the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA), the Employment Service, the Child Care and Development Block Grant, OneStop systems, private sector employers, labor organizations, business and trade associations, vocational rehabilitation and other education agencies, housing agencies, community development corporations, transportation agencies, community-based and faith-based organizations, disability community organizations, community action agencies, and colleges and universities and other sources that provide assistance to the WtW targeted individuals. What Definitions Apply to This Part? ( 645.120) This section of the Interim Final Rule includes a limited number of definitions of terms, acronyms and phrases important to the implementation of the WtW programs. This section is not intended to be an all-inclusive listing of definitions provided within the WtW legislation and WtW regulations. This section includes definitions for the terms ``adult'', ``minor'', and ``TANF MOE'' found in the TANF statute. The Department also relied on the definitions provided in the JTPA regulations at 20 CFR Part 626 for the terms ``PIC'' and ``SDA.'' The definition for ``Chief Elected Official'' comes from Section 103(c) of the Job Training Partnership Act, as amended. States and PICs (and alternate agencies) should keep in mind that additional definitions applicable to the WtW program, but not listed in this section for the sake of brevity, can be found in the definitions section(s) of the pertinent OMB Circulars on Uniform Administrative Requirements and the OMB Cost Principles Circulars. For example, 29 CFR 97.3 contains definitions for terms and acronyms relating to administration of the WtW programs operated by State, local and Indian tribal organizations, unless otherwise specified. Similarly, 29 CFR Part 95 contains other administrative definitions relating to non-profit organizations. Subpart B--General Program and Administrative Requirements What Does This Part Cover? ( 645.200) This subpart provides general program and administrative requirements for WtW formula grant funds, including Governors' funds for long-term recipients of assistance, and for competitive grant funding. Of the total amount of WtW funds available for allotment (after reserving an amount for Indian tribes, evaluation, and performance bonuses), 75 percent is allotted to the States on a formula basis. Generally, the States are required to distribute at least 85 percent of this amount, pursuant to a statutory formula, to service delivery areas. The Governor of a State may reserve up to 15 percent of the State's allotment for projects to help long-term recipients of assistance. The roughly 25 percent of the funds that is not allotted to the States by formula is available for the Secretary to award through a competitive grant process. The regulations which appear in this subpart apply to these funds. What Is Meant by the Terms ``Entity'' and ``Project'' in the Statutory Phrase ``An Entity that Operates a Project'' With Welfare-to-Work Funds? ( 645.210) This section defines the terms ``entity'' and ``project'' in the phrase ``an entity that operates a project'' with WtW funds, as used in section 403(a)(5)(C)(ii) of the Act. For WtW substate formula funds, ``entity'' means the PIC (or the alternate agency designated by the Governor and approved by the Secretary) which administers the WtW formula funds in a service delivery area(s). This entity is referred to in  645.211 through 645.225 as the ``operating entity''. The term ``entity'' does not refer to subrecipients, contractors, vendors, or other parties to which the PIC or alternate agency may choose to distribute WtW formula funds to provide specific services. The term ``project'' means all activities, administrative and programmatic, supported by the total amount of the WtW formula funds allotted to an entity as described above. Therefore, the requirement relating to the expenditure of 70 percent WtW funds on hard-toemploy individuals, as described in  645.211, applies to all of the funds allotted to the PIC/alternate administering agency. The entity need not impose these expenditure requirements on each individual subrecipient, contractor, vendor or other party to whom it may choose to distribute WtW funds. However, the entity must ensure that, in the aggregate, it complies with the 70 percent expenditure requirement. For Governors' funds for long-term recipients of assistance, ``entity'' means the agency, group, or organization to which the Governor has distributed such funds, as described in  645.410 (b) and (c). This entity is referred to in  645.211 through 645.225 as the ``operating entity''. The term ``project'' means all activities, administrative and programmatic, supported by the total amount of any one award of Governor's funds made to an entity as described above. Therefore, should the entity receive more than one award from the Governor, the 70 percent expenditure requirement, as described in  645.211, applies individually to each award. The entity need not impose the expenditure requirement on each individual   Federal Register / Vol. 62, No. 222 / Tuesday, November 18, 1997 / Rules and Regulations 61591 subrecipient, contractor, vendor or other party to whom it may choose to distribute WtW funds. However, the entity must ensure that in the aggregate it complies with the 70 percent expenditure requirement. For competitive WtW grants, ``entity'' means an eligible applicant, as described in  645.500, which is awarded a competitive WtW grant by the Secretary. This entity is referred to in  645.211 through 645.225 as the ``operating entity''. The term ``entity'' does not refer to subrecipients, contractors, vendors, or other parties to which the competitive grant recipient may choose to distribute WtW funds. The term ``project'' means all activities, administrative and programmatic, supported by the total amount of any one competitive grant award. Therefore, should the same entity receive more than one competitive grant, the 70 percent expenditure requirement, as described in  645.211, applies individually to each competitive grant. The entity need not impose the expenditure requirements on each individual subrecipient, contractor, vendor or other party to whom it may choose to distribute WtW funds. However, the entity must ensure that in the aggregate it complies with the 70 percent expenditure requirement. How Must Welfare-to-Work Funds Be Spent by the Operating Entity? ( 645.211) This section restates the statutory provisions, at section 403(a)(5)(C)(ii) and (iii) of the Act, which require that an operating entity, as described in  645.210 of this part, expend not less than 70 percent of the WtW funds allotted or awarded to it for the benefit of hard-to-employ individuals, as described in  645.212, and which provide that up to 30 percent of the funds may be spent to assist individuals with characteristics associated with long-term welfare dependence, as described in  645.213. If less than 30 percent of the funds are spent to assist individuals with long-term welfare dependence characteristics, as described in  645.213, the remaining funds shall be spent to benefit hard-to-employ individuals, as described in  645.212. This requirement applies to all WtW funds, i.e., to substate formula funds, Governors' funds for long-term recipients of assistance, and competitive funds. It should be noted that the requirement does not apply to the proportion of WtW participants served; rather, as noted above, it applies to the percentage of WtW funds expended on the participants in each category of eligibility. Who May be Served as a Hard-toEmploy Individual Under the 70 Percent Provision? ( 645.212) The WtW legislation targets those welfare recipients who will have the most difficulty transitioning into employment. Specifically, the Act, at sections 403(a)(5)(C)(ii) and (iv), establishes three different categories of individuals who may be served under the 70 percent provision. An individual is eligible if (s)he meets the criteria of any one of the following three eligibility categories. (1) To be eligible under the first category, individuals: (a) must be recipients of TANF assistance; and (b) must have two of the three specified barriers to employment; and (c) must be long-term recipients of TANF assistance or will become ineligible for TANF assistance within twelve months. (2) To be eligible under the second category, an individual must be a noncustodial parent of a minor whose custodial parent meets the three criteria of the first eligibility category. (3) To be eligible under the third category, an individual must have the specified barriers to employment and no longer be receiving TANF assistance because (s)he has reached either the Federal fiveyear lifetime limit on receipt of assistance, or a State-imposed lifetime limit. The regulations paraphrase the statutory language. Eligibility: Category One. To be eligible to be served under category one of the 70 percent provision, an individual must meet each of the following three eligibility criteria: Criterion a: Recipients of TANF Assistance. The individual must be a current recipient of TANF assistance. The Act, at section 403(a)(5)(C)(ii), uses the term ``recipients of assistance under the program funded under this part.'' In order to facilitate coordination at the local level, the Department has consulted with DHHS regarding interpretations for ``the program funded under this part'' and ``assistance''. Provisions in the statute which use the term ``the program funded under this part'' refer to the State's program of family assistance that is operated in accordance with the TANF statute, regardless of its funding source. Thus, any individual receiving TANF assistance under the State TANF program (whether funded with State or Federal funds) is deemed to meet this criterion of eligibility under the 70 percent provision. ``Assistance'' means every form of support provided to families under TANF (including child care, work subsidies, and allowances to meet living expenses), except: (a) services that have no direct monetary value to an individual family and that do not involve implicit or explicit income support, such as counseling, case management, peer support, and employment services that do not involve subsidies or other forms of income support; and (b) one-time, shortterm assistance (i.e., assistance which is paid no more than once in any 12 month period, is paid within a 30 day period, and covers needs that do not extend beyond a 90-day period, such as automobile repair to obtain employment and avoid welfare receipt, and appliance repair to maintain living arrangements). The Secretary notes that she may issue further rules to conform this provision to similar provisions in forthcoming final regulations governing the TANF program. Criterion b: Barriers to Employment. The Act, at section 403(a)(5)(C)(ii)(I), states that as the second criterion of eligibility under category one of the 70 percent provision, an individual must face at least two of the three following barriers to employment: (1) the individual has not completed secondary school or obtained a certificate of general equivalency, and has low skills in reading or mathematics; (2) the individual requires substance abuse treatment for employment; or (3) the individual has a poor work history. We are defining the phrase ``has low skills in reading or mathematics'', which is used in the first barrier in criterion b, to mean having reading or mathematics skills at or below grade level 8.9. This definition is consistent with the definition which is used in the Job Training Partnership (JTPA) program. We are also defining the phrase ``has a poor work history'' to mean having worked no more than three consecutive months in the last 12 calendar months. In this way individuals who have taken the initiative to try employment but have not been successful for more than a brief period of time, are eligible for assistance. These definitions reinforce the intent of the WtW legislation to focus assistance on hard-to-employ individuals. However, we provide PICs flexibility for each of these definitions for up to 10 percent of participants to recognize individual circumstances, specialized needs, including individuals with disabilities, and local labor market conditions. TANF agencies are required to perform an initial assessment of the skills, prior work experience and employability of each TANF recipient who is at least 18 years old, or who has not completed high school (or equivalent) and is not attending   61592 Federal Register / Vol. 62, No. 222 / Tuesday, November 18, 1997 / Rules and Regulations secondary school. It is likely that this assessment may identify the abovenoted barriers, and we do not want to require further assessment for the purposes of establishing eligibility where it is not needed. Additionally, in relation to the criterion ``requires substance abuse treatment for employment,'' we note that DHHS is suggesting that the optional individual responsibility plan which the TANF agency develops based on the initial assessment may require the individual to undergo appropriate substance abuse treatment. We do not want to impose an additional Federal definition which would cause a local WtW program operator to ``second-guess'' this determination. Criterion c: Long-Term/DurationImpacted TANF Recipients. The third eligibility criterion under category one of the 70 percent provision requires that individuals be long-term recipients of TANF assistance or will become ineligible for TANF assistance within 12 months. The regulations paraphrase the statutory requirements, at section 403(a)(5)(C)(ii)(II), which states that an individual: (1) must have received assistance under a State TANF program, and/or its predecessor program, for at least 30 months, whether consecutive or not; or (2) will become ineligible for assistance within 12 months due to Federal or State-imposed durational time limits on receipt of TANF assistance. This includes individuals who have been exempted from the durational limits due to hardship pursuant to section 408(a)(7)(C) of the Act, but would have faced termination within 12 months without the exemption. Eligibility: Category Two: Noncustodial Parents. The regulations paraphrase the statutory requirement at section 403(a)(5)(C)(ii). A noncustodial parent of a minor child whose custodial parent meets the eligibility criteria of category one, as specified in  645.212(a) of this part, is eligible under the 70 percent provision. In order to facilitate coordination at the local level, we are not defining the term ``noncustodial'' any further. We are allowing States to develop and employ their own definition of the term, which we understand States generally use to mean a parent who is absent from the child's household. Under TANF, States can extend employment services to noncustodial parents by including them in their definition of ``eligible family''. In these cases, the States are already using their own non-Federal definition of ``noncustodial.'' Further, States are required by statute to report to DHHS on the number of noncustodial parents participating in work activities. We do not want to impose a definition which would be at odds with those already existing in the States. If a State does not have a definition for ``noncustodial'' parent for TANF purposes, it should develop one in order to serve noncustodial parents in WtW projects. Eligibility: Category Three: Exceeding Durational Time Limits. The regulations interpret the statutory provision at section 403(a)(5)(C)(iv) to apply to individuals who have reached Stateimposed time limits on receipt of TANF assistance in addition to individuals who have reached the five-year Federal limit on receipt of Federal assistance. This interpretation is consistent with the purpose of the WtW funds to assist those who have the most difficulty making the transition from welfare to work. Therefore, an individual who has barriers to employment, as specified in  645.212(a)(2) of this part, and who would otherwise be eligible to receive TANF assistance but is no longer receiving TANF assistance because (s)he has reached either the Federal five-year lifetime limit on receipt of assistance, or a State-imposed lifetime limit, is eligible. Who May be Served as an Individual With Long-Term Welfare Dependence Characteristics Under the 30 Percent Provision? ( 645.213) The Act, at sections 403 (a)(5)(C)(iii) and (iv), establishes three different categories of individuals who may be served as individuals with characteristics associated with longterm welfare dependence under the 30 percent provision. An individual is eligible if (s)he meets any one of the following three eligibility categories: (1) To be eligible under the first category, individuals must be recipients of TANF assistance and have characteristics associated with, or predictive of, longterm welfare dependence. (2) To be eligible under the second category, an individual must be a noncustodial parent of a minor whose custodial parent is receiving TANF assistance, and the noncustodial parent must have characteristics associated with, or predictive of, long-term welfare dependence. (3) To be eligible under the third category, an individual must have characteristics associated with, or predictive of, long-term welfare dependence, be otherwise eligible to receive TANF assistance, but no longer be receiving TANF assistance because (s)he has reached either the Federal fiveyear lifetime limit on receipt of assistance, or a State-imposed lifetime limit. Eligibility: Category One. To be eligible under category one of the 30 percent provision, an individual must meet both of the following criteria: Criterion a: Recipients of TANF Assistance. The individual must be a current recipient of TANF assistance. The Act states, at section 403 (a)(5)(C)(iii)(I), that individuals with long-term welfare dependence characteristics under the 30 percent provision must be ``recipients of assistance under the program funded under this part''. The regulations paraphrase the statutory requirement. In order to facilitate coordination at the local level, the Department has consulted with DHHS regarding interpretations for ``the program funded under this part'' and ``assistance''. For a fuller discussion of this approach, refer to the discussion regarding recipients of TANF assistance in the preamble for  645.212. Criterion b: Characteristics Associated With Long-Term Welfare Dependence. The Act states, at section 403 (a)(5)(C)(iii)(I), that an individual must have characteristics associated with long-term welfare dependence, such as having dropped out of school, teenage pregnancy, or having a poor work history. We are interpreting ``associated with'' to include characteristics ``predictive of'' long-term welfare dependence. In order to facilitate coordination at the local level, we will not further define the characteristics associated with long-term welfare dependence. It is likely that the TANF assessment may identify the abovenoted characteristics, and we do not want to require further assessment for the purposes of establishing eligibility where it is not needed. Moreover, the regulations interpret the statutory phrase ``such as'' to mean that, in addition to the characteristics listed in the statute, States and PICs may designate other characteristics associated with, or predictive of, longterm welfare dependence, including having a disability. In order to provide the State and local areas with flexibility to design the WtW program to support the goals and objectives of their overall program of assistance for welfare recipients, we are not imposing any further restrictions in this area. Starting with the FY99 State WtW formula plans, States will be asked to include examples of characteristics which the State and PICs consider to be predictive of longterm welfare dependency. Eligibility: Category Two: Noncustodial Parents. The Act states, at section 403(a)(5)(C)(iii)(II), that noncustodial parents of minors who have the characteristics associated with,   Federal Register / Vol. 62, No. 222 / Tuesday, November 18, 1997 / Rules and Regulations 61593 or predictive of, long-term welfare dependence, as described under category one, are eligible to participate under the 30 percent provision if the custodial parent is receiving TANF assistance. In order to facilitate coordination at the local level, we are not defining the term ``noncustodial'' any further. For a fuller discussion of this approach, refer to the discussion regarding noncustodial parents in the preamble for  645.212. Eligibility: Category Three: Exceeding Durational Time Limits. The regulations interpret the statutory provision at section 403(a)(5)(C)(iv) to apply to individuals who have reached Stateimposed time limits on receipt of TANF assistance in addition to individuals who have reached the five-year Federal limit on receipt of Federal assistance. This interpretation is consistent with the purpose of the WtW funds to assist those who have the most difficulty making the transition from welfare to work. Therefore, an individual who has characteristics associated with, or predictive of, long-term welfare dependence, as specified in  645.213(a)(2) of this part, and who would otherwise be eligible to receive TANF assistance but is no longer receiving TANF assistance because (s)he has reached either the Federal five-year lifetime limit on receipt of assistance, or a State-imposed lifetime limit, is eligible to participate under the 30 percent provision. How Will Welfare-to-Work Participant Eligibility be Determined? ( 645.214) The regulations state that the operating entity is accountable for ensuring that WtW funds are spent on individuals who are eligible for WtW projects. The regulations acknowledge, however, that the operating entity may not be in the best position to determine all aspects of WtW eligibility, particularly those associated with receipt of TANF assistance. Therefore, the regulations require that the operating entity ensure that there are mechanisms in place to establish WtW eligibility based on the criteria in  645.212 and 645.213. We urge that the mechanisms for determining WtW eligibility address how the PIC or other WtW operating entity and the TANF agency will work together to facilitate the exchange of eligibility information. The actual scope of the mechanisms, operating procedures, and roles and responsibilities of the cooperating parties are best left to local determination given the myriad of circumstances that exist in local areas. Since receipt of TANF assistance will be the single most critical WtW eligibility criterion in the majority of cases, it is critical that the TANF agency be the source of information about whether an individual is receiving TANF assistance, the length of such receipt, and applicable time limits on such receipt. At a minimum, therefore, for TANF recipients, WtW eligibility determination mechanisms must include arrangements with the TANF agency to ensure that such a determination is based on information, current at the time of the WtW eligibility determination, for the factors specified in  645.214(b)(1) of this part. In establishing WtW eligibility for the criteria of barriers to employment, pursuant to  645.212(a)(2), and characteristics associated with long term-welfare dependency, pursuant to  645.213(a)(2) of this part, the regulations seek to minimize duplication of effort and encourage coordination of TANF and WtW resources. Specifically, the regulations state that for TANF recipients, the operating entity may base a determination of WtW eligibility for these factors on information that was collected up to six months prior to the WtW eligibility determination, by or through the operating entity for JTPA or for other purposes, or by the TANF agency for the TANF assessment or individual responsibility plan (IRP). This mechanism provides an efficient method to minimize duplication of effort and utilize existing, reliable information while ensuring that a WtW eligibility determination will not be made on the basis of outdated information. This six-month window is intended to provide flexibility to the operating entity to customize its mechanisms for determining WtW eligibility to address the unique circumstances of its local area. In some cases, the operating entity may determine that a shorter time period is preferable. In others, the operating entity may determine that for some characteristics, such as the possession of a high school diploma, the individual's status immediately prior to determination of eligibility should be used in the determination. We recognize that the information previously collected by the operating entity or in the TANF assessment and IRP: (1) may be sufficiently comprehensive to allow for making the WtW eligibility determination; or (2) may not necessarily provide sufficient information to determine WtW eligibility in all categories. In either case, we urge close coordination between the TANF agency and the operating entity to develop a coordinated mechanism for eligibility determination. The operating entity must also have mechanisms in place to determine WtW eligibility for individuals who are not receiving TANF assistance (i.e., noncustodial parents and individuals who have reached the time limit on receipt of TANF). Mechanisms may include approaches such as: (1) using staff from the operating entity to determine WtW eligibility (utilizing information from TANF and other appropriate agencies); (2) entering into agreements with local agencies, such as the TANF agency, and other appropriate entities, such as One-Stop systems and substance abuse treatment providers, which foster coordination and facilitate the exchange of eligibility information among parties at the local level; and/or (3) performing joint WtW eligibility determination with other appropriate agencies, including the TANF agency. The TANF agency should be able to provide information about assistance received by the custodial parent of minors or by exhaustees to permit the PIC to determine whether an individual qualifies as a noncustodial parent or about individuals who are no longer receiving TANF assistance. In determining whether someone requires substance abuse treatment for employment, the operating entity can benefit from coordinating with the local recipients of funds from the Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment (SAPT) Block Grant. In some States, SAPT funds substance abuse awareness and identification programs for TANF case workers. In others, substance abuse counselors supported by SAPT funds are co-located in TANF offices. We urge close coordination by the operating entity with efforts of SAPT and other agencies to identify and address substance abuse among the TANF population. The regulations also state that once an individual begins to receive WtW services, the operating entity is not required to redetermine WtW eligibility. For instance, if someone ceases to receive TANF assistance due to increased earnings, that individual may continue to participate in appropriate WtW services (such as occupational training offered as a post-employment service or job retention services, if such services are not otherwise available). What Activities Are Allowable Under This Part? ( 645.220) The ultimate objective for each welfare recipient is placement into an unsubsidized job which provides the potential for achieving economic selfsufficiency. Activities conducted with   61594 Federal Register / Vol. 62, No. 222 / Tuesday, November 18, 1997 / Rules and Regulations WtW grant funds must be grounded in the ``work first'' philosophy which is a fundamental tenet of the Act. Although a variety of activities are authorized under WtW, these activities should be viewed as employment-based developmental steps for helping individuals secure and retain unsubsidized employment. Section 403(a)(5)(C)(i) specifies the allowable activities which can be funded under WtW grants. The statute prescribes the following as allowable activities: job readiness, placement, and post-employment services financed through job vouchers or through contracts with public or private providers; community service or work experience programs; job creation through public or private sector employment wage subsidies; on-the-job training; and job retention or support services if such services are not otherwise available. Congress did not define these activities further. Some activities have commonly understood meanings from their use over time or from operational definitions adopted by other employment and training programs, but others may not. We consulted with a variety of groups to determine what others thought about how these activities should be defined. A major theme they expressed is the need for maximum State and local flexibility to design programs to successfully move the hardest to employ welfare recipients into unsubsidized employment leading to economic selfsufficiency. Another major theme expressed by those with whom we consulted is the need for flexibility to provide to the WtW eligible population, training in basic educational and occupational skills, English as a second language training, and referral to vocational rehabilitation services. Indeed, one of the eligibility factors is the lack of a high school or secondary school diploma or a certificate of general equivalency, coupled with low skills in math or reading. In order to make it possible for these educationally disadvantaged individuals to begin to achieve economic self-sufficiency, they need access to tools for developing the skills necessary for achieving their employment goal. The regulations address these concerns. They provide maximum flexibility to provide transitional assistance which moves welfare recipients into unsubsidized employment providing good career potential for achieving economic selfsufficiency. They also encourage effective linkages of welfare agencies, other agencies serving people with disabilities, adult education, and the workforce development system at the State and local operational levels to maximize the use of all available resources and to focus resources on direct assistance to recipients. Additionally, they encourage the use of training interventions only after an individual begins to work to help participants retain their jobs and move toward economic self-sufficiency. Specifically, in order to facilitate coordination between WtW and TANF activities at the State and local level, the regulations do not define or describe the activities which are common to both WtW allowable activities and TANF work activities. That is, the regulations provide no definitions or description for community service, work experience, job creation through public or private sector employment wage subsidies, onthe-job training, or job readiness activities. Job readiness may, however, include training for WtW participants starting their own businesses. It is expected that operating definitions for these activities will be arrived at through partnership between the State and local administering agencies, taking into consideration applicable statutory and regulatory provisions. The regulations do provide examples of post-employment services. Whether an individual is working in a subsidized or unsubsidized job, including selfemployment or participation in a registered apprenticeship program, that individual may be allowed to receive post-employment services, which may include basic education, English as a second language, occupational skills training, and mentoring. While the legislation does not permit stand-alone training activities independent of a job, allowing them as post-employment activities only while the participant is working in a subsidized or unsubsidized job reflects the basic ``work first'' thrust of the legislation, while recognizing the critical importance of continuous skills acquisition and lifelong learning to economic self-sufficiency. These examples of post-employment services are not intended to imply that only educational, training, or mentoring services are allowable as postemployment services. The regulations incorporate the statutory requirement that job readiness, placement, and post-employment services be provided through job vouchers or contracts with public or private providers. Additionally, the requirement, at  645.230(a)(3), that contracts or vouchers for job placement must include a provision to require that at least one-half of the payment occur after an eligible individual has been placed into the workforce for six months, is referenced. Given the needs of the target group for this assistance, the provision of adequate job retention and support services will be critical. Each participant engaged in a job readiness activity, an employment activity, or in any other subsidized or unsubsidized job, including participation in a registered apprenticeship program, will also be allowed to receive appropriate job retention and support services, if such services are not otherwise available. These could include transportation assistance, substance abuse treatment, child care, emergency or short-term housing assistance, disability-related services, or other supportive services. However, these services can be provided with WtW funds only where they are not otherwise available to the participant. For instance, in the area of child care, the operating entity should ensure that WtW funds are not substituted for child care services available from the Child Care and Development Block Grant, TANF funds, and other State and local funds. The availability of transportation services, to get welfare recipients to work, training, and child care, is a significant factor in obtaining and retaining employment. Historically, DHHS and DOL programs have defined transportation in terms of the individual client, and allowed reimbursement for services used rather than for service availability. However, client reimbursement will not work where services do not exist. WtW funds may be used for both purposes. For instance, WtW funds may be used to reimburse individual participants for transportation costs, to enable an administering agency to purchase additional needed services from transportation providers, or alternatively to support, in combination with other funding sources, the development of new transportation services that may be needed in order to connect individuals to jobs. Such services could include: late night and other off peak hour services, shuttle service, guaranteed ride home, van pooling and ridesharing, and specialized transportation services provided by non-profit agencies. WtW funds cannot be substituted for services available or already provided through other sources. However, this is not meant to preclude funding of an individual's access to existing sources. For example, although a transit service may exist, an individual may need financial assistance to afford such transportation.   Federal Register / Vol. 62, No. 222 / Tuesday, November 18, 1997 / Rules and Regulations 61595 Substance abuse treatment is specifically provided as an example of a job retention service because one of the eligibility factors under the hard-toemploy criteria is the need for substance abuse treatment for employment. In arranging for substance abuse treatment, States and localities should coordinate with the Single State Authority (SSA) (and its subcontractors) designated by the Governor to receive and administer the Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment (SAPT) Block Grant administered by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, DHHS. This grant, totaling $1.23 billion in FY 1998, accounts for approximately 40 percent of all substance abuse treatment provided through State agencies. The SSA and its county or regional subcontractors also coordinate with, or actually provide, substance abuse treatment funded through other sources. It is imperative that use of WtW funds for substance abuse treatment be coordinated with other funding sources to provide only services not otherwise available. It is equally important that the expertise of SAPT block grant recipients be utilized in developing a strategy to provide WtW participants with substance abuse treatment services. Regarding substance abuse treatment, States and localities need to be aware that section 408(a)(6) of the Act, which bars the use of Federal TANF funds for medical services, also applies to WtW funds. In many, but not all, instances the treatment of alcohol and drug abuse involves not just ``medical services,'' but other kinds of social and support services as well. Allowing States to use Federal WtW funds for substance abuse treatment is programmatically sound since it addresses the need of a particular target group and may help clients make successful transitions to work. Therefore, WtW funds can be used for drug and alcohol abuse treatment services to the extent that such services are not medical and not otherwise available to the participant. States and localities will have to look at the range of services offered and differentiate between those that are medical and those that are not. For instance, an evaluation of a substance abuser, to determine the appropriate level of care, performed by a member of the medical profession is considered a medical service, as is a medically supervised detoxification program. However, services performed by those not in the medical profession, such as counselors, technicians, social workers, and psychologists, and services not provided in a hospital or clinic, including 24 hour care programs, may be considered non-medical. In short, as in TANF, States and localities cannot use Federal WtW funds for services that the State identifies as medical; they may only use Federal WtW funds for services that are non-medical. States may, however, use their own funds or other funds to provide these services as long as they do not commingle State and Federal funds. Medicare and Medicaid funds may provide another source of funding for medical substance abuse treatment. Individual development accounts (IDAs) are authorized by section 403(a)(5)(C)(v)(I) of the Act. They are described in detail at section 404(h) of the Act, which gives States the option to fund IDAs with TANF, and by extension, WtW funds, for WtW participants. An IDA is an account established by or for an individual to allow the individual to accumulate funds for specific purposes enumerated in the Act, i.e., postsecondary educational expenses, first home purchase, and business capitalization. The Secretary of DHHS is authorized to establish regulations regarding IDAs. Therefore, we are not regulating or providing further guidance in this area. An entity that funds IDAs with WtW grant funds must comply with Section 404(h) of the Act and the applicable DHHS regulations. Lastly, the regulations state that intake, assessment, eligibility determination, the development of an individualized service strategy, and case management are allowable and may be incorporated in the program design of any of the allowable activities. How Do Welfare-to-Work Activities Relate to Activities Provided Under TANF and Other Related Programs? ( 645.225) The regulations require that activities provided through WtW be coordinated effectively with activities being provided through the TANF grant and other related programs. The WtW grants provide a critical tool to help States and local governments achieve their own welfare reform goals and to meet their responsibilities under the Act to reduce welfare caseloads and move welfare recipients into permanent employment and off welfare. WtW must be an integral part of the States' and local governments' overall program of assistance to move welfare recipients into unsubsidized employment. WtW formula grants are intended to work through the operating entity to supplement and enhance their overall capacity for assisting welfare recipients find work and progress toward selfsufficiency. Coordination of resources should include not only those available through WtW and TANF grant funds, and the Child Care and Development Block Grant, but also those available through other related activities and programs, such as the JTPA programs, the State employment service, One-Stop systems, private sector employers, labor organizations, business and trade associations, education agencies, housing agencies, community development corporations, transportation agencies, communitybased and faith-based organizations, disability community organizations, community action agencies, and colleges and universities which provide some of the assistance needed by the targeted population. The regulations require that an assessment of skills, prior work experience, employability, and other relevant information be in place for each WtW participant. This is consistent with the TANF requirement, at section 408(b)(1) of the Act, that an assessment be developed for each recipient of TANF assistance who has attained 18 years of age or has not completed high school or obtained a certificate of high school equivalency, and is not attending secondary school. In order to maximize coordination and minimize duplication of effort, we urge the use of the TANF assessment to meet this requirement where feasible in order to avoid duplicative assessments and unnecessary use of WtW resources. The regulations require that an individualized strategy for transition to unsubsidized employment should be in place for each participant. This requirement is similar to the TANF provision, at section 408(b)(2) of the Act, regarding an individual responsibility plan (IRP). This strategy should take into account the individual's circumstances reflected in the TANF assessment, JTPA individual service strategy or any participant assessment which may have been performed by the operating entity or its agent. The individualized strategy should also include information regarding disabilities since the characteristics associated with longterm welfare dependence can be caused, or contributed to, by a physical, emotional or cognitive disability. The strategy should assure that activities funded through WtW are effectively coordinated with similar activities (e.g., assessment, case management, supportive services, work activities) being funded through TANF and other related programs to address the   61596 Federal Register / Vol. 62, No. 222 / Tuesday, November 18, 1997 / Rules and Regulations individual's needs so that (s)he can obtain and retain unsubsidized employment. In order to maximize coordination and minimize duplication of effort, the regulations also state that, where appropriate, the TANF IRP may be used for this purpose. It is our understanding that most, if not all, States have exercised their option under TANF of implementing an IRP requirement. The statutory guidelines for the content of an IRP, at section 408(b)(2) of the Act, include an employment goal for the individual and a plan for moving the individual into unsubsidized employment as quickly as possible, and for increasing the responsibility and amount of work the individual is to handle over time. The statutory guidelines also include a description of the obligations of the individual and the services to be provided so that the individual will be able obtain and retain employment. In order to avoid duplicative strategies and unnecessary use of staff resources, we urge the use of the TANF IRP as the WtW individualized service strategy where feasible. What General Fiscal and Administrative Rules Apply to the Use of Federal Funds? ( 645.230) This regulation identifies the appropriate DOL regulations which specify the rules applicable to WtW grants in the areas of fiscal and administrative requirements, audit requirements, allowable cost/cost principles, debarment and suspension, drug-free workplace, restrictions on lobbying, and nondiscrimination. In addition, paragraph (a)(3) of this section specifically indicates that the provision at section 403(a)(5)(C)(i) of the Act is a requirement that is imposed in addition to the procurement provisions applicable to an entity awarding a contract or voucher for job placement services. That provision requires that contracts or vouchers for job placement services must include a provision to require that at least one-half of the payment occur after an eligible individual placed into the workforce has been in the workforce for at least 6 months. Consistent with the purpose of the Act, we have interpreted this provision to apply to placement in unsubsidized jobs. We have done this to avoid the unintended consequence of having all subsidized employment last a minimum of six months. Paragraph (a)(4) of this section adds a provision to address PIC conflict of interest which is not addressed by the uniform requirements. Paragraph (a)(5) of this section specifies the requirement that the addition method will be required for the use of program income and that the cost of generating any program income may be deducted in determining the amount of program income earned. In paragraph (c) of this section, the authority to grant or deny prior approval for those selected items of cost which require such approval has been delegated to the Governor. Paragraph (g) of this section sets forth restrictions on nepotism related to individuals being hired into WtW subsidized employment, work experience, on-the-job training positions and the like. What Are the Time Limitations on the Expenditure of Welfare-to-Work Grant Funds? ( 645.233) The regulation specifies the time limitation rules for expenditure of the two types of Federal WtW grant funds: (a) Formula funds--The general rule is that these funds will be available for expenditure for a ``maximum'' period of three years which commences with the effective date of the grant to a State. The grant period will be specified in the Department's formula grant document for each fiscal year of funds provided to the State. (b) Competitive funds--The general rule is that these funds have the potential for being granted for the ``maximum'' three-year period from the effective date of the grant award but are subject to the terms and conditions of the specific grant. For both types of grant funds, any remaining funds unexpended at the end of the approved grant period must be returned to the Department in accordance with the applicable closeout rules and procedures. For purposes of determining the time limitations for expenditure of ``performance bonus'' grants, the provisions applicable to formula funds (excluding match) will apply. What Types of Activities Are Subject to the Administrative Cost Limit on Welfare-to-Work Grants? ( 645.235) Paragraph (a) of the regulation restates the fact that the statute imposes a 15 percent limitation on administrative costs for formula grants to States. For competitive grants, the regulation permits a different limitation, up to a maximum of 15 percent, to be specified in the grant agreement. If no limitation is specified, then the 15 percent limitation on administrative costs will also apply to competitive grants. Paragraphs (b) & (c) spell out the definition of administrative costs for these WtW grants and provide some additional cost classification guidance. Because the local JTPA system is the presumed delivery system for these grants, the regulation uses the JTPA definition of ``administrative costs'' except that paragraph (c)(3) of the regulation incorporates an exception specified at Section 404(b)(2) of the Act. The exception specifically excludes from the administrative cost category the costs of computer hardware and software that is used for tracking and monitoring under a WtW grant. It is only the cost of the assets, however, and not the salaries or wages of staff who use the computers, that is excluded. The regulation also requires that all information technology purchased for WtW grants must be ``year 2000 compliant.'' To meet this requirement, information technology must be able to accurately process date/time data (including, but not limited to, calculating, comparing and sequencing) from, into, and between the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, and the years 1999 and 2000. The information technology must also be able to make leap year calculations. These Interim Final WtW regulations adopt the JTPA definition of the term ``Administrative Costs'' to minimize the burden on PICs. The Secretary notes that she may issue further rules to conform this provision to similar provisions in forthcoming final regulations governing the TANF program. Comments on this subject are invited and would be helpful in assessing the advantages and disadvantages of such a change. What Are the Reporting Requirements for Welfare-to-Work Grants? ( 645.240) This regulation indicates that DOL will issue instructions and formats for financial reporting, that DHHS will issue the instructions for participant reporting, and that DOL will issue supplemental participant reporting requirements for competitive grants. With respect to participant reporting, DOL will, as an interim measure, revise the Standard Program Information Report (SPIR) to incorporate identification of WtW enrollees and WtW activity categories to facilitate the use of a SPIR-based management information system by PICs who choose to use it to manage their WtW funded activities. However, DOL will not require the use or submission of SPIR for WtW. Who is Responsible for Oversight and Monitoring of Welfare-to-Work Grants? ( 645.245) The Secretary of Labor is authorized to provide WtW grants to States and local entities through formula allocations and a competitive process,   Federal Register / Vol. 62, No. 222 / Tuesday, November 18, 1997 / Rules and Regulations 61597 respectively. To ensure that Federal funds are accounted for and used in a permissible manner, the Secretary is responsible for oversight of grant activities and expenditure of grant funds, and may monitor any WtW grant recipient or subrecipient. The regulations provide for Federal and State oversight responsibilities. For formula grants, the Department's monitoring of the States will include a sample of subrecipients. States funded under this program shall develop a statewide monitoring plan and shall make the monitoring plan available for Federal review. In the event that the Secretary determines that a State grant recipient is not in compliance with Federal statutory or regulatory requirements, the Department may provide technical assistance as part of the corrective action process. The Governor is responsible for oversight of formula grants at the substate level. The State monitoring plan shall provide for adequate oversight and should include State policies and procedures for the implementation, operation and management of the program, as well as State monitoring of reporting requirements for WtW substate grants. The State shall ensure compliance with statutory and regulatory requirements of WtW at the substate level. The State monitoring plan should include an annual monitoring schedule and should describe its process for providing technical assistance to substate grantees that are not in compliance with State or Federal requirements. What Procedures Apply to the Resolution of Findings Arising From Audits, Investigations, Monitoring and Oversight Reviews? ( 645.250) The regulation assigns to the Governor the responsibility to resolve subrecipient findings that arise from audits, investigations, monitoring reviews, and the like. If the States have procedures in place that are used for audit resolution, debt collection and appeal for other grant programs, then the existing processes may be used. Otherwise the State must develop and implement such procedures. The regulation reserves to the Secretary the authority for resolution of findings that arise from Federal audits, investigations, incident reports, and monitoring reviews, as well as recipient level OMB Circular A133 audits. The process that will be used is the grant officer initial and final determination process used for other grant programs which is codified at 29 CFR 96.503. Appeals of grant officer final determinations are to be made to the Department's Office of Administrative Law Judges in accordance with the procedures found at 29 CFR 96.603(b). So as to avoid confusion about which procedures apply to nondiscrimination findings, paragraph (c) specifies that findings arising from investigations or reviews conducted under nondiscrimination laws are to be resolved in accordance with those nondiscrimination laws and the applicable implementing regulations. What Nondiscrimination Protections Apply to Participants in Welfare-toWork Programs? ( 645.255) Section 645.255 of the regulations provides that participants in WtW programs have such rights as are available under any applicable Federal, State or local law prohibiting discrimination, including, but not limited to: the Age Discrimination Act of 1975 (42 U.S.C. 6101 et seq.); Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1975 (Section 504)(29 U.S.C. 794); the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) (42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq.) and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VI)(42 U.S.C. 2000d et seq.). ETA is not responsible for administering any civil rights laws. Rather, it is the Civil Rights Center (CRC), formerly the Directorate of Civil Rights, within the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Administration and Management, that has the responsibility to enforce such laws as the Age Discrimination Act of 1975, Section 504 and Title VI, with respect to recipients of federal financial assistance from the Department. Additionally, the CRC is responsible for processing complaints alleging violations of the ADA by all State and local government programs, services, and regulatory activities relating to labor and the workforce. Section 645.255 of the regulations further provides that complaints alleging discrimination, except for those alleging gender discrimination in violation of  645.255(d), shall be processed in accordance with applicable regulations. For example, WtW recipients who are not also JTPA grant recipients should process complaints that allege discrimination based on race, color or national origin in violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 in accordance with the Department's Title VI regulation at 29 CFR part 31 by forwarding all such complaints to the CRC (Address at the end of this paragraph.). Similarly, WtW recipients who are not also JTPA grant recipients should process complaints that allege discrimination based upon disability in violation of Section 504 in accordance with 29 CFR 32.45(b), i.e., using the complaint procedures established pursuant to that section. WtW recipients who are also JTPA grant recipients should process complaints of discrimination under procedures established pursuant to 29 CFR 34.42. 29 CFR 34.42 establishes the procedures under which JTPA grant recipients shall process complaints involving violations of the JTPA nondiscrimination and equal opportunity provisions. Since many WtW grant recipients will be PICs and other entities with experience operating programs under JTPA, the Department has determined that, in order to avoid administrative burdens, such entities shall process WtW discrimination complaints under these procedures rather than require that they comply with two different sets of procedures. (Recipients of financial assistance from the Department should be aware that the DOL regulations, at 29 CFR Parts 31, 32, and 34, also require that programs and activities meet certain administrative obligations. Among those is the responsibility to notify participants of their rights under nondiscrimination laws (e.g., Title VI, Section 504 and the Age Discrimination Act), including the right to file a complaint with the CRC. Individuals with questions about the requirements of these nondiscrimination laws, or concerns about compliance by individual WtW programs with these laws, should address their comments or concerns to the Director, Civil Rights Center, U.S. Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue, NW, Room N4123, Washington, D.C. 20210.) Both Section 408(d) of the PRWORA and its legislative history, as reflected in H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 725, 104 Cong., 2nd Sess. 293 (1996), clarify that recipients are subject to Federal enforcement mechanisms. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 amended the PRWORA. It provides for, among other things, a new civil rights protection against gender discrimination. This provision ensures that participants who may not be covered under either Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 or Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, are protected against gender discrimination. The PRWORA, as amended, requires States to have grievance procedures to process complaints alleging gender discrimination. The legislative history makes clear that gender-based discrimination is the only civil rights matter that the legislation required to be resolved through a State grievance procedure. See H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 217, 105th Cong., 1st Sess. 935937 (1997). Other civil rights matters are to be resolved in accordance with the   61598 Federal Register / Vol. 62, No. 222 / Tuesday, November 18, 1997 / Rules and Regulations applicable statutes and regulations listed in the preceding paragraph. What Health and Safety Provisions Apply to Participants in Welfare-toWork Programs? ( 645.260) The regulation restates the health and safety provisions which are found in section 403(a)(5)(J)(ii) of the Act and specifies that participants alleging a violation of these standards may file a complaint using the State's legislatively mandated grievance system. The Department interprets the statutory phrase ``work activity'' to refer to the allowable employment activities provided for at  645.220(b) of this part. What Safeguards Are There to Ensure That Participants in Welfare-to-Work Employment Activities do not Displace Other Employees? ( 645.265) Section 403(a)(5)(J) of the Act provides protections to ensure that employees are not displaced by WtW participants engaged in a work activity. The Department interprets the phrase ``work activity'' to refer to the allowable employment activities provided for at  645.220(b) of this part. The regulation incorporates the statutory prohibition, in section 403(a)(5)(J)(i) of the Act, against allowing WtW participants to be enrolled in employment activities which violate existing contracts for services or collective bargaining agreements. Where an employment activity would violate a collective bargaining agreement, the regulations provide that the appropriate affected labor organization and employer must provide written concurrence before the employment activity can be undertaken. The regulations also incorporate the statutory prohibition against allowing an individual participating in employment activities under the WtW program from displacing another employee. Employment activities shall not result in the employment or assignment of a WtW participant or the filling of a position when any other person is on layoff from the same or substantially equivalent job within the same organizational unit. The use of the phrase ``within the same organizational unit'' further clarifies the parameters for the concept of ``a substantially equivalent job''. The employment or assignment of a WtW participant or the filling of a position is prohibited when an employer has terminated any regular, unsubsidized employee or otherwise reduced its workforce with the intent of filling the vacancy with a WtW program participant. In addition, a WtW participant may not be employed or assigned to a position where the employer has caused an involuntary reduction to less than full time in hours of an employee in the same or substantially equivalent job. Consistent with the goal of this program, which is to place participants in employment which will eventually lead to their economic self-sufficiency, we encourage the States to safeguard the current workforce, while aggressively promoting the creation of employment opportunities for welfare recipients. The State's goal should be the expansion of its workforce through the creation of additional new jobs. The regulations also specify that grievances regarding displacement may be filed using the State's legislatively mandated grievance system. What Procedures Are There To Ensure That Currently Employed Workers May File Grievances Regarding Displacement and That Welfare-to-Work Participants in Employment Activities May File Grievances Regarding Displacement, Health and Safety Standards and Gender Discrimination? ( 645.270) The regulations reflect the statutory language concerning the requirement that a State must establish a grievance system for regular, unsubsidized employees regarding displacement and for participants in the WtW program regarding displacement, health and safety standards and gender discrimination. The statute requires that the grievance system must provide an opportunity for a hearing, an appeal, and a final determination within 120 days of the original filing date of the complaint. The regulations give the State the option of including in the grievance system an opportunity for informal resolution prior to the formal hearing. The regulations also provide that in developing its grievance system, the State must specify the time period and format for the hearing and the appeal portions of the procedure. The informal resolution and hearing steps in the grievance procedure may occur at either the State or SDA level. This section of the regulations also restates the statutory provision concerning the designation of a State agency, independent of the State or local agency responsible for administering or supervising the administration of State TANF and WtW programs, to hear appeals. Subpart C--Additional Formula Grant Administrative Requirements and Procedures What Constitutes an Allowable Match? ( 645.300) A State will be awarded a total of $2 in WtW formula grant funds for each $1 in State matching expenditures up to the maximum amount that the State is entitled to receive under the WtW allotment formula. If the State chooses to propose a lesser amount of match than would be required in order for it to receive the full allotment, it may do so. In such cases, the amount of the Federal WtW grant will be reduced accordingly. The regulation authorizes the States to use the uniform financial and administrative requirements, codified at 29 CFR 97.24 (the Common Rule), regarding match allowability and documentation, except that no more than one-half of the match may be in the form of in-kind contributions. We will allow 50 percent of the required match to be in-kind contributions in order to encourage the participation of private non-profit and faith-based organizations in efforts to assist individuals transition from welfare to unsubsidized employment and economic selfsufficiency. These organizations can offer significant resources, especially inkind services, to assist WtW program participants. Cash donations from non-Federal third parties that are used to pay for allowable costs of the WtW grant program will be considered as cash match, and not counted as in-kind contributions. Matching funds include those State and local dollars in excess of funds spent to meet the TANF MOE requirement when those funds are spent on WtW eligible individuals and activities. Matching requirements may not be met by the use of employers' share of participant wage payments, e.g., the employer's share of OJT. The planning guidance issued for FY98 reiterated the legislative provision requiring that the total matching funds must be expended during the FY in which the WtW grant is awarded. A legislative amendment eliminating this requirement and permitting the expenditure of matching funds over the same three-year period as Federal funds is being considered by Congress. The final rule will reflect the action taken by the Congress with respect to this amendment. If match expenditures do not satisfy the requirement for the full level of Federal funds, the grant amount will be reduced by an appropriate corresponding amount.   Federal Register / Vol. 62, No. 222 / Tuesday, November 18, 1997 / Rules and Regulations 61599 Paragraph (c)(7) of the regulation indicates that the burden-of-proof for substantiating match expenditures is to be borne by the recipient of a WtW grant based on its own records and/or those of its subrecipients. What Assurances Must a State Provide That It Will Make the Required Matching Expenditures? ( 645.310) This regulation restates the planning guidance which requires a State to provide a written estimate of planned matching expenditures in its State plan and to describe the process by which the funds will be tracked and reported to ensure that the State meets its projected match. What Actions Are To Be Taken if a State Fails To Make the Required Matching Expenditures? ( 645.315) This regulation requires the Department to implement an annual reconciliation and grant adjustment process for WtW grants. The reconciliation will be based on reported match expenditures made through the end of the FY, as specified in the required report due 45 days after the end of each fiscal year. If the end-offiscal-year report has not been received by December 1 of that year, then the reconciliation will be based on the most current report received. In addition, each FY the Department will evaluate second quarter matching expenditures to determine the status of each State's expenditures compared with planned match. DOL will alert and consult with States that appear to be underexpending matching funds concerning the possibility of reducing the grant to reallot funds if match requirements are not met. When Will Formula funds be Reallotted and What Reallotment Procedures Will the Secretary Use? ( 645.320) This section describes the reconciliation process that the Department will use for determining whether or not a State has expended the required level of matching funds and the process for reallotment of funds that become available as a result of underexpenditure of the required match or failure to fully obligate funds by either States or substate entities. Funds are fully obligated by States when they are awarded to the substate entities. Subpart D--State Formula Grants Administration Under What Conditions May the Governor Request an Alternate Administering Agency at the Local Level? ( 645.400) The regulations reflect the WtW legislative intent to assign PICs, in cooperation with Chief Elected Officials (CEOs), a presumptive role as the administering agencies for the WtW program at the local level. The Act also provides the Governor authority to select an alternate administrative agency and to request from the Secretary a waiver of the statutory provision that PICs have the sole authority to expend funds for the program at the local level. The Governor may request such a waiver in the State's annual plan and must provide information indicating how the selection of the alternate agency will improve the effectiveness or efficiency of the program in each substate area. In presenting the rationale, pursuant to section 403(a)(5)(A)(vii)(III) of the Act, the Governor shall provide such information as (s)he deems is necessary to establish that the designated alternate agency would improve the effectiveness or efficiency of the administration of the funds in each SDA. The Department intends for the Governors to have maximum flexibility on what should be included in their presentation(s) of the reason(s) for the selection of an alternate administering agency at the local level. While no specific format is provided, it is suggested the Governor include, as part of the rationale for the selection of an alternate administering agency, information regarding the PIC's performance, administrative capacity, or whether the PIC has turned down the WtW role; and information on the alternate agency's capacity and fiscal integrity. In addition, the Governor is to provide copies of any comments from the CEOs regarding the Governor's selection of the alternate agency. In addition, the Governor must request a waiver if, during the operation of the local WtW program, s(he) determined that the PIC, or alternate agency, which is administering WtW has not coordinated its expenditures with expenditure of funds provided to the State under TANF. Whenever the Governor requests a waiver, the Governor is to provide a copy of such request to the PIC and CEO of the affected SDA. The Governor shall bear the burden of proving that the proposed designated alternate agency, rather than the PIC, would improve the effectiveness or efficiency of the administration of WtW funds in the SDA. The Secretary shall assess the information provided by the Governor, as well as any input from the affected CEOs, in reaching a decision on the granting of the waiver requested. The regulations provide the PIC and CEO 15 days in which to respond to the Governor's waiver request and submit written comments to the Department. The Secretary's decision on the Governor's request constitutes final agency action and is not subject to further administrative review. It is the Department's position, consistent with section 403(a)(5)(A)(vii)(I) of the Act, that in WtW programs the PICs have the same policy guidance and oversight functions as the PICs have under the JTPA. In service delivery areas where, pursuant to the PIC/CEO agreement, the PIC is not the ``administrative entity'' or the ``grant recipient'' (see JTPA sections 4(2) and 103(b)(1)(B)), the PICs will exercise the authority specified in the WtW legislation. In such situations, consistent with section 403(a)(5)(A)(vii)(I) of the Act, the PIC can use the current JTPA administering agency or grant recipient to disburse WtW funds and manage the program. Finally, in situations where the alternate administering agency selected and approved by the Secretary is neither the SDA's administrative entity nor the SDA's grant recipient entity, the Department intends for the alternate agency to take steps to ensure the CEO(s) continues to be consulted on WtW service strategies and activities planned for the SDA. What Elements Will the State Use in Distributing Funds Within the State? ( 645.410) The regulations follow closely the statutory provisions concerning the Governor's responsibility to distribute funds to the SDAs in the State. The Act requires the Governors to establish a formula to distribute funds to the SDAs in the State and specifies the use of up to three formula factors described at section 403(a)(5)(A)(vi)(I) of the Act. The Governor's formula cannot contain any additional formula factors. In developing the Governor's formula, the statute requires that a weight of no less than 50 percent be given to the following factor: the number by which the population of the area with an income less than the poverty line exceeds 7.5 percent of the total population of the area, compared to all such numbers for all SDAs in the State. This means that at least 50 percent of the funds must be distributed to SDAs based on this factor. If the Governor   61600 Federal Register / Vol. 62, No. 222 / Tuesday, November 18, 1997 / Rules and Regulations chooses not to use this factor in distributing the rest of the funds, these funds may be distributed to an SDA based on one or both of the following factors: an SDA's share of the number of adults receiving assistance under TANF, or the predecessor program, in the SDA for at least 30 months (whether consecutive or not), relative to the number of such adults residing in the State; or an SDA's share of the number of unemployed individuals residing in the SDA, relative to the number of such individuals residing State. If the Governor chooses to use one or both of these additional factors, s(he) may not distribute more that 50 percent of the funds on the basis of these factors. In circumstances where the Governor's formula allocation to an SDA is less than $100,000, those amounts are added to the funds retained at the State level, thereby increasing the amount of funds which may be retained at the State above the 15 percent level. However, in cases where the distribution formula would allocate at least $100,000 to an SDA, those amounts must be allocated to the SDA within 30 days of the date the State receives its Federal allotment. For guidance in determining the number of individuals with income less than the poverty line, the regulations point the States to section 403(a)(5)(D) of the Act. This section instructs States to use the methodology used by the Bureau of the Census to produce and publish intercensal poverty data for States and counties. The Department is aware that the Bureau of the Census in March of 1997 produced an intercensal report containing State and county data estimates of the number of individuals in poverty and poverty rates for 1993. States should use this data, or comparable more recent data published by the Bureau, to determine the number of individuals below the poverty line who exceed 7.5 percent of the total population of the area. For areas for which 1993 intercensal data is not produced and published by the Bureau of the Census, Governors may use 1990 Census poverty data, in conjunction with the intercensal poverty data for related jurisdictions, where appropriate, as a basis for determining the poverty data for those areas. The Governor is to use the most recent year for which poverty data is available when determining the number of individuals below the poverty line and should use data for the most recent 12-month period when determining the number of adults receiving assistance for at least 30 months. This section also sets forth the statutory authority of the PICs (or alternate administering agency) to determine, within their respective service delivery areas, the eligible individuals and the allowable activities upon which to expend their withinState fund allocation. The Department expects that a PIC's targeting of eligible individuals and the selection of service strategies will reflect the needs of the target population and the local employment opportunities, and are coordinated with State TANF expenditures. Up to 15 percent of the funds allotted to the State may be retained by the State for projects to transition long-term recipients into unsubsidized jobs. For a full discussion of what other requirements are applicable to funds retained by the State, please refer to the preamble discussions of  645.210 through 645.225. The regulations clarify that the Governor may utilize PICs, as well other entities, such as One-Stop systems, private sector employers, labor organizations, business and trade associations, education agencies, housing agencies, community development corporations, transportation agencies, communitybased and faith-based organizations, disability community organizations, community action agencies, and colleges and universities, to operate projects for long-term recipients to enter unsubsidized jobs. The Department intends for the Governors to develop guidelines on such matters as project application criteria, project design criteria, project outcome goals, project placement expectations, project duration, etc. The Department intends for the Governors to have maximum flexibility in the management and operation of the funds retained by the State, consistent with statutory requirements, to enable the Governors to fund projects that support and complement the Governors' and the PICs' strategies to transition welfare recipients into unsubsidized jobs and economic self-sufficiency. WtW legislation. Once the plan is accepted, the Department will provide funding to the State. Where a State includes in its plan a request to use an agency other than the PIC to administer the program locally, the Secretary will carefully assess waiver requests for each local jurisdiction and will grant a waiver if the Secretary determines that the designated alternate agency will more effectively or efficiently administer the WtW grant funds for that area. The Secretary will use the information submitted by the Governor as well as input from the affected PICs and CEOs in the decision-making process. The Secretary's decision whether to grant a waiver shall be considered final agency administrative action. What Factors Will Be Used in Measuring State Performance? ( 645.420) This regulation advises that the Secretary will develop and issue a formula that will be used to measure State performance and to serve as the basis for the award of performance grants in FY 2000. The formula will be developed in consultation with DHHS, the National Governors Association (NGA), and the American Public Welfare Association (APWA), and will be published in mid-1998. As required by section 403(a)(5)(E), the formula will be the basis used to measure the success of States in placing individuals in private sector employment or any kind of employment, the duration of such placements, any increase in earnings of such individuals, and other additional factors that the Secretary of Labor deems to be appropriate. What Are the Roles and Responsibilities of the State(s) and PIC(s)? ( 645.425)  This section of the regulations enumerates a number of State and PIC roles and responsibilities embedded in the WtW statute. During the What Planning Information Must a State consultation process conducted by the Submit in Order to Receive a Formula Department to gather input on WtW Grant? ( 645.415) policy development, there were a number of requests for the Department The regulation follows section 403(a)(5)(ii) of the Act and specifies that to explain and clarify the State and PIC roles. The Department believes this a State must provide an annual plan to section of the regulation is responsive to the Secretary for each fiscal year it wishes to receive funding. The format of those requests and highlights the key responsibilities at the State and local the State plan, as well as the date for level. It does not attempt to create submission, will be established by the arbitrary divisions since it is our view Secretary and provided to the States. that coordination among State agencies The plan will be an addendum to the TANF plan and will be submitted to the and programs (e.g., TANF, employment service, One-Stop centers), and local Secretaries of Labor and Health and agencies and programs (e.g., PICs, JTPA Human Services. The Department will review the State Title IIA) is essential to meeting the plan and will accept it as complete if the goals of the WtW legislation and that the plan demonstrates compliance with the methods and mechanisms established to   Federal Register / Vol. 62, No. 222 / Tuesday, November 18, 1997 / Rules and Regulations 61601 combine resources and mount a coordinated effort to serve WtW participants will necessarily vary according to State/local needs and established relationships. In general, it is our view that, under the Act, the State has the primary responsibility for ensuring that WtW programs are consistent with and well coordinated with services under TANF, and that local entities are in the best position to decide the participants to be targeted and the service mix most appropriate for the participants. Consistent with statutory provisions, the State may not restrict PICs from exercising their authority to expend funds on the statutorily eligible populations. PICs, therefore, have authority to determine the individuals to be served in the service delivery areas. Subpart E--Welfare-To-Work Competitive Grants Who Are Eligible Applicants for Competitive Grant Funds? ( 645.500) According to the Act, in order to be eligible to apply for competitive grant funds, an organization must be a PIC for an SDA in a State, a political subdivision of a State (e.g., cities, counties), or a private entity applying in conjunction with the PIC or political subdivision. The proposal must be developed in consultation with the Governor. The Department defines the term ``in conjunction with'' to mean that the application submitted by a private entity must include a signed certification by both the applicant and either the applicable PIC or political subdivision that the relevant PIC/ political subdivision has been consulted during the development of the application and that the activities proposed in the application are consistent with, and will be coordinated with, the WtW efforts of the PIC/ political subdivision. We believe that this definition of ``in conjunction with'' provides sufficient flexibility for private nonprofit entities, such as community development corporations, community-based and faith-based organizations, disability community organizations, community action agencies, and public and private colleges and universities, to apply for funds, while ensuring that adequate coordination with the ongoing WtW formula program occurs. Our requirement for consultation and certification reiterates the Department's emphasis on collaboration and integration of resources at the local level. We are also interpreting ``private entity'' to be any qualified organization, public or private, which is neither a PIC nor a political subdivision of a State. The legislative intent, however, is that competitive grants are for projects which are community based and responsive to the circumstances in a local community. Therefore, an application for competitive grant funds will be judged for its connection and responsiveness to a local community. Although the Department considers local collaboration to be critical to the development of a WtW proposal, in some limited cases, providing evidence of such a collaborative effort may not be possible. In these cases, where a private entity cannot obtain certification from the PIC/political subdivision, the applicant must certify, and provide information indicating, that the PIC/ political subdivision has been provided a sufficient opportunity to cooperate in the development of the application and has not acted within a reasonable period of time. The Department believes that 30 days is a sufficient period of time in which a private entity can expect a response from the PIC or political subdivision. This requirement applies to all PICs or political subdivisions included in the area to be served by the proposed project. What Is the Required Consultation With the Governor? ( 645.510) All applicants for competitive grants, including PICs and political subdivisions, must submit their application to the Governor or the designated State administrative entity for the WtW program for review and comment prior to submission of the application to the Secretary. We have defined sufficient time for review and comment at the State level to be at least 15 days. For applications from private entities, the 15 day comment period must be consecutive to the 30 day period for obtaining evidence of collaboration and support from the PIC or political subdivision. What Are the Program and Administrative Requirements That Apply to Both the Formula Grants and Competitive Grants? ( 645.515) The regulations indicate that all of the general program and administrative requirements that apply to the WtW formula grants also apply to the competitive grants. Competitive grants will be subject to additional reporting and monitoring requirements, however, which will be tailored to the scope of work of the specific grants. What Are the Application Procedures and Timeframes for Competitive Grant Funds? ( 645.520) The Secretary shall establish appropriate application procedures, selection criteria and an approval process to ensure that grant awards accomplish the statutory purposes of the competitive grant funds and that available funds are used in an effective manner. We anticipate that more than one application and award process will occur in each fiscal year of the WtW program. Grant application procedures will be published in the Federal Register for each round of competitive grants. What Special Consideration Will Be Given to Rural Areas and Cities With Large Concentrations of Poverty? ( 645.525) Competitive grant awards will be targeted to areas of significant need, especially rural areas and cities with large concentrations of residents living in poverty. Subpart F--Administrative Appeal Process What Administrative Remedies Are Available Under This Part? ( 645.800) The WtW statute contains provisions (e.g., those addressing the allowable use of funds) which contemplate the exercise of discretion by ETA. It is reasonable to anticipate that there will be instances where parties will seek to overturn decisions made by the Agency. This section sets the administrative procedures available where a party seeks review of a Grant Officer determination that imposes a sanction or corrective action, pursuant to  645.250(b) of this part. Paragraph (a) provides that an adverse decision by a Grant Officer may be appealed, within 21 days of the Grant Officer's final determination, to the Department of Labor's Office of Administrative Law Judges. The parties present their cases before an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) who develops the record for the proceeding, making findings of fact and of law. Such proceedings are relatively informal, utilizing relaxed rules of evidence. For example, a Notice of Appeal functions simply as the invocation of a party's right to administrative review of an Agency decision, rather than as a formal complaint. Paragraph (b) of this section provides that the ALJ's decision regarding a case arising under this section constitutes final agency action for the purpose of judicial review, unless, within 20 days of the ALJ's decision, a dissatisfied   61602 Federal Register / Vol. 62, No. 222 / Tuesday, November 18, 1997 / Rules and Regulations party petitions the Administrative Review Board (ARB) for review. Review by the ARB is discretionary, so paragraph (b) of this section provides that the ALJ's decision constitutes final Agency action unless the ARB notifies the parties, within 30 days of the filing of the petition for review, that the case has been accepted for review. Further, the ALJ's decision constitutes final Agency action if the ARB has not decided the case arising under this section within 120 days of acceptance for review. III. Regulatory Flexibility and Executive Order The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, as amended in 1996 (5 U.S.C. Chapter 6), requires the Federal government to anticipate and minimize the impact of rules and paperwork requirements on small entities. ``Small entities'' are defined as small businesses (those with fewer than 500 employees, except where otherwise provided), small non-profit organizations (those with fewer than 500 employees, except where otherwise provided) and small governmental entities (those in areas with fewer than 50,000 residents). ETA has assessed the potential impact of the draft Interim Final Rule, consulting with a wide range of small entities, in order to identify any areas of concern. Based on that assessment, the Agency certifies that the Interim Final Rule, as promulgated, will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. As indicated in the Background Section (Section I, above), the WtW Interim Final Rule implements grant programs that enhance the resources available to States and PICs or the additional WtW financial resources targeted to hard-to-employ welfare recipients and which will assist in efforts to move these individuals into lasting unsubsidized jobs. ETA has minimized any potential burdens for grant applicants and recipients in order to maximize the resources that will be applied to achieve the purposes of the WtW program. The Agency has further ameliorated any foreseeable burdens by providing (at  645.235 of the Interim Final Rule) that a grantee can allocate up to 15 percent of a grant award for management and administration of the grant, rather than for the direct provision of services to participants. The Agency has determined that the incremental costs of applying for or administering WtW grants will be minimal, because applicants and grantees will, in general, already be familiar with the grant process due to involvement in existing TANF and JTPA programs. Further, ETA has concluded that any such costs will not place small entities at a disadvantage in relation to larger entities, with regard to obtaining formula grants or competitive grants. Therefore, it is unnecessary to set alternative requirements for small entities. In addition, pursuant to the Small Business Regulatory Fairness Act (SBREFA) (5 U.S.C. Chapter 8), the Agency has screened the Interim Final Rule and has determined that it is not a ``major rule,'' as defined in 5 U.S.C. 804(2). IV. Executive Order 12866 Pursuant to Executive Order 12866, the Agency has evaluated the Interim Final Rule and has determined its provisions are consistent with the statement of regulatory philosophy and principles promulgated by the Executive Order. The Department of Labor is required to prescribe regulations for the WtW program within 90 days of the enactment of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. Within this limited time frame, the Department has made every reasonable effort to obtain input in a purposeful manner from a variety of interested parties (State and local government officials, community-based organizations, and the general public). The WtW grant program increases the resources available to the public and private organizations that promote longterm employment and family selfsufficiency. The Agency has determined the Interim Final Rule will not have an adverse effect in a material way on the nation's economy. ETA has developed the Interim Final Rule in close consultation with the Departments of HHS, HUD, and Transportation, and with other responsible Federal agencies. Based on that consultation, the Agency has determined the Interim Final Rule will not create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with any action taken or planned by another agency. The Agency has also assessed the impact of the WtW State match requirement and has determined it will not materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements and grants. States will receive $2 dollars in WtW grant funds for each $1 in State matching expenditures up to the State WtW fund allotment. Further, ETA has determined that up to 50 percent of the State matching effort can be ``in kind'' (goods and services provided in lieu of cash), allowing the States additional flexibility in qualifying for formula funds. Overall, as discussed above, the Department has determined that the Interim Final Rule is not unduly burdensome and that the impacts and consequences are non-material for States, local governmental entities and other potentially interested parties. The Agency finds that this Interim Final Rule raises novel policy issues and thus constitutes a significant regulatory action which has been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget for the purposes of Executive Order 12866. V. Unfunded Mandates The Interim Final Rule has been reviewed in accordance with the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA) (2 U.S.C. 1501 et seq.) and Executive Order 12875. Section 202 of UMRA requires that a covered agency prepare a budgetary impact statement before promulgating a rule that includes any Federal mandate that may result in the expenditure by State, local and Tribal governments, in the aggregate, or by the private sector, of $100 million or more in any one year. If a covered agency must prepare a budgetary impact statement, section 205 of UMRA further requires that it select the most cost-effective and least burdensome alternative that achieves the objectives of the rule and is consistent with the statutory requirements. In addition, section 203 of UMRA requires a plan for informing and advising any small government that may be significantly or uniquely impacted. ETA has determined that the WtW Interim Final Rule will not regulate the expenditure by the State, local, and Tribal governments, in the aggregate, or by the private sector, of more than $100 million in any one year (Tribal governments are covered by a separate Interim Final Rule for which a separate Unfunded Mandates statement has been prepared). Accordingly, the Agency has not prepared a budgetary impact statement, specifically addressed the regulatory alternatives considered, or prepared a plan for informing and advising any significant or uniquely impacted small government. VI. Effective Date and Absence of Notice and Comment The Employment and Training Administration has determined, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B), that the statutory mandate to promulgate regulations within 90 days of the enactment of the statute constitutes good cause for waiving notice and comment proceedings. In addition, the Agency has determined, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3), that the WtW statutory mandate provides good cause for waiving the customary requirement to   Federal Register / Vol. 62, No. 222 / Tuesday, November 18, 1997 / Rules and Regulations 61603 delay the effective date of a final rule for 30 days following its publication. The short statutory duration of the WtW program underscores the importance of beginning the disbursement of WtW funds at the earliest possible date. Accordingly, the issuance of a proposed rule, rather than an interim final rule, (or delaying the effective date for 30 days) would be contrary to the public interest. The Interim Final Rule sets a comment period to elicit any concerns raised by the Rule. ETA has limited the comment period to 60 days so that any input is received in time for the Agency to review it in considering any revisions to Part 645 while the WtW program is still in its early steps of operation.

Subpart C--Additional Formula Grant Administrative Standards and Procedures  645.300 match? What constitutes an allowable  (a) A State is entitled to receive two (2) dollars of Federal funds for every  one (1) dollar of State match expenditures, up to the amount available for allotment to the State based on the State's percentage for WtW formula grant for the fiscal year. The State is not required to provide a level of match necessary to support the total amount available to it based on the State's percentage for WtW formula grant. However, if the proposed match is less than the amount required to support the full level of federal funds, the grant amount will be reduced accordingly (section 403(a)(5)(A)(i)(I) of the Act). (b) States shall follow the match or cost-sharing requirements of the ``Common Rule'' Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Cooperative Agreements to State and Local Governments (codified for DOL at 29 CFR 97.24). Paragraphs (b)(1) (i) and (ii), (b)(3), (b)(4) and (c)(1) of this section are in addition to the common rule requirements. Also, paragraphs included in the common rule which relate to the use of donated buildings and other real property as match have been excluded from this provision. (1) Only costs that would be allowable if paid for with WtW grant funds will be accepted as match. (i) Because the use of Federal funds is prohibited for construction or purchase of facilities or buildings except where there is explicit statutory authority permitting it, costs incurred for the construction or purchase of facilities or buildings shall not be acceptable as match for a WtW grant. (ii) Because the costs of construction or purchase of facilities or buildings are unallowable as match, the donation of a building or property as a third party inkind contribution is also unallowable as a match for a WtW grant. (2) A match or cost-sharing requirement may be satisfied by either or both of the following: (i) Allowable costs incurred by the grantee, subgrantee or a cost type contractor under the assistance agreement. This includes allowable cost borne by non-Federal grants or by others and cash donations from non-Federal third parties. (ii) The value of third party in-kind contributions applicable to the FY period to which the cost-sharing or matching requirement apply. (3) No more than one-half (1/2) of the total match expenditures may be in the form of third party in-kind contributions. (4) Match expenditures must be recorded in the books of account of the entity that incurred the cost or received the contribution. These amounts may be   61610 Federal Register / Vol. 62, No. 222 / Tuesday, November 18, 1997 / Rules and Regulations rolled up and reported as aggregate State level match. (c) Qualifications and exceptions. (1) The matching requirements may not be met by the use of an employer's share of participant wage payments (e.g., employer share of OJT wages). (2) Costs borne by other Federal grant agreements. A cost-sharing or matching requirement may not be met by costs borne by another Federal grant. This prohibition does not apply to income earned by a grantee or subgrantee from a contract awarded under another Federal grant. (3) General revenue sharing. For the purpose of this section, general revenue sharing funds distributed under 31 U.S.C. 6702 are not considered Federal grant funds. (4) Cost or contributions counted towards other Federal cost-sharing requirements. Neither costs nor the values of third party in-kind contributions may count towards satisfying a cost-sharing or matching requirement of a grant agreement if they have been or will be counted towards satisfying a cost-sharing or matching requirement of another Federal grant agreement, a Federal procurement contract, or any other award of Federal funds. (5) Costs financed by program income. Costs financed by program income, as defined in 29 CFR 97.25, shall not count towards satisfying a cost-sharing or matching requirement unless they are expressly permitted in the terms of the assistance agreement. (This use of general program income is described in  97.25(g)). (6) Services or property financed by income earned by contractors. Contractors under a grant may earn income from the activities carried out under the contract in addition to the amounts earned from the party awarding the contract. No costs of services or property supported by this income may count toward satisfying a cost-sharing or matching requirement unless other provisions of the grant agreement expressly permit this kind of income to be used to meet the requirement. (7) Records. Costs and third party inkind contributions counting towards satisfying a cost-sharing or matching requirement must be verifiable from the records of grantees and subgrantee or cost-type contractors. These records must show how the value placed on third party in-kind contributions was derived. To the extent feasible, volunteer services will be supported by the same methods that the organization uses to support the allocability of regular personnel costs. (8) Special standards for third party in-kind contributions. (i) Third party inkind contributions count towards satisfying a cost-sharing or matching requirement only where, if the party receiving the contributions were to pay for them, the payments would be allowable costs. (ii) Some third party in-kind contributions are goods and services that, if the grantee, subgrantee, or contractor receiving the contribution had to pay for them, the payments would have been an indirect costs. Cost sharing or matching credit for such contributions shall be given only if the grantee, subgrantee, or contractor has established, along with its regular indirect cost rate, a special rate for allocating to individual projects or programs the value of the contributions. (iii) A third party in-kind contribution to a fixed-price contract may count towards satisfying a cost-sharing or matching requirement only if it results in: (A) An increase in the services or property provided under the contract (without additional cost to the grantee or subgrantee) or (B) A cost savings to the grantee or subgrantee. (iv) The values placed on third party in-kind contributions for cost-sharing or matching purposes will conform to the rules in the succeeding sections of this part. If a third party in-kind contribution is a type not treated in those sections, the value placed upon it shall be fair and reasonable. (d) Valuation of donated services. (1) Volunteer services. Unpaid services provided to a grantee or subgrantee by individuals will be valued at rates consistent with those ordinarily paid for similar work in the grantee's or subgrantee's organization. If the grantee or subgrantee does not have employees performing similar work, the rates will be consistent with those ordinarily paid by other employers for similar work in the same labor market. In either case, a reasonable amount for fringe benefits may be included in the valuation. (2) Employees of other organizations. When an employer other than a grantee, subgrantee, or cost-type contractor furnishes free of charge the services of an employee in the employee's normal line of work, the services will be valued at the employee's regular rate of pay exclusive of the employee's fringe benefits and overhead costs. If the services are in a different line of work, paragraph (d)(1) of this section applies. (e) Valuation of third party donated supplies and loaned equipment or space. (1) If a third party donates supplies, the contribution will be valued at the market value of the supplies at the time of donation. (2) If a third party donates the use of equipment or space in a building but retains title, the contribution will be valued at the fair rental rate of the equipment or space.  645.310 What assurance must a State provide that it will make the required matching expenditures?  In its State plan, a State must provide a written estimate of planned matching expenditures and describe the process by which the funds will be tracked and reported to ensure that the State meets its projected match (section 403(a)(5)(A)(i)(I) of the Act).  645.315 What actions are to be taken if a State fails to make the required matching expenditures?  (a) The Department will implement an annual reconciliation and grant adjustment for WtW grants. (1) The reconciliation will be based on reported match expenditures through the end of the FY report, which is due 45 days after the end of the fiscal year. (2) If the end of FY report has not been received by December 1 of that year, then the reconciliation will be based on the most current report received. (b) If match expenditures do not satisfy the requirement of the FY grant, the subsequent FY grant amount will be reduced by the appropriate corresponding amount (i.e., the grant will reduced by two (2) dollars for each one (1) dollar shortfall in State matching funds).  645.320 When will formula funds be reallotted, and what reallotment procedures will the Secretary use?  (a) No reallotment of funds among States will occur during FY 98; (b) For subsequent fiscal years, a reconciliation will be made during the first quarter of the fiscal year under  645.315 of this part to determine whether or not a State has satisfied its required level of matching funds for the prior year. (c) If a State has failed to expend the required level of matching funds, the required reduction in the State grant will be made during the second quarter of the fiscal year. (d) Also, any funds which become available as a result of underexpenditures of required match, or failure to obligate 100 percent of the funds by either States or substate entities by the end of the fiscal year of the grant, will be reallotted among qualifying States (i.e., those which have committed a sufficient match to qualify for additional funds). The reallotment   Federal Register / Vol. 62, No. 222 / Tuesday, November 18, 1997 / Rules and Regulations 61611 will occur during the second quarter of the following fiscal year (section 403(a)(5)(A)(i)(I) of the Act). Subpart D--State Formula Grants Administration  645.400 Under what conditions may the Governor request a waiver to designate an alternate local administering agency?  645.410 What elements will the State use in distributing funds within the State?  (a)(1) The Governor may include in the State's WtW Plan a waiver request to select an agency other than the PIC to administer the program for one or more SDAs in a State; or (2) When the Governor determines the PIC, or alternative agency, has not coordinated its expenditures with the expenditure of funds provided to the State under TANF, pursuant to section 403(a)(5)(A)(vii)(II) of the Act, the Governor shall request a waiver. (b) The Governor shall bear the burden of proving that the designated alternative agency, rather than the PIC or other administering agency, would improve the effectiveness or efficiency of the administration of WtW funds in the SDA. The Governor's waiver request shall include information to meet that burden. The Governor shall provide a copy of the waiver request and any supporting information submitted to the Secretary to the PIC and CEO of the SDA for which an alternative administering agency is requested. (c) The PIC and CEO shall have fifteen (15) days in which to submit his or her written response to the Department. The PIC and CEO shall provide a copy of such response to the Governor. (d) The Secretary will assess the waiver information submitted by the Governor, including input from the PIC and CEO in reaching the decision whether to permit the use of an alternate administrative agency. (e) The Secretary shall approve a waiver request if she determines that the Governor has established that the designated alternative administering agency, rather than the PIC or other administering agency, will improve the effectiveness or efficiency of the administration of WtW funds provided for the benefit of the SDA. (f) Where an alternate administering agency is approved by the Secretary, such administrative entity shall coordinate with the CEO for the applicable SDA(s) regarding the expenditure of WtW grant funds in the SDA(s). (g) The decision of the Secretary to approve or deny a waiver request will be issued promptly and shall constitute final agency action.  (a) Of the WtW funds allotted to the State, not less than 85 percent of the State allotment must be distributed to the SDAs in the State. (1) The State shall prescribe a formula for determining the amount of funds to be distributed to each SDA in the State using no factors other than the three factors described in paragraphs (a)(2) and (3) of this section; (2) The formula prescribed by the Governor must include as one of the formula factors for distributing funds the provision at section 403(a)(5)(A)(vi)(I)(aa) of the Act. The Governor is to distribute funds to an SDA based on the number by which the population of the area with an income that is less than the poverty line exceeds 7.5 percent of the total population of the area, compared to all such numbers in all such areas in the State. The Governor must assign a weight of not less than 50 percent to this factor; (3) The Governor shall distribute the remaining funds, if any, to the SDAs utilizing only one or both of the following factors: (i) The SDA's share of the number of adults receiving assistance under TANF or the predecessor program in the SDA for 30 months or more (whether consecutive or not), relative to the number of such adults residing in the State; (ii) The SDA's share of the number of unemployed individuals residing in the SDA, relative to the number of such individuals residing in the State. (4) If the amount to be distributed to a service delivery area by the Governor's formula is less than $100,000, the funds shall be available to be used by the Governor to fund projects described at paragraph (b) of this section. (5) States shall use the guidance provided at section 403(a)(5)(D) of the Act in determining the number of individuals with an income that is less than the poverty line. (6) PICs (or alternate administering agency) shall determine, pursuant to section 403(a)(5)(A)(vii)(I) of the Act, on which individual(s) and on which allowable activities to expend its WtW fund allocation. (7) The State shall distribute the SDAs' allocations in a timely manner, but not later than 30 days from receipt of the State's fund allotment. (b) Of the funds allocated to the State, up to 15 percent of the funds may be retained at the State level to fund projects that appear likely to help longterm recipients of assistance enter unsubsidized employment. Any additional funds available as a result of  the process described at paragraph (a)(4)of this section, shall also be available to be used to fund projects to help long-term recipients of assistance enter unsubsidized jobs. (c) The Governors may distribute the funds retained pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section to a variety of workforce organizations, in addition to PICs, and other entities such as One-Stop systems, private sector employers, labor organizations, business and trade associations, education agencies, housing agencies, community development corporations, transportation agencies, communitybased and faith-based organizations, disability community organizations, community action agencies, and colleges and universities which provide some of the assistance needed by the targeted population.  645.415 What planning information must a State submit in order to receive a formula grant?  (a) Each State seeking financial assistance under the formula grant portion of the WtW legislation must submit an annual plan meeting the requirements prescribed by the Secretary. This plan shall be in the form of an addendum to the TANF State plan and shall be submitted to the Secretaries of Labor and Health and Human Services. (b) The Secretary shall review the State plan for compliance with the statutory and regulatory provisions of the WtW program. The Secretary's decision whether to accept a State plan as in compliance with the Act shall constitute final agency action. (c) If the Governor has requested a waiver to permit the selection of an alternative administering agency in the State plan, the provisions of  645.400 of this part shall apply (section 403(a)(5)(A)(ii) of the Act).  645.420 What factors will be used in measuring State performance?  (a) State performance will be measured by a formula issued by the Secretary after consultation with DHHS, the National Governors Association (NGA) and the American Public Welfare Association (APWA). (b) The formula shall be the basis for measuring the success of States in placing individuals in private sector employment or any kind of employment, the duration of such placements, any increase in earnings of such individuals and other additional factors that the Secretary of Labor deems to be appropriate. The formula will provide for adjustments due to general economic conditions on a State-by-State basis.   61612 Federal Register / Vol. 62, No. 222 / Tuesday, November 18, 1997 / Rules and Regulations (c) The formula shall serve as the basis for the award of FY 2000 bonus grants based on successful performance (section 403(a)(5)(E) of the Act).  645.425 What are the roles and responsibilities of the State(s) and PIC(s)?

In a preaward review, the desk audit is normally conducted onsite (also  see Section 3C).    2A01  PURPOSE OF DESK AUDITS     Desk audits are a major component of compliance reviews.  By careful and  systematic review of the documents and materials provided by covered contractors  and subcontractors, the Equal Opportunity Specialist (EOS) can begin to  determine whether they are complying with relevant provisions of 41 CFR Chapter  60, are not discriminating and are taking affirmative action to ensure equal  employment opportunity without regard to race, color, religion, national origin,  sex, disability, or status as a special disabled or Vietnam era veteran.  Desk  audits enable the EOS to review a contractor's compliance with its affirmative  action and equal opportunity obligations at a particular establishment, and  specifically to:      (a) Workforce Structure, Personnel Policies and Procedures:  Examine the  contractor's basic organizational structure, personnel policies and procedures.      (b) Good Faith Efforts:  Identify areas: (1) where there has been a lack of  goals progress and further information is needed onsite to evaluate the  contractor's good faith effort, including the development and implementation of  programs designed to improve opportunities for minorities and women.    (c) Potential Discrimination:  Identify areas for an in-depth investigation  of potential discrimination: (1) where minorities and women are  underrepresented and concentrated in the workforce; (2) where employment  activity has been disadvantageous to minorities or women; and (3) where there  may be problems in the compensation of minorities or women vs. others.     2A02  PURPOSE AND PRINCIPLES OF AAPS    Desk audits should be conducted with the following AAP principles as points  of reference:    (a) Equal Employment Opportunity:  Equal employment opportunity requires  that a contractor eliminate and remedy all discrimination.  A contractor's  personnel policies and practices must not discriminate against any persons  because of their race, color, religion, national origin, sex, disability or  covered veteran status.       (b) Affirmative Action:  An affirmative action program is a set of specific  and result-oriented policies and procedures to which a contractor commits itself  to apply every good faith effort.  The objective of those procedures plus such  efforts is equal employment opportunity.      (c) Completeness, Reasonableness, Acceptability:  The affirmative action  program will be judged for its completeness, reasonableness, and acceptability.      2A03  RELATIONSHIP TO THE STANDARD COMPLIANCE REVIEW REPORT (SCRR)      The Standard Compliance Review Report (SCRR) and its instructions (Appendix  2A) constitute a framework for conducting the desk audit and developing and  implementing an onsite investigative plan.  The organization of this Chapter  generally parallels that of the SCRR, and it should be read in conjunction with  the SCRR instructions.    (a) Organization of the SCRR:  The SCRR is organized into three parts:    (1) Part A:  Preparation:  Part A covers preparation for the desk audit,  including such areas as the contractor's past review history, overall EEO  trends in its workforce, its organizational structure, and the initial review  of its AAP and support data for completeness, reasonableness, and  acceptability.    (2) Part B:  Affirmative Action:  Part B summarizes prob- lems with the AAP  and support data; provides for analysis of affirmative action progress and  identification of areas where additional information is needed to determine  good faith effort; and covers implementation of other affirmative action  obligations.  For each affirmtive action problem unresolved at the conclusion  of desk audit, the SCRR provides for an onsite plan.    (3) Part C:  Potential Discrimination:  Part C includes review of the  workforce analysis for concentrations/    underrepresentations), impact ratio analyses, and compensation analyses.   For each potential discrimination problem unresolved at the conclusion of desk  audit, the SCRR provides for an onsite investigative plan.    (b) SCRR Potential Discrimination Worksheets:  The SCRR also includes a  series of Potential Discrimination Worksheets designed to illustrate the steps  normally necessary to establish particular types of discrimination.  These  Worksheets and their instructions are in Appendix A to Chapter 3.  Their use,  although encouraged, is optional.  However, the ""Key Factors""  highlighted at the beginning of the instructions for each Worksheet must be  addressed in an analysis if the Worksheet applies to the type of potential  discrimination problem involved.  In developing an onsite plan for the  investigation of potential discrimination issues, therefore, the EOS may find it  useful to review at least the ""Key Factors"" for the initial onsite  step of data refinement (Worksheets 17-1 and 17-2).     2B  PRE-DESK AUDIT ACTIONS    2B00  COMPLIANCE REVIEW INFORMATION SYSTEM (CRIS)    CRIS is used to record basic information about the contractor, to track  major review events, and to summarize violations found and remedies obtained.   To enter a contractor into CRIS, the Area Of-fice completes CRIS Form 100 and  sends it to Region.  The Region then generates a CRIS Form 100a, which is the  first page of the SCRR.  Full instructions for completing the 100a are given in  the CRIS Manual.    2B01  MAINTENANCE OF CASE CHRONOLOGY    The EOS should prepare a case chronology (CC-53; see Figure 2-1) for each  compliance review.  It should cover events occurring from the date of initial  contact with the contractor to the date case closing documents are prepared and  approved.  All telephone conversations, correspondence and meetings associated  with the review should be recorded, indicating the date, nature of contact,  person contacted, summary of discussion or actions taken, and EOS' name.  Events  should be logged in as they occur, since it is difficult to reconstruct these  after a review is completed.  The case chronology is an integral part of the  case file and will be an invaluable tool if enforcement action is necessary.   All notes and logs should be legible (preferably typed).    2B02  INITIAL CONTACT WITH CONTRACTOR    (a) Identifying Information:  Identifying information should be obtained by  contacting the contractor before the start of the compliance review.  The name  of the establishment chief executive officer (CEO), the name of the person  responsible for preparation/implementation of the AAP, and the correct     mailing address for the establishment should be obtained.  If the  establishment is part of a larger entity, the name of the corporate CEO, the  name of the corporate person responsible for Equal Employment  Opportunity/Affirmative Action matters, and the correct corporate mailing  address should also be obtained.  This basic identifying information should be  entered on page 2 of the SCRR, along with contract data, labor force  information, and the other items specified in the SCRR instructions.    (b) Representation by Counsel:  If the contractor indicates, at this point  in the review or later, that an outside counsel or consultant will represent the  company, the contractor will be asked to provide written confirmation of  representation, including: (1) the representative's name, address and phone  number; (2) the scope of the representative's authority (including whether  he/she is authorized to negotiate settlement for the contractor); (3) whether  all contacts, including routine ones to make appointments or to clarify  submitted data or other information, should be made through the representative;  and (4) whether all correspondence should be mailed only to the representative  or if copies should also be mailed to the contractor.  Upon receipt of this  written confirmation, contacts and correspondence will be handled accordingly  for the duration of the review (unless the contractor specifies a different time  period).  NOTE:  This same written confirmation should be obtained from the  contractor if OFCCP is contacted by a person who indicates that he/she  represents the contractor.    (c) Special Circumstances:  The EOS should also determine if there is any  information which would preclude selection of the contractor for a compliance  review (e.g., bankruptcy, debarment, closure of the establishment), or would  influence the timing of the review (i.e. vacation shutdown, strike, lockout,  heavy layoffs, etc.).    2B03  SCHEDULING LETTER    The notice used to schedule a compliance review and request the Affirmative  Action Program (AAP) and supporting documentation is called a Scheduling Letter  (Figure 2-2).  This letter will be sent, by certified mail with return receipt  requested, to the top official at the contractor's establishment with a copy to  the chief executive officer at the corporate address (unless the establishment  and corporate office are the same).  Scheduling Letters shall be signed by the  AOD or FOD.  Letters should include the name and telephone number of the EOS who  will be conducting the review and/or the appropriate Module Chief.      2B04  FOLLOW-UP CONTACT WITH CONTRACTOR    Within fifteen working days after sending the Scheduling Letter, the EOS  should contact the contractor to ensure that the contractor's representatives  fully understand the requirements outlined.  The EOS should also make sure there  have been no special circumstances which may require postponing or cancelling  the scheduled review (see 2B02(c) above).    2B05  CONTACT WITH EEOC, STATE AND LOCAL FEP AGENCIES AND VETS    (a) EEOC and State and local Fair Employment Practices (FEP) Agencies:   Simultaneously with the Scheduling Letter, the standard inquiry letter (Figure  2-3) should be sent to the district office of the EEOC and to State and local  FEP agencies, requesting information on complaints filed against the contractor  and any other information that may be pertinent to assessing the contractor's  EEO posture.  If after 15 days no response is received, the EOS should follow-up  by telephone.     (b) Veterans Employment and Training Service (VETS):  The EOS must contact  the VETS representative at the appropriate State Employment Security office to  request information he or she may have which could be pertinent to the review.   This contact must be recorded in the case chronology record.    2B06  REVIEW OF COMMUNITY RESOURCE FILES    Each AO or FO should maintain resource files on the communities within its  geographic area.  For each community, these files should contain at least: (1)  basic data on minority/female availability; (2) information on public  transportation systems; and (3) identification of local organizations  representing covered group members.  The EOS should review the resource file for  the community where the contractor is located, with particular attention to  organizations which can be helpful in evaluating the contractor's compliance  posture.  If the contractor is located near an Indian reservation, the EOS  should contact the reservation's Tribal Employment Rights Council (TERO).    2B07  STANDARD AFFIRMATIVE ACTION FORMATS    If the contractor scheduled for review has an approved Standard Affirmative  Action Format (SAAF), the Module Chief should obtain a copy of the format and  provide it to the EOS conducting the review.  The EOS should become familiar  with the provisions of the SAAF, preparatory to evaluating the contractor's AAP.      2B08  REVIEW OF PREVIOUS COMPLIANCE ACTIONS    When scheduling the contractor for a compliance review, the EOS should  determine whether the contractor has previously been audited.  If so, the EOS  should examine at least the previous case file for problem areas, with  particular attention to commitments made in a Conciliation Agreement or Letter  of Commitment.  The EOS also should determine whether the contractor has been  subject to an OFCCP complaint investigation and, if so, review the file for any  problems identified.  Problems in these past compliance actions should be  recorded on page 3 of the SCRR. As the review progresses, the EOS should be  alert to any indications that past problems have remained unremedied or have  recurred.    2B09  INFORMATION ON COMPLAINTS    (a) Response to the Standard Inquiry Letter:  The EOS should carefully  examine all information on complaints received from Federal, State, and local  agencies in response to the Standard Inquiry Letter.  Basic information on these  com- plaints should be entered on page 3 of the SCRR, including the agency with  which the complaint was filed, the basis, issue, current status, and the area of  the contractor's workforce involved in the complaint.    (b) Relationship to Desk Audit:  The EOS should note any patterns in the  types of complaints filed, particularly ones that might indicate potential  systemic discrimination problems.  For example, there may be a clustering of  complaints filed by employees in certain job areas, or by applicants or  employees from a particular race, religion, ethnic group, or sex, or by covered  veterans or individuals with disabilities.  As the review progresses, the EOS  should cross reference complaints to potential problem areas identified.  For  example, there may be indications of lack of good faith efforts, adverse IRA's,  and/or concentrations/underrepresentations in areas where complaints have been  filed.      (c) Review of Case Files:  Where appropriate, the EOS should contact the  appropriate EEOC office or State or local fair employment agency to arrange to  review case files as part of the compliance review.  This can be useful when, as  a result of the desk audit, potential systemic problems are indenti- fied in  complaint areas.    (d) Contractor Complaint Information:  Upon receipt of the AAP and  supporting data, any information provided by the con- tractor with respect to  current or past complaints should be compared to the information received from  the agencies.  Discrepancies and/or information not provided by the contractor  should be noted by the EOS for particular attention during the review.      2B10  RELATIONSHIP OF OFCCP COMPLIANCE ACTIVITIES TO EEO LITIGATION OR COURT  ORDERS    If, during the conduct of a compliance review, the EOS finds that the  contractor is involved in litigation or is under a court order on EEO matters,  he/she should identify the EEO issues involved, the court, the parties, the case  name and number, and bring the matter to the attention of the AOD (or FOD, where  appropriate).  The AOD/FOD, in consultation through channels with the Regional  Solicitor's Office, will determine whether there are any limitations which may  be imposed on the conduct of the compliance review by the litigation or court  order.    2C  SUBMISSION OF AAPS FOR DESK AUDIT    2C00  DELAYED RECEIPT OF AAPS    If current AAPs are not received by the 30th calendar day after the  contractor received the notification of the scheduled review, the EOS should  telephone the contractor to determine whether the AAPs have been mailed.  If the  contractor advises that they are en route, a reasonable period of time, not to  exceed five (5) calendar days, will be allowed for receipt.      2C01  NON-RECEIPT OF EXECUTIVE ORDER AAP    If there is no reason to believe that the AAP is en route, or if an AAP  reported en route has not been received at the end of 5 calendar days following  the 30th day, a show cause notice should generally be issued (see Chapter 8).   However, the regulations at 41 CFR 60-1.26(a)(2) give the Director, OFCCP the  discretion to go directly to administrative enforcement where a contractor  refuses to submit an AAP and efforts to conciliate the matter are unsuccessful.       2C02  NON-RECEIPT OF SECTION 503/38 U.S.C. 4212 AAPS    A Section 503 and 38 U.S.C. 4212 AAP may be included in an Executive Order  AAP, may be combined in one document, or may be submitted as separate documents.   Action to be taken where Section 503 and/or 38 U.S.C. 4212 AAP(s) are not  submitted may take either of two forms, depending on circumstances:      (a) Concurrent Failure to Submit EO 11246 AAP or Submission of Unreasonable  EO 11246 AAP:  If the contractor failed to submit both an Executive Order AAP  and the AAP(s) for Section 503/38 U.S.C. 4212, or if the Executive Order AAP is  determined to be an unreasonable submission (see Section 2F    below) and no Section 503/38 U.S.C. 4212 AAP(s) was submitted, then the Show  Cause Notice being issued for the Executive Order violation will include the  failure to submit the Section 503/38 U.S.C. 4212 AAP and offer the contractor a  concurrent 30-day period to submit that AAP (see Sections 8B01(b) and 8D00(b)  and Figures 8-1 and 8-2).    (b) Reasonable EO 11246 AAP Submitted:  If the contractor's Executive Order  AAP has been received and is determined to be reasonable, but no Section 503/38  U.S.C. 4212 AAP(s) was received, the EOS will telephone the contractor to  request that the missing AAP(s) be provided.  If the materials are received  before the end of the desk audit, they will be reviewed for completeness and  acceptability (see Sections 2E01 and 2I below) as part of the desk audit.  If  they are not received before the end of the desk audit, they will be reviewed  onsite.  If, however, it is determined onsite that the contractor did not have  Section 503 and/or 38 U.S.C. 4212 AAPs in place in accordance with the  regulations, this will be cited as a major problem, and its resolution addressed  in a Conciliation Agreement.    2C03  EVALUATION PERIOD    (a) General:  The EOS should evaluate the contractor's perform- ance (e.g.,  goals progress, good faith efforts, personnel activity, etc.) for at least the  last full AAP year.  Cur- rent year performance should also be examined if the  con- tractor is six months or more into its current AAP year.  For example, if  the AAP is established on a calendar year basis, and the compliance review is  scheduled for August 1988, the EOS would evaluate the contractor's performance  from January 1, 1987 through June 30, 1988 (1/1/87 through 12/31/87 under the  prior AAP, and 1/1/88 through 6/30/88 under the current AAP).    (b) When Discrimination Found:  Note, however, that if potential  discrimination is found, analysis of personnel activity/policy implementation  should be extended to cover the normal liability period (providing coverage can  be established during the full normal liability period).  The normal liability  period for a compliance review is the full two years preced-ing the date the  contractor received the Scheduling Letter.  Additionally, where the alleged  discrimination involves a continuing violation, the analysis may be extended  further (see Chapters 3 and 7).    Revised 5-25-90    2C04  TIMEFRAME FOR COMPLETION OF COMPLIANCE REVIEW    The 60-day period for completing the compliance review (refer to 41 CFR  60-60.7) begins when the AAP and support data (whether reasonable or not) are  recieived in the AO/FO.  While completion of the review within the 60-day period  is not a procedural prerequisite to an enforcement action, substantial effort  should be made to complete the review within that period of time.  Should it  become apparent that a review cannot or will not be completed within 60 days of  receipt of the AAP and support data (irrespective of whether a Show Cause Notice  has been issued), the EOS should request an extension through his or her Module  Chief.  All extension requests must be made sufficiently in advance to allow for  necessary processing and entry into the CRIS.      2C05  REVIEWS OF CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS, REGIONAL AND DISTRICT OFFICES    (a) Maintenance of Establishment AAPs:  When reviewing corporate  headquarters, the EOS should review documentation that the corporation's  establishments have developed AAPs.    (b) Corporate-Level Selection Decisions:  The EOS should ensure that the  workforce analysis, utilization analysis and goals in the corporate  headquarter's AAP include all positions filled by headquarters decision-makers,  regardless of where those jobs are physically located.  For example, mid- and  upper-level management jobs at establishments other than headquarters must be  included in the corporate AAP if the selection decisions for those jobs are made  at the corporate level.     Where because of informal or fluctuating managerial appointment authorities,  the appropriate level for job title placement cannot be clearly or consistently  defined, the managerial and other appropriate titles should be placed in the  AAP of the highest organizational level where ultimate approval authority may  reside.  As a result, there may be instances when the majority of mid- and  upper-level manage-ment and other titles should appropriately be placed in the  corporate headquarters AAP, notwithstanding personnel responsibility at  intermediate organizational levels.  Management should be given substantial  discretion in determining proper organizational levels for job title placement  provided such placement is not inconsistent with the purpose of this Section.      (c) Regional or District-Level Selection Decisions:  Similarly, if a  regional or district office has decision-making authority over positions in a  lower-level establishment unit, the regional or district office AAP should  include those positions in its workforce analysis, utilization analysis and  goals.     Revised 5-25-90    (d) Establishments with Positions Filled by Higher-Level Decision Making:   When reviewing establishments which are subordinate to a higher-level  establishment in the contractor's organization, the EOS will ensure that all  positions in the workforce of the lower-level establishment for which the  selection decisions are made at a higher corporate level are excluded from the  utilization analysis and goal setting of the establishment under review.  Such  positions, however, must be shown in the lower-level establishment's workforce  analysis (in order that the complete workforce structure of that establishment  is readily apparent).      2D INITIAL REVIEW OF AAP AND SUPPORT DATA - GENERAL    2D00  CONTENTS OF INITIAL REVIEW    Upon receipt of an AAP and support data, the EOS should immedi- ately review  the material to make sure that it provides an adequate basis for conducting  desk audit analyses of both affirma- tive action and potential discrimination  issues.  This initial review includes a determination of the completeness,  reasonableness and acceptability of the AAP(s) and support data as described  in the sections which follow.    2D01  RECORDING RESULTS OF INITIAL REVIEW    The results of this initial review are recorded on page 4 of the SCRR.   Where problems are identified, each specific problem should be described on page  9 of the SCRR (Problems with AAP and Support Data), along with the actions the  EOS plans to take to resolve it.  Where the matter is unresolved at the  conclusion of desk audit, page 9 will constitute the onsite plan for resolution of AAP and support data problems.     2E REVIEW FOR CURRENCY AND COMPLETENESS    2E00 ACTION WHEN AAP NOT CURRENT    Upon receipt of an AAP for desk audit, the EOS should first determine  whether the AAP is current.  If it is not, the submission should be treated as  if the contractor had failed to submit an AAP.  See Section 2C01 above.      2E01  COMPLETENESS    If the AAP is current, the EOS should review the AAP and support data for  completeness.  To do so, the EOS should first determine whether all materials  requested in the Scheduling Letter and itemized listing, including the Section  503 and 38 U.S.C. 4212 AAPs, have been submitted.  Then the EOS should determine  if the Executive Order and Section 503 and 38 U.S.C. 4212 AAPs contain all  ingredients required by the regulations:    oExecutive Order AAP ingredients required by 41 CFR 60-2.11 and 2.13(a)  through (j);    oRequired Executive Order support data, including the report of prior year  goal progress required by 41 CFR 60-1.40(b) and (c); and    oSection 503 and 38 U.S.C. 4212 AAP ingredients required by 41 CFR  60-741.6(a) through (f) and 41 CFR 60-250.6 (a) through (f) respectively.    2E02 CENTRAL EXECUTIVE ORDER AAP ELEMENT MISSING    If one or more of the following central Executive Order AAP ingredients is  missing, the submission is automatically considered unreasonable and the desk  audit should be suspended and a show cause notice issued:    oA workforce analysis;    oA utilization analysis, including its component parts of job group  formation, availability estimates and, as appropriate, identification of  underutilization; and    oGoals for areas declared underutilized.    If these central ingredients are included, the EOS should then evaluate them  for reasonableness.    2F REVIEW OF EXECUTIVE ORDER AAP FOR REASONABLENESS    For a submission to be considered a reasonable effort to meet the  requirements of 41 CFR Part 60-2, the central Executive Order AAP  ingredients  of workforce analysis, utilization analysis and goals development must meet the  following standards:    2F00  WORKFORCE ANALYSIS    The submission must contain a workforce analysis which lists all  jobs at  the establishment by title (not EEO-1 category, job group or some other  combination of job titles) and by organizational unit, showing at least total  employees, total women and total minorities for each job title.    2F01UTILIZATION ANALYSIS    In the following components of the utilization analysis, the submission must  show:    (a)Job Groups:  An attempt to combine job titles into job groups (defined as  one or more jobs with similar content, wage rates, and opportunities).    (b)Availability Analyses:  An attempt to establish separate availability  estimates for minorities and for women for each job group.    (c)Underutilization Determination:  A comparison of availability to current  incumbency to determine the existence of underutilization.    2F02GOALS    The submission must show an attempt to establish goals for those job groups  identified as underutilized.    2F03  ACTION FOR UNREASONABLE SUBMISSION    If the Executive Order AAP does not meet one or more of these standards for  reasonableness, the desk audit should be suspended and a show cause notice  issued (see Chapter 8).  If the Executive Order AAP is considered reasonable,  the EOS should evaluate the submission for acceptability.    2G REVIEW OF EXECUTIVE ORDER AAP FOR ACCEPTABILITY    2G00GENERAL     Having determined that the elements necessary to proceed with the desk  audit--the workforce analysis, utilization analysis and current goals--are  included in the contractor's submission and are reasonable, the desk audit  proceeds with an evaluation of the acceptability of each required ingredient.   The determination of the acceptability of the items listed on page 4 of the SCRR  will be limited to the evaluation which can be conducted during the desk audit.   This is different from an evaluation of a contractor's implementation of the  requirements, which in most instances cannot be determined without further  investigation onsite (see Chapter 3).      2G01     WORKFORCE ANALYSIS    An acceptable workforce analysis is one which meets the requirements of 41  CFR 60-2.11(a).  It must contain:    oA listing of each job title, as it appears in applicable collective  bargaining agreements or payroll records;    oIn wage rate or salary range order;    oWithin each department or other similar organizational unit, including unit supervision; and    oWhere there are separate work units or lines of progression within the  department or organizational unit, a separate listing must be provided.     More specifically:    (a)Information by Job Title:  Each job title listed must show the total  number of persons in the job title, the total num-ber of men and of women, and  the total number of men and of women in each of the following groups:  Blacks,  Hispanics, Asian/Pacific Islanders, and American Indians/Alaskan Natives.  All  job titles, including managerial job titles,  must be listed.  Positions which  are filled above the estab-lishment level must be included in an establishment's  work-force analysis even though they may be included for goal-setting purposes  in a corporate or mid-level AAP.  In deter-mining whether jobs are listed by  title, the EOS should be alert for the use of plurals in job titles; broad,  general titles, such as ""Manager"" or ""Machine Operator;"" or  inclu- sion of multiple pay ranges for one job title.  The pre- sence of any of  these suggests that jobs may not be listed by title.      (b)Wage Rate:    (1)General:  The wage rate or salary range for each job title must be given  (although this information may be coded--see (2) below).  Titles must be listed  in wage rate or range order within department or other similar organizational  units.  The listing may either be from highest to lowest paid or from lowest to  highest paid.      (2)Coded Data:  Where wage rate or salary range are coded, the contractor  must provide the key to the code onsite.  Any codes must be consistent across  department/unit lines (i.e. a job with a salary code ""57"" in  Department A, pays the same as one coded ""57"" in Department B) and in  wage rate or salary range order within each department or other similar  organization unit.  Also, the submission should include a list of the codes used  in wage/salary order with the highest and lowest codes so labeled.    (c)Organizational Unit:  The organizational units used in the workforce  analysis should be identifiable, and should reflect the contractor's  organizational structure.  If an organizational chart is provided as part of the  supporting documentation, it should be compared to the units used in the  workforce analysis.    (d)Lines of Progression:  Lines of progression or usual promotional  sequences must show the order of jobs in the line through which an employee  moves to reach the top of the line. Lines of progression or promotional  sequences may be identified from collective bargaining agreements as well as  from organizational charts.  If this information is not available at desk audit,  a final determination of acceptability cannot be made until after the onsite review.    2G02JOB GROUPS    Job groups, to be acceptable, must consist of a group of jobs having similar  content, wage rates, and opportunities.    (a)List of Titles in Each Group:  In order for the EOS to assess job group  acceptability, the AAP must include, for each job group, a listing of the job  titles which make up that group.  If such lists have not been provided, the EOS  should immediately contact the contractor and request that such lists be  provided for desk audit.    (b)Criteria for Acceptability:  The following criteria are to be used in  assessing the acceptability of job groups:    (1)Similar work content:  Similarity of work content refers to the duties  and responsibilities of the job titles which make up the job group.  While it is  difficult to confirm similarity without reference to position descriptions, some  steps can be taken during the desk audit to make at least a preliminary  assess-ment of acceptability of work content.  For example:    oAppropriate EEO Category:  The EOS should review the establishment's job  titles that make up each of the job groups to verify they are within the proper  EEO-1 categories.  Job titles in each job group normally would be within the  same EEO-1 category.     oUse of Dictionary of Occupational Titles:  The Dictionary of Occupational  Titles can be referred to, as well as labor agreements, organizational charts,  and other data provided by the contractor, in evaluating the manner in which the  contractor has formulated job groups.  The Dictionary of Occupational Titles  lists standard job titles for  most positions, and codes them based on their  duties, requirements, and other factors.  Descriptions of job duties and  commonly required qualifications are also given.    (2)Similar rates of pay:  Pay rates should be reviewed in conjunction with  job content.  Large apparent differences in pay, when associated with  differences in job title and/or location within an organization, suggest an  unacceptable job grouping.      (3)Similar opportunities:  Opportunity refers to the ability to take  advantage of training opportunities, transfers, promotions, mobility to  desirable wage/ salary situations, and other employment benefits.  Most often,  it refers to upward mobility.  Ideally, each job within a job group should offer  the same opportunities as any other job title within that job group.  As a  result:    oJobs in Separate Unions:  Jobs in separate unions, or jobs in different  departments when interdepartmental mobility is impossible, should not be   grouped together.  For example, nonunion clerical jobs and clerical jobs which  are covered by a collective bargaining agreement should not normally be grouped  together.    oJobs in Lines of Progression:  Jobs that are in lines of progression should  be separated from those that are not.  Where transfer or hire into jobs above  entry level is rare, each line of progression should be analyzed separately.   Where there are lines of progression governed by strict seniority, the job  titles in lines should be considered as a single job group.    (c)Job Groups Must Not Obscure Underutilization:  Job groups which combine  jobs with different content, wages, or opportunities may obscure  underutilization and are not acceptable.  Any job groups that combine jobs in  which minorities or women are concentrated with jobs in which they are  under-represented should be targeted for special scrutiny onsite.  Such job  groups often unacceptably include jobs with different content, wages, or  opportunities.        (d)Effects of Size of Contractor's Workforce:  In assessing the  acceptability of the contractor's job groups, the EOS must remember that the  size of the contractor's workforce is a major factor in determining how well  these three criteria will be met.      (1)Job Groups Must Permit Meaningful Analyses:  Job groups should have  enough incumbents to permit meaningful utilization analyses and goal setting.   Optimally, if a job group is identified as underutilized, it should be large  enough so that a goal of at least one whole person can be established.  No  minimum size has been established for this purpose, however, since it is  dependent not only on the size of the job group, but also on the size of the  availability percentage and the number of minorities or women already in the job  group.    (2)Job Groups Should Not Normally Cross EEO Categories:  Because of the  minimum size of a contractor subject to written AAP requirements, it may not be  possible for any of a smaller contractor's job groups to meet this guideline.   While there are usually two or more job groups within each EEO-1 or EEO-6  category, for smaller contractors some or all of their job groups may  correspond to those categories.  In any event, when job titles are combined to  maintain minimal job group size, EEO category lines should not normally be  crossed.      (e)Relationship Between Job Groups and Availability:  The organization of  jobs into groups allows contractors to tie specific jobs to availability  statistics in order to assess the degree to which their own workforce  representation approximates availability.      2G03AVAILABILITY ANALYSIS - GENERAL      (a)Standard for Acceptability:  The reasonable submission test requires only  that a contractor make an attempt to develop availability estimates.  For the  availability analysis to be found acceptable, however, it must contain a proper  definition of labor area and must show consideration of each of the eight  factors at 41 CFR 60-2.11(b)(1) and (2).      (b)Principles for Evaluation:  In evaluating the acceptability of the  availability analysis, the EOS should be guided by two principles.  First, the  contractor's consideration of each of the factors should reflect its actual  recruitment and employment practices.  Second, the contractor's recruitment and  employment practices should demonstrate the con- tractor's compliance with its  affirmative action and non-discrimination obligations.      (c)Professional Judgement:  The audit of the availability analysis for  acceptability is as much an art as a science.  There are no hard-and-fast, ""mechanical""  methods for evaluating the availability analysis.  The EOS must make a  professional judgement as to the adequacy of the contractor's analysis.  This  requires familiarity with the quality and variety of data available, with  industry and contractor personnel practices, and knowledge of available  recruitment sources.      2G04AVAILABILITY ANALYSIS - DEFINING LABOR AREAS    (a)Importance of Labor Area Definition:  Six of the eight fac-tors for  assessing minority or female availability are tied to the contractor's  definition of labor areas.  How the con-tractor defines its immediate labor area  determines the data used for population, workforce, unemployment/seeking work,  and requisite skills within that immediate area.  How the contractor defines its  reasonable recruitment area determines the data used for requisite skills  within that area.  Definition of both these areas, therefore, heavily impacts  the results of the contractor's availability analysis.  A critical first step in  evaluating the contractor's availability analysis is to assess the  acceptability of both immediate labor area and reasonable recruitment area.    (b)Immediate Labor Area:  In evaluating the contractor's determination of  its immediate labor area, the EOS should consider the following:    (1)Definition:  The immediate labor area is that geographic area from which  employees may reasonably commute to the contractor's establishment.  It may  include one or more contiguous cities, counties or Metropolitan Statistical  Areas (MSAs) or parts thereof, in which the establishment is located.  For  example, it may be defined as the major city in or near which the  establishment is located; the county(ies) surrounding the establishment; the  MSA in which the establishment is located or which borders the establishment; or  a combination of any of the three.  (Note, however, that if the contrac-tor  chooses to combine figures from more than one area, it must be prepared to  provide the raw numbers used to produce the final percentage, since the  percentages themselves cannot be added together).  However defined, the  immediate labor area is normally the same for all job groups.    (2)Must Not Underestimate Availability:  In reviewing the contractor's  definition of immediate labor area, the EOS must ensure that the contractor has  not defined that area in a way that underestimates minority or female  availability.  For example, the definition should not exclude a nearby area with  a large minority workforce.      (3)Commuting Patterns:  In assessing the immediate labor area definition,  the EOS needs to consider commuting patterns, including the availability of  public transportation, approximate normal driving times, etc. in the labor area.      (4)Relationship to EEO/AA Obligations:  The immediate labor area definition  should be consistent with the contractor's nondiscrimination and affirmative  action obligations.  For example, if a contractor's workforce is largely  nonminority and it recruits primarily by word of mouth, defining the immediate  labor area based on the source of applicants may reflect its actual re-  cruitment practices, but does not meet the contractor's affirmative action  obligations (and could, in fact, be found to be discriminatory).  Similarly,  defining the immediate labor area based on residence patterns of current,  nonminority employees, whether as of the time of hire or the time of the review,  may also artificially lower availability for minorities.    (5)Need for Further Investigation:  If the EOS disagrees with the  contractor's definition of the immediate labor area because it appears to  artificially lower the  availability of minorities and women, the EOS should  investigate further onsite to determine whether the contractor, in fact, does  recruit from an area with higher minority/female availability and/or whether the  contractor could expand its area to increase the numbers of minority group  persons and women in the per-centage of available workers.  In this evaluation,  the EOS, based on his or her review experience, may consider where other  nearby employees with similar jobs normally obtain workers.    (6)Sources of Data:  As noted earlier, immediate labor area data are  normally used for factors on population, unemployment/seeking work and  workforce.  For these factors, the contractor should use the best data  available.  Resources for this data include the Research Division of each  State's Division of Employment Security (DES).  This DES Division annually  updates data on population, unemployment/seeking work and workforce for its  State and for MSAs and counties within its State (See Appendix 2B for other  information available from DES).  For a discussion of data on requisite skills  in the immediate labor area, and considerations in their use, see Section  2G05(e) below.    (c)Reasonable Recruitment Area:  The definition of the reason-able  recruitment area is very important in assessing the proportion of minorities and  women available for employment.  It influences the number or proportion of  minorities or women who could--at least theoretically--get through the  contractor's door (be hired) if minority group membership and sex were not taken  into consideration in employment decisions.  In assessing how the contractor has  defined reasonable recruitment area, the EOS should consider the following  factors:    (1)Relationship to Immediate Labor Area:  The reasonable recruiting area  represents the area from which the contractor usually seeks or reasonably could  seek workers for a particular job group.  It may coincide with the immediate  labor area, or it may cover a larger area (state, region, or nation).  Thus,  while the immediate labor area is normally the same for all job groups, the  reasonable recruitment area will vary depending on the types of jobs in the job  group.    (2)Pay and Skill Levels:  Generally, the scope of the reasonable recruitment  area is closely related to pay, based on the assumption that the more a job  pays, the farther people are willing to go to apply for it.  Also, because there  is often a relationship between pay levels and skill levels, for job groups  containing jobs with minimal to intermediate skill requirements, the reasonable  recruiting area will often be the same as the immediate labor area.  As pay  levels and skill requirements increase, however, the likelihood that recruiting  will expand beyond the immediate labor area also increases.      (3)Supply and Demand:  In addition to pay and skills, supply and demand  plays a part in defining the scope of the reasonable recruiting area.  For  example, at times when nurses are in short supply, it may be necessary to expand  recruitment efforts beyond the immediate labor area.  At other times, the supply  of nurses available in the immediate labor area exceeds the demand, and may   reduce the reasonable recruiting area.  Supply and demand can also be influenced  by the specificity of skills required by the contractor.  For example, while the  supply of teachers generally may exceed demand, the demand for teachers with  specific skills, such as math     or science, may exceed the supply and result in an expansion of the  recruitment area.  Further, high unemployment in one area may create a labor  surplus which effectively expands the ""reasonable recruitment area""  elsewhere.  For example, when unemployment is high, persons often search for  work in a wider area, becoming more willing to either relocate or to commute  further to a job than they normally would.  As a result, the ""reasonable  recruitment area"" for other areas expands.    (4)Summary:  As a result, while in most instances job groups in the Service  Worker, Laborer, Operative,  Office and Clerical and retail Sales categories  tend to have reasonable recruitment areas which are the same as the immediate  labor area, this will not always be the case.  Jobs in the Crafts and  Technicians categories are often particularly susceptible to supply and demand  factors related to level and specificity of skill required.  Therefore, while  in most instances, such jobs tend to have reasonable recruitment areas which  coin-cide with the immediate labor area, some job groups within the categories  may have a broader recruitment area.  Similarly, while job groups in the Sales  (non-retail), Professional, and Officials and Managers categories usually have  reasonable recruitment areas which are larger than the immediate labor area (and  often significantly larger, e.g. national), this will not always be the case.      (5)Sources of Data:  See Section 2G05(e) below.       2G05  AVAILABILITY ANALYSIS - EIGHT FACTORS    The contractor's AAP must show, for each job group, consideration of each of  the eight factors for minorities and each of the eight factors for women.  All  factors are expressed as the percentage that minorities or women are among all  persons who meet the factor.  These factors are as follows:    (a)The minority population of the labor area surrounding the facility (Refer  to 41 CFR 60-2.11(b)(1)(i)):  The extent to which this factor is given  consideration in determining the final availability factor for a given job group  will depend on whether or not that job group contains entry level posi- tions  which are filled primarily through outside hire and which require minimal or no  prior skills.  Job groups which fall into the Service Worker, Laborer, and to  some extent, Operatives EEO-1 categories will be more likely to incorpor-ate  minority population percentages into the final availability estimate than  would job groups requiring more specialized skills, such as those falling into  the Technician or Professional categories.      (b)The availability of women seeking employment in the labor or recruitment  area of the contractor (Refer to 41 CFR 60-2.11 (b)(2)(v):  The figure used may  be based on the percentage that unemployed women are among all unemployed  persons in the labor area (41 CFR 60-2.11(b)(2)(i)), since that rate includes  only persons actively seeking work; the percentage of women applying for work at  the local unemployment service office in job categories comparable to those in  the contractor's job groups; or the contractor's prior year applicant flow for  women for that job group.  Generally, the highest figure should be used.  As  with  minority population, inclusion of this figure in developing final  availability estimates for a particular job group will depend on whether or not  the job group is entry level, is filled through outside hire, and requires  little or no prior skills or experience.  The less skill required, the more  consideration this factor should receive.    (c)The size of the minority/female unemployment force in the labor area  surrounding the facility (Refer to 41 CFR 60-2.11(b)(1)(ii) and 41 CFR  60-2.11(b)(2)(i)):  The figure used should be the percentage that unemployed  minorities (or women) are among all unemployed persons in the labor area.   Please note that this is not the same as unemployment rate, which is generally  expressed as the percentage of a given group that is unemployed--e.g., the  percentage that unemployed minorities are among all minorities in the  workforce (employed plus unemployed).  As with minority population and women  seeking employment, the size of the minority/female unemployment force should  receive greater consideration where job groups are entry level, filled by  outside hire, and require little or no skill or experience.  The factor will  receive less consideration where job groups are above entry level, require more  skill or are filled solely or primarily through internal placement.    (d)The percentage of the minority/female workforce as compared with the  total workforce in the immediate labor area (Refer to 41 CFR 60-2.11(b)(1)(iii)  and 41 CFR 60-2.11(b)(2)(ii)): The percentage of minorities/females in the  workforce will have greater applicability for those job groups which draw from a  larger recruiting pool (entry level, filled through external hire, and requiring  few or no skills).  For those job groups which draw from a smaller recruiting  pool (those above entry level, with higher skill requirements, and/or filled  solely or primarily through internal placement), this factor is likely to have  less importance.  (Note:  The term workforce is used elsewhere in the  regulations to mean the incumbent employees of the contractor (e.g., workforce  analysis).  However, as used here in the availability analysis, the term  workforce is synonymous with the term ""labor force"" as defined by the  Census Bureau and other government agencies--e.g., as those persons in the  population, aged 16 and older who are either employed or unemployed (unemployed  is further defined as actively seeking employment).    (e)Requisite Skills:    oThe general availability of minorities/women having requisite skills in the  immediate labor area (Refer to 41 CFR 60-2.11(b)(1)(iv) and 41 CFR 60-2.11(b)(2)  (iii));      oThe availability of minorities/women having requisite skills in an area in  which the contractor can reasonably recruit (Refer to 41 CFR 60-2.11(b)(1)(v)  and 41 CFR 60-2.11(b)(2)(iv));    In assessing these factors, contractors should use the best data available.   While the most recent decennial census data normally provide the most detailed  information on requisite skills, they become increasingly outdated the more  years it has been since the census was conducted.  Also, the decennial census shows only persons employed in a given occupa tion at the time the census was conducted, rather than those with the skills  to be employed in that occupation.  Therefore, the following adjustments to decennial census data are normally needed:    (1)Adjustment for Time Since the Last Decennial Census: Some State Divisions  of Employment Security continue to publish periodic updates of decennial census  data on occupations of persons employed in labor areas within their State.   While these updates are often for fairly broad job categories, they provide a  reliable means of update for job categories where skills are normally  not very  specialized (i.e. service workers, laborers, operatives, entry-level clerical,  retail sales), and at least an indication of overall trends in job categories  where skills often are specialized (see Section 2G05(e) (4) below).   Additionally, for job groups which do have legitimate specialized education  requirements, any available data on the percentage of minority and/or female  graduates at the level (Associates, Bachelor's, etc.) and in the field involved  may be used to update census data.  Since, in many fields, minority and female  enrollment has risen since the last decennial census, these data are often  considerably more accurate than the census as a measure of requisite skills for:   (1) entry-level jobs which legitimately require a particular level and type of  post-high school degree; and (2) such jobs above entry (i.e. with legitimate  experience as well as degree requirements), if the data are corrected for the  year of degree.      (2)Adjustment for Employment vs. Requisite Skills:  The adjustment discussed  immediately above for recent graduates also provides some correction for the  census' focus on persons employed in a given occupation when the census was  conducted.  Additionally, however, care must be taken to ensure that such census  data do not, in effect, perpetuate past discrimination against mi- norities or  women in certain occupations and/or out-dated ""job applied for""  patterns.  This is particularly important for jobs in which, in terms of basic  skill requirements, the availability of minorities and/or women has long been  considerably better than their representation--for example, some management,  professional and sales training programs in which the major legitimate  requirement is a college degree.  Similarly, in entry-level blue collar jobs  where the contractor provides training--and the major skill requirement,  therefore, is ""trainability""-- past employment patterns may simply  reflect who employers in the area choose to train rather than true availability  (which in this situation should normally approximate labor area workforce  representation).      (3)Match Between Data and Skills:  The particular requisite skills  classification(s) from which the data are obtained should closely approximate  the skills required for performance in the job group.  The closeness of the  match between data and skills will depend on how much job content varies within  the job group and the degree of detail in the source data for requisite skills.      (i)Varied Job Content:  Where job content is quite varied (i.e. a Scientist  I job group composed of Chemists and Physicists), the contractor may either  refine the job group further, where appropriate, or combine requisite skills  data for the two or more types of jobs in the group.  Where the data are  combined, the contractor should have available the raw numbers from which the  average percentage was derived.    (ii)Degree of Detail in Data:  The most refined data available are usually  those contained in the most recent decennial census.  Detailed census data are  available from, among other sources, the National Technical Information Service  (NTIS) of the U.S. Department of Commerce (see Appendix 2B).  The NTIS's Report  #5, ""Equal Employment Indicators,"" contains decennial census  information on the employment of minorities and women in 503 job  classifications.  Data from other sources may be considerably broader.  For  example, State Divisions of Employment Security that continue to update  occupational data usually do so for a limited number of job categories, similar  to but not the same as EEO categories.  In the case of either very broad or very  refined data, some adjustment may be needed to approximate requisite skills for  a particular job group.      (4)Adjustment for Broad Data:  Data based on broad job categories (e.g. ""Professionals"")  may either overstate or understate availability.  For example, if the job group  consists of engineering titles, using data for ""all Professionals""  (which includes primary and secondary school teachers) will usually overstate  minority and female availability.  On the other hand, if the job group is  nurses, data on ""all Professionals"" will substantially understate  female availability.  Thus, while the contractor may make adjustment for broad  data, the EOS should evaluate the direction and degree of adjustment made given  the job group involved.    (5)Adjustment for Narrow Data:  Where data based on narrow job categories  are used, they may sometimes show no minorities or women for particular job  titles (either because there were none at the time the census was taken, or  because the actual number was so low as to cause the number to be ""suppressed.""    Where this occurs, contractors should be encouraged to broaden the area of  consideration to include other, related categories, which do show minorities  and/or women.     (f)The availability of promotable and transferable minority/fe-male  employees within the contractor's organization (Refer to 41 CFR  60-2.11(b)(1)(vi) and 41 CFR 60-2.11(b)(2)(vi)).    This is the percentage of minorities/women who are in feeder job groups and  who are (at the start of the AAP year) or who will become (during the AAP year)  promotable or transferra-ble from those job groups into the job group under  consideration.    In evaluating this factor for acceptability:     (1) Determine the Accuracy of Feeder Job Groups:  The EOS should identify  the feeder job groups, if any, from which individuals are, or reasonably could  be, promoted or transferred to the job group under consideration.    oThe EOS can determine actual feeder job groups by examining where persons  who were promoted or transferred into the job group under consideration came  from.  This may be done by identifying the  previous job group of persons who  entered the  target job group during the last AAP year and/or--where that  activity has been too limited to be representative--through examination of the  work histories of persons in the target job group to determine their immediately  preceding job group.  Feeder groups may also be identified through review of  labor agreements and/or written promotion/transfer policies.     oThe EOS, however, should be observant of any indications that the skills  brought by promotees/    transferees to the target job group are similarly available in other  potential feeder groups, particularly if those other potential feeder groups  have substantially better representation of minor-ities or women.  Where this is  the case, the contractor should broaden its feeder group defini-tion,  consistent with its affirmative action obligations.    (2)Percentage of Minorities/Women:  The contractor may  conclude that the  percentage of promotable minorities/ women in the feeder job groups is  approximately equivalent to their representation in those groups.  Where,  however, there are legitimate seniority or special qualification requirements  for promotion/transfer to the target job group, the contractor may identify  those persons who are or will become qualified during the AAP year and the  percentage that minorities/women represent among those persons (for a discussion  of ""legitimate"" qualification requirements, see Chapters 3 and 7).   Where the contractor identifies specific promotable/ transferable persons, this  can be verified by identifying the legitimate criteria used in determining who  is promotable or transferrable, and by reviewing the employment histories of  persons in the feeder job groups.      (3)Relevance of Factor:  The importance of this factor will be related to  whether the contractor normally fills jobs in the target job group by promotion  from within or by hire.  Review of employment activity for the prior AAP year  will show the proportion of placements which resulted from internal movement as  opposed to new hire.  Where this activity has been too limited to be  representative, the work histories of persons in the target group may be  reviewed to determine the proportion who came via promotion or transfer vs. by  new hire.  In addition, labor agreements often contain rules governing promotion  and transfer for jobs in certain sectors of the workforce.    (g)The existence of training institutions capable of training persons in the  requisite skills (Refer to 41 CFR 60-2.11(b) (1)(vii)and 41 CFR  60-2.11(b)(2)(vii)):  This may be the percentage of minorities and women  enrolled in those educational and training institutions serving the  contractor's recruitment needs.      (1)Sources of Data:  Contractors should contact those educational and  training institutions with programs which match their employment needs.  These  can range from local high schools with business or vocational programs through  local technical schools to colleges nationwide.  Such institutions should be  able to provide data on the number and percentage of minorities and women  enrolled in programs appropriate to the contractor's employment needs.     (2)Relevance of Factor:  The extent to which the contrac- tor considers this  factor will depend on the degree to which new graduates of such programs are or  can be utilized in making placements to a particular job group.  For example, a  contractor filling positions in an entry-level clerical job group may hire new  graduates from local high schools and business colleges, but may hire only  experienced persons for a non-entry level clerical job group.     (h)The degree of training which the contractor is reasonably able to  undertake as a means of making all job classes available to minorities/women  (Refer to 41 CFR 60-2.11(b) (1)(viii) and 41 CFR 60-2.11(b)(2)(viii)):  This  factor requires the contractor to make an assessment of the number of employees  who could, with appropriate training, become promotable or transferrable during  the AAP year, and to determine what percentage minorities/women constitute of  that number.     (i)Data Used Must Be Accurate:  Data used for each availability factor must  be accurate and up-to-date.  Sources of data must be identified in the AAP.    (j)Consideration of Each Factor:  The contractor must consider each factor  and must explain in its AAP how it has done so. It may not be necessary,  however, for the contractor to make each factor a part of any final availability  estimate.  Only those factors which are relevant to the actual availability of  the job group under evaluation need be used.  Moreover, contractors may give  differential consideration (e.g., by mathematical weighting or by other means)  to some or all of the individual factors in determining final availability     estimates for each job group.  Where a contractor gives such differential  consideration to factors, the AAP should specifically identify the weights  applied or other methods used.  If the AAP contains no explanation of how the  contractor has considered each factor, or if an explanation is provided but  further investigation and verification is needed  (e.g., if the AAP states that  certain job groups are filled solely by internal means, and this cannot be  verified from the AAP), the EOS should plan to address the matter onsite.    (k)Summary Guidelines For Audit of Acceptability:  In summary, in evaluating  a contractor's final availability estimates for acceptability, the following  general guidelines can be used:    (1)Entry Level Jobs, No Special Skills/Experience:  For entry level jobs  which do not require any special skills or experience, availability for  minorities and women should be close to their workforce participation rates;      (2)Entry Level Jobs, Some Skills/Experience:  For entry level jobs which  require some skills (education and/or experience), availability for minorities  and women should be at least equal to the requisite skills figure for either the  reasonable recruiting area or immediate recruiting area, whichever figure is  larger;    (3)Jobs Filled Through Internal Means Only:  For jobs which are filled  solely through internal means, availability should normally be at least equal to  the percentage which minorities and women represent in all appropriate feeder  job groups.      2G06IDENTIFICATION OF UNDERUTILIZATION    The regulations at 41 CFR 60-2.11(b) define underutilization as ""...having  fewer minorities or women in a particular job group than would reasonably be  expected by their availability.""  Contractors are required in the AAP to  compare availability to incumbency for each job group, and to identify those job  groups which are underutilized.  In evaluating the acceptability of the method  used by a contractor to determine underutilization, EOSs must ensure that the  method used conforms to the requirements of the regulations, that it is  appropriate, and that it has been accurately applied.    2G07GOALS    Having identified a job group as underutilized for minorities and/or women,  the contractor must establish employment goals and exert every good faith effort  toward meeting them.  Such goals must be established separately for minorities  and women.  In setting goals, the contractor should consider:     (a)Level of Goals:  Goals for an underutilized job group must be at least  equal to the percentage availability of minorities or women (as appropriate)  for the job group, as determined by a properly developed utilization analysis  which considers at least those factors discussed in section 2G05 above (see 41  CFR 60-2.11(b)).    (b)Goals Are not Quotas:  41 CFR 60-2.12(e) indicates that goals "". . .  may not be rigid and inflexible quotas which must be met, but must be targets  reasonable attainable by means of applying every good faith effort to make all  aspects of the entire affirmative action program work.""    (c)Separate Goals by Particular Minority Group:  Where appropriate,  separate goals may also be required by particular minority group(s) or by sex  within a particular minority group if there is a substantial disparity in the  utilization of a particular minority group or of men or women of a particular  minority group.  Where the EOS identifies such a substantial disparity (see  Section 2K01(d) and the instructions for SCRR page 7) and the contractor has  not estab-lished a separate goal, the EOS will first determine if the disparity  represents potential discrimination.  If potential discrimination is not found,  separate affirmative action goals to eliminate the disparity may be required  (see 41 CFR 60-2.12(l)).  In order to ensure that such goals are reasonable,  they should be based on a separate availability analysis for the minority group  (or men or women of the minority group) involved in the job group(s) where the  disparity is observed.      2G08ADOPTING AN EEO POLICY    41 CFR 60-2.13(a) requires that a contractor commit itself, in writing, to a  policy of equal employment opportunity in all personnel actions.  The policy  statement must be in the AAP.  It should be signed by the top establishment  official and dated.  It must be reaffirmed annually.  41 CFR 60-2.20 provides  guidance for evaluating the content of the contractor's EEO policy statement.      2G09DISSEMINATION OF THE POLICY    41 CFR 60-2.13(b) requires that the AAP provide for formal inter-nal and  external dissemination of the contractor's policy.  To be acceptable, the AAP  must address how the policy is disseminated, internally and externally.  41 CFR  60-2.21 provides guidance for evaluating dissemination of the policy.  For  example, the AAP may state that the policy is posted in conspicuous places  accessible to employees and applicants for employment, and that the policy is  discussed with management employees having responsibility for making employment  decisions.  External dissemination may include notifying recruitment sources,  community organizations, subcontractors and labor unions, where applicable, of  its policy on equal employment opportunity and affirmative action.     2G10RESPONSIBILITY FOR IMPLEMENTATION    Under 41 CFR 60-2.13(c), contractors are required to provide for the  implementation of the AAP.  To be acceptable, the AAP must identify the person  who is responsible for implementation of the policy and must describe how the  policy is implemented, in sufficient detail for the EOS to be able to audit  compliance.  Guidance as to the types of actions a contractor may take to  implement this requirement is provided at 41 CFR 60-2.22.  For example, an EEO  officer is central to the success of the affirm-ative action program, since he  or she is responsible for ensuring that the contractor takes steps to implement  the AAP.  The AAP should identify the EEO Officer by name and/or title, and may  describe his or her duties and responsibilities as well as those of line  managers with respect to EEO.      2G11IDENTIFICATION OF PROBLEM AREAS    41 CFR 60-2.13(d) requires that problem areas (or deficiencies) be  identified by organizational unit and by job group.  41 CFR 60-2.23 provides  additional guidance on some types of self-analyses which contractors may conduct  in identifying problem areas.  To be acceptable, the AAP must provide evidence  that the contractor has addressed the following:    (a)Employment Processes:  The contractor must examine its basic employment  processes (recruitment, hiring, training, promotion, transfer, termination) to identify any impediments to the full utilization of minorities and women.  To do so, in its AAP, the contractor may  use any analysis that measures how these processes affect minorities and women.   For example, the contractor may use Impact Ratio Analyses (NOTE:  Please also  see Sections 2H01(a) and 2O04 of this Chapter for the contractor's obligations  under 41 CFR Part 60-3 to maintain employment activity data and analyze them for  adverse impact.  While not a required AAP ingredient, the    contractor may choose to use this analysis as a tool for problem  identification in this section of its AAP).    (b)Organizational Unit:  The contractor must examine the distribution of  minorities and women among its organization-al units.  To do so, the contractor  may use any analysis that identifies any problem areas in such distribution, for  example, the contractor may use a Job Area Acceptance Range (JAAR) type analysis  to identify areas of minority or female concentration/underrepresentation)  and/or a utilization analysis applied to job groups within such units.    2G12ESTABLISHMENT OF GOALS AND OBJECTIVES - GOALS BY ORGANIZATIONAL UNIT       41 CFR 60-2.13(e) requires that goals and objectives by organ-izational unit  as well as job group be established to correct identifiable deficiencies.  Goals  by organizational unit, however, refer to action-oriented efforts rather than  percentage goals.  Where problem areas by organizational unit have been  identified in accordance with 41 CFR 60-2.13(d), the AAP must include a  description of the efforts which the contractor has taken or will take to  correct those problem areas. This correc-tive action may be addressed in the AAP  section on Development of Action-Orientated Programs (below), and may include  goals for the improvement of recruitment efforts, dissemination of additional  information on job openings (e.g., pay, opportunities, duties), encouraging  transfers and promotions, creating training opportunities, etc.      2G13DEVELOPMENT AND EXECUTION OF ACTION-ORIENTED PROGRAMS    41 CFR 60-2.13(f) requires the development and execution of action-oriented  programs to correct identified problem areas and to attain established goals and  objectives.  41 CFR 60-2.24 provides suggested standards which the EOS can use  to assess the contractor's compliance with this requirement.  For example, the  contractor may commit to increasing the number of qualified minorities and women  in the appropriate candidate pool, since with more women and minorities in the  candidate pool, the logical outcome, absent discrimination, is an increase in  the number of minorities and women hired, promoted, etc.     (a)Contractor Responsibility:  It is the contractor's responsibility to both  develop and execute action-oriented programs.  However, it is the EOS'  responsibility to make a professional judgement as to:    (1)Specificity:  Whether the action-oriented programs are sufficiently  specific and result-oriented to accomplish the aims for which they were created;  and     (2)Execution:  Whether the action-oriented programs were properly executed.      (b)Specific Action-Oriented Programs:  A specific action-oriented program is  one that indicates what the action is, who will accomplish it, how it will be  accomplished and when it will be accomplished.  An action-oriented program  without any one of these ingredients cannot be considered specific.  Action-oriented programs designed to increase candidate pools can be developed  in two stages, (1) steps to be taken immediately to develop internal pools and  to establish a link with potential external pools; and (2) steps to be taken  each time a vacancy occurs in an underutilized area.    (c)Results-Oriented Programs:  A results-oriented action program is one  tailored in such a way that proper execution will result either in an increase  in the minority group/female representation in the job group, if vacancies occur, or clear  documentation of contractor action sufficient to constitute good faith effort.   An action-oriented program that does not meet this standard cannot be considered  results-oriented.    (d)Acceptability of Action Items:  The AAP's action items must be  sufficient, if implemented in good faith, to ensure that each of its specific  objectives and the overall intent of equal employment opportunity are achieved.      2G14INTERNAL AUDIT AND REPORTING    41 CFR 60-2.13(g) requires the contractor to design and implement internal  audit and reporting systems which measure the effectiveness of its total  affirmative action program.  This system must be detailed in its AAP.  The  system must permit adequate monitoring of progress made toward goal  accomplishment and implementation of other affirmative action commitments.    (a)Guidelines for Assessing Acceptability:  The regulations at 41 CFR  60-2.25 provide guidance for assessing the acceptability of a contractor's  internal audit and reporting system.  An acceptable audit and reporting system  is one which allows the contractor to measure the effectiveness of its total  program.  Such a system should include specific procedures for monitoring goals  progress and analyzing employment activity.    (b)Monitoring Goals Progress:  Since utilization and availability analyses  are conducted by job group, and where problems are identified, goals are  established by job group, monitoring of goals progress should be at least by  job group.  The importance of effective internal audit and reporting systems in  goal areas is further underscored by 41 CFR 60-1.40(c), which requires that the  results of the AAP shall be compiled annually (see Section 2H00 below).      (c)Monitoring Personnel Activity:  Audit and reporting systems should also  monitor personnel activity (e.g., hires, promotions/transfers, terminations, and other activity) at least by job group and, where appropriate, by organizational unit.  The regulations at 41 CFR  60-1.40(b) require that a contractor's analysis include hiring practices,  upgrading, transfer and promotion for the past year.    (d)Information to be Maintained:  The regulations at 41 CFR 60-3.4 and  60-3.15A require that contractors with 100 or more employees: (1) maintain and  have available for each job, records sufficient to disclose the impact of the  selection process for that job on women and on each minority group for whom  EEO-1 reporting is required; and (2) conduct adverse impact analyses for women  and for each minority group that constitutes 2% or more of the relevant labor  area or of the  applicable internal workforce.  Where a contractor deter-    mines that a selection process has an adverse impact, evi-dence of validity,  as described in 41 CFR Part 60-3 must also be maintained and made available.   Contractors with fewer than 100 employees must maintain the records set forth in  41 CFR 60-3.15A(1)--e.g. the number of applicants and persons hired, promoted  and terminated by sex and by each minority group (as defined in (d)(1) above)  which consti-    tutes 2% or more of the labor force in the relevant labor area.  Such small  employers, however, are not required to conduct adverse impact analyses of these  data.  See further discussion under Sections 2H01(a) and 2O04 below and in  Questions and Answers Nos. 82-88 of Adoption of Questions and Answers to Clarify  and Provide a Common Interpretation of the Uniform Guidelines on Employee  Selection Procedures.      2G15SEX DISCRIMINATION GUIDELINES    The regulations at 41 CFR 60-2.13(h) require that the AAP contain evidence  of the contractor's compliance with the Sex Discrimina-    tion Guidelines at 41 CFR Part 60-20.  The requirements of the Executive  Order are deemed to preempt any State or local laws restricting the employment  of women.  See 41 CFR 60-2.31 and 41 CFR 60-20.3(f).      To be acceptable, the AAP must address each of the required subitems listed  in the regulations; specifically 41 CFR 60-20.2 through 60-20.6.  The contractor  should delineate in the AAP how each subitem is being implemented.  These  subitems include, but are not limited to:     (a)Conditions of Employment (Refer to 41 CFR 60-20.3, 60-20.4, 60-20.5 and  60-20.6):  A contractor must not make a distinc-tion based on sex in conditions  of employment.  Where State laws provide special minimum wages, overtime pay, or  brief rest periods for women, these benefits must also be given to men.  In  addition, contractors may not use these laws as bases for refusing to hire women  or for limiting their hours of work, etc.  AAPs must provide for the elimination  of any policies, procedures, or working conditions inconsistent with the  requirement of equal treatment.      (b)Distinctions Based on Marital Status (Refer to 41 CFR 60-20.3(d)):  Any  distinction between married and unmarried persons must apply equally to both  sexes.  For example, a contractor cannot refuse to hire women with young  children unless it applies the same exclusionary policy to men.      (c)Bona Fide Occupational Qualification (BFOQ) (Refer to 41 CFR 60-20.3(b)):   A contractor must consider women as well as men for all jobs, unless sex is a  bona fide occupational qualification (BFOQ).  Under Title VII, sex has been  found to be a BFOQ for a job only in extremely rare instances.  Among these have  been:    (1)Authenticity:  Jobs involving a need for authenticity or genuineness,  such as actors or models.    (2)Personal Privacy:  Jobs where the performance of essen-tial job elements  would entail substantial invasion of personal privacy (for example, a permanent  restroom attendant).  This is limited to situations where the normal operation  of the contractor's business depends on the employee being of the same sex as  its employees or customers and there is no other way that privacy could be  ensured.  IMPORTANT:  This is different from customer preference.  For example,  a contractor cannot refuse to hire female salespersons in the belief that they  will not be as well accepted by customers as males.     (d)Employment Opportunities (Refer to 41 CFR 60-20.3(b), 3(c) and 5(b):    (1)Hazardous Jobs:  A contractor may not exclude women from a job it may  believe is dangerous or unsuitable for women to perform unless sex is a BFOQ  (see Section 2G15(c) above).    (2)Reproductive Hazards:  OFCCP follows Title VII prin-ciples when  determining whether a policy excluding     women from a job because of a concern about reproduc-tive hazards is  discriminatory.  If a question relat-ing to reproductive hazards arises during a  compliance review, the EOS should consult, through appropriate channels, with  the Regional Solicitor's Office.    (e)Wage Discrimination (Refer to 41 CFR 60-20.3(c) and 41 CFR 60-20.5(a)and  (b)):  A contractor must compensate employees without regard to sex.  The most  obvious form of wage discrimination occurs when men and women are paid different   wages for performing the same jobs, or jobs which are substantially equal.       (f)Employment Advertising (Refer to 41 CFR 60-20.2(b)):  A con-tractor's  advertisements in newspapers or other media must not express a sex preference  unless the job is one for which sex is a BFOQ (see Section 2G15(c) above).  The  placement of ads in columns headed ""male"" or ""female"" (or ""male  interest"" or ""female interest"") or which otherwise indicate an  orien-tation with regard to sex is considered an expression of preference,  limitation, or specification based on sex and is prohibited.    (g)Employee Benefits:  Refer to discussion of this issue in Chapter 3.     (h)Maternity Leave:  Refer to discussion of this issue in Chapter 3.    2G16SUPPORT OF COMMUNITY ACTION PROGRAMS    The AAP must address the contractor's active support of local and national  community action programs and community service programs which are designed to  improve the employment opportunities of mi-norities and women, as required by 41  CFR 60-2.13(i).  The regu- lations at 41 CFR 60-2.26 provide guidance on the  types of activ-ities which demonstrate active support of local and national  com-munity action and community service programs.  Among these are the  appointment of key members of management to serve on the boards of such  organizations, and active participation in pro- grams for youth sponsored by the  National Alliance of Business-men.  To be acceptable, the AAP should identify  the programs supported, and indicate the type of support (i.e., personnel,  equipment, etc.) given to local and national programs designed to improve  employment opportunities for minorities and women.  The EOS should be familiar  with the types of programs available, both locally and nationally.  The types of  programs, and the degree of support provided, should be consistent with the  nature of the problems identified in the AAP, and may form a component part of  the contractor's organizational goals and development of action programs.    2G17CONSIDERATION OF MINORITIES AND WOMEN NOT CURRENTLY IN THE WORKFORCE      The regulations at 41 CFR 60-2.13(j) require that the AAP address the  contractor's consideration of minorities and women not cur- rently in the  workforce having requisite skills who can be re- cruited through affirmative  action measures.  To be acceptable, the AAP should specify the contractor's  involvement with programs which facilitate the employment of minorities and  women.  Pro- grams offered by the contractor could include providing part-time  employment, flexible hours (flexitime) or dependent care bene-fits, as well as  participating in high school or college co-op programs, particularly with  educational institutions with signi-ficant minority and/or female enrollments.       2HREVIEW OF EXECUTIVE ORDER SUPPORT DATA FOR ACCEPTABILITY    2H00REPORT ON GOALS    41 CFR 60-1.40(c) requires that the contractor prepare a report of results  of its prior year AAP.  This report is part of the support data for the AAP, and  is requested on the itemized list-ing enclosed with the Scheduling Letter  (Figure 2-2a, paragraph f).  The listing requests summary data and information  indicating the numerical and other results of affirmative action goals for each  job group for the current year and for the preceding year.  For each goal not  attained (prior year) or not being attained (current year), the contractor is  requested to describe its good faith efforts.  Prior year data should always be  submitted, unless the contractor was not previously covered by 41 CFR     Part 60-2; current year data should be provided at least where the  contractor is six months or more into its current AAP year at the time it  receives the Scheduling Letter.      (a)Data Required:  As noted above, the contractor must provide summary data  indicating the numerical results of affirmative action goals for each job group.       (1)Information on Job Groups with Goals:  To measure results of goals, one  must first know for which job groups goals were established and what those goals  were.  The contractor's current AAP submitted for desk audit will show this  information for current year goals.  Where the contractor's report on prior year  goals does not specifically state what the prior year goals were, the EOS will  contact the contractor and request that a copy of the goals section of its prior  year AAP be forwarded to permit evaluation of prior year goals progress.    (2)Information on Placements into Job Groups with Goals: Since an annual  goal is established in terms of a per- centage placement rate, evaluating  progress towards it requires knowledge of the total number of placements into  the job group and the number of minority or female placements, as appropriate.   If the contractor's prog-ress report does not give this information or gives it  only in part (i.e., the number of minority/female but not total placements,  etc.), the EOS will determine if the information can be extracted from the  contractor's submission of personnel activity data.  If it cannot be so  extracted, the EOS will contact the contractor and ask that it forward a copy of  reports on goals progress prepared under its internal audit and reporting  systems (41 CFR 60-2.13(g)) and/or, if the contractor employs 100 or more  persons, a copy of the underlying data it used for its adverse impact  determinations on hires, promotions and any other placements into job titles  within the job group (see Section 2H01(a)(2) below).      (b)Good Faith Effort:  Where the contractor's report does not describe its  good faith efforts in a job group where a goal was established but not attained,  or does not describe those efforts in sufficient detail for the EOS to evaluate  their adequacy, the EOS will include the job group as part of the onsite plan  for evaluation of good faith effort (SCRR page     11).    2H01 PERSONNEL ACTIVITY DATA    The itemized listing enclosed with the Scheduling Letter requests  information on personnel activities (e.g., selection--applicant flow and hiring,  promotion and transfer, and terminations) for the prior and current ""goal""  (AAP) years.  The listing requests that the data be provided by race (meaning by  each minority group for whom EEO-1 reporting is required) and sex for each job  group, but permits a contractor to submit the information ""...in the form  in which it is available.""     (a)When Data Are Not Submitted:  If, in response to the Scheduling Letter,  the contractor does not submit any personnel activity data, or does not submit  data for one or more of the activity elements of applicants, hires, promotions  or terminations, a Show Cause Notice should be issued.    (1)If a Show Cause Notice is being issued at desk audit for other reasons  (e.g., see Sections 2C01 and 2F), the failure to submit the activity data will  be included in that Notice.    (2)If the only reason a Show Cause Notice is being issued is failure to  submit the activity data, see Chapter 8, Figure 8-3.    Revised 5-25-90    (b) Regulatory Citations:    (1)General Data Requirements under the Uniform Guidelines on Employee  Selection Procedures (41 CFR Part 60-3):    41 CFR 60-3.4(A) requires that each contractor "". . . maintain and have  available for inspection records or other information which will disclose the  impact which its . . . selection procedures have upon the employment  opportunities of persons by identifiable race, sex, or ethnic groups. . .""   Such identifiable groups are defined by 41 CFR 60-3.4(B) as those groups for  whom     EEO-1 reporting is required--i.e., Blacks, Hispanics, Asian/Pacific  Islanders, American Indians/Alaskan Natives--along with Whites and totals.    (2)Data Requirements under 41 CFR Part 60-3 for Contractors with 100 or More  Employees*:  Contractors with 100 or more employees are more specifically  required by 41 CFR 60-3.15A(2) to maintain and have available records for each  job on applicants, hires, promotions and terminations (and any other selection  decisions) by sex and by each minority group for whom EEO-1 reporting is  required (also see Sections 2G14(d) and 2O04(a)).     (3)41 CFR Part 60-2 Requirements:  In addition to the basic record keeping  requirements in 41 CFR 60-3.4 and 60-3.15, the requirements discussed earlier in  this Chapter that the AAP identify problem areas (41 CFR    60-2.13(d)) and include internal audit and reporting systems (41 CFR  60-2.13(g)) may be cited because they cannot be acceptably implemented without  maintenance and analysis of the basic data on employment activity required by 41  CFR 60-3.4 and 60-3.15.  Failure to submit specific types of employment activity  may be cited as follows:    (a)Applicant Flow and Hires:  41 CFR 60-2.12(m) requires that the AAP  contain, as part of the supporting data, applicant flow data and applicant  rejection ratios (hiring IRAs) indicating minority and sex status. Such  applicant rejection ratios cannot be computed without data on hires by minority  group and sex.  Also, 41 CFR 60-1.40(b)(2) requires that the AAP contain an  analysis of hiring practices for the past year (including recruitment sources  and testing).    __________    *Simplified record keeping requirements for employers of under 100 persons  are described at 41 CFR 60-3.15A(1), and summarized in 2G14(d).  They are not  reiterated here because OFCCP only occasionally reviews supply and service  contractors with under 100 employees.    Revised 5-25-90    (b)Promotions (Transfers, Upgrading Generally):  41 CFR 60-1.40(b)(3)  requires that the AAP include an analysis of upgrading, transfer, and promotion  for the past year.    (c) Review of Data Submitted for Acceptability    (1)Data Format:  To be acceptable for desk audit, the data must be presented  either by job group (as requested in the Scheduling Letter) or by job title (as  required by 41 CFR Part 60-3; see Section 2H01(b)(1) and (2)     above.  If data are submitted in some larger aggrega-tion than job group,  see Section 2H01(d) below.  For example, data by total workforce are not  acceptable, nor are data by EEO category, unless a category legit-imately  constitutes a job group at the particular establishment (see Section 2G02).    (2)Information to be Included:  For each job group or job title, support  data in each major area (applicant flow, hires, promotions and terminations)  must include at least:  the total number of actions, the total number of actions  for women, and the total number of actions for each minority group (as specified  in 2H01(a)(1) above).  For example, applicant flow for a job group or job must  include at least total applicants, total female applicants and total applicants  of each minority group; hires for a job group or job title must include at least  total hires, total female hires and total hires of each minority group, etc.      (3)Period To Be Covered:  Generally, the longer the period covered the  better, because the data are more likely to reflect the contractor's usual way  of operating.  At minimum, however, the data must cover the prior AAP year and,  if the contractor is six months or more into its current AAP year when it  receives the Scheduling Letter, the data must also at least cover the first six  months of the current AAP year.    (d)Action When Data Are Unacceptable:  If employment activity data are  submitted, but are not acceptable (are, as noted immediately above, in  aggregations larger than job group; are not provided by sex and/or by each  minority group, etc.), the EOS should call the contractor and request that the  appropriate changes be made and the data resubmitted within 10 calendar days.   If, at the end of 10 calendar days, the data have not been received in a form  that is acceptable, a Show Cause Notice should be issued which itemizes the  regulatory sections with which the contractor has been found in violation. (see  Section 2H01(b)(1) and (2) and Figure 8-4).    Revised 5-25-90    2IREVIEW OF SECTION 503 AND 38 U.S.C. 4212 AAP(S) FOR ACCEPTABILITY    2I00GENERAL    As with an Executive Order AAP, the determination of the accept-ability of  items listed on page 4 of the SCRR for Section 503 and 38 U.S.C. 4212 AAPs is  limited to the evaluation which can be conducted at desk audit.  This is  different from an evaluation of the contractor's implementation of these items  which normally is done onsite (see Chapter 3).  Additionally, the Section 503  and 38 U.S.C. 4212 regulations require a number of contractor actions that,  while they need not be addressed in the AAP (although most contractors choose to  do so) must be carried out.  These addi-tional requirements are covered on SCRR  page 13, which is nor-mally completed onsite.     2I01ITEMS TO BE INCLUDED    The regulations at 41 CFR 60-741.5(a) require that a Section 503 AAP set  forth the contractor's policies, practices, and proce-dures in accordance with  41 CFR 60-741.6.  To be acceptable, a contractor's Section 503 AAP must address  at least those items listed in 41 CFR 60-741.6(a) through (f).  Similarly, the  regula-tions at 41 CFR 60-250.5(a) require that a 38 U.S.C. 4212 AAP set forth  the contractor's policies, practices and procedures in accordance with 41 CFR  60-250.6.  Therefore, to be acceptable, a contractor's 38 U.S.C. 4212 AAP must  address at least those items listed in 41 CFR 60-250.6(a) through (f).  Since  these items--(a) through (f)--are similar in both regulations, they are  discussed together below (where there are differences, it is pointed out).     2I02POLICY STATEMENT (Refer to 41 CFR 60-250.4(a) and 250.6(a) and 41 CFR  60-741.4(a) and 741.6(a).)    Contractors are required to take affirmative action to employ and advance in  employment qualified special disabled veterans, veterans of the Vietnam era,  and individuals with disabilities.  The con-tractor must affirm its commitment  to this affirmative action re-quirement by incorporating it in a policy  statement included in its AAP(s).      2I03REVIEW OF PERSONNEL POLICIES FOR PROPER CONSIDERATION OF QUALIFICATIONS  (Refer to 41 CFR 60-250.6(b) and 41 CFR 60-741.6(b).)    To be acceptable, the AAP(s) must affirm that the contractor has reviewed  its personnel processes to determine whether its present procedures ensure  careful, thorough, and systematic consideration of the job qualifications of  known individuals with disabilities, special disabled veterans, and Vietnam era  veterans who are applicants for job vacancies filled by employment or promotion,  and for all training opportunities offered or available.      (a)Use of Appendices B and C:  The procedures described at 41 CFR Part  60-250, Appendix B and/or 41 CFR Part 60-741, Ap- pendix C may be utilized in  fulfillment of this requirement.  Those procedures describe how the applications  or personnel forms of covered veterans and persons with disabilities may be  annotated regarding consideration for employment opportunities.     (b)Additional Requirement Under 41 CFR Part 60-250:  41 CFR 60-250.6(b) also  requires the contractor to limit its consider-ation of a covered veteran's  military record to only the portion of that record which is relevant to the  specific job qualifications for which the veteran is being considered.  This  should be affirmed in the AAP.    (c)Adequacy of Present Procedures:  If the contractor asserts that its  present procedures are adequate, this is acceptable if the EOS' investigation  shows that individuals with disabilities and covered veterans are afforded  hire, promotion and training opportunities.      2I04PHYSICAL AND MENTAL QUALIFICATIONS (Refer to 41 CFR 60-250.6(c)(1) and  41 CFR 60-741.6(c)(1).)    The AAP must contain the contractor's schedule for the review of all  physical and mental job qualification requirements.    (a)Scheduled Review:  To be acceptable, the AAP must either affirm that the  review of physical and mental job qualifications requirements has been completed, or provide a specific time schedule by which jobs are to be reviewed.  Where the AAP indicates that the review has  been completed, the contractor is not required to review those physical and  mental job qualification requirements again unless there is a change in working  conditions.  The AAP should state, however, that where there is such a change  in working conditions--for example, through increased automation--the re-  quirements will be reevaluated.    (b)Job-Relatedness of Physical and Mental Qualifications:  The AAP must  affirm that physical or mental job qualification requirements, to the extent  that such requirements tend to screen out qualified individuals with  disabilities or qualified special disabled veterans, shall be related to the  specific jobs for which such individuals are being considered, and shall be  consistent with business necessity and the safe performance of the job (refer to  41 CFR 60-250.6(c)(2) and 41 CFR 60-741.6(c)(2)).    (c)Confidentiality of Information:  To be acceptable, the AAP must affirm  that whenever the contractor inquires into an applicant or employee's physical  or mental condition or conducts a medical examination prior to employment or  change in employment status, information obtained as a result will be kept  confidential, except as otherwise provided for in the regulations (see 41 CFR  60-250.6(c)(3) and 41 CFR 60-741.6(c)(3)).      2I05REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION TO PHYSICAL AND MENTAL LIMITATIONS (Refer to 41  CFR 60-250.6(d)and 41 CFR    60-741.6(d).)    Contractors are required to make reasonable accommodation to the physical  and mental limitations of individuals with disabilities and special disabled  veterans, unless the contractor can demonstrate that such accommodation would  impose an undue hardship on the conduct of its business.  In determining the  extent to which a contractor is obligated to make accommodations, such factors  as business necessity and financial costs and expenses may be considered.  To  be acceptable, this section of the AAP must contain the contractor's policy with  respect to reasonable accommodations.  That statement must be consistent with  the requirements of the regulations.      2I06COMPENSATION (Refer to 41 CFR 60-250.6(e) and 41 CFR 60-741.6(e).)    In order to address this requirement in an acceptable manner, the AAP must  affirm that, in offering employment or promotion to in- dividuals with  disabilities, special disabled veterans, or veterans of the Vietnam era, the  amount of compensation offered is not reduced due to their receipt of any  disability income, pension or other benefit received from another source.      2I07OUTREACH, POSITIVE RECRUITMENT, EXTERNAL DISSEMINATION OF POLICY Refer  to 41 CFR 60-250.6(f) and 41 CFR    60-741.6(f).)    An acceptable AAP must affirm that the contractor reviews its employment  practices, and must at least state that appropriate outreach and positive  recruitment activities are undertaken where indicated by the findings of such  reviews.  The AAP may also describe in some detail the steps taken by the  contractor in its review of employment practices and the resulting outreach and  recruitment activities.  41 CFR 60-250.6(f) and 41 CFR 60-741.6(f) provide  additional guidance in assessing the accept- ability of this part of the  contractor's AAP(s).    2I08ADDITIONAL AAP INGREDIENTS    The following additional ingredients should be included in the contractor's  Section 503 and 38 U.S.C. 4212 AAP(s):    (a)Internal Dissemination of Policy (Refer to 41 CFR 60-250.6 (g) and 41 CFR  60-741.6(g)):  The AAP should address the contractor's procedures for internal  dissemination of its affirmative action policy.  The regulations cited above  provide examples of the types of activities contractors may take in this area  (e.g., contractors may conduct meetings with executive, managerial, and  supervisory personnel to explain the intent of the policy and to delineate  individual responsibility for its implementation, include the policy in internal  publications, etc.).    (b)Responsibility for Implementation (Refer to 41 CFR 60-250.6 (h) and 41  CFR 60-741.6(h)):  The AAP should identify the person(s) responsible for  implementing the contractor's policy with respect to individuals with  disabilities and covered veterans and should describe his or her  responsibilities.  It should also describe the responsibilities of line  man-agement in carrying out the policy.  The regulations cited  above provide  further guidance in this area.     (c)Development and Execution of Action Programs (Refer to 41 CFR 60-250.6(i)  and 41 CFR 60-741.6(i)):  The AAP should include a description of the specific  action programs which have been developed and implemented by the contractor.   The regulations cited above provide guidance on types of action programs.  While  the action programs described are guide- lines, not requirements, they do  provide a means by which the contractor's efforts to comply with its affirmative  action and equal employment opportunity obligations, as described in the AAP(s),  can be evaluated.    2JSUMMARY OF PROBLEMS WITH AAP AND SUPPORT DATA AND DEVELOPMENT OF ONSITE  PLAN    Problems identified with the completeness, reasonableness and/or  acceptability of the AAPs and support data are checked on page 4 of the SCRR,  and the specific problem described on SCRR page 9.  For each such problem,  actions taken at desk audit to resolve it and/or actions planned for onsite are  described.    2J00ITEMS RESOLVED AT DESK AUDIT    Some problems with the AAP(s) and support data may be resolved at desk audit  after further contact with the contractor.  For exam-ple, if the problem were ""Can't  evaluate job group acceptability because there is no information on what job  titles are in each group,"" the entry may be ""Called J. Smith 5/1/88  and asked him to send a list of titles in each group.  List received 5/8/88.""      2J01ITEMS TO BE RESOLVED ONSITE - ONSITE PLAN    Other items will only be resolvable onsite, and an onsite plan for each  should be briefly described.  For example, if the problem were ""Minority  availability for Foremen group appears low given minority % in blue collar area,""  the entry may be ""Determine how foreman jobs filled.  If internally,  examine incumbents' files to identify feeder jobs.""  If a problem has not  been resolved by the conclusion of desk audit, the column labeled ""Onsite?""  on SCRR page 9 is checked.  These checked items constitute the onsite plan for  resolving AAP and support data problems.    2KOVERVIEW OF PERSONNEL ACTIVITY, EEO TRENDS AND WORKFORCE  STRUCTURE/PERSONNEL PRACTICES    2K00PERSONNEL ACTIVITY (SUMMARY)    Page 5 of the SCRR provides an overview, by EEO-1 category, of personnel  activity during the prior year.  A summary of data on hires, promotions and  terminations should be abstracted from the data provided by the contractor, and  entered on the page.  A similar report, using a substitute SCRR page, can be  prepared from EEO-6 data for educational institutions.  This information, used  in conjunction with historical data analyzed through the EEO Trend Analysis  (below) provides a broad framework for later detailed review by job group of  affirmative action progress (placement goals) and potential discrimination in  employment activity (Impact Ratio Analysis).  Also, because this information is  by particular minority group, it can be used in conjunction with the EEO Trend  Analysis (below) to identify any potential problems for a particular minority  group.    2K01EEO TREND ANALYSIS    An initial assessment of the contractor's workforce and utilization trends  can be made by reviewing EEO-1 reports.  Page 6 of the SCRR is a Worksheet for  entry of EEO-1 data and page 7 provides for a narrative evaluation of those  data.    (a)Long-Term, Short-Term:  Current AAP data are compared with:  (1) the  contractor's profile approximately five years ago    (drawn from the earliest data on the current EEDS report) to look at  long-term trends; and (2) that profile approximately one year ago to look at  short-term trends.  An alternate SCRR page 6 is available for use with EEO-6  data (which are reported on a two-year cycle) for university reviews.  This  information provides an overview of:    oThe distribution of jobs within the contractor's workforce (white-collar,  blue-collar, predominant EEO categories);    oThe direction of change in the total workforce and particular categories  (expanding, contracting, stable); and    oWhether minority and female representation has been increasing or  decreasing, and in what areas.    (b)Changes Due to Reclassifications:  If the EOS observes major changes in  the sizes of EEO categories (p. 6) with little or no corresponding activity (p.  5), further investigation onsite may be needed to determine if the changes are  due to the reclassification of jobs with concentrations of minorities or women  from one EEO-1 category to another.  For example, suppose the total number of  positions in the craft category increases from one year to the next and  indicates an increase in women. Over the same time period, however, both the  total number of operative positions and the total number of women listed as  operatives decreases.  The EOS may then infer that the increase in crafts may  have resulted from the contractor's changing the EEO-1 category of the women's  jobs, rather than from genuine promotions.    (c)EEO Category Patterns:  This analysis also permits identification of  broad areas where minorities/women have been persistently underrepresented or  concentrated, setting a framework for the detailed review of the workforce  analysis for potential discrimination problems and review of the contractor's  goals progress by job group.    (d)Particular Minority Group:  Additionally, this analysis permits  identification of any substantial disparity in the representation of a  particular minority group--whether in the workforce as a whole or in certain  categories--when compared to the distribution of particular minority groups in  the contractor's labor area and/or in possible internal feeder categories.   Where such a disparity is identified, the EOS should plan to conduct standard  discrimination analyses by the particular minority group, at least in those  workforce areas where the disparity exists and for the type of activity most  likely to have created the disparity.  For example, if Hispanics are well  represented in the labor area, but have historically been absent from the  contractor's workforce, the EOS should plan to conduct hiring IRAs separately  for Hispanics.  Or, if Blacks have historically been concentrated in Laborers,  but poorly represented in Operatives and Crafts:  (1) the EOS' review of the  workforce analysis should focus on the types of jobs held by Blacks and any  structural impediments to upward mobility from those jobs; and (2) the EOS' blue  collar IRAs--particularly for promotions and hires into jobs above  Laborers--should be conducted separately for Blacks.  Further discussion of such  separate discrimination analysis for a particular minority group is given at  Sections 2N00 and 2O02 below.  Please also note that if investigation of such a  disparity does not show discrimination, the EOS should consider whether goals  and/or specific affirmative action steps for the particular group are warranted  (see Section 2G07(c) above).    2K02WORKFORCE STRUCTURE, PERSONNEL PRACTICES     In the initial review of the AAP and support data, the EOS eval-uated the  workforce analysis for reasonableness and acceptabil-ity.  As a result, the EOS  should have a basic understanding of the contractor's organization and  operations.  For example, the workforce analysis should show whether the  contractor's facility is organized by department or other unit (e.g., division),  whether lines of progression exist, how pay is structured, and other  characteristics which may prove useful for subsequent analyses of both  affirmative action and potential discrimination issues.  Other supporting data  which may be provided with the AAP, such as copies of labor agreements, should  provide additional information regarding pay rates, work performed,  organizational structure, and rules for internal mobility, at least in the blue  collar sector.  This information, to the extent that it is available during the  desk audit, should be entered on page 8 of the SCRR.      2LGOALS PROGRESS AND GOOD FAITH EFFORTS    A contractor's compliance posture is not measured by whether it met all its  goals, but rather whether it made a good faith effort to do so.  Generally,  however, if properly determined goals in a job group were met, further  examination of good faith effort with respect to that job group is unnecessary.   Therefore, in order to focus the investigation of good faith effort, the  following steps are taken:  (1) measure the degree of progress in job groups  where goals were established and opportunities occurred; (2) evaluate the  contractor's resulting overall goals performance; and (3) identify areas where  specific additional information is needed in order to evaluate good faith  effort.    2L00  ANALYSIS OF GOALS PROGRESS    As noted earlier, to be acceptable, AAP support data must include a report  of progress on prior AAP year goals.  Also, a report of progress on current  goals should be included at least if the con-tractor is six months or more into  its current AAP year when it receives the Scheduling Letter.  This report should  be used to conduct the analysis of goals progress on page 10 of the SCRR.    (a)Data Needed:  To conduct this analysis, first the EOS must identify the  job groups for which goals were established at the beginning of the period under  review.  Second, the percentage placement goal for each such group must be  determined.  Third, for each such job group, the number of total placements and  the number of minority and of female placements must be determined.  If this  information has not been submitted for desk audit (see Section 2H00 above), the  EOS will conduct the analysis below at whatever point in the review sufficient  information is obtained.    (b)Analysis:  The analysis itself takes into consideration the number of  opportunities in relationship to the goal.  More specifically, the percentage  placement goal is multiplied by the number of placements that actually occurred  to determine how many minorities/women would have been placed if the goal were  met.  This result is then compared to the number of minorities/women who  actually were placed, and the difference--plus or minus--entered.    EXAMPLE:  If the contractor set a goal of 10% for minorities in XYZ job  group and had 20 openings, the goal would have been met if it placed 2  minorities (.10 X 20).  If the contractor actually placed one minority, the  difference would be ""-1.""  On the other hand, if it actually placed  five minorities, the difference would be ""+3.""    If the contractor established a goal for a particular minor-ity group or for  men or women of a particular minority group (see Section 2G07(c) above), the  evaluation of progress on that goal is conducted in the same fashion as in the  above example.  See the SCRR instructions for page 10 for further examples.       (c)Net Change:  SCRR page 10 also has an optional part II on Workforce  Change, which provides for entry of data on job group incumbency (total, women  and minorities) at the begin-ning of the period and at the end of the period,  and determination of net change (plus or minus).  This information may be  useful in identifying job groups where, although  there has been progress in  placements, there has been little or no improvement in minority and/or female  representation (this can be for either positive or negative reasons--i.e.,  disproportionate promotions out, terminations, etc.).  It can also help the EOS  to focus on anomalies in the contractor's data, such as increases in job group  size without evidence of placement activity.    2L01EVALUATION OF GOOD FAITH EFFORT    (a)Overall Performance:  In evaluating the contractor's good faith effort,  an overall assessment of its goals/affirmative action performance should first  be made (SCRR page 11,    part I).  For example, was there progress in most areas where goals were  established?  In areas with little progress, are there any balancing factors  such as strong performance in similar but higher level jobs?  For example,  little progress in Operatives II, but progress well above expectations in  Operatives III.  Were there performance problems in areas with poor long-term  trends (SCRR page 6)?  This evaluation should also take into account fulfillment  of AAP commitments and the quality of those commitments in terms of creative  problem solving to remove any impediments to minority/female utilization over  both the long and short term.    (b)Goal Areas Needing Further Examination for Good Faith Effort:  As a  result of the above evaluation, identify any goal areas which need further  evaluation for good faith effort (SCRR page 11, part II).  For each such goal  area, review any contractor description of good faith efforts pertinent to the  area.  This should be presented as part of the contractor's report on goals.   Also use the AAP and support data to try to identify the probable reason for  lack of progress and the type of AAP action items that would be pertinent.  For  example, do the support data on employment activity show that the jobs were  filled predominantly by hire or by promotion?  If by hire, was there low  applicant flow?  What AAP commitments did the contractor make on recruitment  efforts?  Is there any evidence they were fulfilled?  If jobs were filled  primarily by promotion, was there an adequate representation of minorities/women  in probable feeder groups?  What AAP commitments did the contractor make  concerning the promotion process (job posting, encouraging bidding, training,  etc.).  Is there any evidence they were fulfilled?    2L02ONSITE PLAN FOR EVALUATION OF GOOD FAITH EFFORT    For each goal area where there is insufficient desk audit information to  determine good faith effort, list (on SCRR page 11a, part II) the additional  information needed.  For example, in a Clerical I job group there may have been  no goals progress for minorities, and low applicant flow appears to be the  reason.  The AAP may state that a particular agency would be used to recruit  minority applicants for the Clerical 1 job group.  The additional information  needed here may include contact with the agency to confirm its use by the  contractor (as well as other action, such as identifying additional recruitment  sources while onsite).  If questions concerning good faith effort in a job area  have not been resolved by the conclusion of desk audit, the ""Onsite?""  column on SCRR page 11 is checked.  These checked items form the onsite plan for  this portion of the review.    2MPOTENTIAL DISCRIMINATION ANALYSES - GENERAL    2M00TITLE VII PRINCIPLES    It is OFCCP policy, in conducting analyses of potential discrimi-nation  issues under the Executive Order, to follow Title VII principles.    2M01USE OF TERM ""MINORITIES""     The term ""minorities"" means those four groups for which EEO-1  reporting is required--i.e. Blacks, Hispanics, Asians/Pacific Islanders and  American Indians/Alaskan Natives.  As used in these instructions for desk audit  potential discrimination analyses, ""minorities"" may mean those groups  in the aggregate or individually, depending on the characteristics of the labor  area and/or on patterns in the contractor's workforce.  In general, where there  is an observed disparity in the representation of a particular minority group,  standard desk audit potential discrimination analyses will be conducted  separately for that group.  See further discussion of this matter under EEO  Trend Analysis, Review of Workforce Analysis and Impact Ratio Analyses below.      2NREVIEW OF THE WORKFORCE ANALYSIS    2N00GENERAL    An understanding of how employees obtained their jobs, the effects of  seniority, rules for promotion and transfer, etc., is necessary in order to  understand how the contractor's employment system works.  Patterns of minority  and female employment must be examined, and apparent disparities (e.g., where  they are or are not employed in departments, progression lines, job titles, and  other relevant job areas) identified for further investigation onsite.  For  example, men may supervise work units which are composed predominantly of women;  or, a job title may be composed predominantly of minorities in one department,  and predominantly of nonminorities in another.  Such disparities may indicate  dis-criminatory placement or promotional practices or other Executive Order  violations.  The results of the review of minority and female employment  patterns is summarized on page 14 of the SCRR.     2N01MINORITY GROUP ANALYSIS    If the EOS' review of the contractor's EEO category data (SCRR page 7)  showed substantial disparities in the representation of a particular minority  group in the workforce as a whole or in distribution among EEO categories, the  review of the workforce analysis should focus on that minority group, at least  in those workforce areas where the disparity was observed.  For example, if  category data showed that Blacks were concentrated in Laborers, poorly  represented in Operatives and absent in Crafts, the EOS' review of the workforce  analysis should specifically identify the types of blue collar jobs in which  Blacks are employed, whether these jobs fall into lines of progression or  departments/ units that tend to inhibit progression to Operatives and Crafts,  etc.  Even where such disparities are not observed in the initial category  screen, where the labor area has high representation of more than one minority  group and/or the general employment patterns in the industry involved have  differed among minority  groups, in reviewing the workforce analysis the EOS  should be alert for any indications of potential problems in the distribution  of the particular minority groups.    2N02UNDERREPRESENTATIONS AND CONCENTRATIONS    In examining patterns of minority group and female employment, the EOS is  looking for evidence of concentrations and under-representations.    (a)Concentration:  The term concentration means that minority groups and/or  women are found in a particular section (job area) of a contractor's workforce  (however that section is defined) in numbers substantially greater than would be  expected in terms of their overall representation in the contractor's workforce,  or in a relevant sector (however defined) of that workforce.    (b)Underrepresentation:  The term underrepresentation means the  opposite--that minority groups and/or women are found in a particular section of  a contractor's workforce in numbers substantially fewer than would be expected  in terms of their overall representation in the contractor's workforce or  relevant sector of that workforce.      (c)Interpreting Results:  The identification of a concentration or  underrepresentation does not mean that discrimination has been found.  It is  only an indicator that further investigation is warranted.      2N03DETERMINING THE RELEVANT WORKFORCE SECTOR AND JOB AREAS     (a)Relevance of Other Information:  In determining the relevant workforce  sector and job areas for the analysis, the EOS must be guided by the findings of  the desk audit up to this point.  For example, the information obtained from the  EOS' earlier analysis of EEO trends (SCRR, page 7) can assist in identifying  areas, by EEO-1 category, which may show persistent minority or female  representation above or below comparable availability; or, as discussed in 2N00  above, the EOS may have identified a substantial disparity in the  representation of a particular minority group.  Information derived from the  earlier review of the organization of the contractor's workforce and personnel  practices (e.g., internal mobility, pay structure), (SCRR, page 8) may be  helpful in making further comparisons.    (b)Workforce Sector/Job Area - General:  In determining the relevant sector  of the contractor's workforce with which minority group or female representation  in a particular job area is to be compared (e.g., blue collar, white collar,  clerical, the entire workforce, or even job group), the EOS should remember that  there should be a reasonable expectation that, absent discrimination,  minorities/women would be fairly evenly distributed among the job areas within  the sector.  That expectation is high when (1) entry-level jobs in the sector  share similar qualification requirements; and (2) jobs above entry-level in the  sector are filled primarily by promotion.  The expectation gets progressively  lower as entry-level jobs in the sector become more differentiated in skill  requirements (since it becomes more likely that minority/female availability  will differ) and/or jobs above entry are filled predominantly by hire.    (c)Relationship to Particular Contractor:  An appropriate definition of the  workforce sector is, therefore, related to the particular contractor's  structure, legitimate skill needs and personnel practices.  In general, analyses  that focus on where minorities/women are located organizationally (which  departments, units, lines of progression, etc.) will tend to identify potential  placement problems.  Analyses that focus on the level at which minorities/women  are employed (concentrated in lowest level jobs within an LOP, department, etc.)  tend to identify potential promotion problems (that may, in turn, be related to  placement).  For example:    (1)Workforce as Sector/Departments as Job Area:  Where there are departments  or organizational units with largely similar qualifications for entry-level positions (e.g., unskilled and, to a more limited extent, semi-skilled, in blue-collar; undifferentiated trainee jobs in white-collar ), representation in each department may be compared to representation in the total workforce of all such departments.      (2)Workforce as Sector/Lines of Progression as Job Area: Where there are  lines of progression (LOPs) or usual promotional sequences that cut across  department lines and have similar entry-level requirements, representa-ion in  each LOP may be compared to representation in the total workforce of all such  LOPs.      (3)Department as Sector/LOPs within Department as Job Area:  Where there are  separate lines of progression and/or usual promotional sequences within a  department or similar organizational unit, representation in each LOP may be  compared to their representation in the department as a whole.    (4)Department as Sector/Jobs within Department as Job Area:  In the absence  of LOPs or usual promotional sequences, where jobs within a department are  usually filled by promotion from within--or might reasonably be filled in such a  manner based on the nature of the jobs involved and the training which the  contractor could reasonably be expected to offer (e.g., on-the-job  training)--representation in a particular job area within that department may be  compared to representation in the department as a whole.      (5)EEO Category as Sector/Type of Job as Job Area:  It can be useful to  compare representation in an EEO category or job group against distribution  within titles in that category/group.  For example, in an Office and Clerical  category, women may be concentrated in General Clerical positions, but  underrepresented in Production and Material Control clerical jobs.      (6)Lines of Progression as Sector/Jobs in LOP as Job Area: A line of  progression or usual promotional sequence--particularly one with a large number  of incumbents--may also be treated as a ""sector,"" and minority/female  representation in the LOP compared with their representation in jobs at  different levels in the LOP.    (7)Job Title as Sector/Job Title within Department as Job Area - Where a job  title--particularly one with a large number of total incumbents--appears in  several depart-ments, representation in the title as a whole can be compared  with representation in the title in each department.    (d)Applicability to Both White-Collar and Blue-Collar Jobs:  These analyses  can be applied to both white collar and blue collar situations.  In all cases,  the EOS should ensure that the sector of the contractor's workforce which is  used as a basis for comparison with a particular job area is, in fact, relevant.   Particularly in the white collar area, differences with respect to factors  such as education or skills may make establishing a basis for comparison  difficult.  However, where it appears that the majority of a white collar  workforce consists of highly specialized jobs (an engineering firm, a scientific  research laboratory), it is generally best to separate clerical positions from  other white collar jobs when defining the base of comparison.    (e)Defining ""Substantially"":  Once the job area and the relevant  workforce sector have been selected, the next step is to identify those job  areas which have ""substantially"" more or fewer minorities and/or women  than would reasonably be expected by their representation in the workforce  sector selected.  These are the job areas which will be investigated further  onsite.  The term ""substantially"" as used here, however, cannot be so  precisely defined as to fit all cases.  In identifying job areas for further  investigation, EOSs must be guided by common sense, reasonableness, and the  nature of the information available up to that point.  In some instances, areas  of minority group/female concentration and underrepresentation will be readily  apparent from review of the workforce analysis.  In others, there may be a need  for more precise identification of potential problem areas.  One method which  may be used to identify job areas for further investigation onsite is the Job  Area Acceptance Range (JAAR).    (f)Use of the Job Area Acceptance Range (JAAR):  The JAAR is a formula which  may be used to determine whether a particular job area represents an area of  concentration or underrepresentation for minorities and/or women.  There is an  optional SCRR Worksheet for using the JAAR.    (1)Relationship to ""80% or four-fifths"" Rule of Thumb:   The JAAR  is based on the ""80% or four-fifths"" rule of thumb, similar to that  used in identifying whether a selection rate for a particular group represents  an adverse impact in selection (see Impact Ratio Analyses below).  For the JAAR,  the assumption is that the percentage representation of minorities and/or women  in a particular job area will normally fall in a range plus or minus 20% of  their representation in the relevant base workforce sector.    (2)Computing the JAAR:  To find this range, therefore, the percentage of  minorities or women in the base sector is multiplied by .20 and the result is  added to and subtracted from the percentage of minorities or women in the base  sector.  For example, if the broad sector had 50% minorities, the JAAR range  would be found by multiplying 50% X .20, and the result, 10%, would be  subtracted from and added to 50% for a JAAR range of 40% to 60%.    (3)Applying the JAAR:  The minority/female percentage in each job area  within the base sector is then compared to the range.  If the percentage in a  job area falls below the range (in the example, less than 40%), the area is  considered underrepresented; if it exceeds the range (in the example, more than  60%), the job area is considered concentrated.    (g)Role of Recent Personnel Activity Data:  Employment data shown in the  workforce analysis represent a cumulative record of past employment activity.   Data summarized in Impact Ratio Analyses (IRAs, below) represent more recent  employment activity.  As a result, in determining which job areas should be  investigated further onsite, EOSs should give a high priority to areas in which  recent employment activity appears to mirror the effects of prior activity.  For  example, there may be adverse IRAs for placement into job groups in areas where  minorities and/or women are underrepresented.    (h)Recording Results:  When, as a result of the review of the workforce  analysis, job areas exhibiting concentrations and underrepresentations are  identified for further investigation onsite, this information is entered on  page 17 of the SCRR, and an onsite plan developed for their investigation.  This  plan may include a request for the contractor's adverse impact determinations  for job titles in concentrated/under- represented areas.  Such information may assist the EOS, in onsite analysis  of potential placement problems, in determining whether there has been activity and of what type during the normal liability period, etc.  See Section 2O04(a) below and Chapters 3 and 7.    2OAUDIT OF PERSONNEL ACTIVITY - IMPACT RATIO ANALYSES    2O00DEFINITION    The Impact Ratio Analysis (IRA) is a method for identifying personnel  activity which should be investigated further onsite.  The IRA is a ratio  between two selection rates, one for minorities or women, and one for others.  Generally, a selection rate for minorities or women which is less than 80% of the selection rate for  nonminorities or men, as appropriate, for a particular personnel activity (e.g.,  hiring, promotion, termination) should be investigated further during the  onsite.  Although related, adverse IRAs should not be confused with the term ""adverse  impact.""  Refer to Chapter 7, Section 7E01, for a definition of the latter  term.     2O01  CALCULATING THE IRA    Page 15 of the SCRR provides a Worksheet for conducting impact ratio  analyses.  The Worksheet is used to compute IRAs for hiring, promotions, and  terminations, and may be adapted to compute IRAs for other data the contractor  may provide (e.g., training, transfers, etc.).     (a)Selection Rates:  The first step in calculating the IRA is to find the  selection rate for minorities or women and the selection rate for others.    (b)Focus on Unfavorable Selection Rate of Minorities/Women:  The next step  is to compare the selection rate for minorities/women to the rate for others.   As a matter of administrative discretion in compliance reviews, OFCCP will  focus on situations in which the selection rate for minorities or women is less  favorable than the rate for others.*  For positive actions, such as hires or  promotions, this will be where the minority or female rate is lower; for  negative actions, such as terminations, it will be where the minority or female  rate is higher.    (c)Finding the Impact Ratio:  Consistent with (b) above, the IRA is  calculated when the selection rate for minorities or women is less favorable.   Therefore, for positive personnel actions the IRA is found by dividing the lower  minority or female rate by the rate for others.  The IRA for negative personnel  actions is found by dividing the rate for others by the higher minority or  female rate.      (d)Number of Persons Potentially Affected:  For adverse IRAs, the SCRR  Worksheet referenced above provides an additional calculation to determine how  many minorities or women are potentially affected.  This information may be  useful in setting investigative priorities.  See Appendix 2A for detailed  instructions for using the Worksheet.     __________    *The EOS should be aware, however, that sometimes a more favorable rate for minorities or women may indicate ""channeling"" into different--and perhaps, less favorable--jobs than others.    2O02MINORITY GROUP ANALYSIS    If the EOS' review of the contractor's EEO category data (SCRR page 7)  showed substantial disparities in the representation of a    particular minority group in the workforce as a whole or in distribution  among EEO categories, IRAs should be conducted for that group(s) separately, at  least for those workforce areas where the disparity was observed and for  activity elements likely to have contributed to the disparity.  For example, if  category data showed that Hispanics were persistently absent from the workforce,  all hiring IRAs should be conducted separately for Hispanics.  Or, in an example  used earlier (2N00), where Blacks were concentrated in Laborers, poorly  represented in Operatives and absent from Crafts, IRAs for blue collar job  groups--particularly for promotions and hires into Operatives and Crafts    --should be conducted separately for Blacks.  Even where such disparities  are not observed in the initial category screen, where the labor area has high  representation of more than one minority group and/or the general employment  patterns in the industry involved have differed among minority groups, in  reviewing the contractor's activity data preparatory to conducting IRA analyses,  the EOS should be alert for any indications of potential problems in selections  of particular minority groups.    2O03  PROPER USE OF THE IRA     It is important to remember that an adverse IRA is only a pre-liminary  indicator of a potential discrimination problem.  It is not proof, in and of  itself, of discrimination, or of the existence of an affected class.  For  example, an adverse IRA in a job group may have been computed using an  insufficiently refined candidate pool.  Only further investigation onsite can  determine whether discrimination has occurred.      2O04 IRA SUMMARY AND ONSITE PLAN    Where adverse IRAs are identified, and further investigation is needed, the  EOS should describe the problem on SCRR page 17 (Summary of Potential  Discrimination Problems) and indicate that will be needed onsite to determine  whether the adverse IRA represents apparent discrimination.    (a)Contractor Adverse Impact Determinations (Contractors with 100 or More  Employees):    (1)Maintenance of Records:  As noted earlier in the discussion of the  acceptability of support data, the Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection  Procedures at 41 CFR 60-3.4 and 60-3.15 require contractors with 100 or more  employees to maintain records by job title sufficient to disclose the impact which its selection procedures (including hiring, promotion and termination) have on the employment opportunities of  women and on each minority group for whom EEO-1 reporting is required.    (2)Analysis of Impact:  The Guidelines at 41 CFR 60-3.4 and 3.15(A)(2) also  require that contractors with 100 or more employees annually analyze these data  to determine whether the total selection process for each job is having adverse  impact.  These determinations are required by sex and for each race/national  origin group (e.g., Black, Hispanic, Asian/Pacific Islander, American  Indian/Alaskan Native) which constitutes 2% or more of the labor force in the  relevant labor area or 2% or more of the applicable workforce (i.e. for jobs  filled internally).      (3)Requesting Contractor Determinations:  When the EOS has identified a job  group with an adverse IRA, and the contractor employs 100 or more persons, the  contractor should be requested to furnish (at desk audit or onsite) its relevant  adverse impact determinations for the job titles which fall within the job  group.  For example, if the adverse IRA is for female hires into a  Administrative Professionals job group, the contractor should be asked to submit  its adverse impact determinations for the hiring of women in each title within  the Administrative Professionals group.  This will assist the EOS in determining  whether the IRA does or does not need to be refined before investigating further  (see Chapter 3).  The EOS may also request the contractor's adverse impact  analyses in other areas.  For example, review of the workforce analysis may have  shown concentrations/underrepresentations that suggest a potential placement problem.  Job group activity data, however, may not show placements into the titles of concern, and the EOS could request the contractor's adverse impact analyses for hires, promotions and transfers into  those titles.  Where appropriate, the EOS may also ask to review the contractor's adverse impact analyses generally and/or may ask the contractor to identify those jobs where its analyses showed adverse impact.    (b)Need for Information about the Selection Process:  The EOS should also  plan to obtain the contractor's description of how employment decisions are made  for positions in the job group, including the steps in the process and, for each  step, the decision makers, criteria used and a description of how they are used,  and records maintained.  Steps may include, for example, review of application  forms by personnel, written tests, formal or informal interviews, physical  examinations, or on-the-job tests.  The EOS should plan to verify the  contractor's statements through review of records, interviews with applicants  and/or employees, and, if possible, observing the process by which applicants  are screened and selected.     (c)Multi-Component Selection Processes - Contractor Obligations:     (1)Adverse Impact in Total Selection Process:  Where the contractor's  adverse impact analyses are requested (per 2O04(a) above) and submitted for desk  audit, if the analysis shows adverse impact in the total selection process for a  job, 41 CFR 60-3.4 and 60-3.15(A)(2) require the contractor to evaluate the  components of the total selection process for adverse impact.  Therefore, in a  multi-step and/or multi-criterion selection process with adverse impact, the EOS  should plan to request the contractor's records showing at what step(s) and/or  by what criterion(ia) minorities or women are being disproportionately screened  out.      (2)No Adverse Impact in Total Selection Process:  If the total selection  process for a job does not have an adverse impact, a contractor would not  normally be expected to evaluate the individual components for adverse impact or  to validate those components, and enforcement action would not normally be taken  based on a component.      (i)Special Circumstances:  In some circumstances, enforcement action may be  taken based on an individual component which has an adverse impact (e.g., height  and weight requirements) that cannot be justified based on job relatedness or  business necessity.    (ii)Relationship of ""Bottom Line"" to Individual Complaints of  Discrimination:  The ""bottom line"" standard with respect to adverse  impact does not mean that complaints alleging discrimination caused by a  component of a selection process will not be investigated.  However this  standard may be applied in an exercise of administrative discretion on whether  to file an enforcement action.  See Question and Answers Nos. 25 and 26 in  Adoption of Questions and Answers to Clarify and Provide a Common  Interpretation of the Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures.       2PCOMPENSATION ANALYSES    2P00GENERAL    While reviewing the workforce analysis for potentially discriminatory placement patterns, the EOS should be especially alert to potential disparities between the wages or salaries shown in the underrepresented areas as compared to those in areas of concentration.  For example, the same or similar job titles may appear in both areas, but show different wage rates or salary ranges, with the higher  wages/salaries shown in those areas where minorities, members of a particular minority group or women are under-represented.      2P01WAGE AND SALARY DATA    As noted earlier in the discussion regarding the reasonableness of a  workforce analysis, coded salary data are acceptable for desk audit purposes.   However, the workforce analysis (wage coded or not) must show titles in wage  rate order within each department or similar organizational unit and the coding  must be consistent across departments/units.  Therefore, when a workforce  analysis contains alpha or numeric codes for salary designations, a salary  analysis may still be conducted by assigning numeric equivalents to the codes (1  to the lowest code, 2 to the second lowest, etc.) and averages computed.  Where  potential problems are identified, the areas should be flagged for further  investigation onsite.  Actual salary information and/or the keys to the codes  for flagged areas should be obtained from the contractor at that time.       2P02IDENTIFICATION OF JOB TITLES FOR COMPARISON    During the desk audit the EOS should also identify specific job titles which  are held by both minorities (or members of a partiticular minority group) and  nonminorities, or both women and men, for onsite comparison of actual salaries.       2P03METHODS USED TO DETERMINE PAY    The EOS should also plan to review onsite how starting pay levels (wage or  salary) are established, and how raises (wage or salary) are determined.      2QSUMMARY OF POTENTIAL DISCRIMINATION PROBLEMS AND ONSITE INVESTIGATIVE PLAN      2Q00  FOCUS ON PROBLEM    While potential discrimination can be divided into problems identified  through analysis of personnel activity (IRAs), and problems identified in the  review of the workforce analysis (e.g., JAAR, Compensation analyses), and/or  problems highlighted by complaints, the focus should be on the problem itself.   Potential discrimination problems which have been identified during the desk  audit on pages 3 (Past Problems/Known Complaints), 14 (Results of Review of  Workforce Analysis), 15 (Impact Ratio Analyses), and 16 (Compensation and Other  Analyses) of the SCRR, should be summarized on page 17 of the SCRR.  As noted  above, the focus is on the problem itself, which although it may have been  identified through more than one analysis, need be  listed only once (e.g., an  area of minority concentration with an adverse IRA for minority promotions out  of the area).    2Q01  ONSITE PLAN    For each such potential discrimination problem, the EOS describes an onsite  investigative plan.  This plan should be as specific as possible, and should set  priorities for the documents to be gathered, the statistical data needed, the  people to be interviewed, and the materials to be reviewed while onsite.  For  example, if the compensation analysis identified job titles for salary  review,  the onsite plan should state that the personnel files of a specific number of  minorities/women and a specific number of others in the identified job title(s)  will be reviewed for actual salary information.  If the IRA indicates a  potential problem in minority hires into a particular job group, the procedures  to be followed (persons to interview, applications and personnel files to be  reviewed, information to be obtained) should be described.      2RPREPARING FOR THE ONSITE    2R00  DECISION TO GO ONSITE     Based on the results of the desk audit, the EOS must decide whether further  investigation onsite is warranted.  However, in most cases an onsite review will  be necessary, because even where potential problems in personnel activity or the  workforce are not identified during the desk audit, many contractor commitments  contained in the AAP cannot be evaluated without an onsite inspection,  corroborating interviews, etc.  Preparation for the onsite phase of the review  is therefore a necessary part of virtually every compliance review.      2R01  SCOPE OF ONSITE    If, at the end of desk audit, the EOS determines that an onsite review is  appropriate, that review will cover: (1) problem areas identified during desk  audit and unresolved at the conclusion of desk audit; and (2) examination of the  contractor's implementation of pertinent AAP items and of those regulatory obligations not  specifically required to be included in the AAP(s).  Refer to Chapter 3 of this  Manual for a complete discussion of onsite activities.    2R02ONSITE PLAN - RESULTS OF DESK AUDIT     The onsite plan is based primarily on the findings obtained as a result of  the desk audit.  These findings fall into two categories, affirmative action  and potential discrimination.     (a)Affirmative Action:  Affirmative action can be further subdivided into  two areas, written AAP and supporting data, and goal attainment and good faith  efforts.      (1)Written AAP and Supporting Data:  Problems identified in the written AAP  and supporting data, were described on page 9 of the SCRR and, for each such  problem, actions taken at desk audit to resolve it and/or actions planned for  onsite were described (see Section 2J above and SCRR Instructions).  If a  problem is not resolved by the conclusion of desk audit, the column on SCRR page  9 labeled ""Onsite?"" is checked.  These checked items constitute the  onsite plan for resolving AAP and support data problems.    (2)Goals Progress and Good Faith Efforts:  Specific job groups/areas where  additional information is needed to assess good faith effort were summarized on  SCRR page 11, part II.  For each such goal area, the specific information needed  to resolve the question of good faith effort was listed (see Section 2L02 above  and SCRR Instructions).  If a question of good faith effort is not resolved at  the conclusion of desk audit, the column on SCRR page 11 labeled ""Onsite?""  is checked.  These checked items constitute the onsite plan for resolving good  faith effort issues.    (b)Potential Discrimination:  Specific potential discrimination problems  (whether identified through the workforce analysis, IRAs, complaints or some  combination of these) were entered on page 17 of the SCRR.  For each such  potential problem, an investigative plan was developed, giving the specific  information needed to determine whether discrimination had occurred (see Section  2Q above and SCRR Instructions).  If a potential discrimination problem is not  resolved at the conclusion of desk audit, the column on SCRR page 17 labeled ""Onsite?""  is checked.  These checked items constitute the onsite plan for resolving  potential discrimination issues.    (c)Summary:  The onsite plan, therefore, consists of checked items in the ""Onsite?""  columns on SCRR pages 9, 11 and 17 in the major review areas of AAP and support  data problems, questions of good faith effort, and potential discrimination  issues.  These items, together with an examination of the contractor's  implementation of the AAP(s) and of the non-AAP areas discussed below, will  direct the onsite review.    2R03OTHER ONSITE INGREDIENTS - GENERAL     The onsite review also covers the contractor's implementation of Executive  Order AAP commitments generally, and specifically must address implementation  of:    oThe Guidelines on Religion and National Origin and Sex Discrimination (SCRR  page 12);    oSection 503 and 38 U.S.C. 4212 affirmative action/    nondiscrimination requirements (SCRR page 13); and     oTechnical requirements (SCRR optional Technical Requirements Worksheet).      2R04IMPLEMENTATION OF GUIDELINES ON RELIGION AND NATIONAL ORIGIN AND SEX  DISCRIMINATION GUIDELINES    (a)Guidelines on Religion and National Origin:  These Guidelines, at 41 CFR  Part 60-50, are not a required AAP ingredient under 41 CFR 60-2.13.  The  contractor's implementation of them, therefore, must be evaluated onsite.  Chapter 3, Section 3G provides detailed guidance on conducting this aspect of  the onsite review.    (b)Sex Discrimination Guidelines:  While these Guidelines, at 41 CFR Part  60-20, are a required AAP ingredient and will have been evaluated for  acceptability (See 41 CFR 60-2.13(h) and Section 2G15 above), the contractor's  implementation of them must be evaluated onsite.  This evaluation should include  a review of the contractor's maternity leave policy (which may not have been  submitted for desk audit) and its implementation as discussed in Chapter 3.  In  addition, although not specifically mentioned in the Guidelines, sexual  harassment (as well as harassment on the basis of race, national origin or  religion) is a violation of the Executive Order.  During the onsite, the EOS  should be alert for any indications of such harassment.  OFCCP follows Title VII  principles in determining whether sexual harassment has occurred.  Further  guidance in this area will be issued.    (c)Recording Results:  The evaluation of both Guidelines is entered on SCRR  page 12.  Particular attention should be directed to those portions of both  Guidelines that are not addressed elsewhere in the regulations--e.g., leave for  religious purposes, maternity leave.      2R05IMPLEMENTATION OF SECTION 503 AND 38 U.S.C. 4212 REQUIREMENTS    (a)Scope:  The onsite review must include examination of the contractor's  implementation of its affirmative action and nondiscrimination obligations with  respect to individuals with disabilities, special disabled veterans and veterans  of the Vietnam era.  Chapter 3 provides detailed guidance on conducting this  aspect of the onsite review.    (b)Non-AAP Requirements:  Along with findings on the contractor's  implementation of AAP ingredients, the  following non-AAP requirements must be  evaluated onsite.  Results of this evaluation are recorded on SCRR page 13, part  I.  Chapter 3 provides detailed guidance on conducting this aspect of the onsite  review.    (1)Invitation to Self-Identify:  Contractors must invite all applicants and  employees to identify themselves as covered veterans or persons with  disabilities.  Refer to 41 CFR 60-250.5(d) and 41 CFR 60-741.5(c).    (2)Availability of the AAP for Inspection:  Contractors must make the AAP  available for inspection by employees and applicants for employment.  The  location and hours during which the AAP is available must be posted.  Refer to  41 CFR 60-250.5(c) and 41 CFR 60-741.5(d).     (3)Listing of Employment Openings:  The Affirmative Action Clause at 41 CFR  60-250.4 requires that covered con-    tractors list all suitable employment openings with the local office of the  State Employment Service.    (4)VETS 100 Filing Requirement:  A contractor covered by 41 CFR Part 60-250  must report at least annually to DOL's Office of the Assistant Secretary for  Veterans' Employment and Training (OASVET) on the number of covered veterans in  its workforce and the number of covered veterans hired.  See 41 CFR Chapter 61.   A copy of the VETS 100 Form and its instructions is included in Chapter 3  (Figure 3-3).     (c)Discrimination:  The onsite evaluation of the contractor's implementation  of its affirmative action obligations under Section 503 and 38 U.S.C. 4212, also  includes investigation for discrimination against individuals with disabilities  or covered veterans.  This includes identification of any qualified individuals  with disabilities or covered veterans screened out by personnel practices or job  requirements not shown to be consistent with business necessity and the safe  performance of the job, and any who could have performed the job involved given  reasonable accommodation to their disability.  The types of materials that may  be examined onsite in this area are discussed on SCRR page 13, Part II and its  instructions, and in Chapter 3.    (d)Technical Requirements:  Additionally, there are a number of technical  requirements which the Section 503 and 38 U.S.C. 4212 programs share with the  Executive Order program.  These are addressed in 2R06(a) below.     2R06TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS    The onsite review must also cover the contractor's implementation of  technical requirements.  These fall in the following areas:  (1) those mandated  by the EEO/AA clauses of all three OFCCP programs; (2) those specific to the  Executive Order program; and (3) those pertaining to OFCCP responsibilities  under the Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA).  There is an optional SCRR  Worksheet for recording the results of the audit of Technical Requirements.    (a)All Three Programs:  In addition to requiring that covered contractors  not discriminate against and take affirmative action on behalf of covered group  members, the Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action Clauses at 41 CFR  60-1.4(a), 41 CFR 60-250.4, and 41 CFR 60-741.4, contain a number of other  requirements.      (1)Inclusion of Clauses:  Each EEO/AA clause must be included, either in its  entirety or by reference, in all covered contracts, subcontracts, and purchase  orders.  Additionally, notice of the VETS 100 filing requirement must be  included.    (2)Informing of Obligations - Vendors and Subcontractors:  Contractors must  advise vendors and subcontractors of their obligation to develop an AAP if they  meet coverage thresholds.    (3)Informing of Obligations - Unions:  Contractors must inform any labor  unions or worker representatives with which they have a collective bargaining  agreement or other agreement of the contractor's commitments under the  regulations.    (4)Posting of Notice:  Contractors must post notice of their EEO/AA  obligations in conspicuous places, available to both employees and applicants  for employment.    (b)Requirements Specific to the Executive Order Program:  The Executive  Order regulations additionally require:    (1)EEO Tag Line:  Advertisements and solicitations for employment must state  that all qualified applicants will be considered, regardless of race, color,  sex, national origin or religion (see 41 CFR 60-1.4(a)(2) and 60-1.41).    (2)Standard Form 100:  The contractor must have filed a current Standard  Form 100 (EEO-1 or, for universities, EEO-6) as required by 41 CFR 60-1.7(a)(1).  (NOTE:  Where the contractor is found not to have filed a Standard Form 100, the  EOS--in addition to including the matter in a Conciliation Agreement--will  notify the OFCCP National Office by completing and forwarding the form provided  in the EEDS Manual for this purpose.)  The contractor must also notify its  vendors and subcontractors of their obligation to file a Standard Form 100  annually.    (c)IRCA - Forms I-9 Inspection:  The onsite review also must include a  review of the contractor's INS (Immigration and Naturalization Service) Forms  I-9.  This form is used to verify that employees hired since November 7, 1986,  are legally eligible to work in the United States under the provisions of the  Immigration Reform and Control Act.  As noted below, the contractor must be  given at least three days advance notice of a Forms I-9 inspection.  Chapter 3  includes a copy of the I-9 Form and its instructions (Figure 3-1), specific  guidance on the contents of this inspection (3E), and a copy of the ESA Form 91  used to record the results of this inspection (Figure 3-2).    2SNOTICE OF ONSITE REVIEW    EOSs are required to provide written notice of the scheduling of the onsite  review to contractors.  This notice of onsite should be a follow-up to an  earlier telephone contact establishing the date and time that the onsite review  will begin.      2S00TELEPHONE NOTICE     In telephoning the contractor to establish the date the onsite will begin,  the EOS should also request that the contractor have additional required  information available at the beginning of the onsite.  This information will  have been identified as a result of problems with the data that the contractor  submitted or failed to submit for the desk audit, or potential problems found  during desk audit.  This contact provides the contractor with lead time to  locate the information.  It also allows the EOS to determine whether the  information is available and in what form.  During the conversation the  contractor would also be told of the need to inspect I-9 forms.      2S01WRITTEN CONFIRMATION OF ONSITE    A letter must be sent to the contractor confirming the phone notice of the  onsite, the date and time the onsite will begin, and that an I-9 inspection will  be conducted (to provide the required formal 3-day notice of such an  inspection).    (a)List of Materials:  The onsite confirmation letter must include a list of  the materials which the contractor should make available at the start of the  onsite.    (1)Materials Related to Specific Findings:  Items which relate to specific  preliminary findings noted during the desk audit should be requested.  For  example, where the EOS has identified adverse IRAs, a list of the employment  actions involved or the contractor's adverse impact determinations for titles in  the job group and type of activity involved should be requested; or,  where the  desk audit has indicated salary questions, the key to any salary codes should be  requested.  Also, the EOS should note that personnel files, applications, and  resumes should be available for inspection.      (2)Materials Not Included in Original Submission:  Items which may not have  been included in the original AAP and supporting data submission--such as copies  of employment advertisements, purchase orders, employment applications, labor  agreements, and policy manuals, should be requested.  Where appropriate, the EOS  may also ask that the contractor's adverse impact determinations be available for review or that the contractor identify those jobs where the results of its analysis showed adverse impact.    (3)I-9's and VETS 100 Report:  Because EOSs must review I-9 forms and verify that the contractor has filed the VETS 100 Report, the contractor must be informed of the need to have these available for inspection.       (4)Additional Information:  A request should also be made for the names of  applicants and employees who have responded to the contractor's invitation to  self-identification or who have otherwise become known to the contractor as  individuals with disabilities, as special disabled veterans, and/or as veterans  of the Vietnam era.  Where special disabled veterans and/or individuals with  disabilities have been identified, the contractor should also be asked to  provide a description of any accommodations made.       (b)Mailing:  The letter confirming the onsite, signed by the AOD/FOD, should  be mailed to the contractor (by certified mail, return receipt requested)  sufficiently in advance of the onsite date to ensure that the letter arrives at  least 3 days before the EOS.  In addition, should the contractor encounter  unanticipated problems in obtaining the items requested, there should be  sufficient lead time to allow for the substitution of alternate materials, where  possible and appropriate.      Figure 2-1:    CHRONOLOGY LOG - CC-53    Figure 2-2:  SCHEDULING LETTER REQUESTING AAP AND SUPPORT DATA    CERTIFIED MAIL    RETURN RECEIPT REQUESTED    Dear (name of contractor official) :    Your establishment located at___________has been selected for a compliance  review under Executive Order 11246, as amended, Section 503 of the  Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, and the Vietnam Era Veterans'  Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974, as amended, (38 U.S.C. 4212), and their  implementing regulations.    The compliance review will be conducted as described in the regulations at  41 CFR Part 60-60 which outlines the three phases of the process.  These phases  normally include a desk audit, an onsite review, and where appropriate, offsite  analysis.    For desk audit purposes we are requesting a copy of your Affirmative Action  Programs (AAPs) and supporting documentation.  These should be prepared in  accordance with the requirements set forth in 41 CFR 60-1.40, 60-2.1 through  60-2.15, Part 60-741 and Part 60-250.  The AAPs' contents and supporting data  such as indicated in the enclosed itemized listing are to be submitted.    Our audit of the AAP and supporting documentation is designed to assist us  in preparing for the onsite review and to reduce the amount of time and level of  effort required by OFCCP and your representatives during this phase of the  compliance process.     You should note, however, that 41 CFR 60-2.2 authorizes the initiation of  enforcement procedures in circumstances where materials submitted for desk audit  do not represent a reasonable effort to meet the affirmative action program  requirements.      Please submit your AAPs and supporting documentation as soon as possible,  and in any case no later than 30 days from the date of receipt of this letter.      If you have any questions concerning OFCCP's compliance review, please feel  free to contact______________.    Sincerely,    AOD/FOD    Attached:  Itemized listing, 41 CFR Chapter 60    Figure 2-2a:  ITEMIZED LISTING    ITEMIZED LISTING    Required AAP contents, including supporting documentation such as those  indicated by check ( ) mark, are essential to conduct the desk audit phase of  the compliance review.      ____a.  Copies of your Employer Information Reports EEO-1 (Standard Form 100  Rev.) for the last three years (____, ____, and ____).  (See 41 CFR 60-1.7).      ____b.  Workforce Analysis (See 41 CFR 60-2.11(a)).    ____c.  Copies of progression line charts (See 41 CFR 60-2.12(m)).    ____d.  Job group and availability analysis (See 41 CFR 60-2.11(b)).      ____e.  Documentation that areas of underutilization have been identified  and goals and timetables have been established to correct any deficiencies,  together with a plan of action to achieve those goals and timetables.  (See 41  CFR 60-2.12(g), (h), and (i) and 41 CFR 60-2.13(d), (e), and (f)).    ____f.  Summary data and information which indicate the numerical and other  results of your affirmative action goals for each job group for the current goal  year and the preceding goal year.  For each goal not attained/being attained,  describe the good faith efforts which were/are being made to achieve them.  (See  41 CFR 60-1.40(c) and 41 CFR 60-2.12).    ____g.  An analysis of your selection process, including a determination of  whether it eliminates a significantly higher percentage of minorities or women  than nonminorities or men.  (See 41 CFR 60-1.40(b)(2), 60-2.23(b)(3), 60-2.25).   This analysis may consist of a summary of applicant and hire activity identified  by race and sex for each job group for (a) the present goal year and (b) the  previous goal year and include:  total applicants, total offers of employment,  total hires, total rejections.  However, if you do not have the data arranged in  that manner you may choose to submit them in the form in which they are  available.    Figure 2-2a:  ITEMIZED LISTING (continued)    ____h.  Analysis of your transfer and promotion practices to determine if  lateral and/or vertical movement of minority or female employees is occurring at  a lesser rate (compared to workforce mix) than nonminority or male employees.   (See 41 CFR 60-1.40(b)(3), 60-2.23(b)(2), 60-2.25).  The analysis may consist of  a summary of promotion and transfer activity during (a) the present goal year  and (b) the previous goal year, identified by race and sex, including the  department/job group/job title into which employees were promoted and each  department/job group/job title from which promoted.  However, if you have  performed the analysis under a different arrangement you may choose to submit it  in the manner in which it is available.    ____i.  Summary of monitoring reports which reflect the degree to which the  nondiscriminatory policy is carried out with respect to terminations of  employment.  (See 41 CFR 60-2.25).  This information may consist of a summary of  employee terminations with identification of race and sex and the departments  and job titles from which they were terminated.  However, if you have not  compiled the data in this form you may choose to submit them in the form in  which they are available.    Although it is not specified as one of the required contents of the AAP, it  would assist us in conducting the desk audit if you would also attach a copy of  your collective bargaining agreement, if any, or other available information  indicating your policies and procedures governing employee mobility (i.e.  promotions, transfers, etc.).    Figure 2-3:STANDARD INQUIRY LETTER FOR REQUESTING COMPLAINT DATA FROM EEOC  AND STATE AND LOCAL FEPS     Dear:    A compliance review of the following Federal contractor has been scheduled:      The review will audit this contractor's compliance with Executive Order  11246, as amended,  Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended,  the Vietnam Era Veterans Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974 (38 U.S.C. 4212),  and implementing regulations.  The Order and Acts prohibit employment   discrimination and require affirmative action to ensure equal employment  opportunity without regard to race, color, religion, national origin, sex,  disability or status as a special disabled or Vietnam era veteran.    Please forward any information you have concerning complaints filed against  this contractor and/or any other information you may have concerning its EEO  posture which you believe we should consider during the course of the review.

STANDARD COMPLIANCE REVIEW REPORT (SCRR) INSTRUCTIONS     OVERALL SCRR STRUCTURE     This SCRR is both a desk audit and onsite report.  It consists     of three parts: (a) Preparation, (b) Affirmative Action and     (c) Potential Discrimination.     Each part contains analytical sheets, followed by a narrative     summary of problems identified in major review areas.  For prob-    lems not resolved at the conclusion of desk audit, the summary sheets  provide for an investigative plan and a description of onsite  findings/conclusions.  These summary sheets are under-    lined in the following SCRR outline:     PART A:  PREPARATION     Page 1   CRIS, CC-100A     2   Introduction     3   Past Problems/Known Complaints     4   Initial Review of AAP and Support Data     5   Personnel Activity     6   EEO Trend Analysis Worksheet     7   EEO Trend Analysis Narrative     8   Organization of the Contractor's Workforce and Review               of  Support Data on Personnel Practices     PART B: AFFIRMATIVE ACTION     9   Problems with AAP and Support Data    10   Analysis of Affirmative Action Progress     11   Evaluation of Good Faith Effort    12   Implementation of Guidelines on Religion and National     Origin and Sex Discrimination     13   Implementation of Disabled/Veterans Affirmative     Action Requirements     PART C: POTENTIAL DISCRIMINATION     14   Results of Review of Workforce Analysis     15   Impact Ratio Analysis (IRA) Worksheet     16   Compensation/Other Analyses     17   Summary of Potential Discrimination Problems     For convenience when an onsite must be approved by a reviewing     official, an optional Desk Audit Summary is included as page 18.     Also included are the following optional SCRR forms:  for     university reviews, a substitute Personnel Activity and EEO     Trend Analysis worksheet with EEO-6 category headings; a     Technical Requirements worksheet covering all three OFCCP     programs; and a Job Area Acceptance Range (JAAR) worksheet.     How much of this SCRR can be done at desk audit will depend on     the quality of data submitted by the contractor.  It is more     important that all analyses are completed by review close out,     than when in the review process they are completed.     SCRR AS A NARRATIVE REPORT    As noted above, the SCRR is both a desk audit and onsite report.  No  separate onsite narrative is required.  What is required is a narrative  description of onsite findings and conclusions on each problem identified* in  the major review areas of AAP and Support Data, Evaluation of Good Faith Effort  and Potential Discrimina-    tion.  This narrative should be as long or short as the facts of the  situation warrant (and, regardless of length, must be backed up by case file  material).    For example, many problems in a written AAP (page 9) can be adequately  addressed in a sentence or two with a reference to corrected AAP pages.  Even  some potential discrimination problems (p. 17) can be briefly addressed--for  example, an Impact Ratio Analysis (IRA) adverse for female hires that when  refined onsite showed that the women applied after the last opening.  On the  other hand, findings on some problems will require substantially more  elaboration.  This will usually be the case for discrimina-    tion issues that are not resolved through such initial onsite data  refinement.    Where such a longer description of findings is appropriate, the EOS should  briefly summarize findings on the SCRR page (9, 11 or 17, as applicable)* and  attach the fuller narrative description--labeled with the item number to which  it pertains--to that page.**  Some examples of when this narrative is needed and  a description of its contents are given following the instructions for SCRR page  17.    ____________       whether identified at desk audit, but not resolved by the conclusion of  desk audit, or onsite.      *EOSs using word processing equipment, see alternative below.           FOR COMPUTER USERS    OFCCP has developed a computer program for IRAs (p. 15) and JAARs (SCRR  optional worksheet).  Once the EOS identifies the appro-    priate raw data and it is entered into the computer, the math- ematical  calculations called for by these SCRR pages are auto- matically made and a  print-out generated with column headings corresponding to these pages.*  Such  computer-generated pages may be substituted for these SCRR pages.  If you want  further infor-    mation on this program, contact your Regional representative to the OFCCP  Technical Support group or the NO Branch of Special Analysis.    Additionally, computer users may wish to use word processing for the rest of  the SCRR.  A distinct advantage of doing so is that once the form is in the  computer, the space allocated to any page/item is fully flexible--i.e. it can be  tailored to the particular review, thus avoiding the need for continuation  sheets.  For example, on the SCRR pages calling for onsite find-    ings/conclusions (see section above), rather than summarizing findings and  expanding on them in an attachment, simply convert the page to a vertical format  (addressing all headings for problem # 1, then all for problem #2, etc.) and use  whatever amount of space is needed for each problem.    RELATIONSHIP OF SCRR    TO POTENTIAL DISCRIMINATION WORKSHEETS     Sample worksheets and instructions for investigating potential   discrimination are given in Appendix 3A.  Key factors that must be addressed in  such an investigation are highlighted in those instructions.     ________    *For IRAs, in addition to the page 15 headings, this program calculates the  number of standard deviations.  This may be of some assistance in setting  investigative priorities.  However, the number of standard deviations must not  be used either to conclude discrimination has occurred or to conclude that  inves-    tigation is not warranted.  Statistical tests mean nothing apart from the  data to which they are applied, and it is entirely pre-    mature to base either such conclusion on unrefined desk audit data.  See IRA  instructions and ""Interpreting IRA Results"" in this Appendix and, in  Chapter 3, the discussion of refined IRAs and statistical tests for small  numbers.    COMMENTS APPLICABLE TO THE SCRR AS A WHOLE     Format/Administrative    oThose SCRR pages and worksheets that are ""fold-out"" have a  perforation in the middle which divides them into two stand-ard 8 1/2"" X 11""  sheets.  These sheets may be separated at the perforation for ease in copying.   In the copy, the two sides of a sheet (they are labeled ""a"" and ""b""--i.e.  11a, 11b, etc.) should be filed in sequence.     Because of their format, some of these sheets have ""Item #""  columns on both sides to permit cross-referencing in a copy.  The EOS assigns an  item number to each problem identified on the left side of the fold-out and uses  the same item number on the right side of the fold-out.     oSCRR pages which present a conclusion on problem areas have  a final column  labeled ""CLOSE OUT DOCUMENT"" which asks ""Include?"" and ""Para.  #.""  If you plan to address the prob-    lem in a close out document, check ""Include?,"" but leave the ""Para.  #"" column blank until the end of the review.     At the end of the review, examine all problems checked and base the type of  close-out document on the most serious problem.  For example, if there are three  deficiencies, two of which--standing alone--would require a Letter of  Commit-ment (LOC), but the remaining deficiency requires a Concil-  iation  Agreement (CA), use a CA to cover all three defi-    ciencies.  When the close-out document is drafted, go back and insert the  paragraph number in which each problem is addressed.     oEach Area and Field Office should maintain extra copies of those SCRR  analytical pages where additional copies may be needed in the average  review--primarily the Analysis of Affirmative Action Progress and IRA  Worksheets.     Other      oIn a preaward review, as at present, all SCRR analyses are normally  completed onsite.    oMinorities means men and women of those minority groups for whom EEO-1  reporting is required--i.e. Blacks, Hispanics, Asians/Pacific Islanders and  American Indians/Alaskan Natives.  It may mean those groups in the aggregate or  an individual group for whom a problem has been identified (see instructions for  SCRR page 7).  Women means both minority and nonminority women.     oWhen reference is made in the SCRR to a particular item included in an AAP,  the AAP page number(s) should be given.  However, please note that an AAP page  reference, standing alone, is not an adequate response to any question concern-      ing the contractor's implementation of an item (for example, see SCRR page  13 on Implementation of Disabled/Veterans' Affirmative Action Requirements).      PAGE INSTRUCTIONS     PART A:  PREPARATION     PAGE 1:  CRIS, CC-100A    See the Compliance Review Information System (CRIS) Manual for instructions  on completing this page.     PAGE 2:  INTRODUCTION    Item 1 - Establishment Name, Address and CRIS Control #:  Enter the name and  address of the establishment being reviewed.  Also enter the CRIS Control number  assigned to this review on page 1.     Item 2 - Parent Name and Address:  If the establishment being reviewed is  part of a larger firm, enter the name and address of the parent firm.     Item 3 - Labor Area:  Enter the name of the Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) in which the establishment is located or, if it is not in an MSA, enter the name of the county or other  appropriate labor area in which it is located.  Then enter the percent of the labor force within the named geographic area that is female and the percent that is minority (in the aggregate and by each minority group).    Item 4 - Complaints Investigated During Review:  Enter the complaint number  of each complaint you plan to investigate as  part of the compliance review.   This will permit a cross- reference to the Complaint Administration System (CAS)  and to the complaint investigation file.  At the end of the review, check    [  ] those complaints that have been resolved.       NOTE:  Further information on these complaints, and on any other open OFCCP  complaints, will be entered on SCRR page 3.    Item 5 - Contract Establishing OFCCP Jurisdiction:  Enter the indicated  information on the contract which establishes OFCCP jurisdiction.  If a  subcontract is used, under ""Agency"" enter the name of the awarding  agency, then check ""SUB TO"" and enter the name of the prime  contractor.     If you have information on several contracts or subcontracts,  use one in  which the work is performed at the establishment level and/or one with the  highest dollar amount or the most relevant time period.  Where more than one  contract is needed to establish and/or further support coverage, include  information on these contracts in item 8 below (Introductory Statement).     Item 6 - Company Contacts:  List the name, title and phone number of the  corporate and establishment Chief Executive Officer (CEO), and the corporate and  establishment contact persons for Equal Employment Opportunity and Affirmative  Action (EEO/AA) matters.       Item 7 - EEDS Contractor Selection Research Documentation Form:  Check here  to confirm that this Equal Employment Data System (EEDS) form--which indicates  why this contractor was selected for review--is included in the case file.    Item 8 - Introductory Statement:  To the degree known, this should include,  but need not be limited to:     oType of Business.  Describe the nature of the establish-    ment's business--for example, its type of industry, main product line, etc.   If it is part of a larger firm, indicate its relationship with its parent--i.e.  ""part of the Consumer Electronics Division of XYZ Company,"" ""a  subsidiary of ABC, Inc.,"" etc.     Also include any general information on the establishment,  such as its  total employment, whether its workforce is predominantly white-collar or  blue-collar, etc.     If the establishment's AAP covers more than one physical location (i.e.  outstationed sales offices, branch banks, etc.), generally describe those  locations and approximately how many people they employ.     oAdditional Coverage Information.  Include information on any contracts or  subcontracts (beyond that given in item 5 above) needed to establish or further  support OFCCP juris- diction.  If coverage is not based on the establishment's  Federal contracts, but on those of a related entity--such as a parent company, a  subsidiary, or another subsidiary of the parent--identify the entity holding the  Federal contracts and the establishment's relationship to it.     To the degree known, also indicate the main product(s) or service(s)  provided under Federal contracts and the approximate volume of such contracts as  a percentage of the contractor's business.     oLabor Area Characteristics.  Describe any relevant informa-    tion on the labor area in which the Contractor is located.     For example:  minority and/or particular minority group distribution within  that geographic area (i.e.  ""The  largest Hispanic community in the MSA is  in Hillsdale, two miles from the plant."" etc.); availability of public/  private transportation; relevant community resource file information,  including the results of any general contacts with community organizations, etc.      Item 9 - Signature Blocks.  Upon completion of the review, the EOS signs and  dates the report in the space provided.  Upon approval of the report, the Module  Chief and appropriate official (ARA or AOD) sign and date it.     PAGE 3:  PAST PROBLEMS/KNOWN COMPLAINTS    Part I:  PAST PROBLEMS.  Review available Area Office files on any past  OFCCP compliance reviews or complaint investigations of this establishment.  If  there have been no prior reviews or complaints, so state, and no further entries  are needed under this part.  If there have been, complete this Part as follows:      oItem a - Past Problems - Give the date of any past compliance review or complaint investigation and list any major problems identified. If there is a current Conciliation Agreement (CA) or Letter of Commitment  (LOC), include a copy of the CA/LOC monitoring record in this case file and list  here any items that may need further investigation.     oItem b - Recurrence?  Do not complete this item now, but in conducting the  rest of the review, be alert for any indications that a past problem has or has not recurred.  At whatever point in the review you have evidence one way or the other, return to this page and enter  your finding.  If you conclude that a problem has, in fact, recurred, also reference the SCRR page number where your findings are presented in more detail.    EXAMPLE:  A past review resulted in a CA because (1) the  contractor's  workforce analysis was by EEO category rather than  by organizational unit, and  (2) the contractor failed to make a good faith effort to recruit minorities for  professional positions.     If, in reviewing the current AAP (SCRR page 4), you find that the current  workforce analysis is properly by organizational unit, return to this page and  so state in item ""b.""  If contractor records and contacts with  recruitment sources show that the contractor did not list professional jobs, so  state in item ""b"" and refer to the SCRR page where your findings are  discussed (for this problem, normally SCRR page 11 on Evaluation of Good Faith  Effort).     Part II:  KNOWN COMPLAINTS.  Review responses received (to Manual Figure  2-3) from other agencies on any complaints filed against this establishment  since the last OFCCP compliance review.  Also review available Area Office  records of any open OFCCP complaints against this establishment.  If there are  no such complaints, so state, and no further entries are needed in this part.   If there are, complete this Part as follows:     oItem a - For each complaint, indicate with what agency it was filed, its  basis, issue, current status and the area of the contractor's workforce it  appears to concern (i.e. clerical, professional, entry-level blue collar, etc.).      oItem b - Potential Systemic?  Do not complete this item now, but in  conducting the rest of the review, be alert for any indications of a potential  systemic discrimination problem in complaint areas.  At whatever point in the  review you have evidence that there is or is not a potential systemic problem,  return to this page and so state.  If you conclude that there is a potential  systemic problem, refer to the SCRR page where your findings are presented in  more detail.     EXAMPLE:  There is (1) an open EEOC complaint alleging discrim-    ination against women in terminations from Operative jobs, and (2) a State  human rights commission individual complaint alleging failure to hire because of  diabetes.     In the first case, if your Impact Ratio Analysis (IRA) did not show an  adverse IRA for women in Operative terminations, return to this page and so  state in ""b.""  In the second case, if examination of the contractor's  policies concerning diabetes and/or applications of diabetics rejected showed a  systemic problem, return to this page, so state in ""b"" and refer to  the SCRR page where your findings are discussed (for this problem, normally page  13, Part II).     The intent here is not to investigate any complaint filed with other  agencies (or any open OFCCP complaint other than those assigned for  investigation during this review--i.e. those listed in SCRR Introduction, item  4), but rather to be alert for potential systemic problems in complaint areas.      PAGE 4:  INITIAL REVIEW OF AAP AND SUPPORT DATA     Immediately upon receipt of the contractor's initial AAP and support data  submission, review it to ensure there is sufficient information to conduct  subsequent basic analyses of both affirmative action and potential  discrimination issues.     In conducting this initial review, be attentive to any information on the contractor's workforce structure and personnel practices that will be discussed on SCRR page 8.  Such information may be included in the AAP narrative, or may be reflected in the workforce analysis or support data on personnel activity.     Complete this page as follows:     oTimely Receipt:  Indicate whether the Executive Order AAP was received on  time by checking ""YES"" or ""NO.""  If the AAP was received on  time, complete the steps below.  For the Disabled/Veterans' (D/V) AAP, indicate  whether it was received.     If the Executive Order AAP was not received on time, on page 9 (Problems  with AAP and Support Data), indicate the date a Show Cause Notice was issued or,  if not issued, the reason.  If the D/V AAP was not received, on page 9 indicate  the date a 30-day Notice was issued or, if not issued, the reason.  When the  contractor does first submit its AAP(s), complete the steps below.     oIncluded?:  Review the Executive Order AAP and support data and the D/V AAP  to ensure that all listed elements are present.  Beside each item, enter a ""Y""  for yes if it is included, or a ""N"" for no if it is missing.     If an element is missing, no further entries are needed concerning it on  this page since it will automatically be neither ""reasonable"" (if a  central element) nor ""acceptable.""  Note any such missing elements on page 9.     oReasonable?:  Beside each central element of the Executive Order  AAP--Workforce Analysis, Utilization Analysis (and its components) and Current  Goals--enter a ""Y"" or ""N"" to indicate whether the element is reasonable (see OFCCP Federal Contract Compliance Manual--hereafter Manual--Section 2F).      If one or more of these central elements is not reasonable, on page 9  describe the specific problem and give the date a show cause notice was issued  or, if no Show Cause was issued, the reason.  If all central elements were  reason-    able, audit the submission for acceptability.     oAcceptable?:  Beside each listed element, enter a ""Y"" or ""N""  to indicate whether it is acceptable (see Manual, Sections 2G, 2H, and 2I).       If any element is not acceptable, list it on page 9 and describe the  specific problem.     If N, p. 9 Item #:  Beside each listed element with an ""N"" under ""Included,""  ""Reasonable,"" or ""Acceptable,"" give the SCRR page 9 item  number where the specific problem is discussed.     Later contractor corrections to an initial submission need not be recorded  here, but will be recorded on page 9 beside the particu-lar problem.     PAGE 5:  PERSONNEL ACTIVITY TABLE    This worksheet provides an EEO-1 category overview of the con-    tractor's major personnel activity over the last AAP year.  If you are doing  a university review, use the EEO-6 Personnel Activ-ity Table (supplied with this  package), which is the same form, but with EEO-6 category headings.     At the top of the page, enter the dates covered by the personnel activity  data to be recorded below.  The data will normally cover the last full AAP year,  but where data for that period are not available, enter the dates covered by  whatever data are avail-    able.     Enter the number of hires, promotions and terminations by minor-    ity group and sex in each EEO category.  If the category is not in use in  the contractor's workforce, enter N/A; if it is in use but had no activity,  enter ""no activity;"" if the contractor did not maintain data for the  category, enter ""no data.""     This information, together with the historical workforce data in the EEO  Trend Analysis (below), provides a framework for later review of affirmative  action progress and employment activity by job group.  Also, since both these  data and EEO trend data are by particular minority group, they can help identify  any potential problems for a particular minority group.    PAGE 6:  EEO TREND ANALYSIS WORKSHEET     This worksheet permits an assessment of net change in minority and female  representation over both the long-term (comparing the earliest EEDS EEO category  data with current data) and the short-term (comparing data for the beginning of  the last full AAP year with current data).     The appropriate EEDS report for EEO-1 data is EEO20; for EEO-6  data, EEO69.   EEO-1 categories are indicated beside the data entry space.  If you are doing a  university review, use the EEO-6 Trend Analysis Worksheet (included with this  package), which is the same form but with EEO-6 category headings.     At the top of the page beside A, enter the date of the earliest data on the  current EEDS report; beside B, the date of the beginning of the last full AAP  year; and beside C, the date of the end of the last full AAP year.     NOTE:  If the contractor has not previously been required to maintain an  AAP, for B use the date of its latest EEO-1 or EEO-6 submission shown on the  current EEDS report; and for C, the date of its most recent EEO-1 or EEO-6  submission not yet shown on EEDS.     To complete this page, for each EEO category and for the total workforce,  make the following entries:     oLine A - Enter the earliest data shown in the current EEDS report, then  calculate and enter the percentage of women and of minorities.     oLine B -  Enter data for the beginning of the last full AAP year, then  calculate and enter the percentage of women and of minorities.     oLine C - Enter data for the end of the last full AAP year, then calculate  and enter the percentage of women and of minorities.     The EOS may wish to make notes on net change and/or white collar and blue  collar subtotals, etc. preparatory to completing the     EEO Trend Analysis Narrative below.    PAGE 7:  EEO TREND ANALYSIS NARRATIVE    At the top of the page, check whether the data are from EEO-1 or EEO-6  information.  Then complete the narrative as follows:     Item 1 - EEO Trends     (a)Total Workforce:  Over the long-term (line A vs. line C on the preceding  worksheet), has the contractor's overall work-force been relatively stable or  has it been expanding or contracting?  If one of the latter, how substantial has  the change been?  Has it been due to marked expansion or con-    traction in particular categories?  What has the change been in the  representation of minorities and women in the over-    all workforce?  As a percent of total?  Numerically?     Address the same questions as above concerning short-term total workforce  trends (Line B vs. Line C on the preceding worksheet).     (b)White Collar:  Over the long and short-term, what has the change been for  minorities in the white collar workforce?  What has the change been for women in  nontraditional white collar categories (normally white collar exclusive of  Office and Clerical and retail Sales)?  Have there been notable minority/female  gains or losses in particular categories?  Give particular attention to  Officials and Managers and Professionals (and any other categories normally  considered favorable in the industry involved).     (c)Blue Collar:  Over the long and short-term, what have the changes been  for minorities and women in the blue collar workforce?  Have there been notable  minority/female gains or losses in particular categories?  Give particular  attention to Crafts.     NOTE:  In discussing short-term trends above, also consider the level and  type of personnel activity shown on page 5.  Lack of short-term progress may be  tied to few hiring/promotion oppor-    tunities in a category over the last AAP year; or to termina-    tions cancelling out hiring gains.  Such observations can help provide a  framework for later analyses by job group of goals (SCRR page 10) and employment  activity (IRAs, SCRR page 15).     Also, in considering page 5, note any obvious major discrepancies that may  need clarification.  For example, if a category shows a short-term gain of 50  persons, but page 5 shows little or no hiring in the category during the AAP  year, you may wish to ask the contractor the source of the growth.     Item 2 - EEO Category Patterns:  Are there any EEO categories in which  minorities or women have been persistently concentrated?  Are there other  categories in which minorities or women appear to be substantially  underrepresented?  In making these assessments, rely upon your general knowledge  of the contractor's labor area, type of business/skill needs, and the  representation of minor-    ities and women in possible feeder categories.     The intent here is not to make comparisons with some hypothetical ""category""  availability (which is inappropriate), but again, to establish a broad framework  for later examination of job groups within those categories, workforce patterns  and IRAs.     For example, if there are very few women in Crafts but many in Operatives,  the EOS is forewarned to look at the types of jobs    in Crafts; the distribution of women vs. men in Operative job     groups/departments/lines of progression; and the volume and type of promotions  from Operatives to Crafts.     Item 3 - Particular Minority Groups:  Identify any substantial disparity in  the representation of a particular minority group or men or women of a  particular minority group.  Is any such dispar-ity present in the workforce as a  whole or only in certain EEO categories?  In making this assessment, as above,  consider the representation of particular minority groups in the contractor's  labor area and in possible internal feeder categories.  Where you observe such a  disparity, plan to conduct standard desk audit discrimination analyses by the  particular minority group (rather than by minorities in the aggregate), at least  in those work-    force areas where the disparity exists and for the type of activ-ity most  likely to have created the disparity.  For example:    -  The contractor is located in a labor area that is 20% minority, composed  of 9% Blacks, 9% Hispanics and 2%     others.  Although the contractor has a large number of jobs probably filled  locally, it historically has employed less than 1% Hispanics.  Under these  circumstances, the EOS should plan to conduct all hiring IRAs specifically for  Hispanics.    -  The contractor has a predominantly blue collar workforce with good  overall minority representation.  However, Blacks are concentrated in Laborers,  poorly represented in Opera-    tives and absent in Crafts.  Under these circumstances, the EOS should:  (1)  in reviewing the workforce analysis, plan to identify blue collar jobs held by  Blacks and whether there is any structural/potential placement problem impeding  their upward mobility, and (2) plan to conduct blue collar IRAs (particularly  for hiring and promotion into Operatives and Craft job groups) separately for  Blacks.    Further discussion of separate minority group analyses is given in the  instructions for SCRR page 14 (Review of Workforce Analy-    sis) and SCRR page 15 (IRAs).  Please also note that if onsite investigation  of such a disparity does not indicate potential discrimination, the EOS should  then consider whether the imbal-    ance warrants separate affirmative action steps--whether goals and/or  specific action programs--for the group (see 41 CFR    60-2.12(l)).    PAGE 8:  ORGANIZATION OF CONTRACTOR'S WORKFORCE AND    REVIEW OF SUPPORT DATA ON PERSONNEL PRACTICES      The intent of this page is to describe those aspects of the par-    ticular contractor's structure and practices which will influence the  interpretation of both affirmative action and potential dis-    crimination issues.  DO NOT ADDRESS RACIAL OR SEX DISTRIBUTION ON THIS PAGE.      oItem 1:  Organization of Contractor's Workforce - Describe how the  contractor's workforce is organized using whatever information is available in  the contractor's AAP and support data (if there is an organization chart,  indicate where it is located in the AAP or case file).     If the contractor's AAP narrative is not helpful, scan the workforce  analysis to identify (a) major organizational units--i.e. those containing the  largest number of employ-    ees, and (b) the type of work that appears to be performed in these major  units.     Also identify any possible formal/informal lines of pro-    gression (LOPs).  If the contractor has not included pro-    gression line charts in its AAP, a union contract(s) may include information  on LOPs.  If neither source is helpful, does the workforce analysis show any  indicators of possible LOPs (for example, sequenced job titles--Assembler A, B,  C; Assistant Teller, Teller, Senior Teller; Scientist I, II, III, etc.)?     oItem 2:  Internal Mobility - Review the contractor's AAP and support data  on personnel practices for any information on how personnel processes work at  the establishment, with particular attention to internal mobility:     (a)Does the contractor indicate that it posts or otherwise makes job  openings known?  How?  At what levels?  Who is eligible to bid/apply?  What  factors are considered in choosing among internal candidates?     (b)Specifically address whether the contractor has one or more collective  bargaining agreements.  If it does, with what union(s)?  Covering what areas of  the work-    force?  Involving what provisions for promotion/transfer, layoff/recall, etc.?     (c)Also, review the contractor's hiring and promotion activity to identify:          Which job groups/areas have had the largest number of hires during the  past year?  Are there job groups  which have been filled only or almost  exclusively by hire?        Which job groups/areas have had the largest number of promotions during  the past year? Are there job groups which have been filled only or almost  exclusively by promotion?          oItem 3:  Pay Structure  - How is the contractor's pay system structured in  major portions of the workforce?  For example, are blue collar jobs paid by  grade level?  If so, what is the lowest and highest grade?  Are salaried jobs  organized into rate ranges identified by letter code?  If so, what is the lowest  and highest letter code?     PART B:  AFFIRMATIVE ACTION    PAGE 9:  PROBLEMS WITH AAP AND SUPPORT DATA     At the top of the page, check whether the page concerns the Executive Order  AAP and support data, the D/V AAP or both, then complete the columns as follows:      o# (a):  Assign a number to each problem identified as a  result of your  initial review of the contractor's AAP and support data submission (SCRR page  4).     oAAP AND SUPPORT DATA PROBLEMS (b):  Briefly describe each problem, and  indicate  whether it is that the AAP or support data item was not  included, was  not reasonable or was not acceptable.  This description should be specific  enough for a reader to clearly understand the issue involved--i.e. ""Current  goals are lower than the contractor's availability estimates in four  Professional job groups,"" NOT ""Goals are unacceptable.""     oACTION TAKEN and/or PLAN TO RESOLVE (c):  Describe the action(s) you have  taken or plan to take to resolve the problem.  For example, if the contractor  failed to submit     an Executive Order AAP, the normal entry would be ""Show Cause issued  (date),"" followed by ""AAP submitted (date).""  For an unacceptable  AAP or support data ingredient, the entry may be ""Called M. Jones to  request (appropriate revision) be made and ready onsite.""     Leave enough room between entries in this column to allow  for a description  of any probable subsequent desk audit developments.  For example, if the problem  is ""No informa-    tion on what job titles fall in what job groups,""  and the action is ""Called  S. Smith 9/5 to obtain listing of titles within group,"" a subsequent desk  audit development may be ""Received listing 9/10.""     oOnsite? (d):  Check those items that will require onsite follow-up.  These  checked items will be your onsite plan  for resolution of AAP and support data  problems.    NOTE:  Your onsite review must include confirmation of the contractor's  implementation of its AAP commitments (see Manual Section 3G01).  If onsite you  identify a problem with AAP implementation that is not covered elsewhere in the  SCRR,* add it to this page.  Enter ""ONS"" for onsite in column ""b""  and complete the other columns as indicated.    ONSITE    o# (e):  Enter the same item number assigned to this problem in column (a).      oFindings/Conclusions (f):  For each AAP and support data  problem for which  you checked onsite, enter your onsite  findings and conclusions.  For example,  if the problem were that the contractor's availability analysis appeared to   give insufficient weight to internal availability, you may note that an onsite  sample of records showed that the  majority of incumbents in the job group had  entered via promotion rather than new hire.    Where a fuller narrative description of findings (and/or resolution, column  (h) below) is needed, attach it to this page (labeled with the item number to  which it pertains).     oResolved? (g):  Enter ""Y"" for yes or ""N"" for no to  indicate whether the problem with the AAP or support data has been resolved.      ________    *AAP implementation issues covered elsewhere are those pertaining to:  (1)  good faith efforts on goals (SCRR p. 11); (2) the Sex Discrimination Guidelines  (SCRR p. 12); (3) Disabled/Veterans requirements (SCRR p. 13); and technical  requirements (if you use the SCRR optional worksheet on Technical Requirements).      oResolution (h):  If the problem has been resolved, describe the resolution.   For example, ""Contractor increased the weight of internal availability in  XYZ job group from 2% to 60% resulting in the following corrected final  availability figures:  Minorities - originally 10%, corrected to 20%; Women -  originally 5%, corrected to 30%.""  If the problem has not been resolved,  discuss the contractor's position on the matter and the actions you are  recommending.    oAAP or Other Reference Pages (i):  When a resolution has been reached,  indicate here the pages of the AAP, support data or other document in which the  resolution is incorporated.     oClose-Out Document (j-k):  If you plan to include the problem in a  close-out document, check ""Include?.""  Leave the ""Para. #""  column blank until the end of the review.     PAGE 10:  ANALYSIS OF AFFIRMATIVE ACTION PROGRESS    Prior Year AAP/Current Year AAP    This page is divided horizontally into two parts:  (I) Goals,    and (II) Workforce Change.  Part I is mandatory; Part II is optional.  Enter  data on job groups for which goals were established.     Prior year goals must always be addressed (unless the contractor was not  previously covered by 41 CFR Part 60-2).  Both prior and current year must be  addressed if the contractor was six months or more into its current AAP year at  the time it received the Scheduling Letter.     At the top of the page, check the appropriate box to indicate whether the  data are for the prior year or the current year. Enter the starting and ending  dates of the period involved and then complete this page as follows:     Part I - Goals:     oEEO Category (a):  Enter the initials or number of the EEO-1 or EEO-6  category in which the job group falls.  Goals should normally be analyzed by job  group within EEO category order, i.e. job groups within Officials and Managers first, then job  groups within Professionals, etc.     oJob Group (b):  Enter the name of the job group being analyzed.     oGoal (c):  Enter the minority/female percentage placement goal.*    oTotal Placements (d):  Enter the total number of placements into the job  group during the AAP year.     oExpected (Placements) (e):  Enter the number of minorities or women who  would have been placed under the percentage placement goal.  To find this  expected number of placements,    multiply the total placements (d) by the goal (c).  Round down to the  nearest whole number (i.e. 0.1 = 0, 11.7 = 11, 0.4 = 0, etc.).     EXAMPLE:  For the Crafts I job group, ABC Company set a goal of 10% for  minorities and 5% for women.  During the AAP year, there were 50 placements into  the job group.  For minorities, you would have expected 5 place-    ments (.10 X 50); for women you would have    expected 2 (.05 X 50 = 2.5 = 2).     oActual (Placements) (f):  Enter the actual number of placements into the job group during the AAP year who were minor-ity/female.     oDifference (g):  Subtract the actual number of placements of  minorities/women (f) from the expected number of placements (e) to find the  difference--preceded by a plus (+) or minus (-) sign.

It  can be useful in focusing attention on job groups where, although there has been  progress in placements, there has been little or no improvement in minority or  female representa-    tion.  This normally is caused by disproportionate minority or    _________    *If the AAP specifies a goal for a particular minority group or for men or  women of a particular minority group, either change the line heading here from ""Min.""  to an abbreviation for the identified group or use another copy of this page to  evaluate goals progress for the identified group.    female movement out of the job group, whether for positive (pro-motions out)  or negative (terminations) reasons, and alerts the EOS to look at Impact Ratio  Analysis (IRA) results for the job group.     Complete this portion of the page as follows:     oBeginning Workforce (h-i):  In column (h) enter the total number of  employees and in column (i), the total number of minorities and the total number  of women in each job group at the beginning of the AAP year.     oEnding Workforce (j-k):  In column (j) enter the total number of employees  and in column (k), the total number of minorities and the total number of women  in each job group at the end of the AAP year.     oNet Change (l-m):  In column (l) enter the difference be-    tween the beginning and ending total workforce in the job group.  ln column  (m), enter the difference between the minority and female beginning and ending  workforce in the job group, preceded by a plus (+) or minus (-) sign.     PAGE 11:  EVALUATION OF GOOD FAITH EFFORT     Evaluate the contractor's overall affirmative action performance.  Was there  progress in most areas where goals were established?  for minorities?  for  women?  for both?  In areas with little progress, are there any balancing  factors such as strong perform-ance in similar or higher level jobs within the  category or generally?  Do performance problems fall in categories with poor  long-term trends (compare SCRR p. 6)?     In evaluating fulfillment of AAP commitments, consider the  quality of those  commitments in terms of their probable long-    range as well as short-range contribution to improving the contractor's  affirmative action posture.  Also consider whether the contractor has used  positive problem solving to help remove any impediments to minority/female  utilization, vs. continued adherence to strategies that are not working.     As a result of this evaluation, identify any goal areas needing further  evaluation for good faith effort.  Complete the remainder of this page as  follows:     o# (a):  Assign an item number to the goal area which needs further  evaluation for good faith effort.     oGOAL AREA (b):  Enter the name of the goal area.  A goal area may be a job  group or a cluster of job groups with similar AAP commitments to be evaluated  for good faith effort.  For example, if the contractor committed to recruit  minority technicians from XYZ organization, and showed little progress in  several technician jobs groups, the goal area may be ""Technician (Elec.,  Mech., Test).""     oMIN./FEM. (c):  Indicate whether the goal(s) involved was for minorities,  for women or for both.  If it was for members of a particular minority group,  enter an abbrevia-    tion for the group.    oPR/CURR YR (d):  Indicate whether the goal(s) needing further evaluation  for good faith effort was for the prior year, the current year or both.     oPOSSIBLE CAUSES/PERTINENT AAP COMMITMENTS (e):  Review any contractor  description of good faith effort pertinent to the goal area.  Also review data  on employment activity in the area, and any relevant AAP information on  personnel prac-    tices/workforce structure.     What appear to be the reasons for the lack of progress?  What AAP  commitments would have helped?  For example:     -If jobs in the area were filled predominantly by hire,  does it appear that  insufficient applicant flow was the problem?  If so, does the contractor's  explanation ad-    dress recruitment efforts?  Were any commitments made in the prior AAP  concerning recruitment?  Were they  fulfilled?     -If most openings were via promotion, was there an adequate supply of  minorities/women in feeder jobs?  If so, did the contractor make any AAP  commitments con-    cerning the promotion process relevant to the area,  such as a commitment  to:  identify promotable minor-    ities/women (skills inventory); increase promotability (training, job  rotation); encourage upward mobility (counseling, encouraging bidding), etc.?   Were any such commitments fulfilled?     NOTE:  Where the problem is the candidate pool (low appli- cant flow, few  minorities/women in feeder jobs), the issue is normally affirmative action  (recruitment, goals at the feeder group level).     However, where the candidate pool is adequate, either affirmative action or  discrimination may be the issue, so pay close attention to the area involved  when conducting IRA analyses.  If you find an adverse IRA in the goal area    involved, pursue the matter first as a potential discrimin-ation issue, and  note that you are doing so here.  Only if you do not find discrimination, return  to complete this evaluation of good faith effort for the goal area.     oADDITIONAL INFORMATION NEEDED (f):  Describe the additional information you  will need to evaluate the contractor's good faith effort.  For example, records  of recruitment efforts, contact with community organizations to confirm  appropriate job listings, etc.  If you have obtained sufficient addi-    tional information at desk audit to conclude there was good faith effort, so  indicate here.     oONS (g):  Check here those items that will require onsite follow-up.  These  checked items will be your onsite plan for evaluation of good faith effort.       ONSITE    o# (h):  Enter the same number assigned to this item in column (a).     oFINDINGS (i):  Discuss your onsite findings on whether the contractor made  a good faith effort in the goal area.  For example, ""Contractor placed  timely and accurate job listings with the major community organizations  specified in its AAP, but received no referrals for this job group.  This was  con-firmed by contact with XYZ referral sources who cited a scarcity of  candidates with the skill specialty involved.""     Where a fuller description of findings (and/or the discus-    sion in column (k) below) is needed, attach it to this page (labeled with  the item number to which it pertains).    oGFE? (Good Faith Effort) (j):  Indicate by entering ""Y"" for yes  or ""N"" for no whether you conclude the contractor made a good faith  effort in this goal area.  If you conclude the contractor made a good faith  effort, no further entries are needed on this sheet, unless you have reached an  agreement with the contractor to take supplementary actions to help improve the  chances of progress during the next AAP year (if so, describe in the next  column).     oIF NO, SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION, CONTRACTOR POSITION, EVALUATION (k):  If  you conclude the contractor did not make a good faith effort, supply any  background information that may provide perspective on the lack of good faith  effort.     For example, ""This job group is seriously underutilized for minorities  (10% incumbency, 20% availability), and has been for at least the last three  years.  The contractor had adequate openings to make progress, but has  consistently failed to take steps to increase minority applicant flow for the  jobs involved, etc.""     Also discuss and evaluate the contractor's position on the matter.     oClose-Out Document (l-m):  If you plan to include the problem in a close  out document, check ""Include?.""  Leave the ""Para. #"" column  blank until the end of the review.    PAGE 12:  IMPLEMENTATION OF GUIDELINES ON RELIGION    AND NATIONAL ORIGIN AND SEX DISCRIMINATION     Verify the contractor's implementation of the Guidelines on Religion and  National Origin and the Sex Discrimination Guide-    lines.  In both cases it is only necessary here to address those policies  and practices that are not covered elsewhere in your evaluation of the  contractor's compliance with the Executive Order--for example, maternity leave  policy, leave for religious purposes, etc.  Since the contractor is not required  to address 41 CFR Part 60-50 in its AAP, and may or may not include a copy of  leave policies, evaluation of these items and their implemen-    tation is normally done onsite.    If, while verifying this implementation, you identify a potential  discrimination issue, check [  ] ""Pot. Disc."" and include the problem  on page 17, ""Summary of Potential Discrimination Problems.""     PAGE 13:  IMPLEMENTATION OF DISABLED/VETERANS    AFFIRMATIVE ACTION REQUIREMENTS      Determine if the contractor has fully implemented its obligations under the  individuals with disabilities and veterans programs.     Part I:     oDescribe Contractor Actions/How Verified:  For each listed  regulatory  item, indicate the actions the contractor has taken, and briefly state how you  made your determination.      For example, in item 4 concerning the Mandatory Job Listing requirement  under the veterans' program, a verification may    be:  ""9/7/88 conversation with J. Smith, Vets. Rep. at the Odgen County  State Employment Service office, confirms contractor's listing of suitable jobs.""      If you determine that the contractor has not taken adequate action, briefly  describe the problem and, if resolved, its resolution.     oProblem?  (D/V):  Enter an ""D"" for disabled, a ""V"" for  veterans, or ""D/V"" for both, to identify the program under which the  contractor has not taken adequate action on the item.     oResolved?:  Enter ""Y"" for yes or ""N"" for no to indicate  whether the problem has been resolved.     oClose-Out Document:  If you intend to include this item in  a close-out  document, check ""Include?.""  Leave the ""Para. #"" column  blank until the end of the review.       Part II:      The purpose of this part is to identify any contractor personnel  practices  or job requirements which may be screening out quali-    fied individuals with disabilities or special disabled veterans, including  those who could have performed the jobs involved given reasonable accommodation.      1.Determine if the contractor has any blanket medical stand-    ards, or medical standards applicable to particular jobs.     Such standards may be incorporated in a policy manual, a manual for medical  personnel or in position descriptions/    qualification standards.  They also may be identifiable through rejections  of persons with certain medical condi-    tions based on responses to application form medical ques-    tions and/or on results of physical examinations.     If you identify a medical standard, indicate the job(s) to which it applies,  and ask the contractor for the results of its review determining that the  standard is job related, consistent with business necessity and with the safe  per- formance of the job.     Evaluate the contractor's response.  If it does not adequately demonstrate  that the standard is job related, consistent with business necessity and with  the safe  performance of the job, include the matter on page 17, ""Summary  of Potential Discrimination Problems.""     Make sure the case file includes any available information relevant to  supporting your conclusions--such as any position description for the jobs  involved, notes on your worksite observations, copies of any physical tests used  and their instructions, etc.--along with standard information on discriminatee  qualifications.     Appendix A to Chapter 6 provides some guidance on the types of information  to obtain about the job and about rejectees who have disabilities or are special  disabled veterans.  Additional guidance will be issued in the future on  assessing job relatedness, business necessity and safety claims as they relate  to the Section 503/4212 programs.    2.In the course of your review above, also identify any qualified  individuals with disabilities or special disabled veterans who could have  performed the job(s) involved given reasonable accommodation to their  disability.  If you identify such persons, include the matter on page 17, ""Summary  of Potential Discrimination Problems.""     Appendix A to Chapter 6 also provides guidance on the types of information  to obtain in evaluating whether the con-    tractor has provided reasonable accommodation, and further guidance will be  issued in this area in the future.    This page, particularly Part II, is normally completed onsite.    PART C:  POTENTIAL DISCRIMINATION    PAGE 14:  RESULTS OF REVIEW OF WORKFORCE ANALYSIS     Review the contractor's workforce analysis to identify patterns of minority  and female employment.  Identify and discuss poten-    tial problem areas where minorities/women are underrepresented or  concentrated.     To focus this review, use the results of your earlier SCRR ana-    lyses such as:     1.EEO Trend Analysis Narrative (SCRR page 7).    (a)  Category Patterns.  Pay particular attention to areas with persistent  representation of minorities or women substantially above or below probable  availability.  Using an earlier example with many women in Operatives but few in  Crafts, what types of jobs are in Crafts?  At the Operative level, are men and  women in different types of jobs (which may have different progression  opportunities--see 2 below)?     (b)  Particular Minority Groups.  Pay specific attention to the distribution  of a particular minority group in areas where you identified a substantial  disparity in the repre-    sentation of that group.  Using an earlier example with Blacks concentrated  in Laborers, poorly represented in Operatives, and absent in Crafts,  specifically identify the blue collar jobs held by Blacks and look for any  structural (see 2 below)/potential placement problems that may be inhibiting  upward mobility.    Even when such disparities are not observed in the initial category screen,  if the labor area has a high representa-    tion of more than one minority group and/or the general employment patterns  in the industry involved have differed among minority groups, in reviewing the  workforce analysis the EOS should be alert for any indications of potential  problems in the distribution of a particular minority group.      2.Organization of the Contractor's Workforce and Review of Support Data on  Personnel Practices (SCRR page 8).  Focus on minority group and female  employment patterns in those work-force areas relevant for this particular  contractor.  Among the possibilities are:  departments/units; possible lines of  progression (LOP's); grade or salary levels; supervisory positions vs. those  supervised; etc.  For example:     (a)If the contractor has possible LOPs, are minorities and women fairly  evenly distributed among LOPs or are they concentrated in ones that offer less  favorable pay or  progression?  If there is no problem in distribution among  LOPs, are minorities/women within LOPs fairly  evenly distributed or are they  clustered toward the bottom?     (b)If departments or units are relevant in determining eligibility for  promotion (or other employment acti-    vity), how are minorities/women distributed among those departments or  units?  Where department/unit seniority is used for promotion, layoff or other  purposes, how are minorities/women distributed among the departments or units?      Please note that even where plant seniority is used for promotion, if it is  exercised first within the depart-    ment where the opening occurs it can limit access to more favorable  departments (since, in practice, all but entry-level and/or undesirable jobs may  be filled with-in the department).     (c)If the contractor announces job openings up to a certain salary level, is  there any marked drop in minority or female representation above that level?      The type of questions to ask and patterns to look for will be different in  each compliance review (as will the quality of desk  audit data) depending on  the organization and practices of the  particular contractor.  The important  thing is to focus on the factors pertinent to that contractor.     DISCUSSION OF RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN     REVIEW OF WORKFORCE ANALYSIS AND IRAS     The workforce analysis essentially reflects employment activity  over an  extended period of time, while IRAs reflect that activity during the most recent  period.  Therefore, pay particular atten-    tion to IRAs in those areas where review of the workforce analy-    sis showed marked underrepresentation or concentration of minor-    ities or women.     For example, in a seriously underrepresented job area, an adverse hiring  and/or promotion IRA suggests that any problem may be  longstanding and, if  discrimination is found, there are likely to be victims within the normal  liability period (with or without a showing of continuing violation).     Or, in a concentrated job area, an adverse promotion IRA may reflect  differing opportunities for minorities or women to move up and out of the area.   This may suggest a structural problem--    i.e. a present policy or practice inhibiting movement--that may constitute  discrimination as well as a continuing violation.    In any event, be aware of possible connections between what you observe in  the workforce analysis and the results of the IRA analysis below.    PAGE 15:  IMPACT RATIO ANALYSIS (IRA) WORKSHEET     GENERAL COMMENTS     The Impact Ratio Analysis (IRA) is a comparison of the selection rates of  different groups from an identified candidate pool.  If  the selection rate for  one group is less than 80% of that for another, the IRA is adverse.     The following mathematical procedure is used to calculate an     IRA:       Find the selection rate for minorities/women by dividing their number of  selectees by their number in the candidate pool.       Find the selection rate for others by dividing their number of selectees by  their number in the candidate pool.       Compare the selection rate for minorities/women to the rate for others.  As  a matter of administrative discre-tion in compliance reviews, OFCCP will focus  on situa-         tions in which the selection rate for minorities or women is less favorable  than the rate for others.*  For positive actions such as hires and promotions,  this will be where the minority or female rate is lower; for negative actions,  such as terminations, it will be where the minority or female rate is higher.      4.Consistent with #3 above, the IRA is calculated when the selection rate  for minorities/women is less favor- able.  Therefore, to find the IRA for  positive     personnel actions, divide the lower minority/female rate by the rate for  others; for negative personnel actions, divide the rate for others by the higher  minority/female rate.    5.If the result of #4 above is less than .8, the IRA is adverse for  minorities or women.     When, and ONLY when an IRA is adverse, this worksheet calls for  an  additional calculation of how many minorities or women poten-    tially were affected.  This, when considered in conjunction with other  review information, may assist in setting investigative priorities.     IRAs may be conducted for women vs. men, for minorities in the aggregate vs.  nonminorities, or for a particular minority  group.**  Where your earlier review  of EEO trends (SCRR page 7) identified a substantial disparity in the  representation of a     _________    *The EOS should be aware, however, that sometimes a more favor-    able rate for minorities or women may indicate a ""channeling"" into  different and perhaps less favorable jobs than others.    **While desk audit IRAs may be based on minorities in the aggre-    gate, an onsite finding of discrimination must identify the par-    ticular minority group(s) against whom discrimination is alleged (see  Appendix 3A instructions for Worksheet 17-1 on onsite refinement of IRAs).    particular minority group, IRAs should be conducted separately for that  group at least in the workforce area(s) where the disparity was observed and for  the type of activity most likely to have caused the disparity.  For example:      -If the disparity you observed was a historical absence of a particular  minority group, all hiring IRAs should be con-    ducted separately for that group.    -If the disparity was that Hispanics have historically been well represented  in Professional jobs but absent from Man-    agement, your IRAs for promotions and hires into Management job groups  should be conducted separately for Hispanics.    -If the disparity was that over the past year the represen-    tation of Black Technicians declined dramatically, termina-    tion IRAs (and probably promotion and hire IRAs also) in Technician job  groups should be conducted separately for Blacks.    Even where such a disparity was not observed in the initial category screen,  where the labor area has a high representation of more than one minority group  and/or the general employment patterns in the industry involved have differed  among minority     groups, in reviewing the contractor's activity data preparatory to  conducting IRA, the EOS should be alert for any indications of potential  problems in selections of a particular minority group.    IMPORTANT:  Remember that an adverse IRA is only a preliminary indicator of  a potential discrimination problem.  For example, a job group IRA may measure  selection for jobs with differing qual-ification standards and consequent  differing candidate pools.  These matters need to be explored further (normally  onsite) before any conclusions can be reached.     IRA INSTRUCTIONS      At the top of this sheet enter the names of the groups whose selection rates  you are comparing (minorities vs. nonminorities; women vs. men; Blacks vs.  Others, etc.) and, in the ""Rate for:"" headings for columns (b) and  (c), an abbreviation for those groups.  Also enter the dates covered by the  employment activity data and the date of the incumbency data you are using  (incum-    bency data should, to the extent possible, be from the beginning of the  activity period), then complete this sheet as follows.     Job Area (a):  Enter the name of the job area being analyzed. Assuming this  is a job group, also indicate the EEO-1/6 category  to which it belongs.     HIRES     The hiring rate of a group is the number of that group who were hired  divided by the number of that group who applied.     oRate for: (b):  Enter the hiring rate for minorities, members of a  particular minority group or women (include both numbers and percent).     oRate for: (c):  Enter the hiring rate for others (include both numbers and  percent).     If the minority/female hiring rate is lower than that for others, compute  the IRA [(d) below].  If the minority/female rate is higher, no further entries  are required.    oIRA (d):  Since this is a positive personnel action, divide the lower  minority/female rate by the rate for others.     If the IRA is .8 or more, STOP.  No further entries are needed for this IRA.   Complete the remaining columns ONLY if the IRA is less than .8.     oOverall Rate (e):  Find the overall hiring rate by dividing the total  number of hires by the total number of     applicants.     oExpected (f):  Enter the number of minorities/women who would have been  hired if all persons had been hired at the same rate.  To get this number,  multiply the overall rate (e) by the number of minority or female applicants  [the denominator in (b)].  Round the result down to the nearest whole number  (i.e. 4.3 = 4; 0.7 = 0, etc.).    oActual (g):  Enter the actual number of minorities or women hired.     oDifference (h):  Subtract the actual number from the expect-ed number and  enter the difference.  This is how many addi-    tional minorities or women you would expect to have been hired if all groups  had been hired at the same rate.     If the difference is zero, leave this column blank, and the IRA need not be  pursued further.     EXAMPLE:  1 of 10 women were hired (10%), 5 of 10 men  were hired (50%).   The IRA is .2 (.10/.50).     Since there were 6 total hires (1 woman + 5 men), and 20 total applicants  (10 women + 10 men)--the overall hiring rate was 6/20 or 30%.     If men and women had been hired at the same rate, you would have expected  30% of the 10 female applicants--or 3--to have been hired.  Since the actual  number hired was 1, the difference is 2--i.e. 2 women may not have been hired  because of potential discrimination.     Your IRA sheet for this example would look like this:    PROMOTIONS      Following the same procedure as for hires, enter the promotion rates for  minorities, members of a particular minority group or women and the promotion  rate for others, then, if the minority/    female rate is lower, divide it by the rate for others.  If the resulting  IRA is less than .8, use the same method as for hires to determine overall rate,  expected, actual and difference.     Please note, however, that to analyze promotion data sensibly, you must:   (1) know how the contractor has defined promotions, and (2) draw on the results  of your Review of Personnel Practices (SCRR page 8), to develop some idea of  what the probable candi-    date pool was for the promotions involved.     For example, if you have data on promotion to Crafts II (mid-    level), you may determine based on your earlier review of person-nel  practices that the prime candidate pool is probably Crafts I (lowest level).  In  that case your IRA would be as follows:      EXAMPLE:     Total  Min.  Nonmin.     Promotions to Crafts II   12     2  9     Persons in Craft I    50    10 40     The minority rate is the number of minority promotions to  Crafts lI,  divided by the number of minorities in Crafts I-- i.e. 2/10 or 20%.     The nonminority rate is the number of nonminority promotions to Crafts II  divided by the number of nonminorities in  Crafts I--i.e. 9/40 or 22.5%.     To find the IRA, divide the minority rate by the nonminority rate--here,  .20/.225 or .89.     Since the IRA is not adverse, no further entries are needed and your IRA  sheet would look like this:    Obviously, you can only conduct this analysis if you can make a fair guess  at what the appropriate feeder pool is for promotion, and you would need to  confirm the accuracy of that guess onsite.  If you cannot make any preliminary  determination of probable feeder groups for promotion, you should wait until you  are     onsite to conduct this portion of the IRA.     TERMINATIONS     Follow the same procedures as for hires and promotions, except that:        Since this is a negative personnel action, the IRA is conducted when the  rate for minorities, members of a particular minority group, or women is higher  than the rate for others.      To find the IRA, divide the termination rate for others by the higher  minority/female rate.       If the IRA is adverse, when you find the expected number, round the result  up* to the nearest whole number (i.e. 0.3 = 1; 6.8 = 7; etc.).       Since in an adverse termination situation, you would expect fewer  minorities/women to have terminated, subtract the expected number from the  actual.          EXAMPLE: 6 of 40 women terminated (15%); 1 of 10 men terminated (10%), for  an IRA of .10./.15 or .67.     Since the IRA is less than .8, find the overall termination rate by dividing  the 7 total terminations (6 women + 1 man) by the 50 total incumbents (40 women  + 10 men)--i.e. 7/50 or 14%.    Multiply the overall rate by the number of female incumbents to find the  number of women you would have expected to ter-    minate--i.e. .14 x 40 or 5.6 = 6.     Since the expected number is 6 and 6 women actually terminated, the  difference is zero, and the IRA need not be pursued further.     _______    *The reason for rounding up here (vs. down on hires and promo-    tions) is to eliminate ""fractional persons.""  For example, in a  positive action, with 3.7 expected hires and 3 actual, the dif-    ference would be .7 ""more"" of a person hired; similarly, in neg-      ative actions, with 4.4 expected terminations and 5 actual, the difference  would be .6 ""less"" of a person terminated.  However, see later  comments on interpreting IRA results.     For this example, your IRA sheet would look like this:     OTHER ACTIVITY ELEMENTS     You may wish to attach additional IRA worksheets (with headings  appropriately modified) for other relevant employment activity information the  contractor may provide, such as training data.  In determining what information  to enter, simply remember that the rate for the groups you are comparing will  always be the number of persons selected (for training, for transfer, etc.)  divided by the number of persons in the pool eligible for selec-    tion.  How you define eligible for selection will depend on the situation  and the quality of your data.     INTERPRETING IRA RESULTS     IRAs do not stand alone.  They must be interpreted in light of surrounding  review factors.  For example,"

What few have recognized is that the labor movement is attempting to transform itself at all levels: from the bottom-up, as local unions engage in new strategies for organizing workers; from the center-out, as central labor councils and multi-union organizing draw together previously disjointed efforts; and from the top-down, as the AFL-CIO takes the lead in reshaping the movement at the national level.    Symposium presenters discussed the retooled strategies of the labor movement at all of these levels and also reported on new experiments around organizing and capacity-building that have been initiated across employers, industries, and the nation.    Organizing Innovations: The Role of Local Unions       Saul Rubinstein of Rutgers University has been tracking the activities of innovative union locals that are rethinking their strategies, roles, and structures in response to competitive pressures or through negotiated opportunities such as cooperative partnership agreements. While the characteristics and industries of these locals—affiliated with national unions as diverse as the CWA, IBEW, UNITE, USWA, UAW, and SEIU—differ significantly, they share one fundamental characteristic. All have expanded their activities beyond the traditional function of union locals. Common principles are also emerging out of their wide variety of experiences:         The labor movement is transforming itself at all levels:from the bottom- up,as local unions engage in new strategies for organizing workers; from the center-out,as central labor councils and multi-union organizing draw together previously disjointed efforts;and from the top-down,as the AFL-CIO takes the lead in reshaping the movement at the national level.         A Changed View of the Role of Management . “Management is seen much more as a function, not as a class of employees,” said Rubinstein. “The locals know that if they introduce the voice of labor in the management function by actually taking on management decision-making, it is a way to increase the representation of collective interests.” To be successful in this arena, however, local union representatives must also be involved in setting the decision-making agenda—not just in responding to one management has already set. In addition, Rubinstein reports that many of these locals are involved in areas that historically have been the sole purview of management: strategy formation, product development, technology selection, and the implementation of new forms of production, budgeting, finance, manpower allocation, supplier and employee selection, and actual operations management.      Expanded Capacities and Skill Requirements . Given these new managerial functions, the capacity and skills of locals and their representatives have been stretched in several ways. “The first is the ability to balance responsibility for representing individuals whose rights have been violated, collective representation, and collective bargaining with contributions to business decisions,” Rubinstein explained. The second is the development of local leadership with a cross-functional understanding of a firm’s business in order to contribute broadly to decision-making. “Locals have had to organize resources around these multiple roles, with a new division of labor within the firm and in the reshaped structure of the local itself,” he said.     Targeted Organizational Development . To both manage the union and engage with management, innovative locals have been forced to grapple with structural problems that require organizational development. Traditional local structures have a division of labor that provides resources to support individual representation through grievance committees and collective representation through a bargaining committee. According to Rubinstein, this organizational form is poorly suited to the pursuit of new organizational responsibilities such as strategy formulation, finance, budgeting, and product development. In order to balance the needs of representation and co-management, many locals have undertaken internal reorganization, developing forums for reporting to the rank and file and receiving its input.     A Proliferation of New Structural Forms . Related to the organizational realignment required to carry out these new functions, many locals have created a variety of both off-line and on-line structures. “The off-line forms are for the local’s leadership to widen governance responsibilities in joint labor-management committees with their non-represented counterparts,” said Rubinstein. “This strategy allowed the firm to engage in cross-boundary linkages with customers and suppliers as well as the corporation and national union.” On-line efforts include involving the membership in self-directed or –managed teams or embedding them in managerial positions within the organization.     Challenges Around Solidarity . “These new roles and capacities raise an issue around enterprise unionism versus solidarity with other locals,” said Rubinstein. “Locals tend to have an enterprise focus in order to engage in business decisions, but there’s some question about whether this role compromises their solidarity with other locals and the national union.”   Coordinating Regional Efforts: Central Labor Councils   The historic role of the approximately 600 Central Labor Councils (CLCs) around the United States has been to engage in regional political and legislative action around elections, fundraising, and lobbying, as well as to coordinate union response to and participation in community activities and service provision. As Susan Eaton of MIT’s Sloan School of Management explained, local unions are not required to affiliate with their CLCs, and the “voluntary” nature of their membership raises a set of issues around relationships with constituencies and the availability of resources. “Since revenue is primarily from membership dues, with some support from the AFL-CIO,” said Eaton, “CLC leadership had to convince locals to affiliate or they would lose their funding. Yet they represent the labor movement generally—the AFL-CIO at the territorial level—and are not directly responsible for organizing workers or negotiating agreements.”One of the first actions taken by John Sweeney as the new president of the AFL-CIO was to assemble CLC leaders at a conference to discuss ways of revitalizing the fundamental role of these councils. Sweeney and the Executive Council reorganized the struc-ture of the AFL-CIO and increased its diversity, creating four new regions and appointing regional and state directors as well as some local representatives. The new officers, in partnership with the Central Labor Council Advisory Committee comprised of a cross-section of CLC leaders, also launched the Union Cities campaign, which created an entirely new role for CLCs. “The idea of Union Cities was to create strong communities and permanent alliances with community-based groups,” Eaton explained. “CLCs now have a new role in union member education and mobilization, which is very unusual since they traditionally had stayed out of matters internal to local unions and the role of organizing.”    In many cities, CLCs have risen to the occasion, developing rapid response mechanisms for supporting organizing, contract battles, and community campaigns. CLCs have also continued to work in the political arena, but have begun to focus on building power and religious/community coalitions, as well as on developing regional training programs as part of economic development efforts. The AFL-CIO may seek to further reinforce all of the work being done at the state and local levels through a new program—to be called “The New Alliance”—which will be voted on this fall at its convention in Los Angeles.   While the changes enacted by Sweeney and the new leadership represent a great deal of promise for the future of CLCs—particularly around local collaboration and community building—Eaton believes that open questions remain about the effectiveness and sustainability of the CLC’s reinvented role:        Can the community focus of the new CLCs win support among the public and their allies, as well as recognition that they represent all working families, as they seek to do, rather than unionized workers only?     How will the CLCs raise additional funds to support their new organizing and educational roles?         As part of a move to reinvigorate the labor movement, the AFL-CIO is spearheading a series of experiments involving strategic organizing across unions and in conjunction with the national federation.          How will CLCs support organizing efforts—a demanding role that constitutes a fundamental charge in their missions—while still engaging in political activity and fulfilling the expectations of union members?    Crossing Boundaries: Multi-Union Organizing      As part of a move to reinvigorate the labor movement, the AFL-CIO is spearheading a series of experiments involving strategic organizing across unions and in conjunction with the national federation. According to Jane McAlevey, who heads the Stamford Organizing Project for the AFL-CIO, these initiatives are intended to develop and test innovative practices and, ultimately, to determine how lessons learned might be brought to scale. The campaign’s primary motivations are to organize workers in greater numbers and in less time, while their secondary motivations are to reframe labor’s relationship to the community, as well as how the community views the labor movement. These highly collaborative projects have engendered innovative institutional structures that transcend many of the boundaries that, historically, have fragmented labor efforts.   McAlevey’s campaign represents a geographically-based, multi-union organizing partnership between the AFL-CIO, three international unions, and four union locals: the SEIU, HERE, and the UAW. The partnership is managed by the Federation, which provides a campaign director, a strategic researcher, a community organizer, and an office manager; the local affiliates agree to send staff to serve as organizers. “With this organizational structure and shared funding between the locals and the national federation, we have a common office and share staff as needed on each other’s campaigns,” said McAlevey. “We also share a collective approach for the public campaign aspect of our community campaign building.” The Project’s advising structure is also collaborative, as it maintains a collective board with representation from the local presidents, the lead organizer on the Project, and the Federation.   While the Project is propelled by national support and collaboration, it has a local focus. In this case, organizers have drawn together to address the egregious income inequality in Fairfield County, Connecticut, and the exploitation considered to be rampant in the county’s predominantly service-sector jobs. “After systematically analyzing the power structure in the area,” said McAlevey, “we realized that we had to retrain our thinking as unions and reframed our public message to eliminate the notion that unions are somehow separate from the community: workers are the union; workers are the community; therefore the unions are the community.” The Project began to train its leaders to take an active role in both the campaign and in community work, as well as develop ties to local legislators, clergy, and civil rights groups. Thus far, the Stamford Organizing Project—in existence for only one year—has forged a sustainable and truly community-based campaign around workers rights and economic justice.   Using the leverage gained by collaborative work and support from community leaders, the Project has won substantial victories and influential allies in an incredibly short amount of time. When fighting one company’s anti-organizing campaign, the Project gained the support of the state legislature, including the majority leader, who made a public call for neutrality. In a major public-sector campaign to organize health care workers, it helped to move the leadership of the legislature to have District 1199 win a $210 million allocation from the State of Connecticut for salaries and improved staffing levels, and even changed the legislature’s funding formula.    Refocusing National Leadership: The AFL-CIO     Ron Blackwell of the AFL-CIO recounted a defining moment in the renewal of the American labor movement: “When Sweeney won the contested election in 1995 he said, ‘The problem is not who heads the labor movement, but where it is headed—toward irrelevance.’” The acknowledgment was that, at least at the national level, labor needed to expand the scope of its organizing efforts to meet the needs of a rapidly changing workforce with many new concerns. “The labor movement in the United States had always maintained the ability to contribute a measure of dignity for people at work, to lend fairness in the way income is distributed at the bargaining table, and to be a voice for social justice,” said Blackwell. “But we had, over the years, become less relevant to our membership—to addressing changing conditions at work, at the bargaining table, and in society.”   Under Sweeney’s direction, the AFL-CIO has arrived at a strategy for revitalizing the labor movement that consists of four major components: organizing; building political voice and power for workers; helping unions change in order to give workers a voice in a rapidly changing global economy; and helping unions change to give workers a voice in their local communities.     “We recognize that the economy is changing—and think that it is moving in the wrong direction,” said Blackwell. “We want to put the power of the national labor movement behind our local affiliates to help unions become influential in developing the strategies that will put us back on track.” The AFL-CIO has reorganized its offices and initiated a series of strategic programs in order to meet this challenge:     Developing worker education programs to support organizing efforts . According to Blackwell, many workers no longer recognize that the problems they face at work are actually work-related problems. As an example, he questioned whether Texaco’s African-American workers were attributing discrimination by their employer to racism in society, not racism in the workplace. The AFL-CIO is developing an education program to help workers recognize that the problems at work are, in fact, work-related; that collective, rather than individual, action is often necessary for solving these problems; and that unions can serve as effective vehicles for such action.      Directly supporting highly focused organizing campaigns with the potential for success . The AFL-CIO’s Center for Strategic Research is targeting entire sectors of the economy for organizing at a pace and scale never attempted before—a strategy that requires a two-fold focus. First, unions need to win in organizing campaigns that matter for helping unions rebuild power in their traditional jurisdictions. Second, unions must reposition themselves to organize in places where the economy is growing.      Paving the high road—and blocking the low road—toward corporate responsibility . “We want our employers to be successful. They have to be successful—our jobs depend on it,” said Blackwell. “We want them to meet their competition in ways that don’t disadvantage the people who work for them and are not indifferent to the communities in which those companies are active.” Blackwell explained that paving the high road involves identifying businesses and competitive strategies that focus on product quality, promote continuous innovation, stress customer service, and meet price competition through increases in productivity. At the same time, the labor movement should work to block the low road—pressuring companies that insist on remaining competitive by weakening unions, undermining job security, and slashing wages and benefits.       Organize pension funds to yield high long-term returns to retirees by supporting high-road corporate competitive strategies . The AFL-CIO’s Office of Investment is focusing its efforts on how capital markets can more effectively meet the needs of working families. The Center for Working Capital is an independent non-profit organization affiliated with the AFL-CIO that will press for a greater voice for workers in global capital markets.     Fostering training for local economic development . The AFL-CIO-affiliated non-profit Working for America Institute focuses on a traditional union function—training—with an updated approach that includes the reform of work organization, industrial modernization, and technological change in the context of regional economic development.   Where does this range of effort—at multiple levels—leave the American labor movement? The reality is that despite these innovations, the decline in union density has not yet been reversed. Other strategies will be needed to appeal to a broader cross-section of the labor force. How to accomplish that reversal still constitutes an open debate within the labor movement itself and among those who believe in its value to society.

In a preaward review, the desk audit is normally conducted onsite (also  see Section 3C).    2A01  PURPOSE OF DESK AUDITS     Desk audits are a major component of compliance reviews.  By careful and  systematic review of the documents and materials provided by covered contractors  and subcontractors, the Equal Opportunity Specialist (EOS) can begin to  determine whether they are complying with relevant provisions of 41 CFR Chapter  60, are not discriminating and are taking affirmative action to ensure equal  employment opportunity without regard to race, color, religion, national origin,  sex, disability, or status as a special disabled or Vietnam era veteran.  Desk  audits enable the EOS to review a contractor's compliance with its affirmative  action and equal opportunity obligations at a particular establishment, and  specifically to:      (a) Workforce Structure, Personnel Policies and Procedures:  Examine the  contractor's basic organizational structure, personnel policies and procedures.      (b) Good Faith Efforts:  Identify areas: (1) where there has been a lack of  goals progress and further information is needed onsite to evaluate the  contractor's good faith effort, including the development and implementation of  programs designed to improve opportunities for minorities and women.    (c) Potential Discrimination:  Identify areas for an in-depth investigation  of potential discrimination: (1) where minorities and women are  underrepresented and concentrated in the workforce; (2) where employment  activity has been disadvantageous to minorities or women; and (3) where there  may be problems in the compensation of minorities or women vs. others.     2A02  PURPOSE AND PRINCIPLES OF AAPS    Desk audits should be conducted with the following AAP principles as points  of reference:    (a) Equal Employment Opportunity:  Equal employment opportunity requires  that a contractor eliminate and remedy all discrimination.  A contractor's  personnel policies and practices must not discriminate against any persons  because of their race, color, religion, national origin, sex, disability or  covered veteran status.       (b) Affirmative Action:  An affirmative action program is a set of specific  and result-oriented policies and procedures to which a contractor commits itself  to apply every good faith effort.  The objective of those procedures plus such  efforts is equal employment opportunity.      (c) Completeness, Reasonableness, Acceptability:  The affirmative action  program will be judged for its completeness, reasonableness, and acceptability.      2A03  RELATIONSHIP TO THE STANDARD COMPLIANCE REVIEW REPORT (SCRR)      The Standard Compliance Review Report (SCRR) and its instructions (Appendix  2A) constitute a framework for conducting the desk audit and developing and  implementing an onsite investigative plan.  The organization of this Chapter  generally parallels that of the SCRR, and it should be read in conjunction with  the SCRR instructions.    (a) Organization of the SCRR:  The SCRR is organized into three parts:    (1) Part A:  Preparation:  Part A covers preparation for the desk audit,  including such areas as the contractor's past review history, overall EEO  trends in its workforce, its organizational structure, and the initial review  of its AAP and support data for completeness, reasonableness, and  acceptability.    (2) Part B:  Affirmative Action:  Part B summarizes prob- lems with the AAP  and support data; provides for analysis of affirmative action progress and  identification of areas where additional information is needed to determine  good faith effort; and covers implementation of other affirmative action  obligations.  For each affirmtive action problem unresolved at the conclusion  of desk audit, the SCRR provides for an onsite plan.    (3) Part C:  Potential Discrimination:  Part C includes review of the  workforce analysis for concentrations/    underrepresentations), impact ratio analyses, and compensation analyses.   For each potential discrimination problem unresolved at the conclusion of desk  audit, the SCRR provides for an onsite investigative plan.    (b) SCRR Potential Discrimination Worksheets:  The SCRR also includes a  series of Potential Discrimination Worksheets designed to illustrate the steps  normally necessary to establish particular types of discrimination.  These  Worksheets and their instructions are in Appendix A to Chapter 3.  Their use,  although encouraged, is optional.  However, the ""Key Factors""  highlighted at the beginning of the instructions for each Worksheet must be  addressed in an analysis if the Worksheet applies to the type of potential  discrimination problem involved.  In developing an onsite plan for the  investigation of potential discrimination issues, therefore, the EOS may find it  useful to review at least the ""Key Factors"" for the initial onsite  step of data refinement (Worksheets 17-1 and 17-2).     2B  PRE-DESK AUDIT ACTIONS    2B00  COMPLIANCE REVIEW INFORMATION SYSTEM (CRIS)    CRIS is used to record basic information about the contractor, to track  major review events, and to summarize violations found and remedies obtained.   To enter a contractor into CRIS, the Area Of-fice completes CRIS Form 100 and  sends it to Region.  The Region then generates a CRIS Form 100a, which is the  first page of the SCRR.  Full instructions for completing the 100a are given in  the CRIS Manual.    2B01  MAINTENANCE OF CASE CHRONOLOGY    The EOS should prepare a case chronology (CC-53; see Figure 2-1) for each  compliance review.  It should cover events occurring from the date of initial  contact with the contractor to the date case closing documents are prepared and  approved.  All telephone conversations, correspondence and meetings associated  with the review should be recorded, indicating the date, nature of contact,  person contacted, summary of discussion or actions taken, and EOS' name.  Events  should be logged in as they occur, since it is difficult to reconstruct these  after a review is completed.  The case chronology is an integral part of the  case file and will be an invaluable tool if enforcement action is necessary.   All notes and logs should be legible (preferably typed).    2B02  INITIAL CONTACT WITH CONTRACTOR    (a) Identifying Information:  Identifying information should be obtained by  contacting the contractor before the start of the compliance review.  The name  of the establishment chief executive officer (CEO), the name of the person  responsible for preparation/implementation of the AAP, and the correct     mailing address for the establishment should be obtained.  If the  establishment is part of a larger entity, the name of the corporate CEO, the  name of the corporate person responsible for Equal Employment  Opportunity/Affirmative Action matters, and the correct corporate mailing  address should also be obtained.  This basic identifying information should be  entered on page 2 of the SCRR, along with contract data, labor force  information, and the other items specified in the SCRR instructions.    (b) Representation by Counsel:  If the contractor indicates, at this point  in the review or later, that an outside counsel or consultant will represent the  company, the contractor will be asked to provide written confirmation of  representation, including: (1) the representative's name, address and phone  number; (2) the scope of the representative's authority (including whether  he/she is authorized to negotiate settlement for the contractor); (3) whether  all contacts, including routine ones to make appointments or to clarify  submitted data or other information, should be made through the representative;  and (4) whether all correspondence should be mailed only to the representative  or if copies should also be mailed to the contractor.  Upon receipt of this  written confirmation, contacts and correspondence will be handled accordingly  for the duration of the review (unless the contractor specifies a different time  period).  NOTE:  This same written confirmation should be obtained from the  contractor if OFCCP is contacted by a person who indicates that he/she  represents the contractor.    (c) Special Circumstances:  The EOS should also determine if there is any  information which would preclude selection of the contractor for a compliance  review (e.g., bankruptcy, debarment, closure of the establishment), or would  influence the timing of the review (i.e. vacation shutdown, strike, lockout,  heavy layoffs, etc.).    2B03  SCHEDULING LETTER    The notice used to schedule a compliance review and request the Affirmative  Action Program (AAP) and supporting documentation is called a Scheduling Letter  (Figure 2-2).  This letter will be sent, by certified mail with return receipt  requested, to the top official at the contractor's establishment with a copy to  the chief executive officer at the corporate address (unless the establishment  and corporate office are the same).  Scheduling Letters shall be signed by the  AOD or FOD.  Letters should include the name and telephone number of the EOS who  will be conducting the review and/or the appropriate Module Chief.      2B04  FOLLOW-UP CONTACT WITH CONTRACTOR    Within fifteen working days after sending the Scheduling Letter, the EOS  should contact the contractor to ensure that the contractor's representatives  fully understand the requirements outlined.  The EOS should also make sure there  have been no special circumstances which may require postponing or cancelling  the scheduled review (see 2B02(c) above).    2B05  CONTACT WITH EEOC, STATE AND LOCAL FEP AGENCIES AND VETS    (a) EEOC and State and local Fair Employment Practices (FEP) Agencies:   Simultaneously with the Scheduling Letter, the standard inquiry letter (Figure  2-3) should be sent to the district office of the EEOC and to State and local  FEP agencies, requesting information on complaints filed against the contractor  and any other information that may be pertinent to assessing the contractor's  EEO posture.  If after 15 days no response is received, the EOS should follow-up  by telephone.     (b) Veterans Employment and Training Service (VETS):  The EOS must contact  the VETS representative at the appropriate State Employment Security office to  request information he or she may have which could be pertinent to the review.   This contact must be recorded in the case chronology record.    2B06  REVIEW OF COMMUNITY RESOURCE FILES    Each AO or FO should maintain resource files on the communities within its  geographic area.  For each community, these files should contain at least: (1)  basic data on minority/female availability; (2) information on public  transportation systems; and (3) identification of local organizations  representing covered group members.  The EOS should review the resource file for  the community where the contractor is located, with particular attention to  organizations which can be helpful in evaluating the contractor's compliance  posture.  If the contractor is located near an Indian reservation, the EOS  should contact the reservation's Tribal Employment Rights Council (TERO).    2B07  STANDARD AFFIRMATIVE ACTION FORMATS    If the contractor scheduled for review has an approved Standard Affirmative  Action Format (SAAF), the Module Chief should obtain a copy of the format and  provide it to the EOS conducting the review.  The EOS should become familiar  with the provisions of the SAAF, preparatory to evaluating the contractor's AAP.      2B08  REVIEW OF PREVIOUS COMPLIANCE ACTIONS    When scheduling the contractor for a compliance review, the EOS should  determine whether the contractor has previously been audited.  If so, the EOS  should examine at least the previous case file for problem areas, with  particular attention to commitments made in a Conciliation Agreement or Letter  of Commitment.  The EOS also should determine whether the contractor has been  subject to an OFCCP complaint investigation and, if so, review the file for any  problems identified.  Problems in these past compliance actions should be  recorded on page 3 of the SCRR. As the review progresses, the EOS should be  alert to any indications that past problems have remained unremedied or have  recurred.    2B09  INFORMATION ON COMPLAINTS    (a) Response to the Standard Inquiry Letter:  The EOS should carefully  examine all information on complaints received from Federal, State, and local  agencies in response to the Standard Inquiry Letter.  Basic information on these  com- plaints should be entered on page 3 of the SCRR, including the agency with  which the complaint was filed, the basis, issue, current status, and the area of  the contractor's workforce involved in the complaint.    (b) Relationship to Desk Audit:  The EOS should note any patterns in the  types of complaints filed, particularly ones that might indicate potential  systemic discrimination problems.  For example, there may be a clustering of  complaints filed by employees in certain job areas, or by applicants or  employees from a particular race, religion, ethnic group, or sex, or by covered  veterans or individuals with disabilities.  As the review progresses, the EOS  should cross reference complaints to potential problem areas identified.  For  example, there may be indications of lack of good faith efforts, adverse IRA's,  and/or concentrations/underrepresentations in areas where complaints have been  filed.      (c) Review of Case Files:  Where appropriate, the EOS should contact the  appropriate EEOC office or State or local fair employment agency to arrange to  review case files as part of the compliance review.  This can be useful when, as  a result of the desk audit, potential systemic problems are indenti- fied in  complaint areas.    (d) Contractor Complaint Information:  Upon receipt of the AAP and  supporting data, any information provided by the con- tractor with respect to  current or past complaints should be compared to the information received from  the agencies.  Discrepancies and/or information not provided by the contractor  should be noted by the EOS for particular attention during the review.      2B10  RELATIONSHIP OF OFCCP COMPLIANCE ACTIVITIES TO EEO LITIGATION OR COURT  ORDERS    If, during the conduct of a compliance review, the EOS finds that the  contractor is involved in litigation or is under a court order on EEO matters,  he/she should identify the EEO issues involved, the court, the parties, the case  name and number, and bring the matter to the attention of the AOD (or FOD, where  appropriate).  The AOD/FOD, in consultation through channels with the Regional  Solicitor's Office, will determine whether there are any limitations which may  be imposed on the conduct of the compliance review by the litigation or court  order.    2C  SUBMISSION OF AAPS FOR DESK AUDIT    2C00  DELAYED RECEIPT OF AAPS    If current AAPs are not received by the 30th calendar day after the  contractor received the notification of the scheduled review, the EOS should  telephone the contractor to determine whether the AAPs have been mailed.  If the  contractor advises that they are en route, a reasonable period of time, not to  exceed five (5) calendar days, will be allowed for receipt.      2C01  NON-RECEIPT OF EXECUTIVE ORDER AAP    If there is no reason to believe that the AAP is en route, or if an AAP  reported en route has not been received at the end of 5 calendar days following  the 30th day, a show cause notice should generally be issued (see Chapter 8).   However, the regulations at 41 CFR 60-1.26(a)(2) give the Director, OFCCP the  discretion to go directly to administrative enforcement where a contractor  refuses to submit an AAP and efforts to conciliate the matter are unsuccessful.       2C02  NON-RECEIPT OF SECTION 503/38 U.S.C. 4212 AAPS    A Section 503 and 38 U.S.C. 4212 AAP may be included in an Executive Order  AAP, may be combined in one document, or may be submitted as separate documents.   Action to be taken where Section 503 and/or 38 U.S.C. 4212 AAP(s) are not  submitted may take either of two forms, depending on circumstances:      (a) Concurrent Failure to Submit EO 11246 AAP or Submission of Unreasonable  EO 11246 AAP:  If the contractor failed to submit both an Executive Order AAP  and the AAP(s) for Section 503/38 U.S.C. 4212, or if the Executive Order AAP is  determined to be an unreasonable submission (see Section 2F    below) and no Section 503/38 U.S.C. 4212 AAP(s) was submitted, then the Show  Cause Notice being issued for the Executive Order violation will include the  failure to submit the Section 503/38 U.S.C. 4212 AAP and offer the contractor a  concurrent 30-day period to submit that AAP (see Sections 8B01(b) and 8D00(b)  and Figures 8-1 and 8-2).    (b) Reasonable EO 11246 AAP Submitted:  If the contractor's Executive Order  AAP has been received and is determined to be reasonable, but no Section 503/38  U.S.C. 4212 AAP(s) was received, the EOS will telephone the contractor to  request that the missing AAP(s) be provided.  If the materials are received  before the end of the desk audit, they will be reviewed for completeness and  acceptability (see Sections 2E01 and 2I below) as part of the desk audit.  If  they are not received before the end of the desk audit, they will be reviewed  onsite.  If, however, it is determined onsite that the contractor did not have  Section 503 and/or 38 U.S.C. 4212 AAPs in place in accordance with the  regulations, this will be cited as a major problem, and its resolution addressed  in a Conciliation Agreement.    2C03  EVALUATION PERIOD    (a) General:  The EOS should evaluate the contractor's perform- ance (e.g.,  goals progress, good faith efforts, personnel activity, etc.) for at least the  last full AAP year.  Cur- rent year performance should also be examined if the  con- tractor is six months or more into its current AAP year.  For example, if  the AAP is established on a calendar year basis, and the compliance review is  scheduled for August 1988, the EOS would evaluate the contractor's performance  from January 1, 1987 through June 30, 1988 (1/1/87 through 12/31/87 under the  prior AAP, and 1/1/88 through 6/30/88 under the current AAP).    (b) When Discrimination Found:  Note, however, that if potential  discrimination is found, analysis of personnel activity/policy implementation  should be extended to cover the normal liability period (providing coverage can  be established during the full normal liability period).  The normal liability  period for a compliance review is the full two years preced-ing the date the  contractor received the Scheduling Letter.  Additionally, where the alleged  discrimination involves a continuing violation, the analysis may be extended  further (see Chapters 3 and 7).    Revised 5-25-90    2C04  TIMEFRAME FOR COMPLETION OF COMPLIANCE REVIEW    The 60-day period for completing the compliance review (refer to 41 CFR  60-60.7) begins when the AAP and support data (whether reasonable or not) are  recieived in the AO/FO.  While completion of the review within the 60-day period  is not a procedural prerequisite to an enforcement action, substantial effort  should be made to complete the review within that period of time.  Should it  become apparent that a review cannot or will not be completed within 60 days of  receipt of the AAP and support data (irrespective of whether a Show Cause Notice  has been issued), the EOS should request an extension through his or her Module  Chief.  All extension requests must be made sufficiently in advance to allow for  necessary processing and entry into the CRIS.      2C05  REVIEWS OF CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS, REGIONAL AND DISTRICT OFFICES    (a) Maintenance of Establishment AAPs:  When reviewing corporate  headquarters, the EOS should review documentation that the corporation's  establishments have developed AAPs.    (b) Corporate-Level Selection Decisions:  The EOS should ensure that the  workforce analysis, utilization analysis and goals in the corporate  headquarter's AAP include all positions filled by headquarters decision-makers,  regardless of where those jobs are physically located.  For example, mid- and  upper-level management jobs at establishments other than headquarters must be  included in the corporate AAP if the selection decisions for those jobs are made  at the corporate level.     Where because of informal or fluctuating managerial appointment authorities,  the appropriate level for job title placement cannot be clearly or consistently  defined, the managerial and other appropriate titles should be placed in the  AAP of the highest organizational level where ultimate approval authority may  reside.  As a result, there may be instances when the majority of mid- and  upper-level manage-ment and other titles should appropriately be placed in the  corporate headquarters AAP, notwithstanding personnel responsibility at  intermediate organizational levels.  Management should be given substantial  discretion in determining proper organizational levels for job title placement  provided such placement is not inconsistent with the purpose of this Section.      (c) Regional or District-Level Selection Decisions:  Similarly, if a  regional or district office has decision-making authority over positions in a  lower-level establishment unit, the regional or district office AAP should  include those positions in its workforce analysis, utilization analysis and  goals.     Revised 5-25-90    (d) Establishments with Positions Filled by Higher-Level Decision Making:   When reviewing establishments which are subordinate to a higher-level  establishment in the contractor's organization, the EOS will ensure that all  positions in the workforce of the lower-level establishment for which the  selection decisions are made at a higher corporate level are excluded from the  utilization analysis and goal setting of the establishment under review.  Such  positions, however, must be shown in the lower-level establishment's workforce  analysis (in order that the complete workforce structure of that establishment  is readily apparent).      2D INITIAL REVIEW OF AAP AND SUPPORT DATA - GENERAL    2D00  CONTENTS OF INITIAL REVIEW    Upon receipt of an AAP and support data, the EOS should immedi- ately review  the material to make sure that it provides an adequate basis for conducting  desk audit analyses of both affirma- tive action and potential discrimination  issues.  This initial review includes a determination of the completeness,  reasonableness and acceptability of the AAP(s) and support data as described  in the sections which follow.    2D01  RECORDING RESULTS OF INITIAL REVIEW    The results of this initial review are recorded on page 4 of the SCRR.   Where problems are identified, each specific problem should be described on page  9 of the SCRR (Problems with AAP and Support Data), along with the actions the  EOS plans to take to resolve it.  Where the matter is unresolved at the  conclusion of desk audit, page 9 will constitute the onsite plan for resolution of AAP and support data problems.     2E REVIEW FOR CURRENCY AND COMPLETENESS    2E00 ACTION WHEN AAP NOT CURRENT    Upon receipt of an AAP for desk audit, the EOS should first determine  whether the AAP is current.  If it is not, the submission should be treated as  if the contractor had failed to submit an AAP.  See Section 2C01 above.      2E01  COMPLETENESS    If the AAP is current, the EOS should review the AAP and support data for  completeness.  To do so, the EOS should first determine whether all materials  requested in the Scheduling Letter and itemized listing, including the Section  503 and 38 U.S.C. 4212 AAPs, have been submitted.  Then the EOS should determine  if the Executive Order and Section 503 and 38 U.S.C. 4212 AAPs contain all  ingredients required by the regulations:    oExecutive Order AAP ingredients required by 41 CFR 60-2.11 and 2.13(a)  through (j);    oRequired Executive Order support data, including the report of prior year  goal progress required by 41 CFR 60-1.40(b) and (c); and    oSection 503 and 38 U.S.C. 4212 AAP ingredients required by 41 CFR  60-741.6(a) through (f) and 41 CFR 60-250.6 (a) through (f) respectively.    2E02 CENTRAL EXECUTIVE ORDER AAP ELEMENT MISSING    If one or more of the following central Executive Order AAP ingredients is  missing, the submission is automatically considered unreasonable and the desk  audit should be suspended and a show cause notice issued:    oA workforce analysis;    oA utilization analysis, including its component parts of job group  formation, availability estimates and, as appropriate, identification of  underutilization; and    oGoals for areas declared underutilized.    If these central ingredients are included, the EOS should then evaluate them  for reasonableness.    2F REVIEW OF EXECUTIVE ORDER AAP FOR REASONABLENESS    For a submission to be considered a reasonable effort to meet the  requirements of 41 CFR Part 60-2, the central Executive Order AAP  ingredients  of workforce analysis, utilization analysis and goals development must meet the  following standards:    2F00  WORKFORCE ANALYSIS    The submission must contain a workforce analysis which lists all  jobs at  the establishment by title (not EEO-1 category, job group or some other  combination of job titles) and by organizational unit, showing at least total  employees, total women and total minorities for each job title.    2F01UTILIZATION ANALYSIS    In the following components of the utilization analysis, the submission must  show:    (a)Job Groups:  An attempt to combine job titles into job groups (defined as  one or more jobs with similar content, wage rates, and opportunities).    (b)Availability Analyses:  An attempt to establish separate availability  estimates for minorities and for women for each job group.    (c)Underutilization Determination:  A comparison of availability to current  incumbency to determine the existence of underutilization.    2F02GOALS    The submission must show an attempt to establish goals for those job groups  identified as underutilized.    2F03  ACTION FOR UNREASONABLE SUBMISSION    If the Executive Order AAP does not meet one or more of these standards for  reasonableness, the desk audit should be suspended and a show cause notice  issued (see Chapter 8).  If the Executive Order AAP is considered reasonable,  the EOS should evaluate the submission for acceptability.    2G REVIEW OF EXECUTIVE ORDER AAP FOR ACCEPTABILITY    2G00GENERAL     Having determined that the elements necessary to proceed with the desk  audit--the workforce analysis, utilization analysis and current goals--are  included in the contractor's submission and are reasonable, the desk audit  proceeds with an evaluation of the acceptability of each required ingredient.   The determination of the acceptability of the items listed on page 4 of the SCRR  will be limited to the evaluation which can be conducted during the desk audit.   This is different from an evaluation of a contractor's implementation of the  requirements, which in most instances cannot be determined without further  investigation onsite (see Chapter 3).      2G01     WORKFORCE ANALYSIS    An acceptable workforce analysis is one which meets the requirements of 41  CFR 60-2.11(a).  It must contain:    oA listing of each job title, as it appears in applicable collective  bargaining agreements or payroll records;    oIn wage rate or salary range order;    oWithin each department or other similar organizational unit, including unit supervision; and    oWhere there are separate work units or lines of progression within the  department or organizational unit, a separate listing must be provided.     More specifically:    (a)Information by Job Title:  Each job title listed must show the total  number of persons in the job title, the total num-ber of men and of women, and  the total number of men and of women in each of the following groups:  Blacks,  Hispanics, Asian/Pacific Islanders, and American Indians/Alaskan Natives.  All  job titles, including managerial job titles,  must be listed.  Positions which  are filled above the estab-lishment level must be included in an establishment's  work-force analysis even though they may be included for goal-setting purposes  in a corporate or mid-level AAP.  In deter-mining whether jobs are listed by  title, the EOS should be alert for the use of plurals in job titles; broad,  general titles, such as ""Manager"" or ""Machine Operator;"" or  inclu- sion of multiple pay ranges for one job title.  The pre- sence of any of  these suggests that jobs may not be listed by title.      (b)Wage Rate:    (1)General:  The wage rate or salary range for each job title must be given  (although this information may be coded--see (2) below).  Titles must be listed  in wage rate or range order within department or other similar organizational  units.  The listing may either be from highest to lowest paid or from lowest to  highest paid.      (2)Coded Data:  Where wage rate or salary range are coded, the contractor  must provide the key to the code onsite.  Any codes must be consistent across  department/unit lines (i.e. a job with a salary code ""57"" in  Department A, pays the same as one coded ""57"" in Department B) and in  wage rate or salary range order within each department or other similar  organization unit.  Also, the submission should include a list of the codes used  in wage/salary order with the highest and lowest codes so labeled.    (c)Organizational Unit:  The organizational units used in the workforce  analysis should be identifiable, and should reflect the contractor's  organizational structure.  If an organizational chart is provided as part of the  supporting documentation, it should be compared to the units used in the  workforce analysis.    (d)Lines of Progression:  Lines of progression or usual promotional  sequences must show the order of jobs in the line through which an employee  moves to reach the top of the line. Lines of progression or promotional  sequences may be identified from collective bargaining agreements as well as  from organizational charts.  If this information is not available at desk audit,  a final determination of acceptability cannot be made until after the onsite review.    2G02JOB GROUPS    Job groups, to be acceptable, must consist of a group of jobs having similar  content, wage rates, and opportunities.    (a)List of Titles in Each Group:  In order for the EOS to assess job group  acceptability, the AAP must include, for each job group, a listing of the job  titles which make up that group.  If such lists have not been provided, the EOS  should immediately contact the contractor and request that such lists be  provided for desk audit.    (b)Criteria for Acceptability:  The following criteria are to be used in  assessing the acceptability of job groups:    (1)Similar work content:  Similarity of work content refers to the duties  and responsibilities of the job titles which make up the job group.  While it is  difficult to confirm similarity without reference to position descriptions, some  steps can be taken during the desk audit to make at least a preliminary  assess-ment of acceptability of work content.  For example:    oAppropriate EEO Category:  The EOS should review the establishment's job  titles that make up each of the job groups to verify they are within the proper  EEO-1 categories.  Job titles in each job group normally would be within the  same EEO-1 category.     oUse of Dictionary of Occupational Titles:  The Dictionary of Occupational  Titles can be referred to, as well as labor agreements, organizational charts,  and other data provided by the contractor, in evaluating the manner in which the  contractor has formulated job groups.  The Dictionary of Occupational Titles  lists standard job titles for  most positions, and codes them based on their  duties, requirements, and other factors.  Descriptions of job duties and  commonly required qualifications are also given.    (2)Similar rates of pay:  Pay rates should be reviewed in conjunction with  job content.  Large apparent differences in pay, when associated with  differences in job title and/or location within an organization, suggest an  unacceptable job grouping.      (3)Similar opportunities:  Opportunity refers to the ability to take  advantage of training opportunities, transfers, promotions, mobility to  desirable wage/ salary situations, and other employment benefits.  Most often,  it refers to upward mobility.  Ideally, each job within a job group should offer  the same opportunities as any other job title within that job group.  As a  result:    oJobs in Separate Unions:  Jobs in separate unions, or jobs in different  departments when interdepartmental mobility is impossible, should not be   grouped together.  For example, nonunion clerical jobs and clerical jobs which  are covered by a collective bargaining agreement should not normally be grouped  together.    oJobs in Lines of Progression:  Jobs that are in lines of progression should  be separated from those that are not.  Where transfer or hire into jobs above  entry level is rare, each line of progression should be analyzed separately.   Where there are lines of progression governed by strict seniority, the job  titles in lines should be considered as a single job group.    (c)Job Groups Must Not Obscure Underutilization:  Job groups which combine  jobs with different content, wages, or opportunities may obscure  underutilization and are not acceptable.  Any job groups that combine jobs in  which minorities or women are concentrated with jobs in which they are  under-represented should be targeted for special scrutiny onsite.  Such job  groups often unacceptably include jobs with different content, wages, or  opportunities.        (d)Effects of Size of Contractor's Workforce:  In assessing the  acceptability of the contractor's job groups, the EOS must remember that the  size of the contractor's workforce is a major factor in determining how well  these three criteria will be met.      (1)Job Groups Must Permit Meaningful Analyses:  Job groups should have  enough incumbents to permit meaningful utilization analyses and goal setting.   Optimally, if a job group is identified as underutilized, it should be large  enough so that a goal of at least one whole person can be established.  No  minimum size has been established for this purpose, however, since it is  dependent not only on the size of the job group, but also on the size of the  availability percentage and the number of minorities or women already in the job  group.    (2)Job Groups Should Not Normally Cross EEO Categories:  Because of the  minimum size of a contractor subject to written AAP requirements, it may not be  possible for any of a smaller contractor's job groups to meet this guideline.   While there are usually two or more job groups within each EEO-1 or EEO-6  category, for smaller contractors some or all of their job groups may  correspond to those categories.  In any event, when job titles are combined to  maintain minimal job group size, EEO category lines should not normally be  crossed.      (e)Relationship Between Job Groups and Availability:  The organization of  jobs into groups allows contractors to tie specific jobs to availability  statistics in order to assess the degree to which their own workforce  representation approximates availability.      2G03AVAILABILITY ANALYSIS - GENERAL      (a)Standard for Acceptability:  The reasonable submission test requires only  that a contractor make an attempt to develop availability estimates.  For the  availability analysis to be found acceptable, however, it must contain a proper  definition of labor area and must show consideration of each of the eight  factors at 41 CFR 60-2.11(b)(1) and (2).      (b)Principles for Evaluation:  In evaluating the acceptability of the  availability analysis, the EOS should be guided by two principles.  First, the  contractor's consideration of each of the factors should reflect its actual  recruitment and employment practices.  Second, the contractor's recruitment and  employment practices should demonstrate the con- tractor's compliance with its  affirmative action and non-discrimination obligations.      (c)Professional Judgement:  The audit of the availability analysis for  acceptability is as much an art as a science.  There are no hard-and-fast, ""mechanical""  methods for evaluating the availability analysis.  The EOS must make a  professional judgement as to the adequacy of the contractor's analysis.  This  requires familiarity with the quality and variety of data available, with  industry and contractor personnel practices, and knowledge of available  recruitment sources.      2G04AVAILABILITY ANALYSIS - DEFINING LABOR AREAS    (a)Importance of Labor Area Definition:  Six of the eight fac-tors for  assessing minority or female availability are tied to the contractor's  definition of labor areas.  How the con-tractor defines its immediate labor area  determines the data used for population, workforce, unemployment/seeking work,  and requisite skills within that immediate area.  How the contractor defines its  reasonable recruitment area determines the data used for requisite skills  within that area.  Definition of both these areas, therefore, heavily impacts  the results of the contractor's availability analysis.  A critical first step in  evaluating the contractor's availability analysis is to assess the  acceptability of both immediate labor area and reasonable recruitment area.    (b)Immediate Labor Area:  In evaluating the contractor's determination of  its immediate labor area, the EOS should consider the following:    (1)Definition:  The immediate labor area is that geographic area from which  employees may reasonably commute to the contractor's establishment.  It may  include one or more contiguous cities, counties or Metropolitan Statistical  Areas (MSAs) or parts thereof, in which the establishment is located.  For  example, it may be defined as the major city in or near which the  establishment is located; the county(ies) surrounding the establishment; the  MSA in which the establishment is located or which borders the establishment; or  a combination of any of the three.  (Note, however, that if the contrac-tor  chooses to combine figures from more than one area, it must be prepared to  provide the raw numbers used to produce the final percentage, since the  percentages themselves cannot be added together).  However defined, the  immediate labor area is normally the same for all job groups.    (2)Must Not Underestimate Availability:  In reviewing the contractor's  definition of immediate labor area, the EOS must ensure that the contractor has  not defined that area in a way that underestimates minority or female  availability.  For example, the definition should not exclude a nearby area with  a large minority workforce.      (3)Commuting Patterns:  In assessing the immediate labor area definition,  the EOS needs to consider commuting patterns, including the availability of  public transportation, approximate normal driving times, etc. in the labor area.      (4)Relationship to EEO/AA Obligations:  The immediate labor area definition  should be consistent with the contractor's nondiscrimination and affirmative  action obligations.  For example, if a contractor's workforce is largely  nonminority and it recruits primarily by word of mouth, defining the immediate  labor area based on the source of applicants may reflect its actual re-  cruitment practices, but does not meet the contractor's affirmative action  obligations (and could, in fact, be found to be discriminatory).  Similarly,  defining the immediate labor area based on residence patterns of current,  nonminority employees, whether as of the time of hire or the time of the review,  may also artificially lower availability for minorities.    (5)Need for Further Investigation:  If the EOS disagrees with the  contractor's definition of the immediate labor area because it appears to  artificially lower the  availability of minorities and women, the EOS should  investigate further onsite to determine whether the contractor, in fact, does  recruit from an area with higher minority/female availability and/or whether the  contractor could expand its area to increase the numbers of minority group  persons and women in the per-centage of available workers.  In this evaluation,  the EOS, based on his or her review experience, may consider where other  nearby employees with similar jobs normally obtain workers.    (6)Sources of Data:  As noted earlier, immediate labor area data are  normally used for factors on population, unemployment/seeking work and  workforce.  For these factors, the contractor should use the best data  available.  Resources for this data include the Research Division of each  State's Division of Employment Security (DES).  This DES Division annually  updates data on population, unemployment/seeking work and workforce for its  State and for MSAs and counties within its State (See Appendix 2B for other  information available from DES).  For a discussion of data on requisite skills  in the immediate labor area, and considerations in their use, see Section  2G05(e) below.    (c)Reasonable Recruitment Area:  The definition of the reason-able  recruitment area is very important in assessing the proportion of minorities and  women available for employment.  It influences the number or proportion of  minorities or women who could--at least theoretically--get through the  contractor's door (be hired) if minority group membership and sex were not taken  into consideration in employment decisions.  In assessing how the contractor has  defined reasonable recruitment area, the EOS should consider the following  factors:    (1)Relationship to Immediate Labor Area:  The reasonable recruiting area  represents the area from which the contractor usually seeks or reasonably could  seek workers for a particular job group.  It may coincide with the immediate  labor area, or it may cover a larger area (state, region, or nation).  Thus,  while the immediate labor area is normally the same for all job groups, the  reasonable recruitment area will vary depending on the types of jobs in the job  group.    (2)Pay and Skill Levels:  Generally, the scope of the reasonable recruitment  area is closely related to pay, based on the assumption that the more a job  pays, the farther people are willing to go to apply for it.  Also, because there  is often a relationship between pay levels and skill levels, for job groups  containing jobs with minimal to intermediate skill requirements, the reasonable  recruiting area will often be the same as the immediate labor area.  As pay  levels and skill requirements increase, however, the likelihood that recruiting  will expand beyond the immediate labor area also increases.      (3)Supply and Demand:  In addition to pay and skills, supply and demand  plays a part in defining the scope of the reasonable recruiting area.  For  example, at times when nurses are in short supply, it may be necessary to expand  recruitment efforts beyond the immediate labor area.  At other times, the supply  of nurses available in the immediate labor area exceeds the demand, and may   reduce the reasonable recruiting area.  Supply and demand can also be influenced  by the specificity of skills required by the contractor.  For example, while the  supply of teachers generally may exceed demand, the demand for teachers with  specific skills, such as math     or science, may exceed the supply and result in an expansion of the  recruitment area.  Further, high unemployment in one area may create a labor  surplus which effectively expands the ""reasonable recruitment area""  elsewhere.  For example, when unemployment is high, persons often search for  work in a wider area, becoming more willing to either relocate or to commute  further to a job than they normally would.  As a result, the ""reasonable  recruitment area"" for other areas expands.    (4)Summary:  As a result, while in most instances job groups in the Service  Worker, Laborer, Operative,  Office and Clerical and retail Sales categories  tend to have reasonable recruitment areas which are the same as the immediate  labor area, this will not always be the case.  Jobs in the Crafts and  Technicians categories are often particularly susceptible to supply and demand  factors related to level and specificity of skill required.  Therefore, while  in most instances, such jobs tend to have reasonable recruitment areas which  coin-cide with the immediate labor area, some job groups within the categories  may have a broader recruitment area.  Similarly, while job groups in the Sales  (non-retail), Professional, and Officials and Managers categories usually have  reasonable recruitment areas which are larger than the immediate labor area (and  often significantly larger, e.g. national), this will not always be the case.      (5)Sources of Data:  See Section 2G05(e) below.       2G05  AVAILABILITY ANALYSIS - EIGHT FACTORS    The contractor's AAP must show, for each job group, consideration of each of  the eight factors for minorities and each of the eight factors for women.  All  factors are expressed as the percentage that minorities or women are among all  persons who meet the factor.  These factors are as follows:    (a)The minority population of the labor area surrounding the facility (Refer  to 41 CFR 60-2.11(b)(1)(i)):  The extent to which this factor is given  consideration in determining the final availability factor for a given job group  will depend on whether or not that job group contains entry level posi- tions  which are filled primarily through outside hire and which require minimal or no  prior skills.  Job groups which fall into the Service Worker, Laborer, and to  some extent, Operatives EEO-1 categories will be more likely to incorpor-ate  minority population percentages into the final availability estimate than  would job groups requiring more specialized skills, such as those falling into  the Technician or Professional categories.      (b)The availability of women seeking employment in the labor or recruitment  area of the contractor (Refer to 41 CFR 60-2.11 (b)(2)(v):  The figure used may  be based on the percentage that unemployed women are among all unemployed  persons in the labor area (41 CFR 60-2.11(b)(2)(i)), since that rate includes  only persons actively seeking work; the percentage of women applying for work at  the local unemployment service office in job categories comparable to those in  the contractor's job groups; or the contractor's prior year applicant flow for  women for that job group.  Generally, the highest figure should be used.  As  with  minority population, inclusion of this figure in developing final  availability estimates for a particular job group will depend on whether or not  the job group is entry level, is filled through outside hire, and requires  little or no prior skills or experience.  The less skill required, the more  consideration this factor should receive.    (c)The size of the minority/female unemployment force in the labor area  surrounding the facility (Refer to 41 CFR 60-2.11(b)(1)(ii) and 41 CFR  60-2.11(b)(2)(i)):  The figure used should be the percentage that unemployed  minorities (or women) are among all unemployed persons in the labor area.   Please note that this is not the same as unemployment rate, which is generally  expressed as the percentage of a given group that is unemployed--e.g., the  percentage that unemployed minorities are among all minorities in the  workforce (employed plus unemployed).  As with minority population and women  seeking employment, the size of the minority/female unemployment force should  receive greater consideration where job groups are entry level, filled by  outside hire, and require little or no skill or experience.  The factor will  receive less consideration where job groups are above entry level, require more  skill or are filled solely or primarily through internal placement.    (d)The percentage of the minority/female workforce as compared with the  total workforce in the immediate labor area (Refer to 41 CFR 60-2.11(b)(1)(iii)  and 41 CFR 60-2.11(b)(2)(ii)): The percentage of minorities/females in the  workforce will have greater applicability for those job groups which draw from a  larger recruiting pool (entry level, filled through external hire, and requiring  few or no skills).  For those job groups which draw from a smaller recruiting  pool (those above entry level, with higher skill requirements, and/or filled  solely or primarily through internal placement), this factor is likely to have  less importance.  (Note:  The term workforce is used elsewhere in the  regulations to mean the incumbent employees of the contractor (e.g., workforce  analysis).  However, as used here in the availability analysis, the term  workforce is synonymous with the term ""labor force"" as defined by the  Census Bureau and other government agencies--e.g., as those persons in the  population, aged 16 and older who are either employed or unemployed (unemployed  is further defined as actively seeking employment).    (e)Requisite Skills:    oThe general availability of minorities/women having requisite skills in the  immediate labor area (Refer to 41 CFR 60-2.11(b)(1)(iv) and 41 CFR 60-2.11(b)(2)  (iii));      oThe availability of minorities/women having requisite skills in an area in  which the contractor can reasonably recruit (Refer to 41 CFR 60-2.11(b)(1)(v)  and 41 CFR 60-2.11(b)(2)(iv));    In assessing these factors, contractors should use the best data available.   While the most recent decennial census data normally provide the most detailed  information on requisite skills, they become increasingly outdated the more  years it has been since the census was conducted.  Also, the decennial census shows only persons employed in a given occupa tion at the time the census was conducted, rather than those with the skills  to be employed in that occupation.  Therefore, the following adjustments to decennial census data are normally needed:    (1)Adjustment for Time Since the Last Decennial Census: Some State Divisions  of Employment Security continue to publish periodic updates of decennial census  data on occupations of persons employed in labor areas within their State.   While these updates are often for fairly broad job categories, they provide a  reliable means of update for job categories where skills are normally  not very  specialized (i.e. service workers, laborers, operatives, entry-level clerical,  retail sales), and at least an indication of overall trends in job categories  where skills often are specialized (see Section 2G05(e) (4) below).   Additionally, for job groups which do have legitimate specialized education  requirements, any available data on the percentage of minority and/or female  graduates at the level (Associates, Bachelor's, etc.) and in the field involved  may be used to update census data.  Since, in many fields, minority and female  enrollment has risen since the last decennial census, these data are often  considerably more accurate than the census as a measure of requisite skills for:   (1) entry-level jobs which legitimately require a particular level and type of  post-high school degree; and (2) such jobs above entry (i.e. with legitimate  experience as well as degree requirements), if the data are corrected for the  year of degree.      (2)Adjustment for Employment vs. Requisite Skills:  The adjustment discussed  immediately above for recent graduates also provides some correction for the  census' focus on persons employed in a given occupation when the census was  conducted.  Additionally, however, care must be taken to ensure that such census  data do not, in effect, perpetuate past discrimination against mi- norities or  women in certain occupations and/or out-dated ""job applied for""  patterns.  This is particularly important for jobs in which, in terms of basic  skill requirements, the availability of minorities and/or women has long been  considerably better than their representation--for example, some management,  professional and sales training programs in which the major legitimate  requirement is a college degree.  Similarly, in entry-level blue collar jobs  where the contractor provides training--and the major skill requirement,  therefore, is ""trainability""-- past employment patterns may simply  reflect who employers in the area choose to train rather than true availability  (which in this situation should normally approximate labor area workforce  representation).      (3)Match Between Data and Skills:  The particular requisite skills  classification(s) from which the data are obtained should closely approximate  the skills required for performance in the job group.  The closeness of the  match between data and skills will depend on how much job content varies within  the job group and the degree of detail in the source data for requisite skills.      (i)Varied Job Content:  Where job content is quite varied (i.e. a Scientist  I job group composed of Chemists and Physicists), the contractor may either  refine the job group further, where appropriate, or combine requisite skills  data for the two or more types of jobs in the group.  Where the data are  combined, the contractor should have available the raw numbers from which the  average percentage was derived.    (ii)Degree of Detail in Data:  The most refined data available are usually  those contained in the most recent decennial census.  Detailed census data are  available from, among other sources, the National Technical Information Service  (NTIS) of the U.S. Department of Commerce (see Appendix 2B).  The NTIS's Report  #5, ""Equal Employment Indicators,"" contains decennial census  information on the employment of minorities and women in 503 job  classifications.  Data from other sources may be considerably broader.  For  example, State Divisions of Employment Security that continue to update  occupational data usually do so for a limited number of job categories, similar  to but not the same as EEO categories.  In the case of either very broad or very  refined data, some adjustment may be needed to approximate requisite skills for  a particular job group.      (4)Adjustment for Broad Data:  Data based on broad job categories (e.g. ""Professionals"")  may either overstate or understate availability.  For example, if the job group  consists of engineering titles, using data for ""all Professionals""  (which includes primary and secondary school teachers) will usually overstate  minority and female availability.  On the other hand, if the job group is  nurses, data on ""all Professionals"" will substantially understate  female availability.  Thus, while the contractor may make adjustment for broad  data, the EOS should evaluate the direction and degree of adjustment made given  the job group involved.    (5)Adjustment for Narrow Data:  Where data based on narrow job categories  are used, they may sometimes show no minorities or women for particular job  titles (either because there were none at the time the census was taken, or  because the actual number was so low as to cause the number to be ""suppressed.""    Where this occurs, contractors should be encouraged to broaden the area of  consideration to include other, related categories, which do show minorities  and/or women.     (f)The availability of promotable and transferable minority/fe-male  employees within the contractor's organization (Refer to 41 CFR  60-2.11(b)(1)(vi) and 41 CFR 60-2.11(b)(2)(vi)).    This is the percentage of minorities/women who are in feeder job groups and  who are (at the start of the AAP year) or who will become (during the AAP year)  promotable or transferra-ble from those job groups into the job group under  consideration.    In evaluating this factor for acceptability:     (1) Determine the Accuracy of Feeder Job Groups:  The EOS should identify  the feeder job groups, if any, from which individuals are, or reasonably could  be, promoted or transferred to the job group under consideration.    oThe EOS can determine actual feeder job groups by examining where persons  who were promoted or transferred into the job group under consideration came  from.  This may be done by identifying the  previous job group of persons who  entered the  target job group during the last AAP year and/or--where that  activity has been too limited to be representative--through examination of the  work histories of persons in the target job group to determine their immediately  preceding job group.  Feeder groups may also be identified through review of  labor agreements and/or written promotion/transfer policies.     oThe EOS, however, should be observant of any indications that the skills  brought by promotees/    transferees to the target job group are similarly available in other  potential feeder groups, particularly if those other potential feeder groups  have substantially better representation of minor-ities or women.  Where this is  the case, the contractor should broaden its feeder group defini-tion,  consistent with its affirmative action obligations.    (2)Percentage of Minorities/Women:  The contractor may  conclude that the  percentage of promotable minorities/ women in the feeder job groups is  approximately equivalent to their representation in those groups.  Where,  however, there are legitimate seniority or special qualification requirements  for promotion/transfer to the target job group, the contractor may identify  those persons who are or will become qualified during the AAP year and the  percentage that minorities/women represent among those persons (for a discussion  of ""legitimate"" qualification requirements, see Chapters 3 and 7).   Where the contractor identifies specific promotable/ transferable persons, this  can be verified by identifying the legitimate criteria used in determining who  is promotable or transferrable, and by reviewing the employment histories of  persons in the feeder job groups.      (3)Relevance of Factor:  The importance of this factor will be related to  whether the contractor normally fills jobs in the target job group by promotion  from within or by hire.  Review of employment activity for the prior AAP year  will show the proportion of placements which resulted from internal movement as  opposed to new hire.  Where this activity has been too limited to be  representative, the work histories of persons in the target group may be  reviewed to determine the proportion who came via promotion or transfer vs. by  new hire.  In addition, labor agreements often contain rules governing promotion  and transfer for jobs in certain sectors of the workforce.    (g)The existence of training institutions capable of training persons in the  requisite skills (Refer to 41 CFR 60-2.11(b) (1)(vii)and 41 CFR  60-2.11(b)(2)(vii)):  This may be the percentage of minorities and women  enrolled in those educational and training institutions serving the  contractor's recruitment needs.      (1)Sources of Data:  Contractors should contact those educational and  training institutions with programs which match their employment needs.  These  can range from local high schools with business or vocational programs through  local technical schools to colleges nationwide.  Such institutions should be  able to provide data on the number and percentage of minorities and women  enrolled in programs appropriate to the contractor's employment needs.     (2)Relevance of Factor:  The extent to which the contrac- tor considers this  factor will depend on the degree to which new graduates of such programs are or  can be utilized in making placements to a particular job group.  For example, a  contractor filling positions in an entry-level clerical job group may hire new  graduates from local high schools and business colleges, but may hire only  experienced persons for a non-entry level clerical job group.     (h)The degree of training which the contractor is reasonably able to  undertake as a means of making all job classes available to minorities/women  (Refer to 41 CFR 60-2.11(b) (1)(viii) and 41 CFR 60-2.11(b)(2)(viii)):  This  factor requires the contractor to make an assessment of the number of employees  who could, with appropriate training, become promotable or transferrable during  the AAP year, and to determine what percentage minorities/women constitute of  that number.     (i)Data Used Must Be Accurate:  Data used for each availability factor must  be accurate and up-to-date.  Sources of data must be identified in the AAP.    (j)Consideration of Each Factor:  The contractor must consider each factor  and must explain in its AAP how it has done so. It may not be necessary,  however, for the contractor to make each factor a part of any final availability  estimate.  Only those factors which are relevant to the actual availability of  the job group under evaluation need be used.  Moreover, contractors may give  differential consideration (e.g., by mathematical weighting or by other means)  to some or all of the individual factors in determining final availability     estimates for each job group.  Where a contractor gives such differential  consideration to factors, the AAP should specifically identify the weights  applied or other methods used.  If the AAP contains no explanation of how the  contractor has considered each factor, or if an explanation is provided but  further investigation and verification is needed  (e.g., if the AAP states that  certain job groups are filled solely by internal means, and this cannot be  verified from the AAP), the EOS should plan to address the matter onsite.    (k)Summary Guidelines For Audit of Acceptability:  In summary, in evaluating  a contractor's final availability estimates for acceptability, the following  general guidelines can be used:    (1)Entry Level Jobs, No Special Skills/Experience:  For entry level jobs  which do not require any special skills or experience, availability for  minorities and women should be close to their workforce participation rates;      (2)Entry Level Jobs, Some Skills/Experience:  For entry level jobs which  require some skills (education and/or experience), availability for minorities  and women should be at least equal to the requisite skills figure for either the  reasonable recruiting area or immediate recruiting area, whichever figure is  larger;    (3)Jobs Filled Through Internal Means Only:  For jobs which are filled  solely through internal means, availability should normally be at least equal to  the percentage which minorities and women represent in all appropriate feeder  job groups.      2G06IDENTIFICATION OF UNDERUTILIZATION    The regulations at 41 CFR 60-2.11(b) define underutilization as ""...having  fewer minorities or women in a particular job group than would reasonably be  expected by their availability.""  Contractors are required in the AAP to  compare availability to incumbency for each job group, and to identify those job  groups which are underutilized.  In evaluating the acceptability of the method  used by a contractor to determine underutilization, EOSs must ensure that the  method used conforms to the requirements of the regulations, that it is  appropriate, and that it has been accurately applied.    2G07GOALS    Having identified a job group as underutilized for minorities and/or women,  the contractor must establish employment goals and exert every good faith effort  toward meeting them.  Such goals must be established separately for minorities  and women.  In setting goals, the contractor should consider:     (a)Level of Goals:  Goals for an underutilized job group must be at least  equal to the percentage availability of minorities or women (as appropriate)  for the job group, as determined by a properly developed utilization analysis  which considers at least those factors discussed in section 2G05 above (see 41  CFR 60-2.11(b)).    (b)Goals Are not Quotas:  41 CFR 60-2.12(e) indicates that goals "". . .  may not be rigid and inflexible quotas which must be met, but must be targets  reasonable attainable by means of applying every good faith effort to make all  aspects of the entire affirmative action program work.""    (c)Separate Goals by Particular Minority Group:  Where appropriate,  separate goals may also be required by particular minority group(s) or by sex  within a particular minority group if there is a substantial disparity in the  utilization of a particular minority group or of men or women of a particular  minority group.  Where the EOS identifies such a substantial disparity (see  Section 2K01(d) and the instructions for SCRR page 7) and the contractor has  not estab-lished a separate goal, the EOS will first determine if the disparity  represents potential discrimination.  If potential discrimination is not found,  separate affirmative action goals to eliminate the disparity may be required  (see 41 CFR 60-2.12(l)).  In order to ensure that such goals are reasonable,  they should be based on a separate availability analysis for the minority group  (or men or women of the minority group) involved in the job group(s) where the  disparity is observed.      2G08ADOPTING AN EEO POLICY    41 CFR 60-2.13(a) requires that a contractor commit itself, in writing, to a  policy of equal employment opportunity in all personnel actions.  The policy  statement must be in the AAP.  It should be signed by the top establishment  official and dated.  It must be reaffirmed annually.  41 CFR 60-2.20 provides  guidance for evaluating the content of the contractor's EEO policy statement.      2G09DISSEMINATION OF THE POLICY    41 CFR 60-2.13(b) requires that the AAP provide for formal inter-nal and  external dissemination of the contractor's policy.  To be acceptable, the AAP  must address how the policy is disseminated, internally and externally.  41 CFR  60-2.21 provides guidance for evaluating dissemination of the policy.  For  example, the AAP may state that the policy is posted in conspicuous places  accessible to employees and applicants for employment, and that the policy is  discussed with management employees having responsibility for making employment  decisions.  External dissemination may include notifying recruitment sources,  community organizations, subcontractors and labor unions, where applicable, of  its policy on equal employment opportunity and affirmative action.     2G10RESPONSIBILITY FOR IMPLEMENTATION    Under 41 CFR 60-2.13(c), contractors are required to provide for the  implementation of the AAP.  To be acceptable, the AAP must identify the person  who is responsible for implementation of the policy and must describe how the  policy is implemented, in sufficient detail for the EOS to be able to audit  compliance.  Guidance as to the types of actions a contractor may take to  implement this requirement is provided at 41 CFR 60-2.22.  For example, an EEO  officer is central to the success of the affirm-ative action program, since he  or she is responsible for ensuring that the contractor takes steps to implement  the AAP.  The AAP should identify the EEO Officer by name and/or title, and may  describe his or her duties and responsibilities as well as those of line  managers with respect to EEO.      2G11IDENTIFICATION OF PROBLEM AREAS    41 CFR 60-2.13(d) requires that problem areas (or deficiencies) be  identified by organizational unit and by job group.  41 CFR 60-2.23 provides  additional guidance on some types of self-analyses which contractors may conduct  in identifying problem areas.  To be acceptable, the AAP must provide evidence  that the contractor has addressed the following:    (a)Employment Processes:  The contractor must examine its basic employment  processes (recruitment, hiring, training, promotion, transfer, termination) to identify any impediments to the full utilization of minorities and women.  To do so, in its AAP, the contractor may  use any analysis that measures how these processes affect minorities and women.   For example, the contractor may use Impact Ratio Analyses (NOTE:  Please also  see Sections 2H01(a) and 2O04 of this Chapter for the contractor's obligations  under 41 CFR Part 60-3 to maintain employment activity data and analyze them for  adverse impact.  While not a required AAP ingredient, the    contractor may choose to use this analysis as a tool for problem  identification in this section of its AAP).    (b)Organizational Unit:  The contractor must examine the distribution of  minorities and women among its organization-al units.  To do so, the contractor  may use any analysis that identifies any problem areas in such distribution, for  example, the contractor may use a Job Area Acceptance Range (JAAR) type analysis  to identify areas of minority or female concentration/underrepresentation)  and/or a utilization analysis applied to job groups within such units.    2G12ESTABLISHMENT OF GOALS AND OBJECTIVES - GOALS BY ORGANIZATIONAL UNIT       41 CFR 60-2.13(e) requires that goals and objectives by organ-izational unit  as well as job group be established to correct identifiable deficiencies.  Goals  by organizational unit, however, refer to action-oriented efforts rather than  percentage goals.  Where problem areas by organizational unit have been  identified in accordance with 41 CFR 60-2.13(d), the AAP must include a  description of the efforts which the contractor has taken or will take to  correct those problem areas. This correc-tive action may be addressed in the AAP  section on Development of Action-Orientated Programs (below), and may include  goals for the improvement of recruitment efforts, dissemination of additional  information on job openings (e.g., pay, opportunities, duties), encouraging  transfers and promotions, creating training opportunities, etc.      2G13DEVELOPMENT AND EXECUTION OF ACTION-ORIENTED PROGRAMS    41 CFR 60-2.13(f) requires the development and execution of action-oriented  programs to correct identified problem areas and to attain established goals and  objectives.  41 CFR 60-2.24 provides suggested standards which the EOS can use  to assess the contractor's compliance with this requirement.  For example, the  contractor may commit to increasing the number of qualified minorities and women  in the appropriate candidate pool, since with more women and minorities in the  candidate pool, the logical outcome, absent discrimination, is an increase in  the number of minorities and women hired, promoted, etc.     (a)Contractor Responsibility:  It is the contractor's responsibility to both  develop and execute action-oriented programs.  However, it is the EOS'  responsibility to make a professional judgement as to:    (1)Specificity:  Whether the action-oriented programs are sufficiently  specific and result-oriented to accomplish the aims for which they were created;  and     (2)Execution:  Whether the action-oriented programs were properly executed.      (b)Specific Action-Oriented Programs:  A specific action-oriented program is  one that indicates what the action is, who will accomplish it, how it will be  accomplished and when it will be accomplished.  An action-oriented program  without any one of these ingredients cannot be considered specific.  Action-oriented programs designed to increase candidate pools can be developed  in two stages, (1) steps to be taken immediately to develop internal pools and  to establish a link with potential external pools; and (2) steps to be taken  each time a vacancy occurs in an underutilized area.    (c)Results-Oriented Programs:  A results-oriented action program is one  tailored in such a way that proper execution will result either in an increase  in the minority group/female representation in the job group, if vacancies occur, or clear  documentation of contractor action sufficient to constitute good faith effort.   An action-oriented program that does not meet this standard cannot be considered  results-oriented.    (d)Acceptability of Action Items:  The AAP's action items must be  sufficient, if implemented in good faith, to ensure that each of its specific  objectives and the overall intent of equal employment opportunity are achieved.      2G14INTERNAL AUDIT AND REPORTING    41 CFR 60-2.13(g) requires the contractor to design and implement internal  audit and reporting systems which measure the effectiveness of its total  affirmative action program.  This system must be detailed in its AAP.  The  system must permit adequate monitoring of progress made toward goal  accomplishment and implementation of other affirmative action commitments.    (a)Guidelines for Assessing Acceptability:  The regulations at 41 CFR  60-2.25 provide guidance for assessing the acceptability of a contractor's  internal audit and reporting system.  An acceptable audit and reporting system  is one which allows the contractor to measure the effectiveness of its total  program.  Such a system should include specific procedures for monitoring goals  progress and analyzing employment activity.    (b)Monitoring Goals Progress:  Since utilization and availability analyses  are conducted by job group, and where problems are identified, goals are  established by job group, monitoring of goals progress should be at least by  job group.  The importance of effective internal audit and reporting systems in  goal areas is further underscored by 41 CFR 60-1.40(c), which requires that the  results of the AAP shall be compiled annually (see Section 2H00 below).      (c)Monitoring Personnel Activity:  Audit and reporting systems should also  monitor personnel activity (e.g., hires, promotions/transfers, terminations, and other activity) at least by job group and, where appropriate, by organizational unit.  The regulations at 41 CFR  60-1.40(b) require that a contractor's analysis include hiring practices,  upgrading, transfer and promotion for the past year.    (d)Information to be Maintained:  The regulations at 41 CFR 60-3.4 and  60-3.15A require that contractors with 100 or more employees: (1) maintain and  have available for each job, records sufficient to disclose the impact of the  selection process for that job on women and on each minority group for whom  EEO-1 reporting is required; and (2) conduct adverse impact analyses for women  and for each minority group that constitutes 2% or more of the relevant labor  area or of the  applicable internal workforce.  Where a contractor deter-    mines that a selection process has an adverse impact, evi-dence of validity,  as described in 41 CFR Part 60-3 must also be maintained and made available.   Contractors with fewer than 100 employees must maintain the records set forth in  41 CFR 60-3.15A(1)--e.g. the number of applicants and persons hired, promoted  and terminated by sex and by each minority group (as defined in (d)(1) above)  which consti-    tutes 2% or more of the labor force in the relevant labor area.  Such small  employers, however, are not required to conduct adverse impact analyses of these  data.  See further discussion under Sections 2H01(a) and 2O04 below and in  Questions and Answers Nos. 82-88 of Adoption of Questions and Answers to Clarify  and Provide a Common Interpretation of the Uniform Guidelines on Employee  Selection Procedures.      2G15SEX DISCRIMINATION GUIDELINES    The regulations at 41 CFR 60-2.13(h) require that the AAP contain evidence  of the contractor's compliance with the Sex Discrimina-    tion Guidelines at 41 CFR Part 60-20.  The requirements of the Executive  Order are deemed to preempt any State or local laws restricting the employment  of women.  See 41 CFR 60-2.31 and 41 CFR 60-20.3(f).      To be acceptable, the AAP must address each of the required subitems listed  in the regulations; specifically 41 CFR 60-20.2 through 60-20.6.  The contractor  should delineate in the AAP how each subitem is being implemented.  These  subitems include, but are not limited to:     (a)Conditions of Employment (Refer to 41 CFR 60-20.3, 60-20.4, 60-20.5 and  60-20.6):  A contractor must not make a distinc-tion based on sex in conditions  of employment.  Where State laws provide special minimum wages, overtime pay, or  brief rest periods for women, these benefits must also be given to men.  In  addition, contractors may not use these laws as bases for refusing to hire women  or for limiting their hours of work, etc.  AAPs must provide for the elimination  of any policies, procedures, or working conditions inconsistent with the  requirement of equal treatment.      (b)Distinctions Based on Marital Status (Refer to 41 CFR 60-20.3(d)):  Any  distinction between married and unmarried persons must apply equally to both  sexes.  For example, a contractor cannot refuse to hire women with young  children unless it applies the same exclusionary policy to men.      (c)Bona Fide Occupational Qualification (BFOQ) (Refer to 41 CFR 60-20.3(b)):   A contractor must consider women as well as men for all jobs, unless sex is a  bona fide occupational qualification (BFOQ).  Under Title VII, sex has been  found to be a BFOQ for a job only in extremely rare instances.  Among these have  been:    (1)Authenticity:  Jobs involving a need for authenticity or genuineness,  such as actors or models.    (2)Personal Privacy:  Jobs where the performance of essen-tial job elements  would entail substantial invasion of personal privacy (for example, a permanent  restroom attendant).  This is limited to situations where the normal operation  of the contractor's business depends on the employee being of the same sex as  its employees or customers and there is no other way that privacy could be  ensured.  IMPORTANT:  This is different from customer preference.  For example,  a contractor cannot refuse to hire female salespersons in the belief that they  will not be as well accepted by customers as males.     (d)Employment Opportunities (Refer to 41 CFR 60-20.3(b), 3(c) and 5(b):    (1)Hazardous Jobs:  A contractor may not exclude women from a job it may  believe is dangerous or unsuitable for women to perform unless sex is a BFOQ  (see Section 2G15(c) above).    (2)Reproductive Hazards:  OFCCP follows Title VII prin-ciples when  determining whether a policy excluding     women from a job because of a concern about reproduc-tive hazards is  discriminatory.  If a question relat-ing to reproductive hazards arises during a  compliance review, the EOS should consult, through appropriate channels, with  the Regional Solicitor's Office.    (e)Wage Discrimination (Refer to 41 CFR 60-20.3(c) and 41 CFR 60-20.5(a)and  (b)):  A contractor must compensate employees without regard to sex.  The most  obvious form of wage discrimination occurs when men and women are paid different   wages for performing the same jobs, or jobs which are substantially equal.       (f)Employment Advertising (Refer to 41 CFR 60-20.2(b)):  A con-tractor's  advertisements in newspapers or other media must not express a sex preference  unless the job is one for which sex is a BFOQ (see Section 2G15(c) above).  The  placement of ads in columns headed ""male"" or ""female"" (or ""male  interest"" or ""female interest"") or which otherwise indicate an  orien-tation with regard to sex is considered an expression of preference,  limitation, or specification based on sex and is prohibited.    (g)Employee Benefits:  Refer to discussion of this issue in Chapter 3.     (h)Maternity Leave:  Refer to discussion of this issue in Chapter 3.    2G16SUPPORT OF COMMUNITY ACTION PROGRAMS    The AAP must address the contractor's active support of local and national  community action programs and community service programs which are designed to  improve the employment opportunities of mi-norities and women, as required by 41  CFR 60-2.13(i).  The regu- lations at 41 CFR 60-2.26 provide guidance on the  types of activ-ities which demonstrate active support of local and national  com-munity action and community service programs.  Among these are the  appointment of key members of management to serve on the boards of such  organizations, and active participation in pro- grams for youth sponsored by the  National Alliance of Business-men.  To be acceptable, the AAP should identify  the programs supported, and indicate the type of support (i.e., personnel,  equipment, etc.) given to local and national programs designed to improve  employment opportunities for minorities and women.  The EOS should be familiar  with the types of programs available, both locally and nationally.  The types of  programs, and the degree of support provided, should be consistent with the  nature of the problems identified in the AAP, and may form a component part of  the contractor's organizational goals and development of action programs.    2G17CONSIDERATION OF MINORITIES AND WOMEN NOT CURRENTLY IN THE WORKFORCE      The regulations at 41 CFR 60-2.13(j) require that the AAP address the  contractor's consideration of minorities and women not cur- rently in the  workforce having requisite skills who can be re- cruited through affirmative  action measures.  To be acceptable, the AAP should specify the contractor's  involvement with programs which facilitate the employment of minorities and  women.  Pro- grams offered by the contractor could include providing part-time  employment, flexible hours (flexitime) or dependent care bene-fits, as well as  participating in high school or college co-op programs, particularly with  educational institutions with signi-ficant minority and/or female enrollments.       2HREVIEW OF EXECUTIVE ORDER SUPPORT DATA FOR ACCEPTABILITY    2H00REPORT ON GOALS    41 CFR 60-1.40(c) requires that the contractor prepare a report of results  of its prior year AAP.  This report is part of the support data for the AAP, and  is requested on the itemized list-ing enclosed with the Scheduling Letter  (Figure 2-2a, paragraph f).  The listing requests summary data and information  indicating the numerical and other results of affirmative action goals for each  job group for the current year and for the preceding year.  For each goal not  attained (prior year) or not being attained (current year), the contractor is  requested to describe its good faith efforts.  Prior year data should always be  submitted, unless the contractor was not previously covered by 41 CFR     Part 60-2; current year data should be provided at least where the  contractor is six months or more into its current AAP year at the time it  receives the Scheduling Letter.      (a)Data Required:  As noted above, the contractor must provide summary data  indicating the numerical results of affirmative action goals for each job group.       (1)Information on Job Groups with Goals:  To measure results of goals, one  must first know for which job groups goals were established and what those goals  were.  The contractor's current AAP submitted for desk audit will show this  information for current year goals.  Where the contractor's report on prior year  goals does not specifically state what the prior year goals were, the EOS will  contact the contractor and request that a copy of the goals section of its prior  year AAP be forwarded to permit evaluation of prior year goals progress.    (2)Information on Placements into Job Groups with Goals: Since an annual  goal is established in terms of a per- centage placement rate, evaluating  progress towards it requires knowledge of the total number of placements into  the job group and the number of minority or female placements, as appropriate.   If the contractor's prog-ress report does not give this information or gives it  only in part (i.e., the number of minority/female but not total placements,  etc.), the EOS will determine if the information can be extracted from the  contractor's submission of personnel activity data.  If it cannot be so  extracted, the EOS will contact the contractor and ask that it forward a copy of  reports on goals progress prepared under its internal audit and reporting  systems (41 CFR 60-2.13(g)) and/or, if the contractor employs 100 or more  persons, a copy of the underlying data it used for its adverse impact  determinations on hires, promotions and any other placements into job titles  within the job group (see Section 2H01(a)(2) below).      (b)Good Faith Effort:  Where the contractor's report does not describe its  good faith efforts in a job group where a goal was established but not attained,  or does not describe those efforts in sufficient detail for the EOS to evaluate  their adequacy, the EOS will include the job group as part of the onsite plan  for evaluation of good faith effort (SCRR page     11).    2H01 PERSONNEL ACTIVITY DATA    The itemized listing enclosed with the Scheduling Letter requests  information on personnel activities (e.g., selection--applicant flow and hiring,  promotion and transfer, and terminations) for the prior and current ""goal""  (AAP) years.  The listing requests that the data be provided by race (meaning by  each minority group for whom EEO-1 reporting is required) and sex for each job  group, but permits a contractor to submit the information ""...in the form  in which it is available.""     (a)When Data Are Not Submitted:  If, in response to the Scheduling Letter,  the contractor does not submit any personnel activity data, or does not submit  data for one or more of the activity elements of applicants, hires, promotions  or terminations, a Show Cause Notice should be issued.    (1)If a Show Cause Notice is being issued at desk audit for other reasons  (e.g., see Sections 2C01 and 2F), the failure to submit the activity data will  be included in that Notice.    (2)If the only reason a Show Cause Notice is being issued is failure to  submit the activity data, see Chapter 8, Figure 8-3.    Revised 5-25-90    (b) Regulatory Citations:    (1)General Data Requirements under the Uniform Guidelines on Employee  Selection Procedures (41 CFR Part 60-3):    41 CFR 60-3.4(A) requires that each contractor "". . . maintain and have  available for inspection records or other information which will disclose the  impact which its . . . selection procedures have upon the employment  opportunities of persons by identifiable race, sex, or ethnic groups. . .""   Such identifiable groups are defined by 41 CFR 60-3.4(B) as those groups for  whom     EEO-1 reporting is required--i.e., Blacks, Hispanics, Asian/Pacific  Islanders, American Indians/Alaskan Natives--along with Whites and totals.    (2)Data Requirements under 41 CFR Part 60-3 for Contractors with 100 or More  Employees*:  Contractors with 100 or more employees are more specifically  required by 41 CFR 60-3.15A(2) to maintain and have available records for each  job on applicants, hires, promotions and terminations (and any other selection  decisions) by sex and by each minority group for whom EEO-1 reporting is  required (also see Sections 2G14(d) and 2O04(a)).     (3)41 CFR Part 60-2 Requirements:  In addition to the basic record keeping  requirements in 41 CFR 60-3.4 and 60-3.15, the requirements discussed earlier in  this Chapter that the AAP identify problem areas (41 CFR    60-2.13(d)) and include internal audit and reporting systems (41 CFR  60-2.13(g)) may be cited because they cannot be acceptably implemented without  maintenance and analysis of the basic data on employment activity required by 41  CFR 60-3.4 and 60-3.15.  Failure to submit specific types of employment activity  may be cited as follows:    (a)Applicant Flow and Hires:  41 CFR 60-2.12(m) requires that the AAP  contain, as part of the supporting data, applicant flow data and applicant  rejection ratios (hiring IRAs) indicating minority and sex status. Such  applicant rejection ratios cannot be computed without data on hires by minority  group and sex.  Also, 41 CFR 60-1.40(b)(2) requires that the AAP contain an  analysis of hiring practices for the past year (including recruitment sources  and testing).    __________    *Simplified record keeping requirements for employers of under 100 persons  are described at 41 CFR 60-3.15A(1), and summarized in 2G14(d).  They are not  reiterated here because OFCCP only occasionally reviews supply and service  contractors with under 100 employees.    Revised 5-25-90    (b)Promotions (Transfers, Upgrading Generally):  41 CFR 60-1.40(b)(3)  requires that the AAP include an analysis of upgrading, transfer, and promotion  for the past year.    (c) Review of Data Submitted for Acceptability    (1)Data Format:  To be acceptable for desk audit, the data must be presented  either by job group (as requested in the Scheduling Letter) or by job title (as  required by 41 CFR Part 60-3; see Section 2H01(b)(1) and (2)     above.  If data are submitted in some larger aggrega-tion than job group,  see Section 2H01(d) below.  For example, data by total workforce are not  acceptable, nor are data by EEO category, unless a category legit-imately  constitutes a job group at the particular establishment (see Section 2G02).    (2)Information to be Included:  For each job group or job title, support  data in each major area (applicant flow, hires, promotions and terminations)  must include at least:  the total number of actions, the total number of actions  for women, and the total number of actions for each minority group (as specified  in 2H01(a)(1) above).  For example, applicant flow for a job group or job must  include at least total applicants, total female applicants and total applicants  of each minority group; hires for a job group or job title must include at least  total hires, total female hires and total hires of each minority group, etc.      (3)Period To Be Covered:  Generally, the longer the period covered the  better, because the data are more likely to reflect the contractor's usual way  of operating.  At minimum, however, the data must cover the prior AAP year and,  if the contractor is six months or more into its current AAP year when it  receives the Scheduling Letter, the data must also at least cover the first six  months of the current AAP year.    (d)Action When Data Are Unacceptable:  If employment activity data are  submitted, but are not acceptable (are, as noted immediately above, in  aggregations larger than job group; are not provided by sex and/or by each  minority group, etc.), the EOS should call the contractor and request that the  appropriate changes be made and the data resubmitted within 10 calendar days.   If, at the end of 10 calendar days, the data have not been received in a form  that is acceptable, a Show Cause Notice should be issued which itemizes the  regulatory sections with which the contractor has been found in violation. (see  Section 2H01(b)(1) and (2) and Figure 8-4).    Revised 5-25-90    2IREVIEW OF SECTION 503 AND 38 U.S.C. 4212 AAP(S) FOR ACCEPTABILITY    2I00GENERAL    As with an Executive Order AAP, the determination of the accept-ability of  items listed on page 4 of the SCRR for Section 503 and 38 U.S.C. 4212 AAPs is  limited to the evaluation which can be conducted at desk audit.  This is  different from an evaluation of the contractor's implementation of these items  which normally is done onsite (see Chapter 3).  Additionally, the Section 503  and 38 U.S.C. 4212 regulations require a number of contractor actions that,  while they need not be addressed in the AAP (although most contractors choose to  do so) must be carried out.  These addi-tional requirements are covered on SCRR  page 13, which is nor-mally completed onsite.     2I01ITEMS TO BE INCLUDED    The regulations at 41 CFR 60-741.5(a) require that a Section 503 AAP set  forth the contractor's policies, practices, and proce-dures in accordance with  41 CFR 60-741.6.  To be acceptable, a contractor's Section 503 AAP must address  at least those items listed in 41 CFR 60-741.6(a) through (f).  Similarly, the  regula-tions at 41 CFR 60-250.5(a) require that a 38 U.S.C. 4212 AAP set forth  the contractor's policies, practices and procedures in accordance with 41 CFR  60-250.6.  Therefore, to be acceptable, a contractor's 38 U.S.C. 4212 AAP must  address at least those items listed in 41 CFR 60-250.6(a) through (f).  Since  these items--(a) through (f)--are similar in both regulations, they are  discussed together below (where there are differences, it is pointed out).     2I02POLICY STATEMENT (Refer to 41 CFR 60-250.4(a) and 250.6(a) and 41 CFR  60-741.4(a) and 741.6(a).)    Contractors are required to take affirmative action to employ and advance in  employment qualified special disabled veterans, veterans of the Vietnam era,  and individuals with disabilities.  The con-tractor must affirm its commitment  to this affirmative action re-quirement by incorporating it in a policy  statement included in its AAP(s).      2I03REVIEW OF PERSONNEL POLICIES FOR PROPER CONSIDERATION OF QUALIFICATIONS  (Refer to 41 CFR 60-250.6(b) and 41 CFR 60-741.6(b).)    To be acceptable, the AAP(s) must affirm that the contractor has reviewed  its personnel processes to determine whether its present procedures ensure  careful, thorough, and systematic consideration of the job qualifications of  known individuals with disabilities, special disabled veterans, and Vietnam era  veterans who are applicants for job vacancies filled by employment or promotion,  and for all training opportunities offered or available.      (a)Use of Appendices B and C:  The procedures described at 41 CFR Part  60-250, Appendix B and/or 41 CFR Part 60-741, Ap- pendix C may be utilized in  fulfillment of this requirement.  Those procedures describe how the applications  or personnel forms of covered veterans and persons with disabilities may be  annotated regarding consideration for employment opportunities.     (b)Additional Requirement Under 41 CFR Part 60-250:  41 CFR 60-250.6(b) also  requires the contractor to limit its consider-ation of a covered veteran's  military record to only the portion of that record which is relevant to the  specific job qualifications for which the veteran is being considered.  This  should be affirmed in the AAP.    (c)Adequacy of Present Procedures:  If the contractor asserts that its  present procedures are adequate, this is acceptable if the EOS' investigation  shows that individuals with disabilities and covered veterans are afforded  hire, promotion and training opportunities.      2I04PHYSICAL AND MENTAL QUALIFICATIONS (Refer to 41 CFR 60-250.6(c)(1) and  41 CFR 60-741.6(c)(1).)    The AAP must contain the contractor's schedule for the review of all  physical and mental job qualification requirements.    (a)Scheduled Review:  To be acceptable, the AAP must either affirm that the  review of physical and mental job qualifications requirements has been completed, or provide a specific time schedule by which jobs are to be reviewed.  Where the AAP indicates that the review has  been completed, the contractor is not required to review those physical and  mental job qualification requirements again unless there is a change in working  conditions.  The AAP should state, however, that where there is such a change  in working conditions--for example, through increased automation--the re-  quirements will be reevaluated.    (b)Job-Relatedness of Physical and Mental Qualifications:  The AAP must  affirm that physical or mental job qualification requirements, to the extent  that such requirements tend to screen out qualified individuals with  disabilities or qualified special disabled veterans, shall be related to the  specific jobs for which such individuals are being considered, and shall be  consistent with business necessity and the safe performance of the job (refer to  41 CFR 60-250.6(c)(2) and 41 CFR 60-741.6(c)(2)).    (c)Confidentiality of Information:  To be acceptable, the AAP must affirm  that whenever the contractor inquires into an applicant or employee's physical  or mental condition or conducts a medical examination prior to employment or  change in employment status, information obtained as a result will be kept  confidential, except as otherwise provided for in the regulations (see 41 CFR  60-250.6(c)(3) and 41 CFR 60-741.6(c)(3)).      2I05REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION TO PHYSICAL AND MENTAL LIMITATIONS (Refer to 41  CFR 60-250.6(d)and 41 CFR    60-741.6(d).)    Contractors are required to make reasonable accommodation to the physical  and mental limitations of individuals with disabilities and special disabled  veterans, unless the contractor can demonstrate that such accommodation would  impose an undue hardship on the conduct of its business.  In determining the  extent to which a contractor is obligated to make accommodations, such factors  as business necessity and financial costs and expenses may be considered.  To  be acceptable, this section of the AAP must contain the contractor's policy with  respect to reasonable accommodations.  That statement must be consistent with  the requirements of the regulations.      2I06COMPENSATION (Refer to 41 CFR 60-250.6(e) and 41 CFR 60-741.6(e).)    In order to address this requirement in an acceptable manner, the AAP must  affirm that, in offering employment or promotion to in- dividuals with  disabilities, special disabled veterans, or veterans of the Vietnam era, the  amount of compensation offered is not reduced due to their receipt of any  disability income, pension or other benefit received from another source.      2I07OUTREACH, POSITIVE RECRUITMENT, EXTERNAL DISSEMINATION OF POLICY Refer  to 41 CFR 60-250.6(f) and 41 CFR    60-741.6(f).)    An acceptable AAP must affirm that the contractor reviews its employment  practices, and must at least state that appropriate outreach and positive  recruitment activities are undertaken where indicated by the findings of such  reviews.  The AAP may also describe in some detail the steps taken by the  contractor in its review of employment practices and the resulting outreach and  recruitment activities.  41 CFR 60-250.6(f) and 41 CFR 60-741.6(f) provide  additional guidance in assessing the accept- ability of this part of the  contractor's AAP(s).    2I08ADDITIONAL AAP INGREDIENTS    The following additional ingredients should be included in the contractor's  Section 503 and 38 U.S.C. 4212 AAP(s):    (a)Internal Dissemination of Policy (Refer to 41 CFR 60-250.6 (g) and 41 CFR  60-741.6(g)):  The AAP should address the contractor's procedures for internal  dissemination of its affirmative action policy.  The regulations cited above  provide examples of the types of activities contractors may take in this area  (e.g., contractors may conduct meetings with executive, managerial, and  supervisory personnel to explain the intent of the policy and to delineate  individual responsibility for its implementation, include the policy in internal  publications, etc.).    (b)Responsibility for Implementation (Refer to 41 CFR 60-250.6 (h) and 41  CFR 60-741.6(h)):  The AAP should identify the person(s) responsible for  implementing the contractor's policy with respect to individuals with  disabilities and covered veterans and should describe his or her  responsibilities.  It should also describe the responsibilities of line  man-agement in carrying out the policy.  The regulations cited  above provide  further guidance in this area.     (c)Development and Execution of Action Programs (Refer to 41 CFR 60-250.6(i)  and 41 CFR 60-741.6(i)):  The AAP should include a description of the specific  action programs which have been developed and implemented by the contractor.   The regulations cited above provide guidance on types of action programs.  While  the action programs described are guide- lines, not requirements, they do  provide a means by which the contractor's efforts to comply with its affirmative  action and equal employment opportunity obligations, as described in the AAP(s),  can be evaluated.    2JSUMMARY OF PROBLEMS WITH AAP AND SUPPORT DATA AND DEVELOPMENT OF ONSITE  PLAN    Problems identified with the completeness, reasonableness and/or  acceptability of the AAPs and support data are checked on page 4 of the SCRR,  and the specific problem described on SCRR page 9.  For each such problem,  actions taken at desk audit to resolve it and/or actions planned for onsite are  described.    2J00ITEMS RESOLVED AT DESK AUDIT    Some problems with the AAP(s) and support data may be resolved at desk audit  after further contact with the contractor.  For exam-ple, if the problem were ""Can't  evaluate job group acceptability because there is no information on what job  titles are in each group,"" the entry may be ""Called J. Smith 5/1/88  and asked him to send a list of titles in each group.  List received 5/8/88.""      2J01ITEMS TO BE RESOLVED ONSITE - ONSITE PLAN    Other items will only be resolvable onsite, and an onsite plan for each  should be briefly described.  For example, if the problem were ""Minority  availability for Foremen group appears low given minority % in blue collar area,""  the entry may be ""Determine how foreman jobs filled.  If internally,  examine incumbents' files to identify feeder jobs.""  If a problem has not  been resolved by the conclusion of desk audit, the column labeled ""Onsite?""  on SCRR page 9 is checked.  These checked items constitute the onsite plan for  resolving AAP and support data problems.    2KOVERVIEW OF PERSONNEL ACTIVITY, EEO TRENDS AND WORKFORCE  STRUCTURE/PERSONNEL PRACTICES    2K00PERSONNEL ACTIVITY (SUMMARY)    Page 5 of the SCRR provides an overview, by EEO-1 category, of personnel  activity during the prior year.  A summary of data on hires, promotions and  terminations should be abstracted from the data provided by the contractor, and  entered on the page.  A similar report, using a substitute SCRR page, can be  prepared from EEO-6 data for educational institutions.  This information, used  in conjunction with historical data analyzed through the EEO Trend Analysis  (below) provides a broad framework for later detailed review by job group of  affirmative action progress (placement goals) and potential discrimination in  employment activity (Impact Ratio Analysis).  Also, because this information is  by particular minority group, it can be used in conjunction with the EEO Trend  Analysis (below) to identify any potential problems for a particular minority  group.    2K01EEO TREND ANALYSIS    An initial assessment of the contractor's workforce and utilization trends  can be made by reviewing EEO-1 reports.  Page 6 of the SCRR is a Worksheet for  entry of EEO-1 data and page 7 provides for a narrative evaluation of those  data.    (a)Long-Term, Short-Term:  Current AAP data are compared with:  (1) the  contractor's profile approximately five years ago    (drawn from the earliest data on the current EEDS report) to look at  long-term trends; and (2) that profile approximately one year ago to look at  short-term trends.  An alternate SCRR page 6 is available for use with EEO-6  data (which are reported on a two-year cycle) for university reviews.  This  information provides an overview of:    oThe distribution of jobs within the contractor's workforce (white-collar,  blue-collar, predominant EEO categories);    oThe direction of change in the total workforce and particular categories  (expanding, contracting, stable); and    oWhether minority and female representation has been increasing or  decreasing, and in what areas.    (b)Changes Due to Reclassifications:  If the EOS observes major changes in  the sizes of EEO categories (p. 6) with little or no corresponding activity (p.  5), further investigation onsite may be needed to determine if the changes are  due to the reclassification of jobs with concentrations of minorities or women  from one EEO-1 category to another.  For example, suppose the total number of  positions in the craft category increases from one year to the next and  indicates an increase in women. Over the same time period, however, both the  total number of operative positions and the total number of women listed as  operatives decreases.  The EOS may then infer that the increase in crafts may  have resulted from the contractor's changing the EEO-1 category of the women's  jobs, rather than from genuine promotions.    (c)EEO Category Patterns:  This analysis also permits identification of  broad areas where minorities/women have been persistently underrepresented or  concentrated, setting a framework for the detailed review of the workforce  analysis for potential discrimination problems and review of the contractor's  goals progress by job group.    (d)Particular Minority Group:  Additionally, this analysis permits  identification of any substantial disparity in the representation of a  particular minority group--whether in the workforce as a whole or in certain  categories--when compared to the distribution of particular minority groups in  the contractor's labor area and/or in possible internal feeder categories.   Where such a disparity is identified, the EOS should plan to conduct standard  discrimination analyses by the particular minority group, at least in those  workforce areas where the disparity exists and for the type of activity most  likely to have created the disparity.  For example, if Hispanics are well  represented in the labor area, but have historically been absent from the  contractor's workforce, the EOS should plan to conduct hiring IRAs separately  for Hispanics.  Or, if Blacks have historically been concentrated in Laborers,  but poorly represented in Operatives and Crafts:  (1) the EOS' review of the  workforce analysis should focus on the types of jobs held by Blacks and any  structural impediments to upward mobility from those jobs; and (2) the EOS' blue  collar IRAs--particularly for promotions and hires into jobs above  Laborers--should be conducted separately for Blacks.  Further discussion of such  separate discrimination analysis for a particular minority group is given at  Sections 2N00 and 2O02 below.  Please also note that if investigation of such a  disparity does not show discrimination, the EOS should consider whether goals  and/or specific affirmative action steps for the particular group are warranted  (see Section 2G07(c) above).    2K02WORKFORCE STRUCTURE, PERSONNEL PRACTICES     In the initial review of the AAP and support data, the EOS eval-uated the  workforce analysis for reasonableness and acceptabil-ity.  As a result, the EOS  should have a basic understanding of the contractor's organization and  operations.  For example, the workforce analysis should show whether the  contractor's facility is organized by department or other unit (e.g., division),  whether lines of progression exist, how pay is structured, and other  characteristics which may prove useful for subsequent analyses of both  affirmative action and potential discrimination issues.  Other supporting data  which may be provided with the AAP, such as copies of labor agreements, should  provide additional information regarding pay rates, work performed,  organizational structure, and rules for internal mobility, at least in the blue  collar sector.  This information, to the extent that it is available during the  desk audit, should be entered on page 8 of the SCRR.      2LGOALS PROGRESS AND GOOD FAITH EFFORTS    A contractor's compliance posture is not measured by whether it met all its  goals, but rather whether it made a good faith effort to do so.  Generally,  however, if properly determined goals in a job group were met, further  examination of good faith effort with respect to that job group is unnecessary.   Therefore, in order to focus the investigation of good faith effort, the  following steps are taken:  (1) measure the degree of progress in job groups  where goals were established and opportunities occurred; (2) evaluate the  contractor's resulting overall goals performance; and (3) identify areas where  specific additional information is needed in order to evaluate good faith  effort.    2L00  ANALYSIS OF GOALS PROGRESS    As noted earlier, to be acceptable, AAP support data must include a report  of progress on prior AAP year goals.  Also, a report of progress on current  goals should be included at least if the con-tractor is six months or more into  its current AAP year when it receives the Scheduling Letter.  This report should  be used to conduct the analysis of goals progress on page 10 of the SCRR.    (a)Data Needed:  To conduct this analysis, first the EOS must identify the  job groups for which goals were established at the beginning of the period under  review.  Second, the percentage placement goal for each such group must be  determined.  Third, for each such job group, the number of total placements and  the number of minority and of female placements must be determined.  If this  information has not been submitted for desk audit (see Section 2H00 above), the  EOS will conduct the analysis below at whatever point in the review sufficient  information is obtained.    (b)Analysis:  The analysis itself takes into consideration the number of  opportunities in relationship to the goal.  More specifically, the percentage  placement goal is multiplied by the number of placements that actually occurred  to determine how many minorities/women would have been placed if the goal were  met.  This result is then compared to the number of minorities/women who  actually were placed, and the difference--plus or minus--entered.    EXAMPLE:  If the contractor set a goal of 10% for minorities in XYZ job  group and had 20 openings, the goal would have been met if it placed 2  minorities (.10 X 20).  If the contractor actually placed one minority, the  difference would be ""-1.""  On the other hand, if it actually placed  five minorities, the difference would be ""+3.""    If the contractor established a goal for a particular minor-ity group or for  men or women of a particular minority group (see Section 2G07(c) above), the  evaluation of progress on that goal is conducted in the same fashion as in the  above example.  See the SCRR instructions for page 10 for further examples.       (c)Net Change:  SCRR page 10 also has an optional part II on Workforce  Change, which provides for entry of data on job group incumbency (total, women  and minorities) at the begin-ning of the period and at the end of the period,  and determination of net change (plus or minus).  This information may be  useful in identifying job groups where, although  there has been progress in  placements, there has been little or no improvement in minority and/or female  representation (this can be for either positive or negative reasons--i.e.,  disproportionate promotions out, terminations, etc.).  It can also help the EOS  to focus on anomalies in the contractor's data, such as increases in job group  size without evidence of placement activity.    2L01EVALUATION OF GOOD FAITH EFFORT    (a)Overall Performance:  In evaluating the contractor's good faith effort,  an overall assessment of its goals/affirmative action performance should first  be made (SCRR page 11,    part I).  For example, was there progress in most areas where goals were  established?  In areas with little progress, are there any balancing factors  such as strong performance in similar but higher level jobs?  For example,  little progress in Operatives II, but progress well above expectations in  Operatives III.  Were there performance problems in areas with poor long-term  trends (SCRR page 6)?  This evaluation should also take into account fulfillment  of AAP commitments and the quality of those commitments in terms of creative  problem solving to remove any impediments to minority/female utilization over  both the long and short term.    (b)Goal Areas Needing Further Examination for Good Faith Effort:  As a  result of the above evaluation, identify any goal areas which need further  evaluation for good faith effort (SCRR page 11, part II).  For each such goal  area, review any contractor description of good faith efforts pertinent to the  area.  This should be presented as part of the contractor's report on goals.   Also use the AAP and support data to try to identify the probable reason for  lack of progress and the type of AAP action items that would be pertinent.  For  example, do the support data on employment activity show that the jobs were  filled predominantly by hire or by promotion?  If by hire, was there low  applicant flow?  What AAP commitments did the contractor make on recruitment  efforts?  Is there any evidence they were fulfilled?  If jobs were filled  primarily by promotion, was there an adequate representation of minorities/women  in probable feeder groups?  What AAP commitments did the contractor make  concerning the promotion process (job posting, encouraging bidding, training,  etc.).  Is there any evidence they were fulfilled?    2L02ONSITE PLAN FOR EVALUATION OF GOOD FAITH EFFORT    For each goal area where there is insufficient desk audit information to  determine good faith effort, list (on SCRR page 11a, part II) the additional  information needed.  For example, in a Clerical I job group there may have been  no goals progress for minorities, and low applicant flow appears to be the  reason.  The AAP may state that a particular agency would be used to recruit  minority applicants for the Clerical 1 job group.  The additional information  needed here may include contact with the agency to confirm its use by the  contractor (as well as other action, such as identifying additional recruitment  sources while onsite).  If questions concerning good faith effort in a job area  have not been resolved by the conclusion of desk audit, the ""Onsite?""  column on SCRR page 11 is checked.  These checked items form the onsite plan for  this portion of the review.    2MPOTENTIAL DISCRIMINATION ANALYSES - GENERAL    2M00TITLE VII PRINCIPLES    It is OFCCP policy, in conducting analyses of potential discrimi-nation  issues under the Executive Order, to follow Title VII principles.    2M01USE OF TERM ""MINORITIES""     The term ""minorities"" means those four groups for which EEO-1  reporting is required--i.e. Blacks, Hispanics, Asians/Pacific Islanders and  American Indians/Alaskan Natives.  As used in these instructions for desk audit  potential discrimination analyses, ""minorities"" may mean those groups  in the aggregate or individually, depending on the characteristics of the labor  area and/or on patterns in the contractor's workforce.  In general, where there  is an observed disparity in the representation of a particular minority group,  standard desk audit potential discrimination analyses will be conducted  separately for that group.  See further discussion of this matter under EEO  Trend Analysis, Review of Workforce Analysis and Impact Ratio Analyses below.      2NREVIEW OF THE WORKFORCE ANALYSIS    2N00GENERAL    An understanding of how employees obtained their jobs, the effects of  seniority, rules for promotion and transfer, etc., is necessary in order to  understand how the contractor's employment system works.  Patterns of minority  and female employment must be examined, and apparent disparities (e.g., where  they are or are not employed in departments, progression lines, job titles, and  other relevant job areas) identified for further investigation onsite.  For  example, men may supervise work units which are composed predominantly of women;  or, a job title may be composed predominantly of minorities in one department,  and predominantly of nonminorities in another.  Such disparities may indicate  dis-criminatory placement or promotional practices or other Executive Order  violations.  The results of the review of minority and female employment  patterns is summarized on page 14 of the SCRR.     2N01MINORITY GROUP ANALYSIS    If the EOS' review of the contractor's EEO category data (SCRR page 7)  showed substantial disparities in the representation of a particular minority  group in the workforce as a whole or in distribution among EEO categories, the  review of the workforce analysis should focus on that minority group, at least  in those workforce areas where the disparity was observed.  For example, if  category data showed that Blacks were concentrated in Laborers, poorly  represented in Operatives and absent in Crafts, the EOS' review of the workforce  analysis should specifically identify the types of blue collar jobs in which  Blacks are employed, whether these jobs fall into lines of progression or  departments/ units that tend to inhibit progression to Operatives and Crafts,  etc.  Even where such disparities are not observed in the initial category  screen, where the labor area has high representation of more than one minority  group and/or the general employment patterns in the industry involved have  differed among minority  groups, in reviewing the workforce analysis the EOS  should be alert for any indications of potential problems in the distribution  of the particular minority groups.    2N02UNDERREPRESENTATIONS AND CONCENTRATIONS    In examining patterns of minority group and female employment, the EOS is  looking for evidence of concentrations and under-representations.    (a)Concentration:  The term concentration means that minority groups and/or  women are found in a particular section (job area) of a contractor's workforce  (however that section is defined) in numbers substantially greater than would be  expected in terms of their overall representation in the contractor's workforce,  or in a relevant sector (however defined) of that workforce.    (b)Underrepresentation:  The term underrepresentation means the  opposite--that minority groups and/or women are found in a particular section of  a contractor's workforce in numbers substantially fewer than would be expected  in terms of their overall representation in the contractor's workforce or  relevant sector of that workforce.      (c)Interpreting Results:  The identification of a concentration or  underrepresentation does not mean that discrimination has been found.  It is  only an indicator that further investigation is warranted.      2N03DETERMINING THE RELEVANT WORKFORCE SECTOR AND JOB AREAS     (a)Relevance of Other Information:  In determining the relevant workforce  sector and job areas for the analysis, the EOS must be guided by the findings of  the desk audit up to this point.  For example, the information obtained from the  EOS' earlier analysis of EEO trends (SCRR, page 7) can assist in identifying  areas, by EEO-1 category, which may show persistent minority or female  representation above or below comparable availability; or, as discussed in 2N00  above, the EOS may have identified a substantial disparity in the  representation of a particular minority group.  Information derived from the  earlier review of the organization of the contractor's workforce and personnel  practices (e.g., internal mobility, pay structure), (SCRR, page 8) may be  helpful in making further comparisons.    (b)Workforce Sector/Job Area - General:  In determining the relevant sector  of the contractor's workforce with which minority group or female representation  in a particular job area is to be compared (e.g., blue collar, white collar,  clerical, the entire workforce, or even job group), the EOS should remember that  there should be a reasonable expectation that, absent discrimination,  minorities/women would be fairly evenly distributed among the job areas within  the sector.  That expectation is high when (1) entry-level jobs in the sector  share similar qualification requirements; and (2) jobs above entry-level in the  sector are filled primarily by promotion.  The expectation gets progressively  lower as entry-level jobs in the sector become more differentiated in skill  requirements (since it becomes more likely that minority/female availability  will differ) and/or jobs above entry are filled predominantly by hire.    (c)Relationship to Particular Contractor:  An appropriate definition of the  workforce sector is, therefore, related to the particular contractor's  structure, legitimate skill needs and personnel practices.  In general, analyses  that focus on where minorities/women are located organizationally (which  departments, units, lines of progression, etc.) will tend to identify potential  placement problems.  Analyses that focus on the level at which minorities/women  are employed (concentrated in lowest level jobs within an LOP, department, etc.)  tend to identify potential promotion problems (that may, in turn, be related to  placement).  For example:    (1)Workforce as Sector/Departments as Job Area:  Where there are departments  or organizational units with largely similar qualifications for entry-level positions (e.g., unskilled and, to a more limited extent, semi-skilled, in blue-collar; undifferentiated trainee jobs in white-collar ), representation in each department may be compared to representation in the total workforce of all such departments.      (2)Workforce as Sector/Lines of Progression as Job Area: Where there are  lines of progression (LOPs) or usual promotional sequences that cut across  department lines and have similar entry-level requirements, representa-ion in  each LOP may be compared to representation in the total workforce of all such  LOPs.      (3)Department as Sector/LOPs within Department as Job Area:  Where there are  separate lines of progression and/or usual promotional sequences within a  department or similar organizational unit, representation in each LOP may be  compared to their representation in the department as a whole.    (4)Department as Sector/Jobs within Department as Job Area:  In the absence  of LOPs or usual promotional sequences, where jobs within a department are  usually filled by promotion from within--or might reasonably be filled in such a  manner based on the nature of the jobs involved and the training which the  contractor could reasonably be expected to offer (e.g., on-the-job  training)--representation in a particular job area within that department may be  compared to representation in the department as a whole.      (5)EEO Category as Sector/Type of Job as Job Area:  It can be useful to  compare representation in an EEO category or job group against distribution  within titles in that category/group.  For example, in an Office and Clerical  category, women may be concentrated in General Clerical positions, but  underrepresented in Production and Material Control clerical jobs.      (6)Lines of Progression as Sector/Jobs in LOP as Job Area: A line of  progression or usual promotional sequence--particularly one with a large number  of incumbents--may also be treated as a ""sector,"" and minority/female  representation in the LOP compared with their representation in jobs at  different levels in the LOP.    (7)Job Title as Sector/Job Title within Department as Job Area - Where a job  title--particularly one with a large number of total incumbents--appears in  several depart-ments, representation in the title as a whole can be compared  with representation in the title in each department.    (d)Applicability to Both White-Collar and Blue-Collar Jobs:  These analyses  can be applied to both white collar and blue collar situations.  In all cases,  the EOS should ensure that the sector of the contractor's workforce which is  used as a basis for comparison with a particular job area is, in fact, relevant.   Particularly in the white collar area, differences with respect to factors  such as education or skills may make establishing a basis for comparison  difficult.  However, where it appears that the majority of a white collar  workforce consists of highly specialized jobs (an engineering firm, a scientific  research laboratory), it is generally best to separate clerical positions from  other white collar jobs when defining the base of comparison.    (e)Defining ""Substantially"":  Once the job area and the relevant  workforce sector have been selected, the next step is to identify those job  areas which have ""substantially"" more or fewer minorities and/or women  than would reasonably be expected by their representation in the workforce  sector selected.  These are the job areas which will be investigated further  onsite.  The term ""substantially"" as used here, however, cannot be so  precisely defined as to fit all cases.  In identifying job areas for further  investigation, EOSs must be guided by common sense, reasonableness, and the  nature of the information available up to that point.  In some instances, areas  of minority group/female concentration and underrepresentation will be readily  apparent from review of the workforce analysis.  In others, there may be a need  for more precise identification of potential problem areas.  One method which  may be used to identify job areas for further investigation onsite is the Job  Area Acceptance Range (JAAR).    (f)Use of the Job Area Acceptance Range (JAAR):  The JAAR is a formula which  may be used to determine whether a particular job area represents an area of  concentration or underrepresentation for minorities and/or women.  There is an  optional SCRR Worksheet for using the JAAR.    (1)Relationship to ""80% or four-fifths"" Rule of Thumb:   The JAAR  is based on the ""80% or four-fifths"" rule of thumb, similar to that  used in identifying whether a selection rate for a particular group represents  an adverse impact in selection (see Impact Ratio Analyses below).  For the JAAR,  the assumption is that the percentage representation of minorities and/or women  in a particular job area will normally fall in a range plus or minus 20% of  their representation in the relevant base workforce sector.    (2)Computing the JAAR:  To find this range, therefore, the percentage of  minorities or women in the base sector is multiplied by .20 and the result is  added to and subtracted from the percentage of minorities or women in the base  sector.  For example, if the broad sector had 50% minorities, the JAAR range  would be found by multiplying 50% X .20, and the result, 10%, would be  subtracted from and added to 50% for a JAAR range of 40% to 60%.    (3)Applying the JAAR:  The minority/female percentage in each job area  within the base sector is then compared to the range.  If the percentage in a  job area falls below the range (in the example, less than 40%), the area is  considered underrepresented; if it exceeds the range (in the example, more than  60%), the job area is considered concentrated.    (g)Role of Recent Personnel Activity Data:  Employment data shown in the  workforce analysis represent a cumulative record of past employment activity.   Data summarized in Impact Ratio Analyses (IRAs, below) represent more recent  employment activity.  As a result, in determining which job areas should be  investigated further onsite, EOSs should give a high priority to areas in which  recent employment activity appears to mirror the effects of prior activity.  For  example, there may be adverse IRAs for placement into job groups in areas where  minorities and/or women are underrepresented.    (h)Recording Results:  When, as a result of the review of the workforce  analysis, job areas exhibiting concentrations and underrepresentations are  identified for further investigation onsite, this information is entered on  page 17 of the SCRR, and an onsite plan developed for their investigation.  This  plan may include a request for the contractor's adverse impact determinations  for job titles in concentrated/under- represented areas.  Such information may assist the EOS, in onsite analysis  of potential placement problems, in determining whether there has been activity and of what type during the normal liability period, etc.  See Section 2O04(a) below and Chapters 3 and 7.    2OAUDIT OF PERSONNEL ACTIVITY - IMPACT RATIO ANALYSES    2O00DEFINITION    The Impact Ratio Analysis (IRA) is a method for identifying personnel  activity which should be investigated further onsite.  The IRA is a ratio  between two selection rates, one for minorities or women, and one for others.  Generally, a selection rate for minorities or women which is less than 80% of the selection rate for  nonminorities or men, as appropriate, for a particular personnel activity (e.g.,  hiring, promotion, termination) should be investigated further during the  onsite.  Although related, adverse IRAs should not be confused with the term ""adverse  impact.""  Refer to Chapter 7, Section 7E01, for a definition of the latter  term.     2O01  CALCULATING THE IRA    Page 15 of the SCRR provides a Worksheet for conducting impact ratio  analyses.  The Worksheet is used to compute IRAs for hiring, promotions, and  terminations, and may be adapted to compute IRAs for other data the contractor  may provide (e.g., training, transfers, etc.).     (a)Selection Rates:  The first step in calculating the IRA is to find the  selection rate for minorities or women and the selection rate for others.    (b)Focus on Unfavorable Selection Rate of Minorities/Women:  The next step  is to compare the selection rate for minorities/women to the rate for others.   As a matter of administrative discretion in compliance reviews, OFCCP will  focus on situations in which the selection rate for minorities or women is less  favorable than the rate for others.*  For positive actions, such as hires or  promotions, this will be where the minority or female rate is lower; for  negative actions, such as terminations, it will be where the minority or female  rate is higher.    (c)Finding the Impact Ratio:  Consistent with (b) above, the IRA is  calculated when the selection rate for minorities or women is less favorable.   Therefore, for positive personnel actions the IRA is found by dividing the lower  minority or female rate by the rate for others.  The IRA for negative personnel  actions is found by dividing the rate for others by the higher minority or  female rate.      (d)Number of Persons Potentially Affected:  For adverse IRAs, the SCRR  Worksheet referenced above provides an additional calculation to determine how  many minorities or women are potentially affected.  This information may be  useful in setting investigative priorities.  See Appendix 2A for detailed  instructions for using the Worksheet.     __________    *The EOS should be aware, however, that sometimes a more favorable rate for minorities or women may indicate ""channeling"" into different--and perhaps, less favorable--jobs than others.    2O02MINORITY GROUP ANALYSIS    If the EOS' review of the contractor's EEO category data (SCRR page 7)  showed substantial disparities in the representation of a    particular minority group in the workforce as a whole or in distribution  among EEO categories, IRAs should be conducted for that group(s) separately, at  least for those workforce areas where the disparity was observed and for  activity elements likely to have contributed to the disparity.  For example, if  category data showed that Hispanics were persistently absent from the workforce,  all hiring IRAs should be conducted separately for Hispanics.  Or, in an example  used earlier (2N00), where Blacks were concentrated in Laborers, poorly  represented in Operatives and absent from Crafts, IRAs for blue collar job  groups--particularly for promotions and hires into Operatives and Crafts    --should be conducted separately for Blacks.  Even where such disparities  are not observed in the initial category screen, where the labor area has high  representation of more than one minority group and/or the general employment  patterns in the industry involved have differed among minority groups, in  reviewing the contractor's activity data preparatory to conducting IRA analyses,  the EOS should be alert for any indications of potential problems in selections  of particular minority groups.    2O03  PROPER USE OF THE IRA     It is important to remember that an adverse IRA is only a pre-liminary  indicator of a potential discrimination problem.  It is not proof, in and of  itself, of discrimination, or of the existence of an affected class.  For  example, an adverse IRA in a job group may have been computed using an  insufficiently refined candidate pool.  Only further investigation onsite can  determine whether discrimination has occurred.      2O04 IRA SUMMARY AND ONSITE PLAN    Where adverse IRAs are identified, and further investigation is needed, the  EOS should describe the problem on SCRR page 17 (Summary of Potential  Discrimination Problems) and indicate that will be needed onsite to determine  whether the adverse IRA represents apparent discrimination.    (a)Contractor Adverse Impact Determinations (Contractors with 100 or More  Employees):    (1)Maintenance of Records:  As noted earlier in the discussion of the  acceptability of support data, the Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection  Procedures at 41 CFR 60-3.4 and 60-3.15 require contractors with 100 or more  employees to maintain records by job title sufficient to disclose the impact which its selection procedures (including hiring, promotion and termination) have on the employment opportunities of  women and on each minority group for whom EEO-1 reporting is required.    (2)Analysis of Impact:  The Guidelines at 41 CFR 60-3.4 and 3.15(A)(2) also  require that contractors with 100 or more employees annually analyze these data  to determine whether the total selection process for each job is having adverse  impact.  These determinations are required by sex and for each race/national  origin group (e.g., Black, Hispanic, Asian/Pacific Islander, American  Indian/Alaskan Native) which constitutes 2% or more of the labor force in the  relevant labor area or 2% or more of the applicable workforce (i.e. for jobs  filled internally).      (3)Requesting Contractor Determinations:  When the EOS has identified a job  group with an adverse IRA, and the contractor employs 100 or more persons, the  contractor should be requested to furnish (at desk audit or onsite) its relevant  adverse impact determinations for the job titles which fall within the job  group.  For example, if the adverse IRA is for female hires into a  Administrative Professionals job group, the contractor should be asked to submit  its adverse impact determinations for the hiring of women in each title within  the Administrative Professionals group.  This will assist the EOS in determining  whether the IRA does or does not need to be refined before investigating further  (see Chapter 3).  The EOS may also request the contractor's adverse impact  analyses in other areas.  For example, review of the workforce analysis may have  shown concentrations/underrepresentations that suggest a potential placement problem.  Job group activity data, however, may not show placements into the titles of concern, and the EOS could request the contractor's adverse impact analyses for hires, promotions and transfers into  those titles.  Where appropriate, the EOS may also ask to review the contractor's adverse impact analyses generally and/or may ask the contractor to identify those jobs where its analyses showed adverse impact.    (b)Need for Information about the Selection Process:  The EOS should also  plan to obtain the contractor's description of how employment decisions are made  for positions in the job group, including the steps in the process and, for each  step, the decision makers, criteria used and a description of how they are used,  and records maintained.  Steps may include, for example, review of application  forms by personnel, written tests, formal or informal interviews, physical  examinations, or on-the-job tests.  The EOS should plan to verify the  contractor's statements through review of records, interviews with applicants  and/or employees, and, if possible, observing the process by which applicants  are screened and selected.     (c)Multi-Component Selection Processes - Contractor Obligations:     (1)Adverse Impact in Total Selection Process:  Where the contractor's  adverse impact analyses are requested (per 2O04(a) above) and submitted for desk  audit, if the analysis shows adverse impact in the total selection process for a  job, 41 CFR 60-3.4 and 60-3.15(A)(2) require the contractor to evaluate the  components of the total selection process for adverse impact.  Therefore, in a  multi-step and/or multi-criterion selection process with adverse impact, the EOS  should plan to request the contractor's records showing at what step(s) and/or  by what criterion(ia) minorities or women are being disproportionately screened  out.      (2)No Adverse Impact in Total Selection Process:  If the total selection  process for a job does not have an adverse impact, a contractor would not  normally be expected to evaluate the individual components for adverse impact or  to validate those components, and enforcement action would not normally be taken  based on a component.      (i)Special Circumstances:  In some circumstances, enforcement action may be  taken based on an individual component which has an adverse impact (e.g., height  and weight requirements) that cannot be justified based on job relatedness or  business necessity.    (ii)Relationship of ""Bottom Line"" to Individual Complaints of  Discrimination:  The ""bottom line"" standard with respect to adverse  impact does not mean that complaints alleging discrimination caused by a  component of a selection process will not be investigated.  However this  standard may be applied in an exercise of administrative discretion on whether  to file an enforcement action.  See Question and Answers Nos. 25 and 26 in  Adoption of Questions and Answers to Clarify and Provide a Common  Interpretation of the Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures.       2PCOMPENSATION ANALYSES    2P00GENERAL    While reviewing the workforce analysis for potentially discriminatory placement patterns, the EOS should be especially alert to potential disparities between the wages or salaries shown in the underrepresented areas as compared to those in areas of concentration.  For example, the same or similar job titles may appear in both areas, but show different wage rates or salary ranges, with the higher  wages/salaries shown in those areas where minorities, members of a particular minority group or women are under-represented.      2P01WAGE AND SALARY DATA    As noted earlier in the discussion regarding the reasonableness of a  workforce analysis, coded salary data are acceptable for desk audit purposes.   However, the workforce analysis (wage coded or not) must show titles in wage  rate order within each department or similar organizational unit and the coding  must be consistent across departments/units.  Therefore, when a workforce  analysis contains alpha or numeric codes for salary designations, a salary  analysis may still be conducted by assigning numeric equivalents to the codes (1  to the lowest code, 2 to the second lowest, etc.) and averages computed.  Where  potential problems are identified, the areas should be flagged for further  investigation onsite.  Actual salary information and/or the keys to the codes  for flagged areas should be obtained from the contractor at that time.       2P02IDENTIFICATION OF JOB TITLES FOR COMPARISON    During the desk audit the EOS should also identify specific job titles which  are held by both minorities (or members of a partiticular minority group) and  nonminorities, or both women and men, for onsite comparison of actual salaries.       2P03METHODS USED TO DETERMINE PAY    The EOS should also plan to review onsite how starting pay levels (wage or  salary) are established, and how raises (wage or salary) are determined.      2QSUMMARY OF POTENTIAL DISCRIMINATION PROBLEMS AND ONSITE INVESTIGATIVE PLAN      2Q00  FOCUS ON PROBLEM    While potential discrimination can be divided into problems identified  through analysis of personnel activity (IRAs), and problems identified in the  review of the workforce analysis (e.g., JAAR, Compensation analyses), and/or  problems highlighted by complaints, the focus should be on the problem itself.   Potential discrimination problems which have been identified during the desk  audit on pages 3 (Past Problems/Known Complaints), 14 (Results of Review of  Workforce Analysis), 15 (Impact Ratio Analyses), and 16 (Compensation and Other  Analyses) of the SCRR, should be summarized on page 17 of the SCRR.  As noted  above, the focus is on the problem itself, which although it may have been  identified through more than one analysis, need be  listed only once (e.g., an  area of minority concentration with an adverse IRA for minority promotions out  of the area).    2Q01  ONSITE PLAN    For each such potential discrimination problem, the EOS describes an onsite  investigative plan.  This plan should be as specific as possible, and should set  priorities for the documents to be gathered, the statistical data needed, the  people to be interviewed, and the materials to be reviewed while onsite.  For  example, if the compensation analysis identified job titles for salary  review,  the onsite plan should state that the personnel files of a specific number of  minorities/women and a specific number of others in the identified job title(s)  will be reviewed for actual salary information.  If the IRA indicates a  potential problem in minority hires into a particular job group, the procedures  to be followed (persons to interview, applications and personnel files to be  reviewed, information to be obtained) should be described.      2RPREPARING FOR THE ONSITE    2R00  DECISION TO GO ONSITE     Based on the results of the desk audit, the EOS must decide whether further  investigation onsite is warranted.  However, in most cases an onsite review will  be necessary, because even where potential problems in personnel activity or the  workforce are not identified during the desk audit, many contractor commitments  contained in the AAP cannot be evaluated without an onsite inspection,  corroborating interviews, etc.  Preparation for the onsite phase of the review  is therefore a necessary part of virtually every compliance review.      2R01  SCOPE OF ONSITE    If, at the end of desk audit, the EOS determines that an onsite review is  appropriate, that review will cover: (1) problem areas identified during desk  audit and unresolved at the conclusion of desk audit; and (2) examination of the  contractor's implementation of pertinent AAP items and of those regulatory obligations not  specifically required to be included in the AAP(s).  Refer to Chapter 3 of this  Manual for a complete discussion of onsite activities.    2R02ONSITE PLAN - RESULTS OF DESK AUDIT     The onsite plan is based primarily on the findings obtained as a result of  the desk audit.  These findings fall into two categories, affirmative action  and potential discrimination.     (a)Affirmative Action:  Affirmative action can be further subdivided into  two areas, written AAP and supporting data, and goal attainment and good faith  efforts.      (1)Written AAP and Supporting Data:  Problems identified in the written AAP  and supporting data, were described on page 9 of the SCRR and, for each such  problem, actions taken at desk audit to resolve it and/or actions planned for  onsite were described (see Section 2J above and SCRR Instructions).  If a  problem is not resolved by the conclusion of desk audit, the column on SCRR page  9 labeled ""Onsite?"" is checked.  These checked items constitute the  onsite plan for resolving AAP and support data problems.    (2)Goals Progress and Good Faith Efforts:  Specific job groups/areas where  additional information is needed to assess good faith effort were summarized on  SCRR page 11, part II.  For each such goal area, the specific information needed  to resolve the question of good faith effort was listed (see Section 2L02 above  and SCRR Instructions).  If a question of good faith effort is not resolved at  the conclusion of desk audit, the column on SCRR page 11 labeled ""Onsite?""  is checked.  These checked items constitute the onsite plan for resolving good  faith effort issues.    (b)Potential Discrimination:  Specific potential discrimination problems  (whether identified through the workforce analysis, IRAs, complaints or some  combination of these) were entered on page 17 of the SCRR.  For each such  potential problem, an investigative plan was developed, giving the specific  information needed to determine whether discrimination had occurred (see Section  2Q above and SCRR Instructions).  If a potential discrimination problem is not  resolved at the conclusion of desk audit, the column on SCRR page 17 labeled ""Onsite?""  is checked.  These checked items constitute the onsite plan for resolving  potential discrimination issues.    (c)Summary:  The onsite plan, therefore, consists of checked items in the ""Onsite?""  columns on SCRR pages 9, 11 and 17 in the major review areas of AAP and support  data problems, questions of good faith effort, and potential discrimination  issues.  These items, together with an examination of the contractor's  implementation of the AAP(s) and of the non-AAP areas discussed below, will  direct the onsite review.    2R03OTHER ONSITE INGREDIENTS - GENERAL     The onsite review also covers the contractor's implementation of Executive  Order AAP commitments generally, and specifically must address implementation  of:    oThe Guidelines on Religion and National Origin and Sex Discrimination (SCRR  page 12);    oSection 503 and 38 U.S.C. 4212 affirmative action/    nondiscrimination requirements (SCRR page 13); and     oTechnical requirements (SCRR optional Technical Requirements Worksheet).      2R04IMPLEMENTATION OF GUIDELINES ON RELIGION AND NATIONAL ORIGIN AND SEX  DISCRIMINATION GUIDELINES    (a)Guidelines on Religion and National Origin:  These Guidelines, at 41 CFR  Part 60-50, are not a required AAP ingredient under 41 CFR 60-2.13.  The  contractor's implementation of them, therefore, must be evaluated onsite.  Chapter 3, Section 3G provides detailed guidance on conducting this aspect of  the onsite review.    (b)Sex Discrimination Guidelines:  While these Guidelines, at 41 CFR Part  60-20, are a required AAP ingredient and will have been evaluated for  acceptability (See 41 CFR 60-2.13(h) and Section 2G15 above), the contractor's  implementation of them must be evaluated onsite.  This evaluation should include  a review of the contractor's maternity leave policy (which may not have been  submitted for desk audit) and its implementation as discussed in Chapter 3.  In  addition, although not specifically mentioned in the Guidelines, sexual  harassment (as well as harassment on the basis of race, national origin or  religion) is a violation of the Executive Order.  During the onsite, the EOS  should be alert for any indications of such harassment.  OFCCP follows Title VII  principles in determining whether sexual harassment has occurred.  Further  guidance in this area will be issued.    (c)Recording Results:  The evaluation of both Guidelines is entered on SCRR  page 12.  Particular attention should be directed to those portions of both  Guidelines that are not addressed elsewhere in the regulations--e.g., leave for  religious purposes, maternity leave.      2R05IMPLEMENTATION OF SECTION 503 AND 38 U.S.C. 4212 REQUIREMENTS    (a)Scope:  The onsite review must include examination of the contractor's  implementation of its affirmative action and nondiscrimination obligations with  respect to individuals with disabilities, special disabled veterans and veterans  of the Vietnam era.  Chapter 3 provides detailed guidance on conducting this  aspect of the onsite review.    (b)Non-AAP Requirements:  Along with findings on the contractor's  implementation of AAP ingredients, the  following non-AAP requirements must be  evaluated onsite.  Results of this evaluation are recorded on SCRR page 13, part  I.  Chapter 3 provides detailed guidance on conducting this aspect of the onsite  review.    (1)Invitation to Self-Identify:  Contractors must invite all applicants and  employees to identify themselves as covered veterans or persons with  disabilities.  Refer to 41 CFR 60-250.5(d) and 41 CFR 60-741.5(c).    (2)Availability of the AAP for Inspection:  Contractors must make the AAP  available for inspection by employees and applicants for employment.  The  location and hours during which the AAP is available must be posted.  Refer to  41 CFR 60-250.5(c) and 41 CFR 60-741.5(d).     (3)Listing of Employment Openings:  The Affirmative Action Clause at 41 CFR  60-250.4 requires that covered con-    tractors list all suitable employment openings with the local office of the  State Employment Service.    (4)VETS 100 Filing Requirement:  A contractor covered by 41 CFR Part 60-250  must report at least annually to DOL's Office of the Assistant Secretary for  Veterans' Employment and Training (OASVET) on the number of covered veterans in  its workforce and the number of covered veterans hired.  See 41 CFR Chapter 61.   A copy of the VETS 100 Form and its instructions is included in Chapter 3  (Figure 3-3).     (c)Discrimination:  The onsite evaluation of the contractor's implementation  of its affirmative action obligations under Section 503 and 38 U.S.C. 4212, also  includes investigation for discrimination against individuals with disabilities  or covered veterans.  This includes identification of any qualified individuals  with disabilities or covered veterans screened out by personnel practices or job  requirements not shown to be consistent with business necessity and the safe  performance of the job, and any who could have performed the job involved given  reasonable accommodation to their disability.  The types of materials that may  be examined onsite in this area are discussed on SCRR page 13, Part II and its  instructions, and in Chapter 3.    (d)Technical Requirements:  Additionally, there are a number of technical  requirements which the Section 503 and 38 U.S.C. 4212 programs share with the  Executive Order program.  These are addressed in 2R06(a) below.     2R06TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS    The onsite review must also cover the contractor's implementation of  technical requirements.  These fall in the following areas:  (1) those mandated  by the EEO/AA clauses of all three OFCCP programs; (2) those specific to the  Executive Order program; and (3) those pertaining to OFCCP responsibilities  under the Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA).  There is an optional SCRR  Worksheet for recording the results of the audit of Technical Requirements.    (a)All Three Programs:  In addition to requiring that covered contractors  not discriminate against and take affirmative action on behalf of covered group  members, the Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action Clauses at 41 CFR  60-1.4(a), 41 CFR 60-250.4, and 41 CFR 60-741.4, contain a number of other  requirements.      (1)Inclusion of Clauses:  Each EEO/AA clause must be included, either in its  entirety or by reference, in all covered contracts, subcontracts, and purchase  orders.  Additionally, notice of the VETS 100 filing requirement must be  included.    (2)Informing of Obligations - Vendors and Subcontractors:  Contractors must  advise vendors and subcontractors of their obligation to develop an AAP if they  meet coverage thresholds.    (3)Informing of Obligations - Unions:  Contractors must inform any labor  unions or worker representatives with which they have a collective bargaining  agreement or other agreement of the contractor's commitments under the  regulations.    (4)Posting of Notice:  Contractors must post notice of their EEO/AA  obligations in conspicuous places, available to both employees and applicants  for employment.    (b)Requirements Specific to the Executive Order Program:  The Executive  Order regulations additionally require:    (1)EEO Tag Line:  Advertisements and solicitations for employment must state  that all qualified applicants will be considered, regardless of race, color,  sex, national origin or religion (see 41 CFR 60-1.4(a)(2) and 60-1.41).    (2)Standard Form 100:  The contractor must have filed a current Standard  Form 100 (EEO-1 or, for universities, EEO-6) as required by 41 CFR 60-1.7(a)(1).  (NOTE:  Where the contractor is found not to have filed a Standard Form 100, the  EOS--in addition to including the matter in a Conciliation Agreement--will  notify the OFCCP National Office by completing and forwarding the form provided  in the EEDS Manual for this purpose.)  The contractor must also notify its  vendors and subcontractors of their obligation to file a Standard Form 100  annually.    (c)IRCA - Forms I-9 Inspection:  The onsite review also must include a  review of the contractor's INS (Immigration and Naturalization Service) Forms  I-9.  This form is used to verify that employees hired since November 7, 1986,  are legally eligible to work in the United States under the provisions of the  Immigration Reform and Control Act.  As noted below, the contractor must be  given at least three days advance notice of a Forms I-9 inspection.  Chapter 3  includes a copy of the I-9 Form and its instructions (Figure 3-1), specific  guidance on the contents of this inspection (3E), and a copy of the ESA Form 91  used to record the results of this inspection (Figure 3-2).    2SNOTICE OF ONSITE REVIEW    EOSs are required to provide written notice of the scheduling of the onsite  review to contractors.  This notice of onsite should be a follow-up to an  earlier telephone contact establishing the date and time that the onsite review  will begin.      2S00TELEPHONE NOTICE     In telephoning the contractor to establish the date the onsite will begin,  the EOS should also request that the contractor have additional required  information available at the beginning of the onsite.  This information will  have been identified as a result of problems with the data that the contractor  submitted or failed to submit for the desk audit, or potential problems found  during desk audit.  This contact provides the contractor with lead time to  locate the information.  It also allows the EOS to determine whether the  information is available and in what form.  During the conversation the  contractor would also be told of the need to inspect I-9 forms.      2S01WRITTEN CONFIRMATION OF ONSITE    A letter must be sent to the contractor confirming the phone notice of the  onsite, the date and time the onsite will begin, and that an I-9 inspection will  be conducted (to provide the required formal 3-day notice of such an  inspection).    (a)List of Materials:  The onsite confirmation letter must include a list of  the materials which the contractor should make available at the start of the  onsite.    (1)Materials Related to Specific Findings:  Items which relate to specific  preliminary findings noted during the desk audit should be requested.  For  example, where the EOS has identified adverse IRAs, a list of the employment  actions involved or the contractor's adverse impact determinations for titles in  the job group and type of activity involved should be requested; or,  where the  desk audit has indicated salary questions, the key to any salary codes should be  requested.  Also, the EOS should note that personnel files, applications, and  resumes should be available for inspection.      (2)Materials Not Included in Original Submission:  Items which may not have  been included in the original AAP and supporting data submission--such as copies  of employment advertisements, purchase orders, employment applications, labor  agreements, and policy manuals, should be requested.  Where appropriate, the EOS  may also ask that the contractor's adverse impact determinations be available for review or that the contractor identify those jobs where the results of its analysis showed adverse impact.    (3)I-9's and VETS 100 Report:  Because EOSs must review I-9 forms and verify that the contractor has filed the VETS 100 Report, the contractor must be informed of the need to have these available for inspection.       (4)Additional Information:  A request should also be made for the names of  applicants and employees who have responded to the contractor's invitation to  self-identification or who have otherwise become known to the contractor as  individuals with disabilities, as special disabled veterans, and/or as veterans  of the Vietnam era.  Where special disabled veterans and/or individuals with  disabilities have been identified, the contractor should also be asked to  provide a description of any accommodations made.       (b)Mailing:  The letter confirming the onsite, signed by the AOD/FOD, should  be mailed to the contractor (by certified mail, return receipt requested)  sufficiently in advance of the onsite date to ensure that the letter arrives at  least 3 days before the EOS.  In addition, should the contractor encounter  unanticipated problems in obtaining the items requested, there should be  sufficient lead time to allow for the substitution of alternate materials, where  possible and appropriate.      Figure 2-1:    CHRONOLOGY LOG - CC-53    Figure 2-2:  SCHEDULING LETTER REQUESTING AAP AND SUPPORT DATA    CERTIFIED MAIL    RETURN RECEIPT REQUESTED    Dear (name of contractor official) :    Your establishment located at___________has been selected for a compliance  review under Executive Order 11246, as amended, Section 503 of the  Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, and the Vietnam Era Veterans'  Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974, as amended, (38 U.S.C. 4212), and their  implementing regulations.    The compliance review will be conducted as described in the regulations at  41 CFR Part 60-60 which outlines the three phases of the process.  These phases  normally include a desk audit, an onsite review, and where appropriate, offsite  analysis.    For desk audit purposes we are requesting a copy of your Affirmative Action  Programs (AAPs) and supporting documentation.  These should be prepared in  accordance with the requirements set forth in 41 CFR 60-1.40, 60-2.1 through  60-2.15, Part 60-741 and Part 60-250.  The AAPs' contents and supporting data  such as indicated in the enclosed itemized listing are to be submitted.    Our audit of the AAP and supporting documentation is designed to assist us  in preparing for the onsite review and to reduce the amount of time and level of  effort required by OFCCP and your representatives during this phase of the  compliance process.     You should note, however, that 41 CFR 60-2.2 authorizes the initiation of  enforcement procedures in circumstances where materials submitted for desk audit  do not represent a reasonable effort to meet the affirmative action program  requirements.      Please submit your AAPs and supporting documentation as soon as possible,  and in any case no later than 30 days from the date of receipt of this letter.      If you have any questions concerning OFCCP's compliance review, please feel  free to contact______________.    Sincerely,    AOD/FOD    Attached:  Itemized listing, 41 CFR Chapter 60    Figure 2-2a:  ITEMIZED LISTING    ITEMIZED LISTING    Required AAP contents, including supporting documentation such as those  indicated by check ( ) mark, are essential to conduct the desk audit phase of  the compliance review.      ____a.  Copies of your Employer Information Reports EEO-1 (Standard Form 100  Rev.) for the last three years (____, ____, and ____).  (See 41 CFR 60-1.7).      ____b.  Workforce Analysis (See 41 CFR 60-2.11(a)).    ____c.  Copies of progression line charts (See 41 CFR 60-2.12(m)).    ____d.  Job group and availability analysis (See 41 CFR 60-2.11(b)).      ____e.  Documentation that areas of underutilization have been identified  and goals and timetables have been established to correct any deficiencies,  together with a plan of action to achieve those goals and timetables.  (See 41  CFR 60-2.12(g), (h), and (i) and 41 CFR 60-2.13(d), (e), and (f)).    ____f.  Summary data and information which indicate the numerical and other  results of your affirmative action goals for each job group for the current goal  year and the preceding goal year.  For each goal not attained/being attained,  describe the good faith efforts which were/are being made to achieve them.  (See  41 CFR 60-1.40(c) and 41 CFR 60-2.12).    ____g.  An analysis of your selection process, including a determination of  whether it eliminates a significantly higher percentage of minorities or women  than nonminorities or men.  (See 41 CFR 60-1.40(b)(2), 60-2.23(b)(3), 60-2.25).   This analysis may consist of a summary of applicant and hire activity identified  by race and sex for each job group for (a) the present goal year and (b) the  previous goal year and include:  total applicants, total offers of employment,  total hires, total rejections.  However, if you do not have the data arranged in  that manner you may choose to submit them in the form in which they are  available.    Figure 2-2a:  ITEMIZED LISTING (continued)    ____h.  Analysis of your transfer and promotion practices to determine if  lateral and/or vertical movement of minority or female employees is occurring at  a lesser rate (compared to workforce mix) than nonminority or male employees.   (See 41 CFR 60-1.40(b)(3), 60-2.23(b)(2), 60-2.25).  The analysis may consist of  a summary of promotion and transfer activity during (a) the present goal year  and (b) the previous goal year, identified by race and sex, including the  department/job group/job title into which employees were promoted and each  department/job group/job title from which promoted.  However, if you have  performed the analysis under a different arrangement you may choose to submit it  in the manner in which it is available.    ____i.  Summary of monitoring reports which reflect the degree to which the  nondiscriminatory policy is carried out with respect to terminations of  employment.  (See 41 CFR 60-2.25).  This information may consist of a summary of  employee terminations with identification of race and sex and the departments  and job titles from which they were terminated.  However, if you have not  compiled the data in this form you may choose to submit them in the form in  which they are available.    Although it is not specified as one of the required contents of the AAP, it  would assist us in conducting the desk audit if you would also attach a copy of  your collective bargaining agreement, if any, or other available information  indicating your policies and procedures governing employee mobility (i.e.  promotions, transfers, etc.).    Figure 2-3:STANDARD INQUIRY LETTER FOR REQUESTING COMPLAINT DATA FROM EEOC  AND STATE AND LOCAL FEPS     Dear:    A compliance review of the following Federal contractor has been scheduled:      The review will audit this contractor's compliance with Executive Order  11246, as amended,  Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended,  the Vietnam Era Veterans Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974 (38 U.S.C. 4212),  and implementing regulations.  The Order and Acts prohibit employment   discrimination and require affirmative action to ensure equal employment  opportunity without regard to race, color, religion, national origin, sex,  disability or status as a special disabled or Vietnam era veteran.    Please forward any information you have concerning complaints filed against  this contractor and/or any other information you may have concerning its EEO  posture which you believe we should consider during the course of the review.

STANDARD COMPLIANCE REVIEW REPORT (SCRR) INSTRUCTIONS     OVERALL SCRR STRUCTURE     This SCRR is both a desk audit and onsite report.  It consists     of three parts: (a) Preparation, (b) Affirmative Action and     (c) Potential Discrimination.     Each part contains analytical sheets, followed by a narrative     summary of problems identified in major review areas.  For prob-    lems not resolved at the conclusion of desk audit, the summary sheets  provide for an investigative plan and a description of onsite  findings/conclusions.  These summary sheets are under-    lined in the following SCRR outline:     PART A:  PREPARATION     Page 1   CRIS, CC-100A     2   Introduction     3   Past Problems/Known Complaints     4   Initial Review of AAP and Support Data     5   Personnel Activity     6   EEO Trend Analysis Worksheet     7   EEO Trend Analysis Narrative     8   Organization of the Contractor's Workforce and Review               of  Support Data on Personnel Practices     PART B: AFFIRMATIVE ACTION     9   Problems with AAP and Support Data    10   Analysis of Affirmative Action Progress     11   Evaluation of Good Faith Effort    12   Implementation of Guidelines on Religion and National     Origin and Sex Discrimination     13   Implementation of Disabled/Veterans Affirmative     Action Requirements     PART C: POTENTIAL DISCRIMINATION     14   Results of Review of Workforce Analysis     15   Impact Ratio Analysis (IRA) Worksheet     16   Compensation/Other Analyses     17   Summary of Potential Discrimination Problems     For convenience when an onsite must be approved by a reviewing     official, an optional Desk Audit Summary is included as page 18.     Also included are the following optional SCRR forms:  for     university reviews, a substitute Personnel Activity and EEO     Trend Analysis worksheet with EEO-6 category headings; a     Technical Requirements worksheet covering all three OFCCP     programs; and a Job Area Acceptance Range (JAAR) worksheet.     How much of this SCRR can be done at desk audit will depend on     the quality of data submitted by the contractor.  It is more     important that all analyses are completed by review close out,     than when in the review process they are completed.     SCRR AS A NARRATIVE REPORT    As noted above, the SCRR is both a desk audit and onsite report.  No  separate onsite narrative is required.  What is required is a narrative  description of onsite findings and conclusions on each problem identified* in  the major review areas of AAP and Support Data, Evaluation of Good Faith Effort  and Potential Discrimina-    tion.  This narrative should be as long or short as the facts of the  situation warrant (and, regardless of length, must be backed up by case file  material).    For example, many problems in a written AAP (page 9) can be adequately  addressed in a sentence or two with a reference to corrected AAP pages.  Even  some potential discrimination problems (p. 17) can be briefly addressed--for  example, an Impact Ratio Analysis (IRA) adverse for female hires that when  refined onsite showed that the women applied after the last opening.  On the  other hand, findings on some problems will require substantially more  elaboration.  This will usually be the case for discrimina-    tion issues that are not resolved through such initial onsite data  refinement.    Where such a longer description of findings is appropriate, the EOS should  briefly summarize findings on the SCRR page (9, 11 or 17, as applicable)* and  attach the fuller narrative description--labeled with the item number to which  it pertains--to that page.**  Some examples of when this narrative is needed and  a description of its contents are given following the instructions for SCRR page  17.    ____________       whether identified at desk audit, but not resolved by the conclusion of  desk audit, or onsite.      *EOSs using word processing equipment, see alternative below.           FOR COMPUTER USERS    OFCCP has developed a computer program for IRAs (p. 15) and JAARs (SCRR  optional worksheet).  Once the EOS identifies the appro-    priate raw data and it is entered into the computer, the math- ematical  calculations called for by these SCRR pages are auto- matically made and a  print-out generated with column headings corresponding to these pages.*  Such  computer-generated pages may be substituted for these SCRR pages.  If you want  further infor-    mation on this program, contact your Regional representative to the OFCCP  Technical Support group or the NO Branch of Special Analysis.    Additionally, computer users may wish to use word processing for the rest of  the SCRR.  A distinct advantage of doing so is that once the form is in the  computer, the space allocated to any page/item is fully flexible--i.e. it can be  tailored to the particular review, thus avoiding the need for continuation  sheets.  For example, on the SCRR pages calling for onsite find-    ings/conclusions (see section above), rather than summarizing findings and  expanding on them in an attachment, simply convert the page to a vertical format  (addressing all headings for problem # 1, then all for problem #2, etc.) and use  whatever amount of space is needed for each problem.    RELATIONSHIP OF SCRR    TO POTENTIAL DISCRIMINATION WORKSHEETS     Sample worksheets and instructions for investigating potential   discrimination are given in Appendix 3A.  Key factors that must be addressed in  such an investigation are highlighted in those instructions.     ________    *For IRAs, in addition to the page 15 headings, this program calculates the  number of standard deviations.  This may be of some assistance in setting  investigative priorities.  However, the number of standard deviations must not  be used either to conclude discrimination has occurred or to conclude that  inves-    tigation is not warranted.  Statistical tests mean nothing apart from the  data to which they are applied, and it is entirely pre-    mature to base either such conclusion on unrefined desk audit data.  See IRA  instructions and ""Interpreting IRA Results"" in this Appendix and, in  Chapter 3, the discussion of refined IRAs and statistical tests for small  numbers.    COMMENTS APPLICABLE TO THE SCRR AS A WHOLE     Format/Administrative    oThose SCRR pages and worksheets that are ""fold-out"" have a  perforation in the middle which divides them into two stand-ard 8 1/2"" X 11""  sheets.  These sheets may be separated at the perforation for ease in copying.   In the copy, the two sides of a sheet (they are labeled ""a"" and ""b""--i.e.  11a, 11b, etc.) should be filed in sequence.     Because of their format, some of these sheets have ""Item #""  columns on both sides to permit cross-referencing in a copy.  The EOS assigns an  item number to each problem identified on the left side of the fold-out and uses  the same item number on the right side of the fold-out.     oSCRR pages which present a conclusion on problem areas have  a final column  labeled ""CLOSE OUT DOCUMENT"" which asks ""Include?"" and ""Para.  #.""  If you plan to address the prob-    lem in a close out document, check ""Include?,"" but leave the ""Para.  #"" column blank until the end of the review.     At the end of the review, examine all problems checked and base the type of  close-out document on the most serious problem.  For example, if there are three  deficiencies, two of which--standing alone--would require a Letter of  Commit-ment (LOC), but the remaining deficiency requires a Concil-  iation  Agreement (CA), use a CA to cover all three defi-    ciencies.  When the close-out document is drafted, go back and insert the  paragraph number in which each problem is addressed.     oEach Area and Field Office should maintain extra copies of those SCRR  analytical pages where additional copies may be needed in the average  review--primarily the Analysis of Affirmative Action Progress and IRA  Worksheets.     Other      oIn a preaward review, as at present, all SCRR analyses are normally  completed onsite.    oMinorities means men and women of those minority groups for whom EEO-1  reporting is required--i.e. Blacks, Hispanics, Asians/Pacific Islanders and  American Indians/Alaskan Natives.  It may mean those groups in the aggregate or  an individual group for whom a problem has been identified (see instructions for  SCRR page 7).  Women means both minority and nonminority women.     oWhen reference is made in the SCRR to a particular item included in an AAP,  the AAP page number(s) should be given.  However, please note that an AAP page  reference, standing alone, is not an adequate response to any question concern-      ing the contractor's implementation of an item (for example, see SCRR page  13 on Implementation of Disabled/Veterans' Affirmative Action Requirements).      PAGE INSTRUCTIONS     PART A:  PREPARATION     PAGE 1:  CRIS, CC-100A    See the Compliance Review Information System (CRIS) Manual for instructions  on completing this page.     PAGE 2:  INTRODUCTION    Item 1 - Establishment Name, Address and CRIS Control #:  Enter the name and  address of the establishment being reviewed.  Also enter the CRIS Control number  assigned to this review on page 1.     Item 2 - Parent Name and Address:  If the establishment being reviewed is  part of a larger firm, enter the name and address of the parent firm.     Item 3 - Labor Area:  Enter the name of the Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) in which the establishment is located or, if it is not in an MSA, enter the name of the county or other  appropriate labor area in which it is located.  Then enter the percent of the labor force within the named geographic area that is female and the percent that is minority (in the aggregate and by each minority group).    Item 4 - Complaints Investigated During Review:  Enter the complaint number  of each complaint you plan to investigate as  part of the compliance review.   This will permit a cross- reference to the Complaint Administration System (CAS)  and to the complaint investigation file.  At the end of the review, check    [  ] those complaints that have been resolved.       NOTE:  Further information on these complaints, and on any other open OFCCP  complaints, will be entered on SCRR page 3.    Item 5 - Contract Establishing OFCCP Jurisdiction:  Enter the indicated  information on the contract which establishes OFCCP jurisdiction.  If a  subcontract is used, under ""Agency"" enter the name of the awarding  agency, then check ""SUB TO"" and enter the name of the prime  contractor.     If you have information on several contracts or subcontracts,  use one in  which the work is performed at the establishment level and/or one with the  highest dollar amount or the most relevant time period.  Where more than one  contract is needed to establish and/or further support coverage, include  information on these contracts in item 8 below (Introductory Statement).     Item 6 - Company Contacts:  List the name, title and phone number of the  corporate and establishment Chief Executive Officer (CEO), and the corporate and  establishment contact persons for Equal Employment Opportunity and Affirmative  Action (EEO/AA) matters.       Item 7 - EEDS Contractor Selection Research Documentation Form:  Check here  to confirm that this Equal Employment Data System (EEDS) form--which indicates  why this contractor was selected for review--is included in the case file.    Item 8 - Introductory Statement:  To the degree known, this should include,  but need not be limited to:     oType of Business.  Describe the nature of the establish-    ment's business--for example, its type of industry, main product line, etc.   If it is part of a larger firm, indicate its relationship with its parent--i.e.  ""part of the Consumer Electronics Division of XYZ Company,"" ""a  subsidiary of ABC, Inc.,"" etc.     Also include any general information on the establishment,  such as its  total employment, whether its workforce is predominantly white-collar or  blue-collar, etc.     If the establishment's AAP covers more than one physical location (i.e.  outstationed sales offices, branch banks, etc.), generally describe those  locations and approximately how many people they employ.     oAdditional Coverage Information.  Include information on any contracts or  subcontracts (beyond that given in item 5 above) needed to establish or further  support OFCCP juris- diction.  If coverage is not based on the establishment's  Federal contracts, but on those of a related entity--such as a parent company, a  subsidiary, or another subsidiary of the parent--identify the entity holding the  Federal contracts and the establishment's relationship to it.     To the degree known, also indicate the main product(s) or service(s)  provided under Federal contracts and the approximate volume of such contracts as  a percentage of the contractor's business.     oLabor Area Characteristics.  Describe any relevant informa-    tion on the labor area in which the Contractor is located.     For example:  minority and/or particular minority group distribution within  that geographic area (i.e.  ""The  largest Hispanic community in the MSA is  in Hillsdale, two miles from the plant."" etc.); availability of public/  private transportation; relevant community resource file information,  including the results of any general contacts with community organizations, etc.      Item 9 - Signature Blocks.  Upon completion of the review, the EOS signs and  dates the report in the space provided.  Upon approval of the report, the Module  Chief and appropriate official (ARA or AOD) sign and date it.     PAGE 3:  PAST PROBLEMS/KNOWN COMPLAINTS    Part I:  PAST PROBLEMS.  Review available Area Office files on any past  OFCCP compliance reviews or complaint investigations of this establishment.  If  there have been no prior reviews or complaints, so state, and no further entries  are needed under this part.  If there have been, complete this Part as follows:      oItem a - Past Problems - Give the date of any past compliance review or complaint investigation and list any major problems identified. If there is a current Conciliation Agreement (CA) or Letter of Commitment  (LOC), include a copy of the CA/LOC monitoring record in this case file and list  here any items that may need further investigation.     oItem b - Recurrence?  Do not complete this item now, but in conducting the  rest of the review, be alert for any indications that a past problem has or has not recurred.  At whatever point in the review you have evidence one way or the other, return to this page and enter  your finding.  If you conclude that a problem has, in fact, recurred, also reference the SCRR page number where your findings are presented in more detail.    EXAMPLE:  A past review resulted in a CA because (1) the  contractor's  workforce analysis was by EEO category rather than  by organizational unit, and  (2) the contractor failed to make a good faith effort to recruit minorities for  professional positions.     If, in reviewing the current AAP (SCRR page 4), you find that the current  workforce analysis is properly by organizational unit, return to this page and  so state in item ""b.""  If contractor records and contacts with  recruitment sources show that the contractor did not list professional jobs, so  state in item ""b"" and refer to the SCRR page where your findings are  discussed (for this problem, normally SCRR page 11 on Evaluation of Good Faith  Effort).     Part II:  KNOWN COMPLAINTS.  Review responses received (to Manual Figure  2-3) from other agencies on any complaints filed against this establishment  since the last OFCCP compliance review.  Also review available Area Office  records of any open OFCCP complaints against this establishment.  If there are  no such complaints, so state, and no further entries are needed in this part.   If there are, complete this Part as follows:     oItem a - For each complaint, indicate with what agency it was filed, its  basis, issue, current status and the area of the contractor's workforce it  appears to concern (i.e. clerical, professional, entry-level blue collar, etc.).      oItem b - Potential Systemic?  Do not complete this item now, but in  conducting the rest of the review, be alert for any indications of a potential  systemic discrimination problem in complaint areas.  At whatever point in the  review you have evidence that there is or is not a potential systemic problem,  return to this page and so state.  If you conclude that there is a potential  systemic problem, refer to the SCRR page where your findings are presented in  more detail.     EXAMPLE:  There is (1) an open EEOC complaint alleging discrim-    ination against women in terminations from Operative jobs, and (2) a State  human rights commission individual complaint alleging failure to hire because of  diabetes.     In the first case, if your Impact Ratio Analysis (IRA) did not show an  adverse IRA for women in Operative terminations, return to this page and so  state in ""b.""  In the second case, if examination of the contractor's  policies concerning diabetes and/or applications of diabetics rejected showed a  systemic problem, return to this page, so state in ""b"" and refer to  the SCRR page where your findings are discussed (for this problem, normally page  13, Part II).     The intent here is not to investigate any complaint filed with other  agencies (or any open OFCCP complaint other than those assigned for  investigation during this review--i.e. those listed in SCRR Introduction, item  4), but rather to be alert for potential systemic problems in complaint areas.      PAGE 4:  INITIAL REVIEW OF AAP AND SUPPORT DATA     Immediately upon receipt of the contractor's initial AAP and support data  submission, review it to ensure there is sufficient information to conduct  subsequent basic analyses of both affirmative action and potential  discrimination issues.     In conducting this initial review, be attentive to any information on the contractor's workforce structure and personnel practices that will be discussed on SCRR page 8.  Such information may be included in the AAP narrative, or may be reflected in the workforce analysis or support data on personnel activity.     Complete this page as follows:     oTimely Receipt:  Indicate whether the Executive Order AAP was received on  time by checking ""YES"" or ""NO.""  If the AAP was received on  time, complete the steps below.  For the Disabled/Veterans' (D/V) AAP, indicate  whether it was received.     If the Executive Order AAP was not received on time, on page 9 (Problems  with AAP and Support Data), indicate the date a Show Cause Notice was issued or,  if not issued, the reason.  If the D/V AAP was not received, on page 9 indicate  the date a 30-day Notice was issued or, if not issued, the reason.  When the  contractor does first submit its AAP(s), complete the steps below.     oIncluded?:  Review the Executive Order AAP and support data and the D/V AAP  to ensure that all listed elements are present.  Beside each item, enter a ""Y""  for yes if it is included, or a ""N"" for no if it is missing.     If an element is missing, no further entries are needed concerning it on  this page since it will automatically be neither ""reasonable"" (if a  central element) nor ""acceptable.""  Note any such missing elements on page 9.     oReasonable?:  Beside each central element of the Executive Order  AAP--Workforce Analysis, Utilization Analysis (and its components) and Current  Goals--enter a ""Y"" or ""N"" to indicate whether the element is reasonable (see OFCCP Federal Contract Compliance Manual--hereafter Manual--Section 2F).      If one or more of these central elements is not reasonable, on page 9  describe the specific problem and give the date a show cause notice was issued  or, if no Show Cause was issued, the reason.  If all central elements were  reason-    able, audit the submission for acceptability.     oAcceptable?:  Beside each listed element, enter a ""Y"" or ""N""  to indicate whether it is acceptable (see Manual, Sections 2G, 2H, and 2I).       If any element is not acceptable, list it on page 9 and describe the  specific problem.     If N, p. 9 Item #:  Beside each listed element with an ""N"" under ""Included,""  ""Reasonable,"" or ""Acceptable,"" give the SCRR page 9 item  number where the specific problem is discussed.     Later contractor corrections to an initial submission need not be recorded  here, but will be recorded on page 9 beside the particu-lar problem.     PAGE 5:  PERSONNEL ACTIVITY TABLE    This worksheet provides an EEO-1 category overview of the con-    tractor's major personnel activity over the last AAP year.  If you are doing  a university review, use the EEO-6 Personnel Activ-ity Table (supplied with this  package), which is the same form, but with EEO-6 category headings.     At the top of the page, enter the dates covered by the personnel activity  data to be recorded below.  The data will normally cover the last full AAP year,  but where data for that period are not available, enter the dates covered by  whatever data are avail-    able.     Enter the number of hires, promotions and terminations by minor-    ity group and sex in each EEO category.  If the category is not in use in  the contractor's workforce, enter N/A; if it is in use but had no activity,  enter ""no activity;"" if the contractor did not maintain data for the  category, enter ""no data.""     This information, together with the historical workforce data in the EEO  Trend Analysis (below), provides a framework for later review of affirmative  action progress and employment activity by job group.  Also, since both these  data and EEO trend data are by particular minority group, they can help identify  any potential problems for a particular minority group.    PAGE 6:  EEO TREND ANALYSIS WORKSHEET     This worksheet permits an assessment of net change in minority and female  representation over both the long-term (comparing the earliest EEDS EEO category  data with current data) and the short-term (comparing data for the beginning of  the last full AAP year with current data).     The appropriate EEDS report for EEO-1 data is EEO20; for EEO-6  data, EEO69.   EEO-1 categories are indicated beside the data entry space.  If you are doing a  university review, use the EEO-6 Trend Analysis Worksheet (included with this  package), which is the same form but with EEO-6 category headings.     At the top of the page beside A, enter the date of the earliest data on the  current EEDS report; beside B, the date of the beginning of the last full AAP  year; and beside C, the date of the end of the last full AAP year.     NOTE:  If the contractor has not previously been required to maintain an  AAP, for B use the date of its latest EEO-1 or EEO-6 submission shown on the  current EEDS report; and for C, the date of its most recent EEO-1 or EEO-6  submission not yet shown on EEDS.     To complete this page, for each EEO category and for the total workforce,  make the following entries:     oLine A - Enter the earliest data shown in the current EEDS report, then  calculate and enter the percentage of women and of minorities.     oLine B -  Enter data for the beginning of the last full AAP year, then  calculate and enter the percentage of women and of minorities.     oLine C - Enter data for the end of the last full AAP year, then calculate  and enter the percentage of women and of minorities.     The EOS may wish to make notes on net change and/or white collar and blue  collar subtotals, etc. preparatory to completing the     EEO Trend Analysis Narrative below.    PAGE 7:  EEO TREND ANALYSIS NARRATIVE    At the top of the page, check whether the data are from EEO-1 or EEO-6  information.  Then complete the narrative as follows:     Item 1 - EEO Trends     (a)Total Workforce:  Over the long-term (line A vs. line C on the preceding  worksheet), has the contractor's overall work-force been relatively stable or  has it been expanding or contracting?  If one of the latter, how substantial has  the change been?  Has it been due to marked expansion or con-    traction in particular categories?  What has the change been in the  representation of minorities and women in the over-    all workforce?  As a percent of total?  Numerically?     Address the same questions as above concerning short-term total workforce  trends (Line B vs. Line C on the preceding worksheet).     (b)White Collar:  Over the long and short-term, what has the change been for  minorities in the white collar workforce?  What has the change been for women in  nontraditional white collar categories (normally white collar exclusive of  Office and Clerical and retail Sales)?  Have there been notable minority/female  gains or losses in particular categories?  Give particular attention to  Officials and Managers and Professionals (and any other categories normally  considered favorable in the industry involved).     (c)Blue Collar:  Over the long and short-term, what have the changes been  for minorities and women in the blue collar workforce?  Have there been notable  minority/female gains or losses in particular categories?  Give particular  attention to Crafts.     NOTE:  In discussing short-term trends above, also consider the level and  type of personnel activity shown on page 5.  Lack of short-term progress may be  tied to few hiring/promotion oppor-    tunities in a category over the last AAP year; or to termina-    tions cancelling out hiring gains.  Such observations can help provide a  framework for later analyses by job group of goals (SCRR page 10) and employment  activity (IRAs, SCRR page 15).     Also, in considering page 5, note any obvious major discrepancies that may  need clarification.  For example, if a category shows a short-term gain of 50  persons, but page 5 shows little or no hiring in the category during the AAP  year, you may wish to ask the contractor the source of the growth.     Item 2 - EEO Category Patterns:  Are there any EEO categories in which  minorities or women have been persistently concentrated?  Are there other  categories in which minorities or women appear to be substantially  underrepresented?  In making these assessments, rely upon your general knowledge  of the contractor's labor area, type of business/skill needs, and the  representation of minor-    ities and women in possible feeder categories.     The intent here is not to make comparisons with some hypothetical ""category""  availability (which is inappropriate), but again, to establish a broad framework  for later examination of job groups within those categories, workforce patterns  and IRAs.     For example, if there are very few women in Crafts but many in Operatives,  the EOS is forewarned to look at the types of jobs    in Crafts; the distribution of women vs. men in Operative job     groups/departments/lines of progression; and the volume and type of promotions  from Operatives to Crafts.     Item 3 - Particular Minority Groups:  Identify any substantial disparity in  the representation of a particular minority group or men or women of a  particular minority group.  Is any such dispar-ity present in the workforce as a  whole or only in certain EEO categories?  In making this assessment, as above,  consider the representation of particular minority groups in the contractor's  labor area and in possible internal feeder categories.  Where you observe such a  disparity, plan to conduct standard desk audit discrimination analyses by the  particular minority group (rather than by minorities in the aggregate), at least  in those work-    force areas where the disparity exists and for the type of activ-ity most  likely to have created the disparity.  For example:    -  The contractor is located in a labor area that is 20% minority, composed  of 9% Blacks, 9% Hispanics and 2%     others.  Although the contractor has a large number of jobs probably filled  locally, it historically has employed less than 1% Hispanics.  Under these  circumstances, the EOS should plan to conduct all hiring IRAs specifically for  Hispanics.    -  The contractor has a predominantly blue collar workforce with good  overall minority representation.  However, Blacks are concentrated in Laborers,  poorly represented in Opera-    tives and absent in Crafts.  Under these circumstances, the EOS should:  (1)  in reviewing the workforce analysis, plan to identify blue collar jobs held by  Blacks and whether there is any structural/potential placement problem impeding  their upward mobility, and (2) plan to conduct blue collar IRAs (particularly  for hiring and promotion into Operatives and Craft job groups) separately for  Blacks.    Further discussion of separate minority group analyses is given in the  instructions for SCRR page 14 (Review of Workforce Analy-    sis) and SCRR page 15 (IRAs).  Please also note that if onsite investigation  of such a disparity does not indicate potential discrimination, the EOS should  then consider whether the imbal-    ance warrants separate affirmative action steps--whether goals and/or  specific action programs--for the group (see 41 CFR    60-2.12(l)).    PAGE 8:  ORGANIZATION OF CONTRACTOR'S WORKFORCE AND    REVIEW OF SUPPORT DATA ON PERSONNEL PRACTICES      The intent of this page is to describe those aspects of the par-    ticular contractor's structure and practices which will influence the  interpretation of both affirmative action and potential dis-    crimination issues.  DO NOT ADDRESS RACIAL OR SEX DISTRIBUTION ON THIS PAGE.      oItem 1:  Organization of Contractor's Workforce - Describe how the  contractor's workforce is organized using whatever information is available in  the contractor's AAP and support data (if there is an organization chart,  indicate where it is located in the AAP or case file).     If the contractor's AAP narrative is not helpful, scan the workforce  analysis to identify (a) major organizational units--i.e. those containing the  largest number of employ-    ees, and (b) the type of work that appears to be performed in these major  units.     Also identify any possible formal/informal lines of pro-    gression (LOPs).  If the contractor has not included pro-    gression line charts in its AAP, a union contract(s) may include information  on LOPs.  If neither source is helpful, does the workforce analysis show any  indicators of possible LOPs (for example, sequenced job titles--Assembler A, B,  C; Assistant Teller, Teller, Senior Teller; Scientist I, II, III, etc.)?     oItem 2:  Internal Mobility - Review the contractor's AAP and support data  on personnel practices for any information on how personnel processes work at  the establishment, with particular attention to internal mobility:     (a)Does the contractor indicate that it posts or otherwise makes job  openings known?  How?  At what levels?  Who is eligible to bid/apply?  What  factors are considered in choosing among internal candidates?     (b)Specifically address whether the contractor has one or more collective  bargaining agreements.  If it does, with what union(s)?  Covering what areas of  the work-    force?  Involving what provisions for promotion/transfer, layoff/recall, etc.?     (c)Also, review the contractor's hiring and promotion activity to identify:          Which job groups/areas have had the largest number of hires during the  past year?  Are there job groups  which have been filled only or almost  exclusively by hire?        Which job groups/areas have had the largest number of promotions during  the past year? Are there job groups which have been filled only or almost  exclusively by promotion?          oItem 3:  Pay Structure  - How is the contractor's pay system structured in  major portions of the workforce?  For example, are blue collar jobs paid by  grade level?  If so, what is the lowest and highest grade?  Are salaried jobs  organized into rate ranges identified by letter code?  If so, what is the lowest  and highest letter code?     PART B:  AFFIRMATIVE ACTION    PAGE 9:  PROBLEMS WITH AAP AND SUPPORT DATA     At the top of the page, check whether the page concerns the Executive Order  AAP and support data, the D/V AAP or both, then complete the columns as follows:      o# (a):  Assign a number to each problem identified as a  result of your  initial review of the contractor's AAP and support data submission (SCRR page  4).     oAAP AND SUPPORT DATA PROBLEMS (b):  Briefly describe each problem, and  indicate  whether it is that the AAP or support data item was not  included, was  not reasonable or was not acceptable.  This description should be specific  enough for a reader to clearly understand the issue involved--i.e. ""Current  goals are lower than the contractor's availability estimates in four  Professional job groups,"" NOT ""Goals are unacceptable.""     oACTION TAKEN and/or PLAN TO RESOLVE (c):  Describe the action(s) you have  taken or plan to take to resolve the problem.  For example, if the contractor  failed to submit     an Executive Order AAP, the normal entry would be ""Show Cause issued  (date),"" followed by ""AAP submitted (date).""  For an unacceptable  AAP or support data ingredient, the entry may be ""Called M. Jones to  request (appropriate revision) be made and ready onsite.""     Leave enough room between entries in this column to allow  for a description  of any probable subsequent desk audit developments.  For example, if the problem  is ""No informa-    tion on what job titles fall in what job groups,""  and the action is ""Called  S. Smith 9/5 to obtain listing of titles within group,"" a subsequent desk  audit development may be ""Received listing 9/10.""     oOnsite? (d):  Check those items that will require onsite follow-up.  These  checked items will be your onsite plan  for resolution of AAP and support data  problems.    NOTE:  Your onsite review must include confirmation of the contractor's  implementation of its AAP commitments (see Manual Section 3G01).  If onsite you  identify a problem with AAP implementation that is not covered elsewhere in the  SCRR,* add it to this page.  Enter ""ONS"" for onsite in column ""b""  and complete the other columns as indicated.    ONSITE    o# (e):  Enter the same item number assigned to this problem in column (a).      oFindings/Conclusions (f):  For each AAP and support data  problem for which  you checked onsite, enter your onsite  findings and conclusions.  For example,  if the problem were that the contractor's availability analysis appeared to   give insufficient weight to internal availability, you may note that an onsite  sample of records showed that the  majority of incumbents in the job group had  entered via promotion rather than new hire.    Where a fuller narrative description of findings (and/or resolution, column  (h) below) is needed, attach it to this page (labeled with the item number to  which it pertains).     oResolved? (g):  Enter ""Y"" for yes or ""N"" for no to  indicate whether the problem with the AAP or support data has been resolved.      ________    *AAP implementation issues covered elsewhere are those pertaining to:  (1)  good faith efforts on goals (SCRR p. 11); (2) the Sex Discrimination Guidelines  (SCRR p. 12); (3) Disabled/Veterans requirements (SCRR p. 13); and technical  requirements (if you use the SCRR optional worksheet on Technical Requirements).      oResolution (h):  If the problem has been resolved, describe the resolution.   For example, ""Contractor increased the weight of internal availability in  XYZ job group from 2% to 60% resulting in the following corrected final  availability figures:  Minorities - originally 10%, corrected to 20%; Women -  originally 5%, corrected to 30%.""  If the problem has not been resolved,  discuss the contractor's position on the matter and the actions you are  recommending.    oAAP or Other Reference Pages (i):  When a resolution has been reached,  indicate here the pages of the AAP, support data or other document in which the  resolution is incorporated.     oClose-Out Document (j-k):  If you plan to include the problem in a  close-out document, check ""Include?.""  Leave the ""Para. #""  column blank until the end of the review.     PAGE 10:  ANALYSIS OF AFFIRMATIVE ACTION PROGRESS    Prior Year AAP/Current Year AAP    This page is divided horizontally into two parts:  (I) Goals,    and (II) Workforce Change.  Part I is mandatory; Part II is optional.  Enter  data on job groups for which goals were established.     Prior year goals must always be addressed (unless the contractor was not  previously covered by 41 CFR Part 60-2).  Both prior and current year must be  addressed if the contractor was six months or more into its current AAP year at  the time it received the Scheduling Letter.     At the top of the page, check the appropriate box to indicate whether the  data are for the prior year or the current year. Enter the starting and ending  dates of the period involved and then complete this page as follows:     Part I - Goals:     oEEO Category (a):  Enter the initials or number of the EEO-1 or EEO-6  category in which the job group falls.  Goals should normally be analyzed by job  group within EEO category order, i.e. job groups within Officials and Managers first, then job  groups within Professionals, etc.     oJob Group (b):  Enter the name of the job group being analyzed.     oGoal (c):  Enter the minority/female percentage placement goal.*    oTotal Placements (d):  Enter the total number of placements into the job  group during the AAP year.     oExpected (Placements) (e):  Enter the number of minorities or women who  would have been placed under the percentage placement goal.  To find this  expected number of placements,    multiply the total placements (d) by the goal (c).  Round down to the  nearest whole number (i.e. 0.1 = 0, 11.7 = 11, 0.4 = 0, etc.).     EXAMPLE:  For the Crafts I job group, ABC Company set a goal of 10% for  minorities and 5% for women.  During the AAP year, there were 50 placements into  the job group.  For minorities, you would have expected 5 place-    ments (.10 X 50); for women you would have    expected 2 (.05 X 50 = 2.5 = 2).     oActual (Placements) (f):  Enter the actual number of placements into the job group during the AAP year who were minor-ity/female.     oDifference (g):  Subtract the actual number of placements of  minorities/women (f) from the expected number of placements (e) to find the  difference--preceded by a plus (+) or minus (-) sign.     EXAMPLE:        Expected     Actual     Diff.     Minorities         5           6         +1        Women              2           1         -1     Part II - Workforce Change:  As noted above, this portion is  optional.  It  can be useful in focusing attention on job groups where, although there has been  progress in placements, there has been little or no improvement in minority or  female representa-    tion.  This normally is caused by disproportionate minority or    _________    *If the AAP specifies a goal for a particular minority group or for men or  women of a particular minority group, either change the line heading here from ""Min.""  to an abbreviation for the identified group or use another copy of this page to  evaluate goals progress for the identified group.    female movement out of the job group, whether for positive (pro-motions out)  or negative (terminations) reasons, and alerts the EOS to look at Impact Ratio  Analysis (IRA) results for the job group.     Complete this portion of the page as follows:     oBeginning Workforce (h-i):  In column (h) enter the total number of  employees and in column (i), the total number of minorities and the total number  of women in each job group at the beginning of the AAP year.     oEnding Workforce (j-k):  In column (j) enter the total number of employees  and in column (k), the total number of minorities and the total number of women  in each job group at the end of the AAP year.     oNet Change (l-m):  In column (l) enter the difference be-    tween the beginning and ending total workforce in the job group.  ln column  (m), enter the difference between the minority and female beginning and ending  workforce in the job group, preceded by a plus (+) or minus (-) sign.     PAGE 11:  EVALUATION OF GOOD FAITH EFFORT     Evaluate the contractor's overall affirmative action performance.  Was there  progress in most areas where goals were established?  for minorities?  for  women?  for both?  In areas with little progress, are there any balancing  factors such as strong perform-ance in similar or higher level jobs within the  category or generally?  Do performance problems fall in categories with poor  long-term trends (compare SCRR p. 6)?     In evaluating fulfillment of AAP commitments, consider the  quality of those  commitments in terms of their probable long-    range as well as short-range contribution to improving the contractor's  affirmative action posture.  Also consider whether the contractor has used  positive problem solving to help remove any impediments to minority/female  utilization, vs. continued adherence to strategies that are not working.     As a result of this evaluation, identify any goal areas needing further  evaluation for good faith effort.  Complete the remainder of this page as  follows:     o# (a):  Assign an item number to the goal area which needs further  evaluation for good faith effort.     oGOAL AREA (b):  Enter the name of the goal area.  A goal area may be a job  group or a cluster of job groups with similar AAP commitments to be evaluated  for good faith effort.  For example, if the contractor committed to recruit  minority technicians from XYZ organization, and showed little progress in  several technician jobs groups, the goal area may be ""Technician (Elec.,  Mech., Test).""     oMIN./FEM. (c):  Indicate whether the goal(s) involved was for minorities,  for women or for both.  If it was for members of a particular minority group,  enter an abbrevia-    tion for the group.    oPR/CURR YR (d):  Indicate whether the goal(s) needing further evaluation  for good faith effort was for the prior year, the current year or both.     oPOSSIBLE CAUSES/PERTINENT AAP COMMITMENTS (e):  Review any contractor  description of good faith effort pertinent to the goal area.  Also review data  on employment activity in the area, and any relevant AAP information on  personnel prac-    tices/workforce structure.     What appear to be the reasons for the lack of progress?  What AAP  commitments would have helped?  For example:     -If jobs in the area were filled predominantly by hire,  does it appear that  insufficient applicant flow was the problem?  If so, does the contractor's  explanation ad-    dress recruitment efforts?  Were any commitments made in the prior AAP  concerning recruitment?  Were they  fulfilled?     -If most openings were via promotion, was there an adequate supply of  minorities/women in feeder jobs?  If so, did the contractor make any AAP  commitments con-    cerning the promotion process relevant to the area,  such as a commitment  to:  identify promotable minor-    ities/women (skills inventory); increase promotability (training, job  rotation); encourage upward mobility (counseling, encouraging bidding), etc.?   Were any such commitments fulfilled?     NOTE:  Where the problem is the candidate pool (low appli- cant flow, few  minorities/women in feeder jobs), the issue is normally affirmative action  (recruitment, goals at the feeder group level).     However, where the candidate pool is adequate, either affirmative action or  discrimination may be the issue, so pay close attention to the area involved  when conducting IRA analyses.  If you find an adverse IRA in the goal area    involved, pursue the matter first as a potential discrimin-ation issue, and  note that you are doing so here.  Only if you do not find discrimination, return  to complete this evaluation of good faith effort for the goal area.     oADDITIONAL INFORMATION NEEDED (f):  Describe the additional information you  will need to evaluate the contractor's good faith effort.  For example, records  of recruitment efforts, contact with community organizations to confirm  appropriate job listings, etc.  If you have obtained sufficient addi-    tional information at desk audit to conclude there was good faith effort, so  indicate here.     oONS (g):  Check here those items that will require onsite follow-up.  These  checked items will be your onsite plan for evaluation of good faith effort.       ONSITE    o# (h):  Enter the same number assigned to this item in column (a).     oFINDINGS (i):  Discuss your onsite findings on whether the contractor made  a good faith effort in the goal area.  For example, ""Contractor placed  timely and accurate job listings with the major community organizations  specified in its AAP, but received no referrals for this job group.  This was  con-firmed by contact with XYZ referral sources who cited a scarcity of  candidates with the skill specialty involved.""     Where a fuller description of findings (and/or the discus-    sion in column (k) below) is needed, attach it to this page (labeled with  the item number to which it pertains).    oGFE? (Good Faith Effort) (j):  Indicate by entering ""Y"" for yes  or ""N"" for no whether you conclude the contractor made a good faith  effort in this goal area.  If you conclude the contractor made a good faith  effort, no further entries are needed on this sheet, unless you have reached an  agreement with the contractor to take supplementary actions to help improve the  chances of progress during the next AAP year (if so, describe in the next  column).     oIF NO, SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION, CONTRACTOR POSITION, EVALUATION (k):  If  you conclude the contractor did not make a good faith effort, supply any  background information that may provide perspective on the lack of good faith  effort.     For example, ""This job group is seriously underutilized for minorities  (10% incumbency, 20% availability), and has been for at least the last three  years.  The contractor had adequate openings to make progress, but has  consistently failed to take steps to increase minority applicant flow for the  jobs involved, etc.""     Also discuss and evaluate the contractor's position on the matter.     oClose-Out Document (l-m):  If you plan to include the problem in a close  out document, check ""Include?.""  Leave the ""Para. #"" column  blank until the end of the review.    PAGE 12:  IMPLEMENTATION OF GUIDELINES ON RELIGION    AND NATIONAL ORIGIN AND SEX DISCRIMINATION     Verify the contractor's implementation of the Guidelines on Religion and  National Origin and the Sex Discrimination Guide-    lines.  In both cases it is only necessary here to address those policies  and practices that are not covered elsewhere in your evaluation of the  contractor's compliance with the Executive Order--for example, maternity leave  policy, leave for religious purposes, etc.  Since the contractor is not required  to address 41 CFR Part 60-50 in its AAP, and may or may not include a copy of  leave policies, evaluation of these items and their implemen-    tation is normally done onsite.    If, while verifying this implementation, you identify a potential  discrimination issue, check [  ] ""Pot. Disc."" and include the problem  on page 17, ""Summary of Potential Discrimination Problems.""     PAGE 13:  IMPLEMENTATION OF DISABLED/VETERANS    AFFIRMATIVE ACTION REQUIREMENTS      Determine if the contractor has fully implemented its obligations under the  individuals with disabilities and veterans programs.     Part I:     oDescribe Contractor Actions/How Verified:  For each listed  regulatory  item, indicate the actions the contractor has taken, and briefly state how you  made your determination.      For example, in item 4 concerning the Mandatory Job Listing requirement  under the veterans' program, a verification may    be:  ""9/7/88 conversation with J. Smith, Vets. Rep. at the Odgen County  State Employment Service office, confirms contractor's listing of suitable jobs.""      If you determine that the contractor has not taken adequate action, briefly  describe the problem and, if resolved, its resolution.     oProblem?  (D/V):  Enter an ""D"" for disabled, a ""V"" for  veterans, or ""D/V"" for both, to identify the program under which the  contractor has not taken adequate action on the item.     oResolved?:  Enter ""Y"" for yes or ""N"" for no to indicate  whether the problem has been resolved.     oClose-Out Document:  If you intend to include this item in  a close-out  document, check ""Include?.""  Leave the ""Para. #"" column  blank until the end of the review.       Part II:      The purpose of this part is to identify any contractor personnel  practices  or job requirements which may be screening out quali-    fied individuals with disabilities or special disabled veterans, including  those who could have performed the jobs involved given reasonable accommodation.      1.Determine if the contractor has any blanket medical stand-    ards, or medical standards applicable to particular jobs.     Such standards may be incorporated in a policy manual, a manual for medical  personnel or in position descriptions/    qualification standards.  They also may be identifiable through rejections  of persons with certain medical condi-    tions based on responses to application form medical ques-    tions and/or on results of physical examinations.     If you identify a medical standard, indicate the job(s) to which it applies,  and ask the contractor for the results of its review determining that the  standard is job related, consistent with business necessity and with the safe  per- formance of the job.     Evaluate the contractor's response.  If it does not adequately demonstrate  that the standard is job related, consistent with business necessity and with  the safe  performance of the job, include the matter on page 17, ""Summary  of Potential Discrimination Problems.""     Make sure the case file includes any available information relevant to  supporting your conclusions--such as any position description for the jobs  involved, notes on your worksite observations, copies of any physical tests used  and their instructions, etc.--along with standard information on discriminatee  qualifications.     Appendix A to Chapter 6 provides some guidance on the types of information  to obtain about the job and about rejectees who have disabilities or are special  disabled veterans.  Additional guidance will be issued in the future on  assessing job relatedness, business necessity and safety claims as they relate  to the Section 503/4212 programs.    2.In the course of your review above, also identify any qualified  individuals with disabilities or special disabled veterans who could have  performed the job(s) involved given reasonable accommodation to their  disability.  If you identify such persons, include the matter on page 17, ""Summary  of Potential Discrimination Problems.""     Appendix A to Chapter 6 also provides guidance on the types of information  to obtain in evaluating whether the con-    tractor has provided reasonable accommodation, and further guidance will be  issued in this area in the future.    This page, particularly Part II, is normally completed onsite.    PART C:  POTENTIAL DISCRIMINATION    PAGE 14:  RESULTS OF REVIEW OF WORKFORCE ANALYSIS     Review the contractor's workforce analysis to identify patterns of minority  and female employment.  Identify and discuss poten-    tial problem areas where minorities/women are underrepresented or  concentrated.     To focus this review, use the results of your earlier SCRR ana-    lyses such as:     1.EEO Trend Analysis Narrative (SCRR page 7).    (a)  Category Patterns.  Pay particular attention to areas with persistent  representation of minorities or women substantially above or below probable  availability.  Using an earlier example with many women in Operatives but few in  Crafts, what types of jobs are in Crafts?  At the Operative level, are men and  women in different types of jobs (which may have different progression  opportunities--see 2 below)?     (b)  Particular Minority Groups.  Pay specific attention to the distribution  of a particular minority group in areas where you identified a substantial  disparity in the repre-    sentation of that group.  Using an earlier example with Blacks concentrated  in Laborers, poorly represented in Operatives, and absent in Crafts,  specifically identify the blue collar jobs held by Blacks and look for any  structural (see 2 below)/potential placement problems that may be inhibiting  upward mobility.    Even when such disparities are not observed in the initial category screen,  if the labor area has a high representa-    tion of more than one minority group and/or the general employment patterns  in the industry involved have differed among minority groups, in reviewing the  workforce analysis the EOS should be alert for any indications of potential  problems in the distribution of a particular minority group.      2.Organization of the Contractor's Workforce and Review of Support Data on  Personnel Practices (SCRR page 8).  Focus on minority group and female  employment patterns in those work-force areas relevant for this particular  contractor.  Among the possibilities are:  departments/units; possible lines of  progression (LOP's); grade or salary levels; supervisory positions vs. those  supervised; etc.  For example:     (a)If the contractor has possible LOPs, are minorities and women fairly  evenly distributed among LOPs or are they concentrated in ones that offer less  favorable pay or  progression?  If there is no problem in distribution among  LOPs, are minorities/women within LOPs fairly  evenly distributed or are they  clustered toward the bottom?     (b)If departments or units are relevant in determining eligibility for  promotion (or other employment acti-    vity), how are minorities/women distributed among those departments or  units?  Where department/unit seniority is used for promotion, layoff or other  purposes, how are minorities/women distributed among the departments or units?      Please note that even where plant seniority is used for promotion, if it is  exercised first within the depart-    ment where the opening occurs it can limit access to more favorable  departments (since, in practice, all but entry-level and/or undesirable jobs may  be filled with-in the department).     (c)If the contractor announces job openings up to a certain salary level, is  there any marked drop in minority or female representation above that level?      The type of questions to ask and patterns to look for will be different in  each compliance review (as will the quality of desk  audit data) depending on  the organization and practices of the  particular contractor.  The important  thing is to focus on the factors pertinent to that contractor.     DISCUSSION OF RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN     REVIEW OF WORKFORCE ANALYSIS AND IRAS     The workforce analysis essentially reflects employment activity  over an  extended period of time, while IRAs reflect that activity during the most recent  period.  Therefore, pay particular atten-    tion to IRAs in those areas where review of the workforce analy-    sis showed marked underrepresentation or concentration of minor-    ities or women.     For example, in a seriously underrepresented job area, an adverse hiring  and/or promotion IRA suggests that any problem may be  longstanding and, if  discrimination is found, there are likely to be victims within the normal  liability period (with or without a showing of continuing violation).     Or, in a concentrated job area, an adverse promotion IRA may reflect  differing opportunities for minorities or women to move up and out of the area.   This may suggest a structural problem--    i.e. a present policy or practice inhibiting movement--that may constitute  discrimination as well as a continuing violation.    In any event, be aware of possible connections between what you observe in  the workforce analysis and the results of the IRA analysis below.    PAGE 15:  IMPACT RATIO ANALYSIS (IRA) WORKSHEET     GENERAL COMMENTS     The Impact Ratio Analysis (IRA) is a comparison of the selection rates of  different groups from an identified candidate pool.  If  the selection rate for  one group is less than 80% of that for another, the IRA is adverse.     The following mathematical procedure is used to calculate an     IRA:       Find the selection rate for minorities/women by dividing their number of  selectees by their number in the candidate pool.       Find the selection rate for others by dividing their number of selectees by  their number in the candidate pool.       Compare the selection rate for minorities/women to the rate for others.  As  a matter of administrative discre-tion in compliance reviews, OFCCP will focus  on situa-         tions in which the selection rate for minorities or women is less favorable  than the rate for others.*  For positive actions such as hires and promotions,  this will be where the minority or female rate is lower; for negative actions,  such as terminations, it will be where the minority or female rate is higher.      4.Consistent with #3 above, the IRA is calculated when the selection rate  for minorities/women is less favor- able.  Therefore, to find the IRA for  positive     personnel actions, divide the lower minority/female rate by the rate for  others; for negative personnel actions, divide the rate for others by the higher  minority/female rate.    5.If the result of #4 above is less than .8, the IRA is adverse for  minorities or women.     When, and ONLY when an IRA is adverse, this worksheet calls for  an  additional calculation of how many minorities or women poten-    tially were affected.  This, when considered in conjunction with other  review information, may assist in setting investigative priorities.     IRAs may be conducted for women vs. men, for minorities in the aggregate vs.  nonminorities, or for a particular minority  group.**  Where your earlier review  of EEO trends (SCRR page 7) identified a substantial disparity in the  representation of a     _________    *The EOS should be aware, however, that sometimes a more favor-    able rate for minorities or women may indicate a ""channeling"" into  different and perhaps less favorable jobs than others.    **While desk audit IRAs may be based on minorities in the aggre-    gate, an onsite finding of discrimination must identify the par-    ticular minority group(s) against whom discrimination is alleged (see  Appendix 3A instructions for Worksheet 17-1 on onsite refinement of IRAs).    particular minority group, IRAs should be conducted separately for that  group at least in the workforce area(s) where the disparity was observed and for  the type of activity most likely to have caused the disparity.  For example:      -If the disparity you observed was a historical absence of a particular  minority group, all hiring IRAs should be con-    ducted separately for that group.    -If the disparity was that Hispanics have historically been well represented  in Professional jobs but absent from Man-    agement, your IRAs for promotions and hires into Management job groups  should be conducted separately for Hispanics.    -If the disparity was that over the past year the represen-    tation of Black Technicians declined dramatically, termina-    tion IRAs (and probably promotion and hire IRAs also) in Technician job  groups should be conducted separately for Blacks.    Even where such a disparity was not observed in the initial category screen,  where the labor area has a high representation of more than one minority group  and/or the general employment patterns in the industry involved have differed  among minority     groups, in reviewing the contractor's activity data preparatory to  conducting IRA, the EOS should be alert for any indications of potential  problems in selections of a particular minority group.    IMPORTANT:  Remember that an adverse IRA is only a preliminary indicator of  a potential discrimination problem.  For example, a job group IRA may measure  selection for jobs with differing qual-ification standards and consequent  differing candidate pools.  These matters need to be explored further (normally  onsite) before any conclusions can be reached.     IRA INSTRUCTIONS      At the top of this sheet enter the names of the groups whose selection rates  you are comparing (minorities vs. nonminorities; women vs. men; Blacks vs.  Others, etc.) and, in the ""Rate for:"" headings for columns (b) and  (c), an abbreviation for those groups.  Also enter the dates covered by the  employment activity data and the date of the incumbency data you are using  (incum-    bency data should, to the extent possible, be from the beginning of the  activity period), then complete this sheet as follows.     Job Area (a):  Enter the name of the job area being analyzed. Assuming this  is a job group, also indicate the EEO-1/6 category  to which it belongs.     HIRES     The hiring rate of a group is the number of that group who were hired  divided by the number of that group who applied.     oRate for: (b):  Enter the hiring rate for minorities, members of a  particular minority group or women (include both numbers and percent).     oRate for: (c):  Enter the hiring rate for others (include both numbers and  percent).     If the minority/female hiring rate is lower than that for others, compute  the IRA [(d) below].  If the minority/female rate is higher, no further entries  are required.    oIRA (d):  Since this is a positive personnel action, divide the lower  minority/female rate by the rate for others.     If the IRA is .8 or more, STOP.  No further entries are needed for this IRA.   Complete the remaining columns ONLY if the IRA is less than .8.     oOverall Rate (e):  Find the overall hiring rate by dividing the total  number of hires by the total number of     applicants.     oExpected (f):  Enter the number of minorities/women who would have been  hired if all persons had been hired at the same rate.  To get this number,  multiply the overall rate (e) by the number of minority or female applicants  [the denominator in (b)].  Round the result down to the nearest whole number  (i.e. 4.3 = 4; 0.7 = 0, etc.).    oActual (g):  Enter the actual number of minorities or women hired.     oDifference (h):  Subtract the actual number from the expect-ed number and  enter the difference.  This is how many addi-    tional minorities or women you would expect to have been hired if all groups  had been hired at the same rate.     If the difference is zero, leave this column blank, and the IRA need not be  pursued further.     EXAMPLE:  1 of 10 women were hired (10%), 5 of 10 men  were hired (50%).   The IRA is .2 (.10/.50).     Since there were 6 total hires (1 woman + 5 men), and 20 total applicants  (10 women + 10 men)--the overall hiring rate was 6/20 or 30%.     If men and women had been hired at the same rate, you would have expected  30% of the 10 female applicants--or 3--to have been hired.  Since the actual  number hired was 1, the difference is 2--i.e. 2 women may not have been hired  because of potential discrimination.     Your IRA sheet for this example would look like this:    PROMOTIONS      Following the same procedure as for hires, enter the promotion rates for  minorities, members of a particular minority group or women and the promotion  rate for others, then, if the minority/    female rate is lower, divide it by the rate for others.  If the resulting  IRA is less than .8, use the same method as for hires to determine overall rate,  expected, actual and difference.     Please note, however, that to analyze promotion data sensibly, you must:   (1) know how the contractor has defined promotions, and (2) draw on the results  of your Review of Personnel Practices (SCRR page 8), to develop some idea of  what the probable candi-    date pool was for the promotions involved.     For example, if you have data on promotion to Crafts II (mid-    level), you may determine based on your earlier review of person-nel  practices that the prime candidate pool is probably Crafts I (lowest level).  In  that case your IRA would be as follows:      EXAMPLE:     Total  Min.  Nonmin.     Promotions to Crafts II   12     2  9     Persons in Craft I    50    10 40     The minority rate is the number of minority promotions to  Crafts lI,  divided by the number of minorities in Crafts I-- i.e. 2/10 or 20%.     The nonminority rate is the number of nonminority promotions to Crafts II  divided by the number of nonminorities in  Crafts I--i.e. 9/40 or 22.5%.     To find the IRA, divide the minority rate by the nonminority rate--here,  .20/.225 or .89.     Since the IRA is not adverse, no further entries are needed and your IRA  sheet would look like this:    Obviously, you can only conduct this analysis if you can make a fair guess  at what the appropriate feeder pool is for promotion, and you would need to  confirm the accuracy of that guess onsite.  If you cannot make any preliminary  determination of probable feeder groups for promotion, you should wait until you  are     onsite to conduct this portion of the IRA.     TERMINATIONS     Follow the same procedures as for hires and promotions, except that:        Since this is a negative personnel action, the IRA is conducted when the  rate for minorities, members of a particular minority group, or women is higher  than the rate for others.      To find the IRA, divide the termination rate for others by the higher  minority/female rate.       If the IRA is adverse, when you find the expected number, round the result  up* to the nearest whole number (i.e. 0.3 = 1; 6.8 = 7; etc.).       Since in an adverse termination situation, you would expect fewer  minorities/women to have terminated, subtract the expected number from the  actual.          EXAMPLE: 6 of 40 women terminated (15%); 1 of 10 men terminated (10%), for  an IRA of .10./.15 or .67.     Since the IRA is less than .8, find the overall termination rate by dividing  the 7 total terminations (6 women + 1 man) by the 50 total incumbents (40 women  + 10 men)--i.e. 7/50 or 14%.    Multiply the overall rate by the number of female incumbents to find the  number of women you would have expected to ter-    minate--i.e. .14 x 40 or 5.6 = 6.     Since the expected number is 6 and 6 women actually terminated, the  difference is zero, and the IRA need not be pursued further.     _______    *The reason for rounding up here (vs. down on hires and promo-    tions) is to eliminate ""fractional persons.""  For example, in a  positive action, with 3.7 expected hires and 3 actual, the dif-    ference would be .7 ""more"" of a person hired; similarly, in neg-      ative actions, with 4.4 expected terminations and 5 actual, the difference  would be .6 ""less"" of a person terminated.  However, see later  comments on interpreting IRA results.     For this example, your IRA sheet would look like this:     OTHER ACTIVITY ELEMENTS     You may wish to attach additional IRA worksheets (with headings  appropriately modified) for other relevant employment activity information the  contractor may provide, such as training data.  In determining what information  to enter, simply remember that the rate for the groups you are comparing will  always be the number of persons selected (for training, for transfer, etc.)  divided by the number of persons in the pool eligible for selec-    tion.  How you define eligible for selection will depend on the situation  and the quality of your data.     INTERPRETING IRA RESULTS     IRAs do not stand alone.  They must be interpreted in light of surrounding  review factors.  For example,"

In a preaward review, the desk audit is normally conducted onsite (also  see Section 3C).    2A01  PURPOSE OF DESK AUDITS     Desk audits are a major component of compliance reviews.  By careful and  systematic review of the documents and materials provided by covered contractors  and subcontractors, the Equal Opportunity Specialist (EOS) can begin to  determine whether they are complying with relevant provisions of 41 CFR Chapter  60, are not discriminating and are taking affirmative action to ensure equal  employment opportunity without regard to race, color, religion, national origin,  sex, disability, or status as a special disabled or Vietnam era veteran.  Desk  audits enable the EOS to review a contractor's compliance with its affirmative  action and equal opportunity obligations at a particular establishment, and  specifically to:      (a) Workforce Structure, Personnel Policies and Procedures:  Examine the  contractor's basic organizational structure, personnel policies and procedures.      (b) Good Faith Efforts:  Identify areas: (1) where there has been a lack of  goals progress and further information is needed onsite to evaluate the  contractor's good faith effort, including the development and implementation of  programs designed to improve opportunities for minorities and women.    (c) Potential Discrimination:  Identify areas for an in-depth investigation  of potential discrimination: (1) where minorities and women are  underrepresented and concentrated in the workforce; (2) where employment  activity has been disadvantageous to minorities or women; and (3) where there  may be problems in the compensation of minorities or women vs. others.     2A02  PURPOSE AND PRINCIPLES OF AAPS    Desk audits should be conducted with the following AAP principles as points  of reference:    (a) Equal Employment Opportunity:  Equal employment opportunity requires  that a contractor eliminate and remedy all discrimination.  A contractor's  personnel policies and practices must not discriminate against any persons  because of their race, color, religion, national origin, sex, disability or  covered veteran status.       (b) Affirmative Action:  An affirmative action program is a set of specific  and result-oriented policies and procedures to which a contractor commits itself  to apply every good faith effort.  The objective of those procedures plus such  efforts is equal employment opportunity.      (c) Completeness, Reasonableness, Acceptability:  The affirmative action  program will be judged for its completeness, reasonableness, and acceptability.      2A03  RELATIONSHIP TO THE STANDARD COMPLIANCE REVIEW REPORT (SCRR)      The Standard Compliance Review Report (SCRR) and its instructions (Appendix  2A) constitute a framework for conducting the desk audit and developing and  implementing an onsite investigative plan.  The organization of this Chapter  generally parallels that of the SCRR, and it should be read in conjunction with  the SCRR instructions.    (a) Organization of the SCRR:  The SCRR is organized into three parts:    (1) Part A:  Preparation:  Part A covers preparation for the desk audit,  including such areas as the contractor's past review history, overall EEO  trends in its workforce, its organizational structure, and the initial review  of its AAP and support data for completeness, reasonableness, and  acceptability.    (2) Part B:  Affirmative Action:  Part B summarizes prob- lems with the AAP  and support data; provides for analysis of affirmative action progress and  identification of areas where additional information is needed to determine  good faith effort; and covers implementation of other affirmative action  obligations.  For each affirmtive action problem unresolved at the conclusion  of desk audit, the SCRR provides for an onsite plan.    (3) Part C:  Potential Discrimination:  Part C includes review of the  workforce analysis for concentrations/    underrepresentations), impact ratio analyses, and compensation analyses.   For each potential discrimination problem unresolved at the conclusion of desk  audit, the SCRR provides for an onsite investigative plan.    (b) SCRR Potential Discrimination Worksheets:  The SCRR also includes a  series of Potential Discrimination Worksheets designed to illustrate the steps  normally necessary to establish particular types of discrimination.  These  Worksheets and their instructions are in Appendix A to Chapter 3.  Their use,  although encouraged, is optional.  However, the ""Key Factors""  highlighted at the beginning of the instructions for each Worksheet must be  addressed in an analysis if the Worksheet applies to the type of potential  discrimination problem involved.  In developing an onsite plan for the  investigation of potential discrimination issues, therefore, the EOS may find it  useful to review at least the ""Key Factors"" for the initial onsite  step of data refinement (Worksheets 17-1 and 17-2).     2B  PRE-DESK AUDIT ACTIONS    2B00  COMPLIANCE REVIEW INFORMATION SYSTEM (CRIS)    CRIS is used to record basic information about the contractor, to track  major review events, and to summarize violations found and remedies obtained.   To enter a contractor into CRIS, the Area Of-fice completes CRIS Form 100 and  sends it to Region.  The Region then generates a CRIS Form 100a, which is the  first page of the SCRR.  Full instructions for completing the 100a are given in  the CRIS Manual.    2B01  MAINTENANCE OF CASE CHRONOLOGY    The EOS should prepare a case chronology (CC-53; see Figure 2-1) for each  compliance review.  It should cover events occurring from the date of initial  contact with the contractor to the date case closing documents are prepared and  approved.  All telephone conversations, correspondence and meetings associated  with the review should be recorded, indicating the date, nature of contact,  person contacted, summary of discussion or actions taken, and EOS' name.  Events  should be logged in as they occur, since it is difficult to reconstruct these  after a review is completed.  The case chronology is an integral part of the  case file and will be an invaluable tool if enforcement action is necessary.   All notes and logs should be legible (preferably typed).    2B02  INITIAL CONTACT WITH CONTRACTOR    (a) Identifying Information:  Identifying information should be obtained by  contacting the contractor before the start of the compliance review.  The name  of the establishment chief executive officer (CEO), the name of the person  responsible for preparation/implementation of the AAP, and the correct     mailing address for the establishment should be obtained.  If the  establishment is part of a larger entity, the name of the corporate CEO, the  name of the corporate person responsible for Equal Employment  Opportunity/Affirmative Action matters, and the correct corporate mailing  address should also be obtained.  This basic identifying information should be  entered on page 2 of the SCRR, along with contract data, labor force  information, and the other items specified in the SCRR instructions.    (b) Representation by Counsel:  If the contractor indicates, at this point  in the review or later, that an outside counsel or consultant will represent the  company, the contractor will be asked to provide written confirmation of  representation, including: (1) the representative's name, address and phone  number; (2) the scope of the representative's authority (including whether  he/she is authorized to negotiate settlement for the contractor); (3) whether  all contacts, including routine ones to make appointments or to clarify  submitted data or other information, should be made through the representative;  and (4) whether all correspondence should be mailed only to the representative  or if copies should also be mailed to the contractor.  Upon receipt of this  written confirmation, contacts and correspondence will be handled accordingly  for the duration of the review (unless the contractor specifies a different time  period).  NOTE:  This same written confirmation should be obtained from the  contractor if OFCCP is contacted by a person who indicates that he/she  represents the contractor.    (c) Special Circumstances:  The EOS should also determine if there is any  information which would preclude selection of the contractor for a compliance  review (e.g., bankruptcy, debarment, closure of the establishment), or would  influence the timing of the review (i.e. vacation shutdown, strike, lockout,  heavy layoffs, etc.).    2B03  SCHEDULING LETTER    The notice used to schedule a compliance review and request the Affirmative  Action Program (AAP) and supporting documentation is called a Scheduling Letter  (Figure 2-2).  This letter will be sent, by certified mail with return receipt  requested, to the top official at the contractor's establishment with a copy to  the chief executive officer at the corporate address (unless the establishment  and corporate office are the same).  Scheduling Letters shall be signed by the  AOD or FOD.  Letters should include the name and telephone number of the EOS who  will be conducting the review and/or the appropriate Module Chief.      2B04  FOLLOW-UP CONTACT WITH CONTRACTOR    Within fifteen working days after sending the Scheduling Letter, the EOS  should contact the contractor to ensure that the contractor's representatives  fully understand the requirements outlined.  The EOS should also make sure there  have been no special circumstances which may require postponing or cancelling  the scheduled review (see 2B02(c) above).    2B05  CONTACT WITH EEOC, STATE AND LOCAL FEP AGENCIES AND VETS    (a) EEOC and State and local Fair Employment Practices (FEP) Agencies:   Simultaneously with the Scheduling Letter, the standard inquiry letter (Figure  2-3) should be sent to the district office of the EEOC and to State and local  FEP agencies, requesting information on complaints filed against the contractor  and any other information that may be pertinent to assessing the contractor's  EEO posture.  If after 15 days no response is received, the EOS should follow-up  by telephone.     (b) Veterans Employment and Training Service (VETS):  The EOS must contact  the VETS representative at the appropriate State Employment Security office to  request information he or she may have which could be pertinent to the review.   This contact must be recorded in the case chronology record.    2B06  REVIEW OF COMMUNITY RESOURCE FILES    Each AO or FO should maintain resource files on the communities within its  geographic area.  For each community, these files should contain at least: (1)  basic data on minority/female availability; (2) information on public  transportation systems; and (3) identification of local organizations  representing covered group members.  The EOS should review the resource file for  the community where the contractor is located, with particular attention to  organizations which can be helpful in evaluating the contractor's compliance  posture.  If the contractor is located near an Indian reservation, the EOS  should contact the reservation's Tribal Employment Rights Council (TERO).    2B07  STANDARD AFFIRMATIVE ACTION FORMATS    If the contractor scheduled for review has an approved Standard Affirmative  Action Format (SAAF), the Module Chief should obtain a copy of the format and  provide it to the EOS conducting the review.  The EOS should become familiar  with the provisions of the SAAF, preparatory to evaluating the contractor's AAP.      2B08  REVIEW OF PREVIOUS COMPLIANCE ACTIONS    When scheduling the contractor for a compliance review, the EOS should  determine whether the contractor has previously been audited.  If so, the EOS  should examine at least the previous case file for problem areas, with  particular attention to commitments made in a Conciliation Agreement or Letter  of Commitment.  The EOS also should determine whether the contractor has been  subject to an OFCCP complaint investigation and, if so, review the file for any  problems identified.  Problems in these past compliance actions should be  recorded on page 3 of the SCRR. As the review progresses, the EOS should be  alert to any indications that past problems have remained unremedied or have  recurred.    2B09  INFORMATION ON COMPLAINTS    (a) Response to the Standard Inquiry Letter:  The EOS should carefully  examine all information on complaints received from Federal, State, and local  agencies in response to the Standard Inquiry Letter.  Basic information on these  com- plaints should be entered on page 3 of the SCRR, including the agency with  which the complaint was filed, the basis, issue, current status, and the area of  the contractor's workforce involved in the complaint.    (b) Relationship to Desk Audit:  The EOS should note any patterns in the  types of complaints filed, particularly ones that might indicate potential  systemic discrimination problems.  For example, there may be a clustering of  complaints filed by employees in certain job areas, or by applicants or  employees from a particular race, religion, ethnic group, or sex, or by covered  veterans or individuals with disabilities.  As the review progresses, the EOS  should cross reference complaints to potential problem areas identified.  For  example, there may be indications of lack of good faith efforts, adverse IRA's,  and/or concentrations/underrepresentations in areas where complaints have been  filed.      (c) Review of Case Files:  Where appropriate, the EOS should contact the  appropriate EEOC office or State or local fair employment agency to arrange to  review case files as part of the compliance review.  This can be useful when, as  a result of the desk audit, potential systemic problems are indenti- fied in  complaint areas.    (d) Contractor Complaint Information:  Upon receipt of the AAP and  supporting data, any information provided by the con- tractor with respect to  current or past complaints should be compared to the information received from  the agencies.  Discrepancies and/or information not provided by the contractor  should be noted by the EOS for particular attention during the review.      2B10  RELATIONSHIP OF OFCCP COMPLIANCE ACTIVITIES TO EEO LITIGATION OR COURT  ORDERS    If, during the conduct of a compliance review, the EOS finds that the  contractor is involved in litigation or is under a court order on EEO matters,  he/she should identify the EEO issues involved, the court, the parties, the case  name and number, and bring the matter to the attention of the AOD (or FOD, where  appropriate).  The AOD/FOD, in consultation through channels with the Regional  Solicitor's Office, will determine whether there are any limitations which may  be imposed on the conduct of the compliance review by the litigation or court  order.    2C  SUBMISSION OF AAPS FOR DESK AUDIT    2C00  DELAYED RECEIPT OF AAPS    If current AAPs are not received by the 30th calendar day after the  contractor received the notification of the scheduled review, the EOS should  telephone the contractor to determine whether the AAPs have been mailed.  If the  contractor advises that they are en route, a reasonable period of time, not to  exceed five (5) calendar days, will be allowed for receipt.      2C01  NON-RECEIPT OF EXECUTIVE ORDER AAP    If there is no reason to believe that the AAP is en route, or if an AAP  reported en route has not been received at the end of 5 calendar days following  the 30th day, a show cause notice should generally be issued (see Chapter 8).   However, the regulations at 41 CFR 60-1.26(a)(2) give the Director, OFCCP the  discretion to go directly to administrative enforcement where a contractor  refuses to submit an AAP and efforts to conciliate the matter are unsuccessful.       2C02  NON-RECEIPT OF SECTION 503/38 U.S.C. 4212 AAPS    A Section 503 and 38 U.S.C. 4212 AAP may be included in an Executive Order  AAP, may be combined in one document, or may be submitted as separate documents.   Action to be taken where Section 503 and/or 38 U.S.C. 4212 AAP(s) are not  submitted may take either of two forms, depending on circumstances:      (a) Concurrent Failure to Submit EO 11246 AAP or Submission of Unreasonable  EO 11246 AAP:  If the contractor failed to submit both an Executive Order AAP  and the AAP(s) for Section 503/38 U.S.C. 4212, or if the Executive Order AAP is  determined to be an unreasonable submission (see Section 2F    below) and no Section 503/38 U.S.C. 4212 AAP(s) was submitted, then the Show  Cause Notice being issued for the Executive Order violation will include the  failure to submit the Section 503/38 U.S.C. 4212 AAP and offer the contractor a  concurrent 30-day period to submit that AAP (see Sections 8B01(b) and 8D00(b)  and Figures 8-1 and 8-2).    (b) Reasonable EO 11246 AAP Submitted:  If the contractor's Executive Order  AAP has been received and is determined to be reasonable, but no Section 503/38  U.S.C. 4212 AAP(s) was received, the EOS will telephone the contractor to  request that the missing AAP(s) be provided.  If the materials are received  before the end of the desk audit, they will be reviewed for completeness and  acceptability (see Sections 2E01 and 2I below) as part of the desk audit.  If  they are not received before the end of the desk audit, they will be reviewed  onsite.  If, however, it is determined onsite that the contractor did not have  Section 503 and/or 38 U.S.C. 4212 AAPs in place in accordance with the  regulations, this will be cited as a major problem, and its resolution addressed  in a Conciliation Agreement.    2C03  EVALUATION PERIOD    (a) General:  The EOS should evaluate the contractor's perform- ance (e.g.,  goals progress, good faith efforts, personnel activity, etc.) for at least the  last full AAP year.  Cur- rent year performance should also be examined if the  con- tractor is six months or more into its current AAP year.  For example, if  the AAP is established on a calendar year basis, and the compliance review is  scheduled for August 1988, the EOS would evaluate the contractor's performance  from January 1, 1987 through June 30, 1988 (1/1/87 through 12/31/87 under the  prior AAP, and 1/1/88 through 6/30/88 under the current AAP).    (b) When Discrimination Found:  Note, however, that if potential  discrimination is found, analysis of personnel activity/policy implementation  should be extended to cover the normal liability period (providing coverage can  be established during the full normal liability period).  The normal liability  period for a compliance review is the full two years preced-ing the date the  contractor received the Scheduling Letter.  Additionally, where the alleged  discrimination involves a continuing violation, the analysis may be extended  further (see Chapters 3 and 7).    Revised 5-25-90    2C04  TIMEFRAME FOR COMPLETION OF COMPLIANCE REVIEW    The 60-day period for completing the compliance review (refer to 41 CFR  60-60.7) begins when the AAP and support data (whether reasonable or not) are  recieived in the AO/FO.  While completion of the review within the 60-day period  is not a procedural prerequisite to an enforcement action, substantial effort  should be made to complete the review within that period of time.  Should it  become apparent that a review cannot or will not be completed within 60 days of  receipt of the AAP and support data (irrespective of whether a Show Cause Notice  has been issued), the EOS should request an extension through his or her Module  Chief.  All extension requests must be made sufficiently in advance to allow for  necessary processing and entry into the CRIS.      2C05  REVIEWS OF CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS, REGIONAL AND DISTRICT OFFICES    (a) Maintenance of Establishment AAPs:  When reviewing corporate  headquarters, the EOS should review documentation that the corporation's  establishments have developed AAPs.    (b) Corporate-Level Selection Decisions:  The EOS should ensure that the  workforce analysis, utilization analysis and goals in the corporate  headquarter's AAP include all positions filled by headquarters decision-makers,  regardless of where those jobs are physically located.  For example, mid- and  upper-level management jobs at establishments other than headquarters must be  included in the corporate AAP if the selection decisions for those jobs are made  at the corporate level.     Where because of informal or fluctuating managerial appointment authorities,  the appropriate level for job title placement cannot be clearly or consistently  defined, the managerial and other appropriate titles should be placed in the  AAP of the highest organizational level where ultimate approval authority may  reside.  As a result, there may be instances when the majority of mid- and  upper-level manage-ment and other titles should appropriately be placed in the  corporate headquarters AAP, notwithstanding personnel responsibility at  intermediate organizational levels.  Management should be given substantial  discretion in determining proper organizational levels for job title placement  provided such placement is not inconsistent with the purpose of this Section.      (c) Regional or District-Level Selection Decisions:  Similarly, if a  regional or district office has decision-making authority over positions in a  lower-level establishment unit, the regional or district office AAP should  include those positions in its workforce analysis, utilization analysis and  goals.     Revised 5-25-90    (d) Establishments with Positions Filled by Higher-Level Decision Making:   When reviewing establishments which are subordinate to a higher-level  establishment in the contractor's organization, the EOS will ensure that all  positions in the workforce of the lower-level establishment for which the  selection decisions are made at a higher corporate level are excluded from the  utilization analysis and goal setting of the establishment under review.  Such  positions, however, must be shown in the lower-level establishment's workforce  analysis (in order that the complete workforce structure of that establishment  is readily apparent).      2D INITIAL REVIEW OF AAP AND SUPPORT DATA - GENERAL    2D00  CONTENTS OF INITIAL REVIEW    Upon receipt of an AAP and support data, the EOS should immedi- ately review  the material to make sure that it provides an adequate basis for conducting  desk audit analyses of both affirma- tive action and potential discrimination  issues.  This initial review includes a determination of the completeness,  reasonableness and acceptability of the AAP(s) and support data as described  in the sections which follow.    2D01  RECORDING RESULTS OF INITIAL REVIEW    The results of this initial review are recorded on page 4 of the SCRR.   Where problems are identified, each specific problem should be described on page  9 of the SCRR (Problems with AAP and Support Data), along with the actions the  EOS plans to take to resolve it.  Where the matter is unresolved at the  conclusion of desk audit, page 9 will constitute the onsite plan for resolution of AAP and support data problems.     2E REVIEW FOR CURRENCY AND COMPLETENESS    2E00 ACTION WHEN AAP NOT CURRENT    Upon receipt of an AAP for desk audit, the EOS should first determine  whether the AAP is current.  If it is not, the submission should be treated as  if the contractor had failed to submit an AAP.  See Section 2C01 above.      2E01  COMPLETENESS    If the AAP is current, the EOS should review the AAP and support data for  completeness.  To do so, the EOS should first determine whether all materials  requested in the Scheduling Letter and itemized listing, including the Section  503 and 38 U.S.C. 4212 AAPs, have been submitted.  Then the EOS should determine  if the Executive Order and Section 503 and 38 U.S.C. 4212 AAPs contain all  ingredients required by the regulations:    oExecutive Order AAP ingredients required by 41 CFR 60-2.11 and 2.13(a)  through (j);    oRequired Executive Order support data, including the report of prior year  goal progress required by 41 CFR 60-1.40(b) and (c); and    oSection 503 and 38 U.S.C. 4212 AAP ingredients required by 41 CFR  60-741.6(a) through (f) and 41 CFR 60-250.6 (a) through (f) respectively.    2E02 CENTRAL EXECUTIVE ORDER AAP ELEMENT MISSING    If one or more of the following central Executive Order AAP ingredients is  missing, the submission is automatically considered unreasonable and the desk  audit should be suspended and a show cause notice issued:    oA workforce analysis;    oA utilization analysis, including its component parts of job group  formation, availability estimates and, as appropriate, identification of  underutilization; and    oGoals for areas declared underutilized.    If these central ingredients are included, the EOS should then evaluate them  for reasonableness.    2F REVIEW OF EXECUTIVE ORDER AAP FOR REASONABLENESS    For a submission to be considered a reasonable effort to meet the  requirements of 41 CFR Part 60-2, the central Executive Order AAP  ingredients  of workforce analysis, utilization analysis and goals development must meet the  following standards:    2F00  WORKFORCE ANALYSIS    The submission must contain a workforce analysis which lists all  jobs at  the establishment by title (not EEO-1 category, job group or some other  combination of job titles) and by organizational unit, showing at least total  employees, total women and total minorities for each job title.    2F01UTILIZATION ANALYSIS    In the following components of the utilization analysis, the submission must  show:    (a)Job Groups:  An attempt to combine job titles into job groups (defined as  one or more jobs with similar content, wage rates, and opportunities).    (b)Availability Analyses:  An attempt to establish separate availability  estimates for minorities and for women for each job group.    (c)Underutilization Determination:  A comparison of availability to current  incumbency to determine the existence of underutilization.    2F02GOALS    The submission must show an attempt to establish goals for those job groups  identified as underutilized.    2F03  ACTION FOR UNREASONABLE SUBMISSION    If the Executive Order AAP does not meet one or more of these standards for  reasonableness, the desk audit should be suspended and a show cause notice  issued (see Chapter 8).  If the Executive Order AAP is considered reasonable,  the EOS should evaluate the submission for acceptability.    2G REVIEW OF EXECUTIVE ORDER AAP FOR ACCEPTABILITY    2G00GENERAL     Having determined that the elements necessary to proceed with the desk  audit--the workforce analysis, utilization analysis and current goals--are  included in the contractor's submission and are reasonable, the desk audit  proceeds with an evaluation of the acceptability of each required ingredient.   The determination of the acceptability of the items listed on page 4 of the SCRR  will be limited to the evaluation which can be conducted during the desk audit.   This is different from an evaluation of a contractor's implementation of the  requirements, which in most instances cannot be determined without further  investigation onsite (see Chapter 3).      2G01     WORKFORCE ANALYSIS    An acceptable workforce analysis is one which meets the requirements of 41  CFR 60-2.11(a).  It must contain:    oA listing of each job title, as it appears in applicable collective  bargaining agreements or payroll records;    oIn wage rate or salary range order;    oWithin each department or other similar organizational unit, including unit supervision; and    oWhere there are separate work units or lines of progression within the  department or organizational unit, a separate listing must be provided.     More specifically:    (a)Information by Job Title:  Each job title listed must show the total  number of persons in the job title, the total num-ber of men and of women, and  the total number of men and of women in each of the following groups:  Blacks,  Hispanics, Asian/Pacific Islanders, and American Indians/Alaskan Natives.  All  job titles, including managerial job titles,  must be listed.  Positions which  are filled above the estab-lishment level must be included in an establishment's  work-force analysis even though they may be included for goal-setting purposes  in a corporate or mid-level AAP.  In deter-mining whether jobs are listed by  title, the EOS should be alert for the use of plurals in job titles; broad,  general titles, such as ""Manager"" or ""Machine Operator;"" or  inclu- sion of multiple pay ranges for one job title.  The pre- sence of any of  these suggests that jobs may not be listed by title.      (b)Wage Rate:    (1)General:  The wage rate or salary range for each job title must be given  (although this information may be coded--see (2) below).  Titles must be listed  in wage rate or range order within department or other similar organizational  units.  The listing may either be from highest to lowest paid or from lowest to  highest paid.      (2)Coded Data:  Where wage rate or salary range are coded, the contractor  must provide the key to the code onsite.  Any codes must be consistent across  department/unit lines (i.e. a job with a salary code ""57"" in  Department A, pays the same as one coded ""57"" in Department B) and in  wage rate or salary range order within each department or other similar  organization unit.  Also, the submission should include a list of the codes used  in wage/salary order with the highest and lowest codes so labeled.    (c)Organizational Unit:  The organizational units used in the workforce  analysis should be identifiable, and should reflect the contractor's  organizational structure.  If an organizational chart is provided as part of the  supporting documentation, it should be compared to the units used in the  workforce analysis.    (d)Lines of Progression:  Lines of progression or usual promotional  sequences must show the order of jobs in the line through which an employee  moves to reach the top of the line. Lines of progression or promotional  sequences may be identified from collective bargaining agreements as well as  from organizational charts.  If this information is not available at desk audit,  a final determination of acceptability cannot be made until after the onsite review.    2G02JOB GROUPS    Job groups, to be acceptable, must consist of a group of jobs having similar  content, wage rates, and opportunities.    (a)List of Titles in Each Group:  In order for the EOS to assess job group  acceptability, the AAP must include, for each job group, a listing of the job  titles which make up that group.  If such lists have not been provided, the EOS  should immediately contact the contractor and request that such lists be  provided for desk audit.    (b)Criteria for Acceptability:  The following criteria are to be used in  assessing the acceptability of job groups:    (1)Similar work content:  Similarity of work content refers to the duties  and responsibilities of the job titles which make up the job group.  While it is  difficult to confirm similarity without reference to position descriptions, some  steps can be taken during the desk audit to make at least a preliminary  assess-ment of acceptability of work content.  For example:    oAppropriate EEO Category:  The EOS should review the establishment's job  titles that make up each of the job groups to verify they are within the proper  EEO-1 categories.  Job titles in each job group normally would be within the  same EEO-1 category.     oUse of Dictionary of Occupational Titles:  The Dictionary of Occupational  Titles can be referred to, as well as labor agreements, organizational charts,  and other data provided by the contractor, in evaluating the manner in which the  contractor has formulated job groups.  The Dictionary of Occupational Titles  lists standard job titles for  most positions, and codes them based on their  duties, requirements, and other factors.  Descriptions of job duties and  commonly required qualifications are also given.    (2)Similar rates of pay:  Pay rates should be reviewed in conjunction with  job content.  Large apparent differences in pay, when associated with  differences in job title and/or location within an organization, suggest an  unacceptable job grouping.      (3)Similar opportunities:  Opportunity refers to the ability to take  advantage of training opportunities, transfers, promotions, mobility to  desirable wage/ salary situations, and other employment benefits.  Most often,  it refers to upward mobility.  Ideally, each job within a job group should offer  the same opportunities as any other job title within that job group.  As a  result:    oJobs in Separate Unions:  Jobs in separate unions, or jobs in different  departments when interdepartmental mobility is impossible, should not be   grouped together.  For example, nonunion clerical jobs and clerical jobs which  are covered by a collective bargaining agreement should not normally be grouped  together.    oJobs in Lines of Progression:  Jobs that are in lines of progression should  be separated from those that are not.  Where transfer or hire into jobs above  entry level is rare, each line of progression should be analyzed separately.   Where there are lines of progression governed by strict seniority, the job  titles in lines should be considered as a single job group.    (c)Job Groups Must Not Obscure Underutilization:  Job groups which combine  jobs with different content, wages, or opportunities may obscure  underutilization and are not acceptable.  Any job groups that combine jobs in  which minorities or women are concentrated with jobs in which they are  under-represented should be targeted for special scrutiny onsite.  Such job  groups often unacceptably include jobs with different content, wages, or  opportunities.        (d)Effects of Size of Contractor's Workforce:  In assessing the  acceptability of the contractor's job groups, the EOS must remember that the  size of the contractor's workforce is a major factor in determining how well  these three criteria will be met.      (1)Job Groups Must Permit Meaningful Analyses:  Job groups should have  enough incumbents to permit meaningful utilization analyses and goal setting.   Optimally, if a job group is identified as underutilized, it should be large  enough so that a goal of at least one whole person can be established.  No  minimum size has been established for this purpose, however, since it is  dependent not only on the size of the job group, but also on the size of the  availability percentage and the number of minorities or women already in the job  group.    (2)Job Groups Should Not Normally Cross EEO Categories:  Because of the  minimum size of a contractor subject to written AAP requirements, it may not be  possible for any of a smaller contractor's job groups to meet this guideline.   While there are usually two or more job groups within each EEO-1 or EEO-6  category, for smaller contractors some or all of their job groups may  correspond to those categories.  In any event, when job titles are combined to  maintain minimal job group size, EEO category lines should not normally be  crossed.      (e)Relationship Between Job Groups and Availability:  The organization of  jobs into groups allows contractors to tie specific jobs to availability  statistics in order to assess the degree to which their own workforce  representation approximates availability.      2G03AVAILABILITY ANALYSIS - GENERAL      (a)Standard for Acceptability:  The reasonable submission test requires only  that a contractor make an attempt to develop availability estimates.  For the  availability analysis to be found acceptable, however, it must contain a proper  definition of labor area and must show consideration of each of the eight  factors at 41 CFR 60-2.11(b)(1) and (2).      (b)Principles for Evaluation:  In evaluating the acceptability of the  availability analysis, the EOS should be guided by two principles.  First, the  contractor's consideration of each of the factors should reflect its actual  recruitment and employment practices.  Second, the contractor's recruitment and  employment practices should demonstrate the con- tractor's compliance with its  affirmative action and non-discrimination obligations.      (c)Professional Judgement:  The audit of the availability analysis for  acceptability is as much an art as a science.  There are no hard-and-fast, ""mechanical""  methods for evaluating the availability analysis.  The EOS must make a  professional judgement as to the adequacy of the contractor's analysis.  This  requires familiarity with the quality and variety of data available, with  industry and contractor personnel practices, and knowledge of available  recruitment sources.      2G04AVAILABILITY ANALYSIS - DEFINING LABOR AREAS    (a)Importance of Labor Area Definition:  Six of the eight fac-tors for  assessing minority or female availability are tied to the contractor's  definition of labor areas.  How the con-tractor defines its immediate labor area  determines the data used for population, workforce, unemployment/seeking work,  and requisite skills within that immediate area.  How the contractor defines its  reasonable recruitment area determines the data used for requisite skills  within that area.  Definition of both these areas, therefore, heavily impacts  the results of the contractor's availability analysis.  A critical first step in  evaluating the contractor's availability analysis is to assess the  acceptability of both immediate labor area and reasonable recruitment area.    (b)Immediate Labor Area:  In evaluating the contractor's determination of  its immediate labor area, the EOS should consider the following:    (1)Definition:  The immediate labor area is that geographic area from which  employees may reasonably commute to the contractor's establishment.  It may  include one or more contiguous cities, counties or Metropolitan Statistical  Areas (MSAs) or parts thereof, in which the establishment is located.  For  example, it may be defined as the major city in or near which the  establishment is located; the county(ies) surrounding the establishment; the  MSA in which the establishment is located or which borders the establishment; or  a combination of any of the three.  (Note, however, that if the contrac-tor  chooses to combine figures from more than one area, it must be prepared to  provide the raw numbers used to produce the final percentage, since the  percentages themselves cannot be added together).  However defined, the  immediate labor area is normally the same for all job groups.    (2)Must Not Underestimate Availability:  In reviewing the contractor's  definition of immediate labor area, the EOS must ensure that the contractor has  not defined that area in a way that underestimates minority or female  availability.  For example, the definition should not exclude a nearby area with  a large minority workforce.      (3)Commuting Patterns:  In assessing the immediate labor area definition,  the EOS needs to consider commuting patterns, including the availability of  public transportation, approximate normal driving times, etc. in the labor area.      (4)Relationship to EEO/AA Obligations:  The immediate labor area definition  should be consistent with the contractor's nondiscrimination and affirmative  action obligations.  For example, if a contractor's workforce is largely  nonminority and it recruits primarily by word of mouth, defining the immediate  labor area based on the source of applicants may reflect its actual re-  cruitment practices, but does not meet the contractor's affirmative action  obligations (and could, in fact, be found to be discriminatory).  Similarly,  defining the immediate labor area based on residence patterns of current,  nonminority employees, whether as of the time of hire or the time of the review,  may also artificially lower availability for minorities.    (5)Need for Further Investigation:  If the EOS disagrees with the  contractor's definition of the immediate labor area because it appears to  artificially lower the  availability of minorities and women, the EOS should  investigate further onsite to determine whether the contractor, in fact, does  recruit from an area with higher minority/female availability and/or whether the  contractor could expand its area to increase the numbers of minority group  persons and women in the per-centage of available workers.  In this evaluation,  the EOS, based on his or her review experience, may consider where other  nearby employees with similar jobs normally obtain workers.    (6)Sources of Data:  As noted earlier, immediate labor area data are  normally used for factors on population, unemployment/seeking work and  workforce.  For these factors, the contractor should use the best data  available.  Resources for this data include the Research Division of each  State's Division of Employment Security (DES).  This DES Division annually  updates data on population, unemployment/seeking work and workforce for its  State and for MSAs and counties within its State (See Appendix 2B for other  information available from DES).  For a discussion of data on requisite skills  in the immediate labor area, and considerations in their use, see Section  2G05(e) below.    (c)Reasonable Recruitment Area:  The definition of the reason-able  recruitment area is very important in assessing the proportion of minorities and  women available for employment.  It influences the number or proportion of  minorities or women who could--at least theoretically--get through the  contractor's door (be hired) if minority group membership and sex were not taken  into consideration in employment decisions.  In assessing how the contractor has  defined reasonable recruitment area, the EOS should consider the following  factors:    (1)Relationship to Immediate Labor Area:  The reasonable recruiting area  represents the area from which the contractor usually seeks or reasonably could  seek workers for a particular job group.  It may coincide with the immediate  labor area, or it may cover a larger area (state, region, or nation).  Thus,  while the immediate labor area is normally the same for all job groups, the  reasonable recruitment area will vary depending on the types of jobs in the job  group.    (2)Pay and Skill Levels:  Generally, the scope of the reasonable recruitment  area is closely related to pay, based on the assumption that the more a job  pays, the farther people are willing to go to apply for it.  Also, because there  is often a relationship between pay levels and skill levels, for job groups  containing jobs with minimal to intermediate skill requirements, the reasonable  recruiting area will often be the same as the immediate labor area.  As pay  levels and skill requirements increase, however, the likelihood that recruiting  will expand beyond the immediate labor area also increases.      (3)Supply and Demand:  In addition to pay and skills, supply and demand  plays a part in defining the scope of the reasonable recruiting area.  For  example, at times when nurses are in short supply, it may be necessary to expand  recruitment efforts beyond the immediate labor area.  At other times, the supply  of nurses available in the immediate labor area exceeds the demand, and may   reduce the reasonable recruiting area.  Supply and demand can also be influenced  by the specificity of skills required by the contractor.  For example, while the  supply of teachers generally may exceed demand, the demand for teachers with  specific skills, such as math     or science, may exceed the supply and result in an expansion of the  recruitment area.  Further, high unemployment in one area may create a labor  surplus which effectively expands the ""reasonable recruitment area""  elsewhere.  For example, when unemployment is high, persons often search for  work in a wider area, becoming more willing to either relocate or to commute  further to a job than they normally would.  As a result, the ""reasonable  recruitment area"" for other areas expands.    (4)Summary:  As a result, while in most instances job groups in the Service  Worker, Laborer, Operative,  Office and Clerical and retail Sales categories  tend to have reasonable recruitment areas which are the same as the immediate  labor area, this will not always be the case.  Jobs in the Crafts and  Technicians categories are often particularly susceptible to supply and demand  factors related to level and specificity of skill required.  Therefore, while  in most instances, such jobs tend to have reasonable recruitment areas which  coin-cide with the immediate labor area, some job groups within the categories  may have a broader recruitment area.  Similarly, while job groups in the Sales  (non-retail), Professional, and Officials and Managers categories usually have  reasonable recruitment areas which are larger than the immediate labor area (and  often significantly larger, e.g. national), this will not always be the case.      (5)Sources of Data:  See Section 2G05(e) below.       2G05  AVAILABILITY ANALYSIS - EIGHT FACTORS    The contractor's AAP must show, for each job group, consideration of each of  the eight factors for minorities and each of the eight factors for women.  All  factors are expressed as the percentage that minorities or women are among all  persons who meet the factor.  These factors are as follows:    (a)The minority population of the labor area surrounding the facility (Refer  to 41 CFR 60-2.11(b)(1)(i)):  The extent to which this factor is given  consideration in determining the final availability factor for a given job group  will depend on whether or not that job group contains entry level posi- tions  which are filled primarily through outside hire and which require minimal or no  prior skills.  Job groups which fall into the Service Worker, Laborer, and to  some extent, Operatives EEO-1 categories will be more likely to incorpor-ate  minority population percentages into the final availability estimate than  would job groups requiring more specialized skills, such as those falling into  the Technician or Professional categories.      (b)The availability of women seeking employment in the labor or recruitment  area of the contractor (Refer to 41 CFR 60-2.11 (b)(2)(v):  The figure used may  be based on the percentage that unemployed women are among all unemployed  persons in the labor area (41 CFR 60-2.11(b)(2)(i)), since that rate includes  only persons actively seeking work; the percentage of women applying for work at  the local unemployment service office in job categories comparable to those in  the contractor's job groups; or the contractor's prior year applicant flow for  women for that job group.  Generally, the highest figure should be used.  As  with  minority population, inclusion of this figure in developing final  availability estimates for a particular job group will depend on whether or not  the job group is entry level, is filled through outside hire, and requires  little or no prior skills or experience.  The less skill required, the more  consideration this factor should receive.    (c)The size of the minority/female unemployment force in the labor area  surrounding the facility (Refer to 41 CFR 60-2.11(b)(1)(ii) and 41 CFR  60-2.11(b)(2)(i)):  The figure used should be the percentage that unemployed  minorities (or women) are among all unemployed persons in the labor area.   Please note that this is not the same as unemployment rate, which is generally  expressed as the percentage of a given group that is unemployed--e.g., the  percentage that unemployed minorities are among all minorities in the  workforce (employed plus unemployed).  As with minority population and women  seeking employment, the size of the minority/female unemployment force should  receive greater consideration where job groups are entry level, filled by  outside hire, and require little or no skill or experience.  The factor will  receive less consideration where job groups are above entry level, require more  skill or are filled solely or primarily through internal placement.    (d)The percentage of the minority/female workforce as compared with the  total workforce in the immediate labor area (Refer to 41 CFR 60-2.11(b)(1)(iii)  and 41 CFR 60-2.11(b)(2)(ii)): The percentage of minorities/females in the  workforce will have greater applicability for those job groups which draw from a  larger recruiting pool (entry level, filled through external hire, and requiring  few or no skills).  For those job groups which draw from a smaller recruiting  pool (those above entry level, with higher skill requirements, and/or filled  solely or primarily through internal placement), this factor is likely to have  less importance.  (Note:  The term workforce is used elsewhere in the  regulations to mean the incumbent employees of the contractor (e.g., workforce  analysis).  However, as used here in the availability analysis, the term  workforce is synonymous with the term ""labor force"" as defined by the  Census Bureau and other government agencies--e.g., as those persons in the  population, aged 16 and older who are either employed or unemployed (unemployed  is further defined as actively seeking employment).    (e)Requisite Skills:    oThe general availability of minorities/women having requisite skills in the  immediate labor area (Refer to 41 CFR 60-2.11(b)(1)(iv) and 41 CFR 60-2.11(b)(2)  (iii));      oThe availability of minorities/women having requisite skills in an area in  which the contractor can reasonably recruit (Refer to 41 CFR 60-2.11(b)(1)(v)  and 41 CFR 60-2.11(b)(2)(iv));    In assessing these factors, contractors should use the best data available.   While the most recent decennial census data normally provide the most detailed  information on requisite skills, they become increasingly outdated the more  years it has been since the census was conducted.  Also, the decennial census shows only persons employed in a given occupa tion at the time the census was conducted, rather than those with the skills  to be employed in that occupation.  Therefore, the following adjustments to decennial census data are normally needed:    (1)Adjustment for Time Since the Last Decennial Census: Some State Divisions  of Employment Security continue to publish periodic updates of decennial census  data on occupations of persons employed in labor areas within their State.   While these updates are often for fairly broad job categories, they provide a  reliable means of update for job categories where skills are normally  not very  specialized (i.e. service workers, laborers, operatives, entry-level clerical,  retail sales), and at least an indication of overall trends in job categories  where skills often are specialized (see Section 2G05(e) (4) below).   Additionally, for job groups which do have legitimate specialized education  requirements, any available data on the percentage of minority and/or female  graduates at the level (Associates, Bachelor's, etc.) and in the field involved  may be used to update census data.  Since, in many fields, minority and female  enrollment has risen since the last decennial census, these data are often  considerably more accurate than the census as a measure of requisite skills for:   (1) entry-level jobs which legitimately require a particular level and type of  post-high school degree; and (2) such jobs above entry (i.e. with legitimate  experience as well as degree requirements), if the data are corrected for the  year of degree.      (2)Adjustment for Employment vs. Requisite Skills:  The adjustment discussed  immediately above for recent graduates also provides some correction for the  census' focus on persons employed in a given occupation when the census was  conducted.  Additionally, however, care must be taken to ensure that such census  data do not, in effect, perpetuate past discrimination against mi- norities or  women in certain occupations and/or out-dated ""job applied for""  patterns.  This is particularly important for jobs in which, in terms of basic  skill requirements, the availability of minorities and/or women has long been  considerably better than their representation--for example, some management,  professional and sales training programs in which the major legitimate  requirement is a college degree.  Similarly, in entry-level blue collar jobs  where the contractor provides training--and the major skill requirement,  therefore, is ""trainability""-- past employment patterns may simply  reflect who employers in the area choose to train rather than true availability  (which in this situation should normally approximate labor area workforce  representation).      (3)Match Between Data and Skills:  The particular requisite skills  classification(s) from which the data are obtained should closely approximate  the skills required for performance in the job group.  The closeness of the  match between data and skills will depend on how much job content varies within  the job group and the degree of detail in the source data for requisite skills.      (i)Varied Job Content:  Where job content is quite varied (i.e. a Scientist  I job group composed of Chemists and Physicists), the contractor may either  refine the job group further, where appropriate, or combine requisite skills  data for the two or more types of jobs in the group.  Where the data are  combined, the contractor should have available the raw numbers from which the  average percentage was derived.    (ii)Degree of Detail in Data:  The most refined data available are usually  those contained in the most recent decennial census.  Detailed census data are  available from, among other sources, the National Technical Information Service  (NTIS) of the U.S. Department of Commerce (see Appendix 2B).  The NTIS's Report  #5, ""Equal Employment Indicators,"" contains decennial census  information on the employment of minorities and women in 503 job  classifications.  Data from other sources may be considerably broader.  For  example, State Divisions of Employment Security that continue to update  occupational data usually do so for a limited number of job categories, similar  to but not the same as EEO categories.  In the case of either very broad or very  refined data, some adjustment may be needed to approximate requisite skills for  a particular job group.      (4)Adjustment for Broad Data:  Data based on broad job categories (e.g. ""Professionals"")  may either overstate or understate availability.  For example, if the job group  consists of engineering titles, using data for ""all Professionals""  (which includes primary and secondary school teachers) will usually overstate  minority and female availability.  On the other hand, if the job group is  nurses, data on ""all Professionals"" will substantially understate  female availability.  Thus, while the contractor may make adjustment for broad  data, the EOS should evaluate the direction and degree of adjustment made given  the job group involved.    (5)Adjustment for Narrow Data:  Where data based on narrow job categories  are used, they may sometimes show no minorities or women for particular job  titles (either because there were none at the time the census was taken, or  because the actual number was so low as to cause the number to be ""suppressed.""    Where this occurs, contractors should be encouraged to broaden the area of  consideration to include other, related categories, which do show minorities  and/or women.     (f)The availability of promotable and transferable minority/fe-male  employees within the contractor's organization (Refer to 41 CFR  60-2.11(b)(1)(vi) and 41 CFR 60-2.11(b)(2)(vi)).    This is the percentage of minorities/women who are in feeder job groups and  who are (at the start of the AAP year) or who will become (during the AAP year)  promotable or transferra-ble from those job groups into the job group under  consideration.    In evaluating this factor for acceptability:     (1) Determine the Accuracy of Feeder Job Groups:  The EOS should identify  the feeder job groups, if any, from which individuals are, or reasonably could  be, promoted or transferred to the job group under consideration.    oThe EOS can determine actual feeder job groups by examining where persons  who were promoted or transferred into the job group under consideration came  from.  This may be done by identifying the  previous job group of persons who  entered the  target job group during the last AAP year and/or--where that  activity has been too limited to be representative--through examination of the  work histories of persons in the target job group to determine their immediately  preceding job group.  Feeder groups may also be identified through review of  labor agreements and/or written promotion/transfer policies.     oThe EOS, however, should be observant of any indications that the skills  brought by promotees/    transferees to the target job group are similarly available in other  potential feeder groups, particularly if those other potential feeder groups  have substantially better representation of minor-ities or women.  Where this is  the case, the contractor should broaden its feeder group defini-tion,  consistent with its affirmative action obligations.    (2)Percentage of Minorities/Women:  The contractor may  conclude that the  percentage of promotable minorities/ women in the feeder job groups is  approximately equivalent to their representation in those groups.  Where,  however, there are legitimate seniority or special qualification requirements  for promotion/transfer to the target job group, the contractor may identify  those persons who are or will become qualified during the AAP year and the  percentage that minorities/women represent among those persons (for a discussion  of ""legitimate"" qualification requirements, see Chapters 3 and 7).   Where the contractor identifies specific promotable/ transferable persons, this  can be verified by identifying the legitimate criteria used in determining who  is promotable or transferrable, and by reviewing the employment histories of  persons in the feeder job groups.      (3)Relevance of Factor:  The importance of this factor will be related to  whether the contractor normally fills jobs in the target job group by promotion  from within or by hire.  Review of employment activity for the prior AAP year  will show the proportion of placements which resulted from internal movement as  opposed to new hire.  Where this activity has been too limited to be  representative, the work histories of persons in the target group may be  reviewed to determine the proportion who came via promotion or transfer vs. by  new hire.  In addition, labor agreements often contain rules governing promotion  and transfer for jobs in certain sectors of the workforce.    (g)The existence of training institutions capable of training persons in the  requisite skills (Refer to 41 CFR 60-2.11(b) (1)(vii)and 41 CFR  60-2.11(b)(2)(vii)):  This may be the percentage of minorities and women  enrolled in those educational and training institutions serving the  contractor's recruitment needs.      (1)Sources of Data:  Contractors should contact those educational and  training institutions with programs which match their employment needs.  These  can range from local high schools with business or vocational programs through  local technical schools to colleges nationwide.  Such institutions should be  able to provide data on the number and percentage of minorities and women  enrolled in programs appropriate to the contractor's employment needs.     (2)Relevance of Factor:  The extent to which the contrac- tor considers this  factor will depend on the degree to which new graduates of such programs are or  can be utilized in making placements to a particular job group.  For example, a  contractor filling positions in an entry-level clerical job group may hire new  graduates from local high schools and business colleges, but may hire only  experienced persons for a non-entry level clerical job group.     (h)The degree of training which the contractor is reasonably able to  undertake as a means of making all job classes available to minorities/women  (Refer to 41 CFR 60-2.11(b) (1)(viii) and 41 CFR 60-2.11(b)(2)(viii)):  This  factor requires the contractor to make an assessment of the number of employees  who could, with appropriate training, become promotable or transferrable during  the AAP year, and to determine what percentage minorities/women constitute of  that number.     (i)Data Used Must Be Accurate:  Data used for each availability factor must  be accurate and up-to-date.  Sources of data must be identified in the AAP.    (j)Consideration of Each Factor:  The contractor must consider each factor  and must explain in its AAP how it has done so. It may not be necessary,  however, for the contractor to make each factor a part of any final availability  estimate.  Only those factors which are relevant to the actual availability of  the job group under evaluation need be used.  Moreover, contractors may give  differential consideration (e.g., by mathematical weighting or by other means)  to some or all of the individual factors in determining final availability     estimates for each job group.  Where a contractor gives such differential  consideration to factors, the AAP should specifically identify the weights  applied or other methods used.  If the AAP contains no explanation of how the  contractor has considered each factor, or if an explanation is provided but  further investigation and verification is needed  (e.g., if the AAP states that  certain job groups are filled solely by internal means, and this cannot be  verified from the AAP), the EOS should plan to address the matter onsite.    (k)Summary Guidelines For Audit of Acceptability:  In summary, in evaluating  a contractor's final availability estimates for acceptability, the following  general guidelines can be used:    (1)Entry Level Jobs, No Special Skills/Experience:  For entry level jobs  which do not require any special skills or experience, availability for  minorities and women should be close to their workforce participation rates;      (2)Entry Level Jobs, Some Skills/Experience:  For entry level jobs which  require some skills (education and/or experience), availability for minorities  and women should be at least equal to the requisite skills figure for either the  reasonable recruiting area or immediate recruiting area, whichever figure is  larger;    (3)Jobs Filled Through Internal Means Only:  For jobs which are filled  solely through internal means, availability should normally be at least equal to  the percentage which minorities and women represent in all appropriate feeder  job groups.      2G06IDENTIFICATION OF UNDERUTILIZATION    The regulations at 41 CFR 60-2.11(b) define underutilization as ""...having  fewer minorities or women in a particular job group than would reasonably be  expected by their availability.""  Contractors are required in the AAP to  compare availability to incumbency for each job group, and to identify those job  groups which are underutilized.  In evaluating the acceptability of the method  used by a contractor to determine underutilization, EOSs must ensure that the  method used conforms to the requirements of the regulations, that it is  appropriate, and that it has been accurately applied.    2G07GOALS    Having identified a job group as underutilized for minorities and/or women,  the contractor must establish employment goals and exert every good faith effort  toward meeting them.  Such goals must be established separately for minorities  and women.  In setting goals, the contractor should consider:     (a)Level of Goals:  Goals for an underutilized job group must be at least  equal to the percentage availability of minorities or women (as appropriate)  for the job group, as determined by a properly developed utilization analysis  which considers at least those factors discussed in section 2G05 above (see 41  CFR 60-2.11(b)).    (b)Goals Are not Quotas:  41 CFR 60-2.12(e) indicates that goals "". . .  may not be rigid and inflexible quotas which must be met, but must be targets  reasonable attainable by means of applying every good faith effort to make all  aspects of the entire affirmative action program work.""    (c)Separate Goals by Particular Minority Group:  Where appropriate,  separate goals may also be required by particular minority group(s) or by sex  within a particular minority group if there is a substantial disparity in the  utilization of a particular minority group or of men or women of a particular  minority group.  Where the EOS identifies such a substantial disparity (see  Section 2K01(d) and the instructions for SCRR page 7) and the contractor has  not estab-lished a separate goal, the EOS will first determine if the disparity  represents potential discrimination.  If potential discrimination is not found,  separate affirmative action goals to eliminate the disparity may be required  (see 41 CFR 60-2.12(l)).  In order to ensure that such goals are reasonable,  they should be based on a separate availability analysis for the minority group  (or men or women of the minority group) involved in the job group(s) where the  disparity is observed.      2G08ADOPTING AN EEO POLICY    41 CFR 60-2.13(a) requires that a contractor commit itself, in writing, to a  policy of equal employment opportunity in all personnel actions.  The policy  statement must be in the AAP.  It should be signed by the top establishment  official and dated.  It must be reaffirmed annually.  41 CFR 60-2.20 provides  guidance for evaluating the content of the contractor's EEO policy statement.      2G09DISSEMINATION OF THE POLICY    41 CFR 60-2.13(b) requires that the AAP provide for formal inter-nal and  external dissemination of the contractor's policy.  To be acceptable, the AAP  must address how the policy is disseminated, internally and externally.  41 CFR  60-2.21 provides guidance for evaluating dissemination of the policy.  For  example, the AAP may state that the policy is posted in conspicuous places  accessible to employees and applicants for employment, and that the policy is  discussed with management employees having responsibility for making employment  decisions.  External dissemination may include notifying recruitment sources,  community organizations, subcontractors and labor unions, where applicable, of  its policy on equal employment opportunity and affirmative action.     2G10RESPONSIBILITY FOR IMPLEMENTATION    Under 41 CFR 60-2.13(c), contractors are required to provide for the  implementation of the AAP.  To be acceptable, the AAP must identify the person  who is responsible for implementation of the policy and must describe how the  policy is implemented, in sufficient detail for the EOS to be able to audit  compliance.  Guidance as to the types of actions a contractor may take to  implement this requirement is provided at 41 CFR 60-2.22.  For example, an EEO  officer is central to the success of the affirm-ative action program, since he  or she is responsible for ensuring that the contractor takes steps to implement  the AAP.  The AAP should identify the EEO Officer by name and/or title, and may  describe his or her duties and responsibilities as well as those of line  managers with respect to EEO.      2G11IDENTIFICATION OF PROBLEM AREAS    41 CFR 60-2.13(d) requires that problem areas (or deficiencies) be  identified by organizational unit and by job group.  41 CFR 60-2.23 provides  additional guidance on some types of self-analyses which contractors may conduct  in identifying problem areas.  To be acceptable, the AAP must provide evidence  that the contractor has addressed the following:    (a)Employment Processes:  The contractor must examine its basic employment  processes (recruitment, hiring, training, promotion, transfer, termination) to identify any impediments to the full utilization of minorities and women.  To do so, in its AAP, the contractor may  use any analysis that measures how these processes affect minorities and women.   For example, the contractor may use Impact Ratio Analyses (NOTE:  Please also  see Sections 2H01(a) and 2O04 of this Chapter for the contractor's obligations  under 41 CFR Part 60-3 to maintain employment activity data and analyze them for  adverse impact.  While not a required AAP ingredient, the    contractor may choose to use this analysis as a tool for problem  identification in this section of its AAP).    (b)Organizational Unit:  The contractor must examine the distribution of  minorities and women among its organization-al units.  To do so, the contractor  may use any analysis that identifies any problem areas in such distribution, for  example, the contractor may use a Job Area Acceptance Range (JAAR) type analysis  to identify areas of minority or female concentration/underrepresentation)  and/or a utilization analysis applied to job groups within such units.    2G12ESTABLISHMENT OF GOALS AND OBJECTIVES - GOALS BY ORGANIZATIONAL UNIT       41 CFR 60-2.13(e) requires that goals and objectives by organ-izational unit  as well as job group be established to correct identifiable deficiencies.  Goals  by organizational unit, however, refer to action-oriented efforts rather than  percentage goals.  Where problem areas by organizational unit have been  identified in accordance with 41 CFR 60-2.13(d), the AAP must include a  description of the efforts which the contractor has taken or will take to  correct those problem areas. This correc-tive action may be addressed in the AAP  section on Development of Action-Orientated Programs (below), and may include  goals for the improvement of recruitment efforts, dissemination of additional  information on job openings (e.g., pay, opportunities, duties), encouraging  transfers and promotions, creating training opportunities, etc.      2G13DEVELOPMENT AND EXECUTION OF ACTION-ORIENTED PROGRAMS    41 CFR 60-2.13(f) requires the development and execution of action-oriented  programs to correct identified problem areas and to attain established goals and  objectives.  41 CFR 60-2.24 provides suggested standards which the EOS can use  to assess the contractor's compliance with this requirement.  For example, the  contractor may commit to increasing the number of qualified minorities and women  in the appropriate candidate pool, since with more women and minorities in the  candidate pool, the logical outcome, absent discrimination, is an increase in  the number of minorities and women hired, promoted, etc.     (a)Contractor Responsibility:  It is the contractor's responsibility to both  develop and execute action-oriented programs.  However, it is the EOS'  responsibility to make a professional judgement as to:    (1)Specificity:  Whether the action-oriented programs are sufficiently  specific and result-oriented to accomplish the aims for which they were created;  and     (2)Execution:  Whether the action-oriented programs were properly executed.      (b)Specific Action-Oriented Programs:  A specific action-oriented program is  one that indicates what the action is, who will accomplish it, how it will be  accomplished and when it will be accomplished.  An action-oriented program  without any one of these ingredients cannot be considered specific.  Action-oriented programs designed to increase candidate pools can be developed  in two stages, (1) steps to be taken immediately to develop internal pools and  to establish a link with potential external pools; and (2) steps to be taken  each time a vacancy occurs in an underutilized area.    (c)Results-Oriented Programs:  A results-oriented action program is one  tailored in such a way that proper execution will result either in an increase  in the minority group/female representation in the job group, if vacancies occur, or clear  documentation of contractor action sufficient to constitute good faith effort.   An action-oriented program that does not meet this standard cannot be considered  results-oriented.    (d)Acceptability of Action Items:  The AAP's action items must be  sufficient, if implemented in good faith, to ensure that each of its specific  objectives and the overall intent of equal employment opportunity are achieved.      2G14INTERNAL AUDIT AND REPORTING    41 CFR 60-2.13(g) requires the contractor to design and implement internal  audit and reporting systems which measure the effectiveness of its total  affirmative action program.  This system must be detailed in its AAP.  The  system must permit adequate monitoring of progress made toward goal  accomplishment and implementation of other affirmative action commitments.    (a)Guidelines for Assessing Acceptability:  The regulations at 41 CFR  60-2.25 provide guidance for assessing the acceptability of a contractor's  internal audit and reporting system.  An acceptable audit and reporting system  is one which allows the contractor to measure the effectiveness of its total  program.  Such a system should include specific procedures for monitoring goals  progress and analyzing employment activity.    (b)Monitoring Goals Progress:  Since utilization and availability analyses  are conducted by job group, and where problems are identified, goals are  established by job group, monitoring of goals progress should be at least by  job group.  The importance of effective internal audit and reporting systems in  goal areas is further underscored by 41 CFR 60-1.40(c), which requires that the  results of the AAP shall be compiled annually (see Section 2H00 below).      (c)Monitoring Personnel Activity:  Audit and reporting systems should also  monitor personnel activity (e.g., hires, promotions/transfers, terminations, and other activity) at least by job group and, where appropriate, by organizational unit.  The regulations at 41 CFR  60-1.40(b) require that a contractor's analysis include hiring practices,  upgrading, transfer and promotion for the past year.    (d)Information to be Maintained:  The regulations at 41 CFR 60-3.4 and  60-3.15A require that contractors with 100 or more employees: (1) maintain and  have available for each job, records sufficient to disclose the impact of the  selection process for that job on women and on each minority group for whom  EEO-1 reporting is required; and (2) conduct adverse impact analyses for women  and for each minority group that constitutes 2% or more of the relevant labor  area or of the  applicable internal workforce.  Where a contractor deter-    mines that a selection process has an adverse impact, evi-dence of validity,  as described in 41 CFR Part 60-3 must also be maintained and made available.   Contractors with fewer than 100 employees must maintain the records set forth in  41 CFR 60-3.15A(1)--e.g. the number of applicants and persons hired, promoted  and terminated by sex and by each minority group (as defined in (d)(1) above)  which consti-    tutes 2% or more of the labor force in the relevant labor area.  Such small  employers, however, are not required to conduct adverse impact analyses of these  data.  See further discussion under Sections 2H01(a) and 2O04 below and in  Questions and Answers Nos. 82-88 of Adoption of Questions and Answers to Clarify  and Provide a Common Interpretation of the Uniform Guidelines on Employee  Selection Procedures.      2G15SEX DISCRIMINATION GUIDELINES    The regulations at 41 CFR 60-2.13(h) require that the AAP contain evidence  of the contractor's compliance with the Sex Discrimina-    tion Guidelines at 41 CFR Part 60-20.  The requirements of the Executive  Order are deemed to preempt any State or local laws restricting the employment  of women.  See 41 CFR 60-2.31 and 41 CFR 60-20.3(f).      To be acceptable, the AAP must address each of the required subitems listed  in the regulations; specifically 41 CFR 60-20.2 through 60-20.6.  The contractor  should delineate in the AAP how each subitem is being implemented.  These  subitems include, but are not limited to:     (a)Conditions of Employment (Refer to 41 CFR 60-20.3, 60-20.4, 60-20.5 and  60-20.6):  A contractor must not make a distinc-tion based on sex in conditions  of employment.  Where State laws provide special minimum wages, overtime pay, or  brief rest periods for women, these benefits must also be given to men.  In  addition, contractors may not use these laws as bases for refusing to hire women  or for limiting their hours of work, etc.  AAPs must provide for the elimination  of any policies, procedures, or working conditions inconsistent with the  requirement of equal treatment.      (b)Distinctions Based on Marital Status (Refer to 41 CFR 60-20.3(d)):  Any  distinction between married and unmarried persons must apply equally to both  sexes.  For example, a contractor cannot refuse to hire women with young  children unless it applies the same exclusionary policy to men.      (c)Bona Fide Occupational Qualification (BFOQ) (Refer to 41 CFR 60-20.3(b)):   A contractor must consider women as well as men for all jobs, unless sex is a  bona fide occupational qualification (BFOQ).  Under Title VII, sex has been  found to be a BFOQ for a job only in extremely rare instances.  Among these have  been:    (1)Authenticity:  Jobs involving a need for authenticity or genuineness,  such as actors or models.    (2)Personal Privacy:  Jobs where the performance of essen-tial job elements  would entail substantial invasion of personal privacy (for example, a permanent  restroom attendant).  This is limited to situations where the normal operation  of the contractor's business depends on the employee being of the same sex as  its employees or customers and there is no other way that privacy could be  ensured.  IMPORTANT:  This is different from customer preference.  For example,  a contractor cannot refuse to hire female salespersons in the belief that they  will not be as well accepted by customers as males.     (d)Employment Opportunities (Refer to 41 CFR 60-20.3(b), 3(c) and 5(b):    (1)Hazardous Jobs:  A contractor may not exclude women from a job it may  believe is dangerous or unsuitable for women to perform unless sex is a BFOQ  (see Section 2G15(c) above).    (2)Reproductive Hazards:  OFCCP follows Title VII prin-ciples when  determining whether a policy excluding     women from a job because of a concern about reproduc-tive hazards is  discriminatory.  If a question relat-ing to reproductive hazards arises during a  compliance review, the EOS should consult, through appropriate channels, with  the Regional Solicitor's Office.    (e)Wage Discrimination (Refer to 41 CFR 60-20.3(c) and 41 CFR 60-20.5(a)and  (b)):  A contractor must compensate employees without regard to sex.  The most  obvious form of wage discrimination occurs when men and women are paid different   wages for performing the same jobs, or jobs which are substantially equal.       (f)Employment Advertising (Refer to 41 CFR 60-20.2(b)):  A con-tractor's  advertisements in newspapers or other media must not express a sex preference  unless the job is one for which sex is a BFOQ (see Section 2G15(c) above).  The  placement of ads in columns headed ""male"" or ""female"" (or ""male  interest"" or ""female interest"") or which otherwise indicate an  orien-tation with regard to sex is considered an expression of preference,  limitation, or specification based on sex and is prohibited.    (g)Employee Benefits:  Refer to discussion of this issue in Chapter 3.     (h)Maternity Leave:  Refer to discussion of this issue in Chapter 3.    2G16SUPPORT OF COMMUNITY ACTION PROGRAMS    The AAP must address the contractor's active support of local and national  community action programs and community service programs which are designed to  improve the employment opportunities of mi-norities and women, as required by 41  CFR 60-2.13(i).  The regu- lations at 41 CFR 60-2.26 provide guidance on the  types of activ-ities which demonstrate active support of local and national  com-munity action and community service programs.  Among these are the  appointment of key members of management to serve on the boards of such  organizations, and active participation in pro- grams for youth sponsored by the  National Alliance of Business-men.  To be acceptable, the AAP should identify  the programs supported, and indicate the type of support (i.e., personnel,  equipment, etc.) given to local and national programs designed to improve  employment opportunities for minorities and women.  The EOS should be familiar  with the types of programs available, both locally and nationally.  The types of  programs, and the degree of support provided, should be consistent with the  nature of the problems identified in the AAP, and may form a component part of  the contractor's organizational goals and development of action programs.    2G17CONSIDERATION OF MINORITIES AND WOMEN NOT CURRENTLY IN THE WORKFORCE      The regulations at 41 CFR 60-2.13(j) require that the AAP address the  contractor's consideration of minorities and women not cur- rently in the  workforce having requisite skills who can be re- cruited through affirmative  action measures.  To be acceptable, the AAP should specify the contractor's  involvement with programs which facilitate the employment of minorities and  women.  Pro- grams offered by the contractor could include providing part-time  employment, flexible hours (flexitime) or dependent care bene-fits, as well as  participating in high school or college co-op programs, particularly with  educational institutions with signi-ficant minority and/or female enrollments.       2HREVIEW OF EXECUTIVE ORDER SUPPORT DATA FOR ACCEPTABILITY    2H00REPORT ON GOALS    41 CFR 60-1.40(c) requires that the contractor prepare a report of results  of its prior year AAP.  This report is part of the support data for the AAP, and  is requested on the itemized list-ing enclosed with the Scheduling Letter  (Figure 2-2a, paragraph f).  The listing requests summary data and information  indicating the numerical and other results of affirmative action goals for each  job group for the current year and for the preceding year.  For each goal not  attained (prior year) or not being attained (current year), the contractor is  requested to describe its good faith efforts.  Prior year data should always be  submitted, unless the contractor was not previously covered by 41 CFR     Part 60-2; current year data should be provided at least where the  contractor is six months or more into its current AAP year at the time it  receives the Scheduling Letter.      (a)Data Required:  As noted above, the contractor must provide summary data  indicating the numerical results of affirmative action goals for each job group.       (1)Information on Job Groups with Goals:  To measure results of goals, one  must first know for which job groups goals were established and what those goals  were.  The contractor's current AAP submitted for desk audit will show this  information for current year goals.  Where the contractor's report on prior year  goals does not specifically state what the prior year goals were, the EOS will  contact the contractor and request that a copy of the goals section of its prior  year AAP be forwarded to permit evaluation of prior year goals progress.    (2)Information on Placements into Job Groups with Goals: Since an annual  goal is established in terms of a per- centage placement rate, evaluating  progress towards it requires knowledge of the total number of placements into  the job group and the number of minority or female placements, as appropriate.   If the contractor's prog-ress report does not give this information or gives it  only in part (i.e., the number of minority/female but not total placements,  etc.), the EOS will determine if the information can be extracted from the  contractor's submission of personnel activity data.  If it cannot be so  extracted, the EOS will contact the contractor and ask that it forward a copy of  reports on goals progress prepared under its internal audit and reporting  systems (41 CFR 60-2.13(g)) and/or, if the contractor employs 100 or more  persons, a copy of the underlying data it used for its adverse impact  determinations on hires, promotions and any other placements into job titles  within the job group (see Section 2H01(a)(2) below).      (b)Good Faith Effort:  Where the contractor's report does not describe its  good faith efforts in a job group where a goal was established but not attained,  or does not describe those efforts in sufficient detail for the EOS to evaluate  their adequacy, the EOS will include the job group as part of the onsite plan  for evaluation of good faith effort (SCRR page     11).    2H01 PERSONNEL ACTIVITY DATA    The itemized listing enclosed with the Scheduling Letter requests  information on personnel activities (e.g., selection--applicant flow and hiring,  promotion and transfer, and terminations) for the prior and current ""goal""  (AAP) years.  The listing requests that the data be provided by race (meaning by  each minority group for whom EEO-1 reporting is required) and sex for each job  group, but permits a contractor to submit the information ""...in the form  in which it is available.""     (a)When Data Are Not Submitted:  If, in response to the Scheduling Letter,  the contractor does not submit any personnel activity data, or does not submit  data for one or more of the activity elements of applicants, hires, promotions  or terminations, a Show Cause Notice should be issued.    (1)If a Show Cause Notice is being issued at desk audit for other reasons  (e.g., see Sections 2C01 and 2F), the failure to submit the activity data will  be included in that Notice.    (2)If the only reason a Show Cause Notice is being issued is failure to  submit the activity data, see Chapter 8, Figure 8-3.    Revised 5-25-90    (b) Regulatory Citations:    (1)General Data Requirements under the Uniform Guidelines on Employee  Selection Procedures (41 CFR Part 60-3):    41 CFR 60-3.4(A) requires that each contractor "". . . maintain and have  available for inspection records or other information which will disclose the  impact which its . . . selection procedures have upon the employment  opportunities of persons by identifiable race, sex, or ethnic groups. . .""   Such identifiable groups are defined by 41 CFR 60-3.4(B) as those groups for  whom     EEO-1 reporting is required--i.e., Blacks, Hispanics, Asian/Pacific  Islanders, American Indians/Alaskan Natives--along with Whites and totals.    (2)Data Requirements under 41 CFR Part 60-3 for Contractors with 100 or More  Employees*:  Contractors with 100 or more employees are more specifically  required by 41 CFR 60-3.15A(2) to maintain and have available records for each  job on applicants, hires, promotions and terminations (and any other selection  decisions) by sex and by each minority group for whom EEO-1 reporting is  required (also see Sections 2G14(d) and 2O04(a)).     (3)41 CFR Part 60-2 Requirements:  In addition to the basic record keeping  requirements in 41 CFR 60-3.4 and 60-3.15, the requirements discussed earlier in  this Chapter that the AAP identify problem areas (41 CFR    60-2.13(d)) and include internal audit and reporting systems (41 CFR  60-2.13(g)) may be cited because they cannot be acceptably implemented without  maintenance and analysis of the basic data on employment activity required by 41  CFR 60-3.4 and 60-3.15.  Failure to submit specific types of employment activity  may be cited as follows:    (a)Applicant Flow and Hires:  41 CFR 60-2.12(m) requires that the AAP  contain, as part of the supporting data, applicant flow data and applicant  rejection ratios (hiring IRAs) indicating minority and sex status. Such  applicant rejection ratios cannot be computed without data on hires by minority  group and sex.  Also, 41 CFR 60-1.40(b)(2) requires that the AAP contain an  analysis of hiring practices for the past year (including recruitment sources  and testing).    __________    *Simplified record keeping requirements for employers of under 100 persons  are described at 41 CFR 60-3.15A(1), and summarized in 2G14(d).  They are not  reiterated here because OFCCP only occasionally reviews supply and service  contractors with under 100 employees.    Revised 5-25-90    (b)Promotions (Transfers, Upgrading Generally):  41 CFR 60-1.40(b)(3)  requires that the AAP include an analysis of upgrading, transfer, and promotion  for the past year.    (c) Review of Data Submitted for Acceptability    (1)Data Format:  To be acceptable for desk audit, the data must be presented  either by job group (as requested in the Scheduling Letter) or by job title (as  required by 41 CFR Part 60-3; see Section 2H01(b)(1) and (2)     above.  If data are submitted in some larger aggrega-tion than job group,  see Section 2H01(d) below.  For example, data by total workforce are not  acceptable, nor are data by EEO category, unless a category legit-imately  constitutes a job group at the particular establishment (see Section 2G02).    (2)Information to be Included:  For each job group or job title, support  data in each major area (applicant flow, hires, promotions and terminations)  must include at least:  the total number of actions, the total number of actions  for women, and the total number of actions for each minority group (as specified  in 2H01(a)(1) above).  For example, applicant flow for a job group or job must  include at least total applicants, total female applicants and total applicants  of each minority group; hires for a job group or job title must include at least  total hires, total female hires and total hires of each minority group, etc.      (3)Period To Be Covered:  Generally, the longer the period covered the  better, because the data are more likely to reflect the contractor's usual way  of operating.  At minimum, however, the data must cover the prior AAP year and,  if the contractor is six months or more into its current AAP year when it  receives the Scheduling Letter, the data must also at least cover the first six  months of the current AAP year.    (d)Action When Data Are Unacceptable:  If employment activity data are  submitted, but are not acceptable (are, as noted immediately above, in  aggregations larger than job group; are not provided by sex and/or by each  minority group, etc.), the EOS should call the contractor and request that the  appropriate changes be made and the data resubmitted within 10 calendar days.   If, at the end of 10 calendar days, the data have not been received in a form  that is acceptable, a Show Cause Notice should be issued which itemizes the  regulatory sections with which the contractor has been found in violation. (see  Section 2H01(b)(1) and (2) and Figure 8-4).    Revised 5-25-90    2IREVIEW OF SECTION 503 AND 38 U.S.C. 4212 AAP(S) FOR ACCEPTABILITY    2I00GENERAL    As with an Executive Order AAP, the determination of the accept-ability of  items listed on page 4 of the SCRR for Section 503 and 38 U.S.C. 4212 AAPs is  limited to the evaluation which can be conducted at desk audit.  This is  different from an evaluation of the contractor's implementation of these items  which normally is done onsite (see Chapter 3).  Additionally, the Section 503  and 38 U.S.C. 4212 regulations require a number of contractor actions that,  while they need not be addressed in the AAP (although most contractors choose to  do so) must be carried out.  These addi-tional requirements are covered on SCRR  page 13, which is nor-mally completed onsite.     2I01ITEMS TO BE INCLUDED    The regulations at 41 CFR 60-741.5(a) require that a Section 503 AAP set  forth the contractor's policies, practices, and proce-dures in accordance with  41 CFR 60-741.6.  To be acceptable, a contractor's Section 503 AAP must address  at least those items listed in 41 CFR 60-741.6(a) through (f).  Similarly, the  regula-tions at 41 CFR 60-250.5(a) require that a 38 U.S.C. 4212 AAP set forth  the contractor's policies, practices and procedures in accordance with 41 CFR  60-250.6.  Therefore, to be acceptable, a contractor's 38 U.S.C. 4212 AAP must  address at least those items listed in 41 CFR 60-250.6(a) through (f).  Since  these items--(a) through (f)--are similar in both regulations, they are  discussed together below (where there are differences, it is pointed out).     2I02POLICY STATEMENT (Refer to 41 CFR 60-250.4(a) and 250.6(a) and 41 CFR  60-741.4(a) and 741.6(a).)    Contractors are required to take affirmative action to employ and advance in  employment qualified special disabled veterans, veterans of the Vietnam era,  and individuals with disabilities.  The con-tractor must affirm its commitment  to this affirmative action re-quirement by incorporating it in a policy  statement included in its AAP(s).      2I03REVIEW OF PERSONNEL POLICIES FOR PROPER CONSIDERATION OF QUALIFICATIONS  (Refer to 41 CFR 60-250.6(b) and 41 CFR 60-741.6(b).)    To be acceptable, the AAP(s) must affirm that the contractor has reviewed  its personnel processes to determine whether its present procedures ensure  careful, thorough, and systematic consideration of the job qualifications of  known individuals with disabilities, special disabled veterans, and Vietnam era  veterans who are applicants for job vacancies filled by employment or promotion,  and for all training opportunities offered or available.      (a)Use of Appendices B and C:  The procedures described at 41 CFR Part  60-250, Appendix B and/or 41 CFR Part 60-741, Ap- pendix C may be utilized in  fulfillment of this requirement.  Those procedures describe how the applications  or personnel forms of covered veterans and persons with disabilities may be  annotated regarding consideration for employment opportunities.     (b)Additional Requirement Under 41 CFR Part 60-250:  41 CFR 60-250.6(b) also  requires the contractor to limit its consider-ation of a covered veteran's  military record to only the portion of that record which is relevant to the  specific job qualifications for which the veteran is being considered.  This  should be affirmed in the AAP.    (c)Adequacy of Present Procedures:  If the contractor asserts that its  present procedures are adequate, this is acceptable if the EOS' investigation  shows that individuals with disabilities and covered veterans are afforded  hire, promotion and training opportunities.      2I04PHYSICAL AND MENTAL QUALIFICATIONS (Refer to 41 CFR 60-250.6(c)(1) and  41 CFR 60-741.6(c)(1).)    The AAP must contain the contractor's schedule for the review of all  physical and mental job qualification requirements.    (a)Scheduled Review:  To be acceptable, the AAP must either affirm that the  review of physical and mental job qualifications requirements has been completed, or provide a specific time schedule by which jobs are to be reviewed.  Where the AAP indicates that the review has  been completed, the contractor is not required to review those physical and  mental job qualification requirements again unless there is a change in working  conditions.  The AAP should state, however, that where there is such a change  in working conditions--for example, through increased automation--the re-  quirements will be reevaluated.    (b)Job-Relatedness of Physical and Mental Qualifications:  The AAP must  affirm that physical or mental job qualification requirements, to the extent  that such requirements tend to screen out qualified individuals with  disabilities or qualified special disabled veterans, shall be related to the  specific jobs for which such individuals are being considered, and shall be  consistent with business necessity and the safe performance of the job (refer to  41 CFR 60-250.6(c)(2) and 41 CFR 60-741.6(c)(2)).    (c)Confidentiality of Information:  To be acceptable, the AAP must affirm  that whenever the contractor inquires into an applicant or employee's physical  or mental condition or conducts a medical examination prior to employment or  change in employment status, information obtained as a result will be kept  confidential, except as otherwise provided for in the regulations (see 41 CFR  60-250.6(c)(3) and 41 CFR 60-741.6(c)(3)).      2I05REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION TO PHYSICAL AND MENTAL LIMITATIONS (Refer to 41  CFR 60-250.6(d)and 41 CFR    60-741.6(d).)    Contractors are required to make reasonable accommodation to the physical  and mental limitations of individuals with disabilities and special disabled  veterans, unless the contractor can demonstrate that such accommodation would  impose an undue hardship on the conduct of its business.  In determining the  extent to which a contractor is obligated to make accommodations, such factors  as business necessity and financial costs and expenses may be considered.  To  be acceptable, this section of the AAP must contain the contractor's policy with  respect to reasonable accommodations.  That statement must be consistent with  the requirements of the regulations.      2I06COMPENSATION (Refer to 41 CFR 60-250.6(e) and 41 CFR 60-741.6(e).)    In order to address this requirement in an acceptable manner, the AAP must  affirm that, in offering employment or promotion to in- dividuals with  disabilities, special disabled veterans, or veterans of the Vietnam era, the  amount of compensation offered is not reduced due to their receipt of any  disability income, pension or other benefit received from another source.      2I07OUTREACH, POSITIVE RECRUITMENT, EXTERNAL DISSEMINATION OF POLICY Refer  to 41 CFR 60-250.6(f) and 41 CFR    60-741.6(f).)    An acceptable AAP must affirm that the contractor reviews its employment  practices, and must at least state that appropriate outreach and positive  recruitment activities are undertaken where indicated by the findings of such  reviews.  The AAP may also describe in some detail the steps taken by the  contractor in its review of employment practices and the resulting outreach and  recruitment activities.  41 CFR 60-250.6(f) and 41 CFR 60-741.6(f) provide  additional guidance in assessing the accept- ability of this part of the  contractor's AAP(s).    2I08ADDITIONAL AAP INGREDIENTS    The following additional ingredients should be included in the contractor's  Section 503 and 38 U.S.C. 4212 AAP(s):    (a)Internal Dissemination of Policy (Refer to 41 CFR 60-250.6 (g) and 41 CFR  60-741.6(g)):  The AAP should address the contractor's procedures for internal  dissemination of its affirmative action policy.  The regulations cited above  provide examples of the types of activities contractors may take in this area  (e.g., contractors may conduct meetings with executive, managerial, and  supervisory personnel to explain the intent of the policy and to delineate  individual responsibility for its implementation, include the policy in internal  publications, etc.).    (b)Responsibility for Implementation (Refer to 41 CFR 60-250.6 (h) and 41  CFR 60-741.6(h)):  The AAP should identify the person(s) responsible for  implementing the contractor's policy with respect to individuals with  disabilities and covered veterans and should describe his or her  responsibilities.  It should also describe the responsibilities of line  man-agement in carrying out the policy.  The regulations cited  above provide  further guidance in this area.     (c)Development and Execution of Action Programs (Refer to 41 CFR 60-250.6(i)  and 41 CFR 60-741.6(i)):  The AAP should include a description of the specific  action programs which have been developed and implemented by the contractor.   The regulations cited above provide guidance on types of action programs.  While  the action programs described are guide- lines, not requirements, they do  provide a means by which the contractor's efforts to comply with its affirmative  action and equal employment opportunity obligations, as described in the AAP(s),  can be evaluated.    2JSUMMARY OF PROBLEMS WITH AAP AND SUPPORT DATA AND DEVELOPMENT OF ONSITE  PLAN    Problems identified with the completeness, reasonableness and/or  acceptability of the AAPs and support data are checked on page 4 of the SCRR,  and the specific problem described on SCRR page 9.  For each such problem,  actions taken at desk audit to resolve it and/or actions planned for onsite are  described.    2J00ITEMS RESOLVED AT DESK AUDIT    Some problems with the AAP(s) and support data may be resolved at desk audit  after further contact with the contractor.  For exam-ple, if the problem were ""Can't  evaluate job group acceptability because there is no information on what job  titles are in each group,"" the entry may be ""Called J. Smith 5/1/88  and asked him to send a list of titles in each group.  List received 5/8/88.""      2J01ITEMS TO BE RESOLVED ONSITE - ONSITE PLAN    Other items will only be resolvable onsite, and an onsite plan for each  should be briefly described.  For example, if the problem were ""Minority  availability for Foremen group appears low given minority % in blue collar area,""  the entry may be ""Determine how foreman jobs filled.  If internally,  examine incumbents' files to identify feeder jobs.""  If a problem has not  been resolved by the conclusion of desk audit, the column labeled ""Onsite?""  on SCRR page 9 is checked.  These checked items constitute the onsite plan for  resolving AAP and support data problems.    2KOVERVIEW OF PERSONNEL ACTIVITY, EEO TRENDS AND WORKFORCE  STRUCTURE/PERSONNEL PRACTICES    2K00PERSONNEL ACTIVITY (SUMMARY)    Page 5 of the SCRR provides an overview, by EEO-1 category, of personnel  activity during the prior year.  A summary of data on hires, promotions and  terminations should be abstracted from the data provided by the contractor, and  entered on the page.  A similar report, using a substitute SCRR page, can be  prepared from EEO-6 data for educational institutions.  This information, used  in conjunction with historical data analyzed through the EEO Trend Analysis  (below) provides a broad framework for later detailed review by job group of  affirmative action progress (placement goals) and potential discrimination in  employment activity (Impact Ratio Analysis).  Also, because this information is  by particular minority group, it can be used in conjunction with the EEO Trend  Analysis (below) to identify any potential problems for a particular minority  group.    2K01EEO TREND ANALYSIS    An initial assessment of the contractor's workforce and utilization trends  can be made by reviewing EEO-1 reports.  Page 6 of the SCRR is a Worksheet for  entry of EEO-1 data and page 7 provides for a narrative evaluation of those  data.    (a)Long-Term, Short-Term:  Current AAP data are compared with:  (1) the  contractor's profile approximately five years ago    (drawn from the earliest data on the current EEDS report) to look at  long-term trends; and (2) that profile approximately one year ago to look at  short-term trends.  An alternate SCRR page 6 is available for use with EEO-6  data (which are reported on a two-year cycle) for university reviews.  This  information provides an overview of:    oThe distribution of jobs within the contractor's workforce (white-collar,  blue-collar, predominant EEO categories);    oThe direction of change in the total workforce and particular categories  (expanding, contracting, stable); and    oWhether minority and female representation has been increasing or  decreasing, and in what areas.    (b)Changes Due to Reclassifications:  If the EOS observes major changes in  the sizes of EEO categories (p. 6) with little or no corresponding activity (p.  5), further investigation onsite may be needed to determine if the changes are  due to the reclassification of jobs with concentrations of minorities or women  from one EEO-1 category to another.  For example, suppose the total number of  positions in the craft category increases from one year to the next and  indicates an increase in women. Over the same time period, however, both the  total number of operative positions and the total number of women listed as  operatives decreases.  The EOS may then infer that the increase in crafts may  have resulted from the contractor's changing the EEO-1 category of the women's  jobs, rather than from genuine promotions.    (c)EEO Category Patterns:  This analysis also permits identification of  broad areas where minorities/women have been persistently underrepresented or  concentrated, setting a framework for the detailed review of the workforce  analysis for potential discrimination problems and review of the contractor's  goals progress by job group.    (d)Particular Minority Group:  Additionally, this analysis permits  identification of any substantial disparity in the representation of a  particular minority group--whether in the workforce as a whole or in certain  categories--when compared to the distribution of particular minority groups in  the contractor's labor area and/or in possible internal feeder categories.   Where such a disparity is identified, the EOS should plan to conduct standard  discrimination analyses by the particular minority group, at least in those  workforce areas where the disparity exists and for the type of activity most  likely to have created the disparity.  For example, if Hispanics are well  represented in the labor area, but have historically been absent from the  contractor's workforce, the EOS should plan to conduct hiring IRAs separately  for Hispanics.  Or, if Blacks have historically been concentrated in Laborers,  but poorly represented in Operatives and Crafts:  (1) the EOS' review of the  workforce analysis should focus on the types of jobs held by Blacks and any  structural impediments to upward mobility from those jobs; and (2) the EOS' blue  collar IRAs--particularly for promotions and hires into jobs above  Laborers--should be conducted separately for Blacks.  Further discussion of such  separate discrimination analysis for a particular minority group is given at  Sections 2N00 and 2O02 below.  Please also note that if investigation of such a  disparity does not show discrimination, the EOS should consider whether goals  and/or specific affirmative action steps for the particular group are warranted  (see Section 2G07(c) above).    2K02WORKFORCE STRUCTURE, PERSONNEL PRACTICES     In the initial review of the AAP and support data, the EOS eval-uated the  workforce analysis for reasonableness and acceptabil-ity.  As a result, the EOS  should have a basic understanding of the contractor's organization and  operations.  For example, the workforce analysis should show whether the  contractor's facility is organized by department or other unit (e.g., division),  whether lines of progression exist, how pay is structured, and other  characteristics which may prove useful for subsequent analyses of both  affirmative action and potential discrimination issues.  Other supporting data  which may be provided with the AAP, such as copies of labor agreements, should  provide additional information regarding pay rates, work performed,  organizational structure, and rules for internal mobility, at least in the blue  collar sector.  This information, to the extent that it is available during the  desk audit, should be entered on page 8 of the SCRR.      2LGOALS PROGRESS AND GOOD FAITH EFFORTS    A contractor's compliance posture is not measured by whether it met all its  goals, but rather whether it made a good faith effort to do so.  Generally,  however, if properly determined goals in a job group were met, further  examination of good faith effort with respect to that job group is unnecessary.   Therefore, in order to focus the investigation of good faith effort, the  following steps are taken:  (1) measure the degree of progress in job groups  where goals were established and opportunities occurred; (2) evaluate the  contractor's resulting overall goals performance; and (3) identify areas where  specific additional information is needed in order to evaluate good faith  effort.    2L00  ANALYSIS OF GOALS PROGRESS    As noted earlier, to be acceptable, AAP support data must include a report  of progress on prior AAP year goals.  Also, a report of progress on current  goals should be included at least if the con-tractor is six months or more into  its current AAP year when it receives the Scheduling Letter.  This report should  be used to conduct the analysis of goals progress on page 10 of the SCRR.    (a)Data Needed:  To conduct this analysis, first the EOS must identify the  job groups for which goals were established at the beginning of the period under  review.  Second, the percentage placement goal for each such group must be  determined.  Third, for each such job group, the number of total placements and  the number of minority and of female placements must be determined.  If this  information has not been submitted for desk audit (see Section 2H00 above), the  EOS will conduct the analysis below at whatever point in the review sufficient  information is obtained.    (b)Analysis:  The analysis itself takes into consideration the number of  opportunities in relationship to the goal.  More specifically, the percentage  placement goal is multiplied by the number of placements that actually occurred  to determine how many minorities/women would have been placed if the goal were  met.  This result is then compared to the number of minorities/women who  actually were placed, and the difference--plus or minus--entered.    EXAMPLE:  If the contractor set a goal of 10% for minorities in XYZ job  group and had 20 openings, the goal would have been met if it placed 2  minorities (.10 X 20).  If the contractor actually placed one minority, the  difference would be ""-1.""  On the other hand, if it actually placed  five minorities, the difference would be ""+3.""    If the contractor established a goal for a particular minor-ity group or for  men or women of a particular minority group (see Section 2G07(c) above), the  evaluation of progress on that goal is conducted in the same fashion as in the  above example.  See the SCRR instructions for page 10 for further examples.       (c)Net Change:  SCRR page 10 also has an optional part II on Workforce  Change, which provides for entry of data on job group incumbency (total, women  and minorities) at the begin-ning of the period and at the end of the period,  and determination of net change (plus or minus).  This information may be  useful in identifying job groups where, although  there has been progress in  placements, there has been little or no improvement in minority and/or female  representation (this can be for either positive or negative reasons--i.e.,  disproportionate promotions out, terminations, etc.).  It can also help the EOS  to focus on anomalies in the contractor's data, such as increases in job group  size without evidence of placement activity.    2L01EVALUATION OF GOOD FAITH EFFORT    (a)Overall Performance:  In evaluating the contractor's good faith effort,  an overall assessment of its goals/affirmative action performance should first  be made (SCRR page 11,    part I).  For example, was there progress in most areas where goals were  established?  In areas with little progress, are there any balancing factors  such as strong performance in similar but higher level jobs?  For example,  little progress in Operatives II, but progress well above expectations in  Operatives III.  Were there performance problems in areas with poor long-term  trends (SCRR page 6)?  This evaluation should also take into account fulfillment  of AAP commitments and the quality of those commitments in terms of creative  problem solving to remove any impediments to minority/female utilization over  both the long and short term.    (b)Goal Areas Needing Further Examination for Good Faith Effort:  As a  result of the above evaluation, identify any goal areas which need further  evaluation for good faith effort (SCRR page 11, part II).  For each such goal  area, review any contractor description of good faith efforts pertinent to the  area.  This should be presented as part of the contractor's report on goals.   Also use the AAP and support data to try to identify the probable reason for  lack of progress and the type of AAP action items that would be pertinent.  For  example, do the support data on employment activity show that the jobs were  filled predominantly by hire or by promotion?  If by hire, was there low  applicant flow?  What AAP commitments did the contractor make on recruitment  efforts?  Is there any evidence they were fulfilled?  If jobs were filled  primarily by promotion, was there an adequate representation of minorities/women  in probable feeder groups?  What AAP commitments did the contractor make  concerning the promotion process (job posting, encouraging bidding, training,  etc.).  Is there any evidence they were fulfilled?    2L02ONSITE PLAN FOR EVALUATION OF GOOD FAITH EFFORT    For each goal area where there is insufficient desk audit information to  determine good faith effort, list (on SCRR page 11a, part II) the additional  information needed.  For example, in a Clerical I job group there may have been  no goals progress for minorities, and low applicant flow appears to be the  reason.  The AAP may state that a particular agency would be used to recruit  minority applicants for the Clerical 1 job group.  The additional information  needed here may include contact with the agency to confirm its use by the  contractor (as well as other action, such as identifying additional recruitment  sources while onsite).  If questions concerning good faith effort in a job area  have not been resolved by the conclusion of desk audit, the ""Onsite?""  column on SCRR page 11 is checked.  These checked items form the onsite plan for  this portion of the review.    2MPOTENTIAL DISCRIMINATION ANALYSES - GENERAL    2M00TITLE VII PRINCIPLES    It is OFCCP policy, in conducting analyses of potential discrimi-nation  issues under the Executive Order, to follow Title VII principles.    2M01USE OF TERM ""MINORITIES""     The term ""minorities"" means those four groups for which EEO-1  reporting is required--i.e. Blacks, Hispanics, Asians/Pacific Islanders and  American Indians/Alaskan Natives.  As used in these instructions for desk audit  potential discrimination analyses, ""minorities"" may mean those groups  in the aggregate or individually, depending on the characteristics of the labor  area and/or on patterns in the contractor's workforce.  In general, where there  is an observed disparity in the representation of a particular minority group,  standard desk audit potential discrimination analyses will be conducted  separately for that group.  See further discussion of this matter under EEO  Trend Analysis, Review of Workforce Analysis and Impact Ratio Analyses below.      2NREVIEW OF THE WORKFORCE ANALYSIS    2N00GENERAL    An understanding of how employees obtained their jobs, the effects of  seniority, rules for promotion and transfer, etc., is necessary in order to  understand how the contractor's employment system works.  Patterns of minority  and female employment must be examined, and apparent disparities (e.g., where  they are or are not employed in departments, progression lines, job titles, and  other relevant job areas) identified for further investigation onsite.  For  example, men may supervise work units which are composed predominantly of women;  or, a job title may be composed predominantly of minorities in one department,  and predominantly of nonminorities in another.  Such disparities may indicate  dis-criminatory placement or promotional practices or other Executive Order  violations.  The results of the review of minority and female employment  patterns is summarized on page 14 of the SCRR.     2N01MINORITY GROUP ANALYSIS    If the EOS' review of the contractor's EEO category data (SCRR page 7)  showed substantial disparities in the representation of a particular minority  group in the workforce as a whole or in distribution among EEO categories, the  review of the workforce analysis should focus on that minority group, at least  in those workforce areas where the disparity was observed.  For example, if  category data showed that Blacks were concentrated in Laborers, poorly  represented in Operatives and absent in Crafts, the EOS' review of the workforce  analysis should specifically identify the types of blue collar jobs in which  Blacks are employed, whether these jobs fall into lines of progression or  departments/ units that tend to inhibit progression to Operatives and Crafts,  etc.  Even where such disparities are not observed in the initial category  screen, where the labor area has high representation of more than one minority  group and/or the general employment patterns in the industry involved have  differed among minority  groups, in reviewing the workforce analysis the EOS  should be alert for any indications of potential problems in the distribution  of the particular minority groups.    2N02UNDERREPRESENTATIONS AND CONCENTRATIONS    In examining patterns of minority group and female employment, the EOS is  looking for evidence of concentrations and under-representations.    (a)Concentration:  The term concentration means that minority groups and/or  women are found in a particular section (job area) of a contractor's workforce  (however that section is defined) in numbers substantially greater than would be  expected in terms of their overall representation in the contractor's workforce,  or in a relevant sector (however defined) of that workforce.    (b)Underrepresentation:  The term underrepresentation means the  opposite--that minority groups and/or women are found in a particular section of  a contractor's workforce in numbers substantially fewer than would be expected  in terms of their overall representation in the contractor's workforce or  relevant sector of that workforce.      (c)Interpreting Results:  The identification of a concentration or  underrepresentation does not mean that discrimination has been found.  It is  only an indicator that further investigation is warranted.      2N03DETERMINING THE RELEVANT WORKFORCE SECTOR AND JOB AREAS     (a)Relevance of Other Information:  In determining the relevant workforce  sector and job areas for the analysis, the EOS must be guided by the findings of  the desk audit up to this point.  For example, the information obtained from the  EOS' earlier analysis of EEO trends (SCRR, page 7) can assist in identifying  areas, by EEO-1 category, which may show persistent minority or female  representation above or below comparable availability; or, as discussed in 2N00  above, the EOS may have identified a substantial disparity in the  representation of a particular minority group.  Information derived from the  earlier review of the organization of the contractor's workforce and personnel  practices (e.g., internal mobility, pay structure), (SCRR, page 8) may be  helpful in making further comparisons.    (b)Workforce Sector/Job Area - General:  In determining the relevant sector  of the contractor's workforce with which minority group or female representation  in a particular job area is to be compared (e.g., blue collar, white collar,  clerical, the entire workforce, or even job group), the EOS should remember that  there should be a reasonable expectation that, absent discrimination,  minorities/women would be fairly evenly distributed among the job areas within  the sector.  That expectation is high when (1) entry-level jobs in the sector  share similar qualification requirements; and (2) jobs above entry-level in the  sector are filled primarily by promotion.  The expectation gets progressively  lower as entry-level jobs in the sector become more differentiated in skill  requirements (since it becomes more likely that minority/female availability  will differ) and/or jobs above entry are filled predominantly by hire.    (c)Relationship to Particular Contractor:  An appropriate definition of the  workforce sector is, therefore, related to the particular contractor's  structure, legitimate skill needs and personnel practices.  In general, analyses  that focus on where minorities/women are located organizationally (which  departments, units, lines of progression, etc.) will tend to identify potential  placement problems.  Analyses that focus on the level at which minorities/women  are employed (concentrated in lowest level jobs within an LOP, department, etc.)  tend to identify potential promotion problems (that may, in turn, be related to  placement).  For example:    (1)Workforce as Sector/Departments as Job Area:  Where there are departments  or organizational units with largely similar qualifications for entry-level positions (e.g., unskilled and, to a more limited extent, semi-skilled, in blue-collar; undifferentiated trainee jobs in white-collar ), representation in each department may be compared to representation in the total workforce of all such departments.      (2)Workforce as Sector/Lines of Progression as Job Area: Where there are  lines of progression (LOPs) or usual promotional sequences that cut across  department lines and have similar entry-level requirements, representa-ion in  each LOP may be compared to representation in the total workforce of all such  LOPs.      (3)Department as Sector/LOPs within Department as Job Area:  Where there are  separate lines of progression and/or usual promotional sequences within a  department or similar organizational unit, representation in each LOP may be  compared to their representation in the department as a whole.    (4)Department as Sector/Jobs within Department as Job Area:  In the absence  of LOPs or usual promotional sequences, where jobs within a department are  usually filled by promotion from within--or might reasonably be filled in such a  manner based on the nature of the jobs involved and the training which the  contractor could reasonably be expected to offer (e.g., on-the-job  training)--representation in a particular job area within that department may be  compared to representation in the department as a whole.      (5)EEO Category as Sector/Type of Job as Job Area:  It can be useful to  compare representation in an EEO category or job group against distribution  within titles in that category/group.  For example, in an Office and Clerical  category, women may be concentrated in General Clerical positions, but  underrepresented in Production and Material Control clerical jobs.      (6)Lines of Progression as Sector/Jobs in LOP as Job Area: A line of  progression or usual promotional sequence--particularly one with a large number  of incumbents--may also be treated as a ""sector,"" and minority/female  representation in the LOP compared with their representation in jobs at  different levels in the LOP.    (7)Job Title as Sector/Job Title within Department as Job Area - Where a job  title--particularly one with a large number of total incumbents--appears in  several depart-ments, representation in the title as a whole can be compared  with representation in the title in each department.    (d)Applicability to Both White-Collar and Blue-Collar Jobs:  These analyses  can be applied to both white collar and blue collar situations.  In all cases,  the EOS should ensure that the sector of the contractor's workforce which is  used as a basis for comparison with a particular job area is, in fact, relevant.   Particularly in the white collar area, differences with respect to factors  such as education or skills may make establishing a basis for comparison  difficult.  However, where it appears that the majority of a white collar  workforce consists of highly specialized jobs (an engineering firm, a scientific  research laboratory), it is generally best to separate clerical positions from  other white collar jobs when defining the base of comparison.    (e)Defining ""Substantially"":  Once the job area and the relevant  workforce sector have been selected, the next step is to identify those job  areas which have ""substantially"" more or fewer minorities and/or women  than would reasonably be expected by their representation in the workforce  sector selected.  These are the job areas which will be investigated further  onsite.  The term ""substantially"" as used here, however, cannot be so  precisely defined as to fit all cases.  In identifying job areas for further  investigation, EOSs must be guided by common sense, reasonableness, and the  nature of the information available up to that point.  In some instances, areas  of minority group/female concentration and underrepresentation will be readily  apparent from review of the workforce analysis.  In others, there may be a need  for more precise identification of potential problem areas.  One method which  may be used to identify job areas for further investigation onsite is the Job  Area Acceptance Range (JAAR).    (f)Use of the Job Area Acceptance Range (JAAR):  The JAAR is a formula which  may be used to determine whether a particular job area represents an area of  concentration or underrepresentation for minorities and/or women.  There is an  optional SCRR Worksheet for using the JAAR.    (1)Relationship to ""80% or four-fifths"" Rule of Thumb:   The JAAR  is based on the ""80% or four-fifths"" rule of thumb, similar to that  used in identifying whether a selection rate for a particular group represents  an adverse impact in selection (see Impact Ratio Analyses below).  For the JAAR,  the assumption is that the percentage representation of minorities and/or women  in a particular job area will normally fall in a range plus or minus 20% of  their representation in the relevant base workforce sector.    (2)Computing the JAAR:  To find this range, therefore, the percentage of  minorities or women in the base sector is multiplied by .20 and the result is  added to and subtracted from the percentage of minorities or women in the base  sector.  For example, if the broad sector had 50% minorities, the JAAR range  would be found by multiplying 50% X .20, and the result, 10%, would be  subtracted from and added to 50% for a JAAR range of 40% to 60%.    (3)Applying the JAAR:  The minority/female percentage in each job area  within the base sector is then compared to the range.  If the percentage in a  job area falls below the range (in the example, less than 40%), the area is  considered underrepresented; if it exceeds the range (in the example, more than  60%), the job area is considered concentrated.    (g)Role of Recent Personnel Activity Data:  Employment data shown in the  workforce analysis represent a cumulative record of past employment activity.   Data summarized in Impact Ratio Analyses (IRAs, below) represent more recent  employment activity.  As a result, in determining which job areas should be  investigated further onsite, EOSs should give a high priority to areas in which  recent employment activity appears to mirror the effects of prior activity.  For  example, there may be adverse IRAs for placement into job groups in areas where  minorities and/or women are underrepresented.    (h)Recording Results:  When, as a result of the review of the workforce  analysis, job areas exhibiting concentrations and underrepresentations are  identified for further investigation onsite, this information is entered on  page 17 of the SCRR, and an onsite plan developed for their investigation.  This  plan may include a request for the contractor's adverse impact determinations  for job titles in concentrated/under- represented areas.  Such information may assist the EOS, in onsite analysis  of potential placement problems, in determining whether there has been activity and of what type during the normal liability period, etc.  See Section 2O04(a) below and Chapters 3 and 7.    2OAUDIT OF PERSONNEL ACTIVITY - IMPACT RATIO ANALYSES    2O00DEFINITION    The Impact Ratio Analysis (IRA) is a method for identifying personnel  activity which should be investigated further onsite.  The IRA is a ratio  between two selection rates, one for minorities or women, and one for others.  Generally, a selection rate for minorities or women which is less than 80% of the selection rate for  nonminorities or men, as appropriate, for a particular personnel activity (e.g.,  hiring, promotion, termination) should be investigated further during the  onsite.  Although related, adverse IRAs should not be confused with the term ""adverse  impact.""  Refer to Chapter 7, Section 7E01, for a definition of the latter  term.     2O01  CALCULATING THE IRA    Page 15 of the SCRR provides a Worksheet for conducting impact ratio  analyses.  The Worksheet is used to compute IRAs for hiring, promotions, and  terminations, and may be adapted to compute IRAs for other data the contractor  may provide (e.g., training, transfers, etc.).     (a)Selection Rates:  The first step in calculating the IRA is to find the  selection rate for minorities or women and the selection rate for others.    (b)Focus on Unfavorable Selection Rate of Minorities/Women:  The next step  is to compare the selection rate for minorities/women to the rate for others.   As a matter of administrative discretion in compliance reviews, OFCCP will  focus on situations in which the selection rate for minorities or women is less  favorable than the rate for others.*  For positive actions, such as hires or  promotions, this will be where the minority or female rate is lower; for  negative actions, such as terminations, it will be where the minority or female  rate is higher.    (c)Finding the Impact Ratio:  Consistent with (b) above, the IRA is  calculated when the selection rate for minorities or women is less favorable.   Therefore, for positive personnel actions the IRA is found by dividing the lower  minority or female rate by the rate for others.  The IRA for negative personnel  actions is found by dividing the rate for others by the higher minority or  female rate.      (d)Number of Persons Potentially Affected:  For adverse IRAs, the SCRR  Worksheet referenced above provides an additional calculation to determine how  many minorities or women are potentially affected.  This information may be  useful in setting investigative priorities.  See Appendix 2A for detailed  instructions for using the Worksheet.     __________    *The EOS should be aware, however, that sometimes a more favorable rate for minorities or women may indicate ""channeling"" into different--and perhaps, less favorable--jobs than others.    2O02MINORITY GROUP ANALYSIS    If the EOS' review of the contractor's EEO category data (SCRR page 7)  showed substantial disparities in the representation of a    particular minority group in the workforce as a whole or in distribution  among EEO categories, IRAs should be conducted for that group(s) separately, at  least for those workforce areas where the disparity was observed and for  activity elements likely to have contributed to the disparity.  For example, if  category data showed that Hispanics were persistently absent from the workforce,  all hiring IRAs should be conducted separately for Hispanics.  Or, in an example  used earlier (2N00), where Blacks were concentrated in Laborers, poorly  represented in Operatives and absent from Crafts, IRAs for blue collar job  groups--particularly for promotions and hires into Operatives and Crafts    --should be conducted separately for Blacks.  Even where such disparities  are not observed in the initial category screen, where the labor area has high  representation of more than one minority group and/or the general employment  patterns in the industry involved have differed among minority groups, in  reviewing the contractor's activity data preparatory to conducting IRA analyses,  the EOS should be alert for any indications of potential problems in selections  of particular minority groups.    2O03  PROPER USE OF THE IRA     It is important to remember that an adverse IRA is only a pre-liminary  indicator of a potential discrimination problem.  It is not proof, in and of  itself, of discrimination, or of the existence of an affected class.  For  example, an adverse IRA in a job group may have been computed using an  insufficiently refined candidate pool.  Only further investigation onsite can  determine whether discrimination has occurred.      2O04 IRA SUMMARY AND ONSITE PLAN    Where adverse IRAs are identified, and further investigation is needed, the  EOS should describe the problem on SCRR page 17 (Summary of Potential  Discrimination Problems) and indicate that will be needed onsite to determine  whether the adverse IRA represents apparent discrimination.    (a)Contractor Adverse Impact Determinations (Contractors with 100 or More  Employees):    (1)Maintenance of Records:  As noted earlier in the discussion of the  acceptability of support data, the Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection  Procedures at 41 CFR 60-3.4 and 60-3.15 require contractors with 100 or more  employees to maintain records by job title sufficient to disclose the impact which its selection procedures (including hiring, promotion and termination) have on the employment opportunities of  women and on each minority group for whom EEO-1 reporting is required.    (2)Analysis of Impact:  The Guidelines at 41 CFR 60-3.4 and 3.15(A)(2) also  require that contractors with 100 or more employees annually analyze these data  to determine whether the total selection process for each job is having adverse  impact.  These determinations are required by sex and for each race/national  origin group (e.g., Black, Hispanic, Asian/Pacific Islander, American  Indian/Alaskan Native) which constitutes 2% or more of the labor force in the  relevant labor area or 2% or more of the applicable workforce (i.e. for jobs  filled internally).      (3)Requesting Contractor Determinations:  When the EOS has identified a job  group with an adverse IRA, and the contractor employs 100 or more persons, the  contractor should be requested to furnish (at desk audit or onsite) its relevant  adverse impact determinations for the job titles which fall within the job  group.  For example, if the adverse IRA is for female hires into a  Administrative Professionals job group, the contractor should be asked to submit  its adverse impact determinations for the hiring of women in each title within  the Administrative Professionals group.  This will assist the EOS in determining  whether the IRA does or does not need to be refined before investigating further  (see Chapter 3).  The EOS may also request the contractor's adverse impact  analyses in other areas.  For example, review of the workforce analysis may have  shown concentrations/underrepresentations that suggest a potential placement problem.  Job group activity data, however, may not show placements into the titles of concern, and the EOS could request the contractor's adverse impact analyses for hires, promotions and transfers into  those titles.  Where appropriate, the EOS may also ask to review the contractor's adverse impact analyses generally and/or may ask the contractor to identify those jobs where its analyses showed adverse impact.    (b)Need for Information about the Selection Process:  The EOS should also  plan to obtain the contractor's description of how employment decisions are made  for positions in the job group, including the steps in the process and, for each  step, the decision makers, criteria used and a description of how they are used,  and records maintained.  Steps may include, for example, review of application  forms by personnel, written tests, formal or informal interviews, physical  examinations, or on-the-job tests.  The EOS should plan to verify the  contractor's statements through review of records, interviews with applicants  and/or employees, and, if possible, observing the process by which applicants  are screened and selected.     (c)Multi-Component Selection Processes - Contractor Obligations:     (1)Adverse Impact in Total Selection Process:  Where the contractor's  adverse impact analyses are requested (per 2O04(a) above) and submitted for desk  audit, if the analysis shows adverse impact in the total selection process for a  job, 41 CFR 60-3.4 and 60-3.15(A)(2) require the contractor to evaluate the  components of the total selection process for adverse impact.  Therefore, in a  multi-step and/or multi-criterion selection process with adverse impact, the EOS  should plan to request the contractor's records showing at what step(s) and/or  by what criterion(ia) minorities or women are being disproportionately screened  out.      (2)No Adverse Impact in Total Selection Process:  If the total selection  process for a job does not have an adverse impact, a contractor would not  normally be expected to evaluate the individual components for adverse impact or  to validate those components, and enforcement action would not normally be taken  based on a component.      (i)Special Circumstances:  In some circumstances, enforcement action may be  taken based on an individual component which has an adverse impact (e.g., height  and weight requirements) that cannot be justified based on job relatedness or  business necessity.    (ii)Relationship of ""Bottom Line"" to Individual Complaints of  Discrimination:  The ""bottom line"" standard with respect to adverse  impact does not mean that complaints alleging discrimination caused by a  component of a selection process will not be investigated.  However this  standard may be applied in an exercise of administrative discretion on whether  to file an enforcement action.  See Question and Answers Nos. 25 and 26 in  Adoption of Questions and Answers to Clarify and Provide a Common  Interpretation of the Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures.       2PCOMPENSATION ANALYSES    2P00GENERAL    While reviewing the workforce analysis for potentially discriminatory placement patterns, the EOS should be especially alert to potential disparities between the wages or salaries shown in the underrepresented areas as compared to those in areas of concentration.  For example, the same or similar job titles may appear in both areas, but show different wage rates or salary ranges, with the higher  wages/salaries shown in those areas where minorities, members of a particular minority group or women are under-represented.      2P01WAGE AND SALARY DATA    As noted earlier in the discussion regarding the reasonableness of a  workforce analysis, coded salary data are acceptable for desk audit purposes.   However, the workforce analysis (wage coded or not) must show titles in wage  rate order within each department or similar organizational unit and the coding  must be consistent across departments/units.  Therefore, when a workforce  analysis contains alpha or numeric codes for salary designations, a salary  analysis may still be conducted by assigning numeric equivalents to the codes (1  to the lowest code, 2 to the second lowest, etc.) and averages computed.  Where  potential problems are identified, the areas should be flagged for further  investigation onsite.  Actual salary information and/or the keys to the codes  for flagged areas should be obtained from the contractor at that time.       2P02IDENTIFICATION OF JOB TITLES FOR COMPARISON    During the desk audit the EOS should also identify specific job titles which  are held by both minorities (or members of a partiticular minority group) and  nonminorities, or both women and men, for onsite comparison of actual salaries.       2P03METHODS USED TO DETERMINE PAY    The EOS should also plan to review onsite how starting pay levels (wage or  salary) are established, and how raises (wage or salary) are determined.      2QSUMMARY OF POTENTIAL DISCRIMINATION PROBLEMS AND ONSITE INVESTIGATIVE PLAN      2Q00  FOCUS ON PROBLEM    While potential discrimination can be divided into problems identified  through analysis of personnel activity (IRAs), and problems identified in the  review of the workforce analysis (e.g., JAAR, Compensation analyses), and/or  problems highlighted by complaints, the focus should be on the problem itself.   Potential discrimination problems which have been identified during the desk  audit on pages 3 (Past Problems/Known Complaints), 14 (Results of Review of  Workforce Analysis), 15 (Impact Ratio Analyses), and 16 (Compensation and Other  Analyses) of the SCRR, should be summarized on page 17 of the SCRR.  As noted  above, the focus is on the problem itself, which although it may have been  identified through more than one analysis, need be  listed only once (e.g., an  area of minority concentration with an adverse IRA for minority promotions out  of the area).    2Q01  ONSITE PLAN    For each such potential discrimination problem, the EOS describes an onsite  investigative plan.  This plan should be as specific as possible, and should set  priorities for the documents to be gathered, the statistical data needed, the  people to be interviewed, and the materials to be reviewed while onsite.  For  example, if the compensation analysis identified job titles for salary  review,  the onsite plan should state that the personnel files of a specific number of  minorities/women and a specific number of others in the identified job title(s)  will be reviewed for actual salary information.  If the IRA indicates a  potential problem in minority hires into a particular job group, the procedures  to be followed (persons to interview, applications and personnel files to be  reviewed, information to be obtained) should be described.      2RPREPARING FOR THE ONSITE    2R00  DECISION TO GO ONSITE     Based on the results of the desk audit, the EOS must decide whether further  investigation onsite is warranted.  However, in most cases an onsite review will  be necessary, because even where potential problems in personnel activity or the  workforce are not identified during the desk audit, many contractor commitments  contained in the AAP cannot be evaluated without an onsite inspection,  corroborating interviews, etc.  Preparation for the onsite phase of the review  is therefore a necessary part of virtually every compliance review.      2R01  SCOPE OF ONSITE    If, at the end of desk audit, the EOS determines that an onsite review is  appropriate, that review will cover: (1) problem areas identified during desk  audit and unresolved at the conclusion of desk audit; and (2) examination of the  contractor's implementation of pertinent AAP items and of those regulatory obligations not  specifically required to be included in the AAP(s).  Refer to Chapter 3 of this  Manual for a complete discussion of onsite activities.    2R02ONSITE PLAN - RESULTS OF DESK AUDIT     The onsite plan is based primarily on the findings obtained as a result of  the desk audit.  These findings fall into two categories, affirmative action  and potential discrimination.     (a)Affirmative Action:  Affirmative action can be further subdivided into  two areas, written AAP and supporting data, and goal attainment and good faith  efforts.      (1)Written AAP and Supporting Data:  Problems identified in the written AAP  and supporting data, were described on page 9 of the SCRR and, for each such  problem, actions taken at desk audit to resolve it and/or actions planned for  onsite were described (see Section 2J above and SCRR Instructions).  If a  problem is not resolved by the conclusion of desk audit, the column on SCRR page  9 labeled ""Onsite?"" is checked.  These checked items constitute the  onsite plan for resolving AAP and support data problems.    (2)Goals Progress and Good Faith Efforts:  Specific job groups/areas where  additional information is needed to assess good faith effort were summarized on  SCRR page 11, part II.  For each such goal area, the specific information needed  to resolve the question of good faith effort was listed (see Section 2L02 above  and SCRR Instructions).  If a question of good faith effort is not resolved at  the conclusion of desk audit, the column on SCRR page 11 labeled ""Onsite?""  is checked.  These checked items constitute the onsite plan for resolving good  faith effort issues.    (b)Potential Discrimination:  Specific potential discrimination problems  (whether identified through the workforce analysis, IRAs, complaints or some  combination of these) were entered on page 17 of the SCRR.  For each such  potential problem, an investigative plan was developed, giving the specific  information needed to determine whether discrimination had occurred (see Section  2Q above and SCRR Instructions).  If a potential discrimination problem is not  resolved at the conclusion of desk audit, the column on SCRR page 17 labeled ""Onsite?""  is checked.  These checked items constitute the onsite plan for resolving  potential discrimination issues.    (c)Summary:  The onsite plan, therefore, consists of checked items in the ""Onsite?""  columns on SCRR pages 9, 11 and 17 in the major review areas of AAP and support  data problems, questions of good faith effort, and potential discrimination  issues.  These items, together with an examination of the contractor's  implementation of the AAP(s) and of the non-AAP areas discussed below, will  direct the onsite review.    2R03OTHER ONSITE INGREDIENTS - GENERAL     The onsite review also covers the contractor's implementation of Executive  Order AAP commitments generally, and specifically must address implementation  of:    oThe Guidelines on Religion and National Origin and Sex Discrimination (SCRR  page 12);    oSection 503 and 38 U.S.C. 4212 affirmative action/    nondiscrimination requirements (SCRR page 13); and     oTechnical requirements (SCRR optional Technical Requirements Worksheet).      2R04IMPLEMENTATION OF GUIDELINES ON RELIGION AND NATIONAL ORIGIN AND SEX  DISCRIMINATION GUIDELINES    (a)Guidelines on Religion and National Origin:  These Guidelines, at 41 CFR  Part 60-50, are not a required AAP ingredient under 41 CFR 60-2.13.  The  contractor's implementation of them, therefore, must be evaluated onsite.  Chapter 3, Section 3G provides detailed guidance on conducting this aspect of  the onsite review.    (b)Sex Discrimination Guidelines:  While these Guidelines, at 41 CFR Part  60-20, are a required AAP ingredient and will have been evaluated for  acceptability (See 41 CFR 60-2.13(h) and Section 2G15 above), the contractor's  implementation of them must be evaluated onsite.  This evaluation should include  a review of the contractor's maternity leave policy (which may not have been  submitted for desk audit) and its implementation as discussed in Chapter 3.  In  addition, although not specifically mentioned in the Guidelines, sexual  harassment (as well as harassment on the basis of race, national origin or  religion) is a violation of the Executive Order.  During the onsite, the EOS  should be alert for any indications of such harassment.  OFCCP follows Title VII  principles in determining whether sexual harassment has occurred.  Further  guidance in this area will be issued.    (c)Recording Results:  The evaluation of both Guidelines is entered on SCRR  page 12.  Particular attention should be directed to those portions of both  Guidelines that are not addressed elsewhere in the regulations--e.g., leave for  religious purposes, maternity leave.      2R05IMPLEMENTATION OF SECTION 503 AND 38 U.S.C. 4212 REQUIREMENTS    (a)Scope:  The onsite review must include examination of the contractor's  implementation of its affirmative action and nondiscrimination obligations with  respect to individuals with disabilities, special disabled veterans and veterans  of the Vietnam era.  Chapter 3 provides detailed guidance on conducting this  aspect of the onsite review.    (b)Non-AAP Requirements:  Along with findings on the contractor's  implementation of AAP ingredients, the  following non-AAP requirements must be  evaluated onsite.  Results of this evaluation are recorded on SCRR page 13, part  I.  Chapter 3 provides detailed guidance on conducting this aspect of the onsite  review.    (1)Invitation to Self-Identify:  Contractors must invite all applicants and  employees to identify themselves as covered veterans or persons with  disabilities.  Refer to 41 CFR 60-250.5(d) and 41 CFR 60-741.5(c).    (2)Availability of the AAP for Inspection:  Contractors must make the AAP  available for inspection by employees and applicants for employment.  The  location and hours during which the AAP is available must be posted.  Refer to  41 CFR 60-250.5(c) and 41 CFR 60-741.5(d).     (3)Listing of Employment Openings:  The Affirmative Action Clause at 41 CFR  60-250.4 requires that covered con-    tractors list all suitable employment openings with the local office of the  State Employment Service.    (4)VETS 100 Filing Requirement:  A contractor covered by 41 CFR Part 60-250  must report at least annually to DOL's Office of the Assistant Secretary for  Veterans' Employment and Training (OASVET) on the number of covered veterans in  its workforce and the number of covered veterans hired.  See 41 CFR Chapter 61.   A copy of the VETS 100 Form and its instructions is included in Chapter 3  (Figure 3-3).     (c)Discrimination:  The onsite evaluation of the contractor's implementation  of its affirmative action obligations under Section 503 and 38 U.S.C. 4212, also  includes investigation for discrimination against individuals with disabilities  or covered veterans.  This includes identification of any qualified individuals  with disabilities or covered veterans screened out by personnel practices or job  requirements not shown to be consistent with business necessity and the safe  performance of the job, and any who could have performed the job involved given  reasonable accommodation to their disability.  The types of materials that may  be examined onsite in this area are discussed on SCRR page 13, Part II and its  instructions, and in Chapter 3.    (d)Technical Requirements:  Additionally, there are a number of technical  requirements which the Section 503 and 38 U.S.C. 4212 programs share with the  Executive Order program.  These are addressed in 2R06(a) below.     2R06TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS    The onsite review must also cover the contractor's implementation of  technical requirements.  These fall in the following areas:  (1) those mandated  by the EEO/AA clauses of all three OFCCP programs; (2) those specific to the  Executive Order program; and (3) those pertaining to OFCCP responsibilities  under the Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA).  There is an optional SCRR  Worksheet for recording the results of the audit of Technical Requirements.    (a)All Three Programs:  In addition to requiring that covered contractors  not discriminate against and take affirmative action on behalf of covered group  members, the Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action Clauses at 41 CFR  60-1.4(a), 41 CFR 60-250.4, and 41 CFR 60-741.4, contain a number of other  requirements.      (1)Inclusion of Clauses:  Each EEO/AA clause must be included, either in its  entirety or by reference, in all covered contracts, subcontracts, and purchase  orders.  Additionally, notice of the VETS 100 filing requirement must be  included.    (2)Informing of Obligations - Vendors and Subcontractors:  Contractors must  advise vendors and subcontractors of their obligation to develop an AAP if they  meet coverage thresholds.    (3)Informing of Obligations - Unions:  Contractors must inform any labor  unions or worker representatives with which they have a collective bargaining  agreement or other agreement of the contractor's commitments under the  regulations.    (4)Posting of Notice:  Contractors must post notice of their EEO/AA  obligations in conspicuous places, available to both employees and applicants  for employment.    (b)Requirements Specific to the Executive Order Program:  The Executive  Order regulations additionally require:    (1)EEO Tag Line:  Advertisements and solicitations for employment must state  that all qualified applicants will be considered, regardless of race, color,  sex, national origin or religion (see 41 CFR 60-1.4(a)(2) and 60-1.41).    (2)Standard Form 100:  The contractor must have filed a current Standard  Form 100 (EEO-1 or, for universities, EEO-6) as required by 41 CFR 60-1.7(a)(1).  (NOTE:  Where the contractor is found not to have filed a Standard Form 100, the  EOS--in addition to including the matter in a Conciliation Agreement--will  notify the OFCCP National Office by completing and forwarding the form provided  in the EEDS Manual for this purpose.)  The contractor must also notify its  vendors and subcontractors of their obligation to file a Standard Form 100  annually.    (c)IRCA - Forms I-9 Inspection:  The onsite review also must include a  review of the contractor's INS (Immigration and Naturalization Service) Forms  I-9.  This form is used to verify that employees hired since November 7, 1986,  are legally eligible to work in the United States under the provisions of the  Immigration Reform and Control Act.  As noted below, the contractor must be  given at least three days advance notice of a Forms I-9 inspection.  Chapter 3  includes a copy of the I-9 Form and its instructions (Figure 3-1), specific  guidance on the contents of this inspection (3E), and a copy of the ESA Form 91  used to record the results of this inspection (Figure 3-2).    2SNOTICE OF ONSITE REVIEW    EOSs are required to provide written notice of the scheduling of the onsite  review to contractors.  This notice of onsite should be a follow-up to an  earlier telephone contact establishing the date and time that the onsite review  will begin.      2S00TELEPHONE NOTICE     In telephoning the contractor to establish the date the onsite will begin,  the EOS should also request that the contractor have additional required  information available at the beginning of the onsite.  This information will  have been identified as a result of problems with the data that the contractor  submitted or failed to submit for the desk audit, or potential problems found  during desk audit.  This contact provides the contractor with lead time to  locate the information.  It also allows the EOS to determine whether the  information is available and in what form.  During the conversation the  contractor would also be told of the need to inspect I-9 forms.      2S01WRITTEN CONFIRMATION OF ONSITE    A letter must be sent to the contractor confirming the phone notice of the  onsite, the date and time the onsite will begin, and that an I-9 inspection will  be conducted (to provide the required formal 3-day notice of such an  inspection).    (a)List of Materials:  The onsite confirmation letter must include a list of  the materials which the contractor should make available at the start of the  onsite.    (1)Materials Related to Specific Findings:  Items which relate to specific  preliminary findings noted during the desk audit should be requested.  For  example, where the EOS has identified adverse IRAs, a list of the employment  actions involved or the contractor's adverse impact determinations for titles in  the job group and type of activity involved should be requested; or,  where the  desk audit has indicated salary questions, the key to any salary codes should be  requested.  Also, the EOS should note that personnel files, applications, and  resumes should be available for inspection.      (2)Materials Not Included in Original Submission:  Items which may not have  been included in the original AAP and supporting data submission--such as copies  of employment advertisements, purchase orders, employment applications, labor  agreements, and policy manuals, should be requested.  Where appropriate, the EOS  may also ask that the contractor's adverse impact determinations be available for review or that the contractor identify those jobs where the results of its analysis showed adverse impact.    (3)I-9's and VETS 100 Report:  Because EOSs must review I-9 forms and verify that the contractor has filed the VETS 100 Report, the contractor must be informed of the need to have these available for inspection.       (4)Additional Information:  A request should also be made for the names of  applicants and employees who have responded to the contractor's invitation to  self-identification or who have otherwise become known to the contractor as  individuals with disabilities, as special disabled veterans, and/or as veterans  of the Vietnam era.  Where special disabled veterans and/or individuals with  disabilities have been identified, the contractor should also be asked to  provide a description of any accommodations made.       (b)Mailing:  The letter confirming the onsite, signed by the AOD/FOD, should  be mailed to the contractor (by certified mail, return receipt requested)  sufficiently in advance of the onsite date to ensure that the letter arrives at  least 3 days before the EOS.  In addition, should the contractor encounter  unanticipated problems in obtaining the items requested, there should be  sufficient lead time to allow for the substitution of alternate materials, where  possible and appropriate.      Figure 2-1:    CHRONOLOGY LOG - CC-53    Figure 2-2:  SCHEDULING LETTER REQUESTING AAP AND SUPPORT DATA    CERTIFIED MAIL    RETURN RECEIPT REQUESTED    Dear (name of contractor official) :    Your establishment located at___________has been selected for a compliance  review under Executive Order 11246, as amended, Section 503 of the  Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, and the Vietnam Era Veterans'  Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974, as amended, (38 U.S.C. 4212), and their  implementing regulations.    The compliance review will be conducted as described in the regulations at  41 CFR Part 60-60 which outlines the three phases of the process.  These phases  normally include a desk audit, an onsite review, and where appropriate, offsite  analysis.    For desk audit purposes we are requesting a copy of your Affirmative Action  Programs (AAPs) and supporting documentation.  These should be prepared in  accordance with the requirements set forth in 41 CFR 60-1.40, 60-2.1 through  60-2.15, Part 60-741 and Part 60-250.  The AAPs' contents and supporting data  such as indicated in the enclosed itemized listing are to be submitted.    Our audit of the AAP and supporting documentation is designed to assist us  in preparing for the onsite review and to reduce the amount of time and level of  effort required by OFCCP and your representatives during this phase of the  compliance process.     You should note, however, that 41 CFR 60-2.2 authorizes the initiation of  enforcement procedures in circumstances where materials submitted for desk audit  do not represent a reasonable effort to meet the affirmative action program  requirements.      Please submit your AAPs and supporting documentation as soon as possible,  and in any case no later than 30 days from the date of receipt of this letter.      If you have any questions concerning OFCCP's compliance review, please feel  free to contact______________.    Sincerely,    AOD/FOD    Attached:  Itemized listing, 41 CFR Chapter 60    Figure 2-2a:  ITEMIZED LISTING    ITEMIZED LISTING    Required AAP contents, including supporting documentation such as those  indicated by check ( ) mark, are essential to conduct the desk audit phase of  the compliance review.      ____a.  Copies of your Employer Information Reports EEO-1 (Standard Form 100  Rev.) for the last three years (____, ____, and ____).  (See 41 CFR 60-1.7).      ____b.  Workforce Analysis (See 41 CFR 60-2.11(a)).    ____c.  Copies of progression line charts (See 41 CFR 60-2.12(m)).    ____d.  Job group and availability analysis (See 41 CFR 60-2.11(b)).      ____e.  Documentation that areas of underutilization have been identified  and goals and timetables have been established to correct any deficiencies,  together with a plan of action to achieve those goals and timetables.  (See 41  CFR 60-2.12(g), (h), and (i) and 41 CFR 60-2.13(d), (e), and (f)).    ____f.  Summary data and information which indicate the numerical and other  results of your affirmative action goals for each job group for the current goal  year and the preceding goal year.  For each goal not attained/being attained,  describe the good faith efforts which were/are being made to achieve them.  (See  41 CFR 60-1.40(c) and 41 CFR 60-2.12).    ____g.  An analysis of your selection process, including a determination of  whether it eliminates a significantly higher percentage of minorities or women  than nonminorities or men.  (See 41 CFR 60-1.40(b)(2), 60-2.23(b)(3), 60-2.25).   This analysis may consist of a summary of applicant and hire activity identified  by race and sex for each job group for (a) the present goal year and (b) the  previous goal year and include:  total applicants, total offers of employment,  total hires, total rejections.  However, if you do not have the data arranged in  that manner you may choose to submit them in the form in which they are  available.    Figure 2-2a:  ITEMIZED LISTING (continued)    ____h.  Analysis of your transfer and promotion practices to determine if  lateral and/or vertical movement of minority or female employees is occurring at  a lesser rate (compared to workforce mix) than nonminority or male employees.   (See 41 CFR 60-1.40(b)(3), 60-2.23(b)(2), 60-2.25).  The analysis may consist of  a summary of promotion and transfer activity during (a) the present goal year  and (b) the previous goal year, identified by race and sex, including the  department/job group/job title into which employees were promoted and each  department/job group/job title from which promoted.  However, if you have  performed the analysis under a different arrangement you may choose to submit it  in the manner in which it is available.    ____i.  Summary of monitoring reports which reflect the degree to which the  nondiscriminatory policy is carried out with respect to terminations of  employment.  (See 41 CFR 60-2.25).  This information may consist of a summary of  employee terminations with identification of race and sex and the departments  and job titles from which they were terminated.  However, if you have not  compiled the data in this form you may choose to submit them in the form in  which they are available.    Although it is not specified as one of the required contents of the AAP, it  would assist us in conducting the desk audit if you would also attach a copy of  your collective bargaining agreement, if any, or other available information  indicating your policies and procedures governing employee mobility (i.e.  promotions, transfers, etc.).    Figure 2-3:STANDARD INQUIRY LETTER FOR REQUESTING COMPLAINT DATA FROM EEOC  AND STATE AND LOCAL FEPS     Dear:    A compliance review of the following Federal contractor has been scheduled:      The review will audit this contractor's compliance with Executive Order  11246, as amended,  Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended,  the Vietnam Era Veterans Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974 (38 U.S.C. 4212),  and implementing regulations.  The Order and Acts prohibit employment   discrimination and require affirmative action to ensure equal employment  opportunity without regard to race, color, religion, national origin, sex,  disability or status as a special disabled or Vietnam era veteran.    Please forward any information you have concerning complaints filed against  this contractor and/or any other information you may have concerning its EEO  posture which you believe we should consider during the course of the review.

STANDARD COMPLIANCE REVIEW REPORT (SCRR) INSTRUCTIONS     OVERALL SCRR STRUCTURE     This SCRR is both a desk audit and onsite report.  It consists     of three parts: (a) Preparation, (b) Affirmative Action and     (c) Potential Discrimination.     Each part contains analytical sheets, followed by a narrative     summary of problems identified in major review areas.  For prob-    lems not resolved at the conclusion of desk audit, the summary sheets  provide for an investigative plan and a description of onsite  findings/conclusions.  These summary sheets are under-    lined in the following SCRR outline:     PART A:  PREPARATION     Page 1   CRIS, CC-100A     2   Introduction     3   Past Problems/Known Complaints     4   Initial Review of AAP and Support Data     5   Personnel Activity     6   EEO Trend Analysis Worksheet     7   EEO Trend Analysis Narrative     8   Organization of the Contractor's Workforce and Review               of  Support Data on Personnel Practices     PART B: AFFIRMATIVE ACTION     9   Problems with AAP and Support Data    10   Analysis of Affirmative Action Progress     11   Evaluation of Good Faith Effort    12   Implementation of Guidelines on Religion and National     Origin and Sex Discrimination     13   Implementation of Disabled/Veterans Affirmative     Action Requirements     PART C: POTENTIAL DISCRIMINATION     14   Results of Review of Workforce Analysis     15   Impact Ratio Analysis (IRA) Worksheet     16   Compensation/Other Analyses     17   Summary of Potential Discrimination Problems     For convenience when an onsite must be approved by a reviewing     official, an optional Desk Audit Summary is included as page 18.     Also included are the following optional SCRR forms:  for     university reviews, a substitute Personnel Activity and EEO     Trend Analysis worksheet with EEO-6 category headings; a     Technical Requirements worksheet covering all three OFCCP     programs; and a Job Area Acceptance Range (JAAR) worksheet.     How much of this SCRR can be done at desk audit will depend on     the quality of data submitted by the contractor.  It is more     important that all analyses are completed by review close out,     than when in the review process they are completed.     SCRR AS A NARRATIVE REPORT    As noted above, the SCRR is both a desk audit and onsite report.  No  separate onsite narrative is required.  What is required is a narrative  description of onsite findings and conclusions on each problem identified* in  the major review areas of AAP and Support Data, Evaluation of Good Faith Effort  and Potential Discrimina-    tion.  This narrative should be as long or short as the facts of the  situation warrant (and, regardless of length, must be backed up by case file  material).    For example, many problems in a written AAP (page 9) can be adequately  addressed in a sentence or two with a reference to corrected AAP pages.  Even  some potential discrimination problems (p. 17) can be briefly addressed--for  example, an Impact Ratio Analysis (IRA) adverse for female hires that when  refined onsite showed that the women applied after the last opening.  On the  other hand, findings on some problems will require substantially more  elaboration.  This will usually be the case for discrimina-    tion issues that are not resolved through such initial onsite data  refinement.    Where such a longer description of findings is appropriate, the EOS should  briefly summarize findings on the SCRR page (9, 11 or 17, as applicable)* and  attach the fuller narrative description--labeled with the item number to which  it pertains--to that page.**  Some examples of when this narrative is needed and  a description of its contents are given following the instructions for SCRR page  17.    ____________       whether identified at desk audit, but not resolved by the conclusion of  desk audit, or onsite.      *EOSs using word processing equipment, see alternative below.           FOR COMPUTER USERS    OFCCP has developed a computer program for IRAs (p. 15) and JAARs (SCRR  optional worksheet).  Once the EOS identifies the appro-    priate raw data and it is entered into the computer, the math- ematical  calculations called for by these SCRR pages are auto- matically made and a  print-out generated with column headings corresponding to these pages.*  Such  computer-generated pages may be substituted for these SCRR pages.  If you want  further infor-    mation on this program, contact your Regional representative to the OFCCP  Technical Support group or the NO Branch of Special Analysis.    Additionally, computer users may wish to use word processing for the rest of  the SCRR.  A distinct advantage of doing so is that once the form is in the  computer, the space allocated to any page/item is fully flexible--i.e. it can be  tailored to the particular review, thus avoiding the need for continuation  sheets.  For example, on the SCRR pages calling for onsite find-    ings/conclusions (see section above), rather than summarizing findings and  expanding on them in an attachment, simply convert the page to a vertical format  (addressing all headings for problem # 1, then all for problem #2, etc.) and use  whatever amount of space is needed for each problem.    RELATIONSHIP OF SCRR    TO POTENTIAL DISCRIMINATION WORKSHEETS     Sample worksheets and instructions for investigating potential   discrimination are given in Appendix 3A.  Key factors that must be addressed in  such an investigation are highlighted in those instructions.     ________    *For IRAs, in addition to the page 15 headings, this program calculates the  number of standard deviations.  This may be of some assistance in setting  investigative priorities.  However, the number of standard deviations must not  be used either to conclude discrimination has occurred or to conclude that  inves-    tigation is not warranted.  Statistical tests mean nothing apart from the  data to which they are applied, and it is entirely pre-    mature to base either such conclusion on unrefined desk audit data.  See IRA  instructions and ""Interpreting IRA Results"" in this Appendix and, in  Chapter 3, the discussion of refined IRAs and statistical tests for small  numbers.    COMMENTS APPLICABLE TO THE SCRR AS A WHOLE     Format/Administrative    oThose SCRR pages and worksheets that are ""fold-out"" have a  perforation in the middle which divides them into two stand-ard 8 1/2"" X 11""  sheets.  These sheets may be separated at the perforation for ease in copying.   In the copy, the two sides of a sheet (they are labeled ""a"" and ""b""--i.e.  11a, 11b, etc.) should be filed in sequence.     Because of their format, some of these sheets have ""Item #""  columns on both sides to permit cross-referencing in a copy.  The EOS assigns an  item number to each problem identified on the left side of the fold-out and uses  the same item number on the right side of the fold-out.     oSCRR pages which present a conclusion on problem areas have  a final column  labeled ""CLOSE OUT DOCUMENT"" which asks ""Include?"" and ""Para.  #.""  If you plan to address the prob-    lem in a close out document, check ""Include?,"" but leave the ""Para.  #"" column blank until the end of the review.     At the end of the review, examine all problems checked and base the type of  close-out document on the most serious problem.  For example, if there are three  deficiencies, two of which--standing alone--would require a Letter of  Commit-ment (LOC), but the remaining deficiency requires a Concil-  iation  Agreement (CA), use a CA to cover all three defi-    ciencies.  When the close-out document is drafted, go back and insert the  paragraph number in which each problem is addressed.     oEach Area and Field Office should maintain extra copies of those SCRR  analytical pages where additional copies may be needed in the average  review--primarily the Analysis of Affirmative Action Progress and IRA  Worksheets.     Other      oIn a preaward review, as at present, all SCRR analyses are normally  completed onsite.    oMinorities means men and women of those minority groups for whom EEO-1  reporting is required--i.e. Blacks, Hispanics, Asians/Pacific Islanders and  American Indians/Alaskan Natives.  It may mean those groups in the aggregate or  an individual group for whom a problem has been identified (see instructions for  SCRR page 7).  Women means both minority and nonminority women.     oWhen reference is made in the SCRR to a particular item included in an AAP,  the AAP page number(s) should be given.  However, please note that an AAP page  reference, standing alone, is not an adequate response to any question concern-      ing the contractor's implementation of an item (for example, see SCRR page  13 on Implementation of Disabled/Veterans' Affirmative Action Requirements).      PAGE INSTRUCTIONS     PART A:  PREPARATION     PAGE 1:  CRIS, CC-100A    See the Compliance Review Information System (CRIS) Manual for instructions  on completing this page.     PAGE 2:  INTRODUCTION    Item 1 - Establishment Name, Address and CRIS Control #:  Enter the name and  address of the establishment being reviewed.  Also enter the CRIS Control number  assigned to this review on page 1.     Item 2 - Parent Name and Address:  If the establishment being reviewed is  part of a larger firm, enter the name and address of the parent firm.     Item 3 - Labor Area:  Enter the name of the Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) in which the establishment is located or, if it is not in an MSA, enter the name of the county or other  appropriate labor area in which it is located.  Then enter the percent of the labor force within the named geographic area that is female and the percent that is minority (in the aggregate and by each minority group).    Item 4 - Complaints Investigated During Review:  Enter the complaint number  of each complaint you plan to investigate as  part of the compliance review.   This will permit a cross- reference to the Complaint Administration System (CAS)  and to the complaint investigation file.  At the end of the review, check    [  ] those complaints that have been resolved.       NOTE:  Further information on these complaints, and on any other open OFCCP  complaints, will be entered on SCRR page 3.    Item 5 - Contract Establishing OFCCP Jurisdiction:  Enter the indicated  information on the contract which establishes OFCCP jurisdiction.  If a  subcontract is used, under ""Agency"" enter the name of the awarding  agency, then check ""SUB TO"" and enter the name of the prime  contractor.     If you have information on several contracts or subcontracts,  use one in  which the work is performed at the establishment level and/or one with the  highest dollar amount or the most relevant time period.  Where more than one  contract is needed to establish and/or further support coverage, include  information on these contracts in item 8 below (Introductory Statement).     Item 6 - Company Contacts:  List the name, title and phone number of the  corporate and establishment Chief Executive Officer (CEO), and the corporate and  establishment contact persons for Equal Employment Opportunity and Affirmative  Action (EEO/AA) matters.       Item 7 - EEDS Contractor Selection Research Documentation Form:  Check here  to confirm that this Equal Employment Data System (EEDS) form--which indicates  why this contractor was selected for review--is included in the case file.    Item 8 - Introductory Statement:  To the degree known, this should include,  but need not be limited to:     oType of Business.  Describe the nature of the establish-    ment's business--for example, its type of industry, main product line, etc.   If it is part of a larger firm, indicate its relationship with its parent--i.e.  ""part of the Consumer Electronics Division of XYZ Company,"" ""a  subsidiary of ABC, Inc.,"" etc.     Also include any general information on the establishment,  such as its  total employment, whether its workforce is predominantly white-collar or  blue-collar, etc.     If the establishment's AAP covers more than one physical location (i.e.  outstationed sales offices, branch banks, etc.), generally describe those  locations and approximately how many people they employ.     oAdditional Coverage Information.  Include information on any contracts or  subcontracts (beyond that given in item 5 above) needed to establish or further  support OFCCP juris- diction.  If coverage is not based on the establishment's  Federal contracts, but on those of a related entity--such as a parent company, a  subsidiary, or another subsidiary of the parent--identify the entity holding the  Federal contracts and the establishment's relationship to it.     To the degree known, also indicate the main product(s) or service(s)  provided under Federal contracts and the approximate volume of such contracts as  a percentage of the contractor's business.     oLabor Area Characteristics.  Describe any relevant informa-    tion on the labor area in which the Contractor is located.     For example:  minority and/or particular minority group distribution within  that geographic area (i.e.  ""The  largest Hispanic community in the MSA is  in Hillsdale, two miles from the plant."" etc.); availability of public/  private transportation; relevant community resource file information,  including the results of any general contacts with community organizations, etc.      Item 9 - Signature Blocks.  Upon completion of the review, the EOS signs and  dates the report in the space provided.  Upon approval of the report, the Module  Chief and appropriate official (ARA or AOD) sign and date it.     PAGE 3:  PAST PROBLEMS/KNOWN COMPLAINTS    Part I:  PAST PROBLEMS.  Review available Area Office files on any past  OFCCP compliance reviews or complaint investigations of this establishment.  If  there have been no prior reviews or complaints, so state, and no further entries  are needed under this part.  If there have been, complete this Part as follows:      oItem a - Past Problems - Give the date of any past compliance review or complaint investigation and list any major problems identified. If there is a current Conciliation Agreement (CA) or Letter of Commitment  (LOC), include a copy of the CA/LOC monitoring record in this case file and list  here any items that may need further investigation.     oItem b - Recurrence?  Do not complete this item now, but in conducting the  rest of the review, be alert for any indications that a past problem has or has not recurred.  At whatever point in the review you have evidence one way or the other, return to this page and enter  your finding.  If you conclude that a problem has, in fact, recurred, also reference the SCRR page number where your findings are presented in more detail.    EXAMPLE:  A past review resulted in a CA because (1) the  contractor's  workforce analysis was by EEO category rather than  by organizational unit, and  (2) the contractor failed to make a good faith effort to recruit minorities for  professional positions.     If, in reviewing the current AAP (SCRR page 4), you find that the current  workforce analysis is properly by organizational unit, return to this page and  so state in item ""b.""  If contractor records and contacts with  recruitment sources show that the contractor did not list professional jobs, so  state in item ""b"" and refer to the SCRR page where your findings are  discussed (for this problem, normally SCRR page 11 on Evaluation of Good Faith  Effort).     Part II:  KNOWN COMPLAINTS.  Review responses received (to Manual Figure  2-3) from other agencies on any complaints filed against this establishment  since the last OFCCP compliance review.  Also review available Area Office  records of any open OFCCP complaints against this establishment.  If there are  no such complaints, so state, and no further entries are needed in this part.   If there are, complete this Part as follows:     oItem a - For each complaint, indicate with what agency it was filed, its  basis, issue, current status and the area of the contractor's workforce it  appears to concern (i.e. clerical, professional, entry-level blue collar, etc.).      oItem b - Potential Systemic?  Do not complete this item now, but in  conducting the rest of the review, be alert for any indications of a potential  systemic discrimination problem in complaint areas.  At whatever point in the  review you have evidence that there is or is not a potential systemic problem,  return to this page and so state.  If you conclude that there is a potential  systemic problem, refer to the SCRR page where your findings are presented in  more detail.     EXAMPLE:  There is (1) an open EEOC complaint alleging discrim-    ination against women in terminations from Operative jobs, and (2) a State  human rights commission individual complaint alleging failure to hire because of  diabetes.     In the first case, if your Impact Ratio Analysis (IRA) did not show an  adverse IRA for women in Operative terminations, return to this page and so  state in ""b.""  In the second case, if examination of the contractor's  policies concerning diabetes and/or applications of diabetics rejected showed a  systemic problem, return to this page, so state in ""b"" and refer to  the SCRR page where your findings are discussed (for this problem, normally page  13, Part II).     The intent here is not to investigate any complaint filed with other  agencies (or any open OFCCP complaint other than those assigned for  investigation during this review--i.e. those listed in SCRR Introduction, item  4), but rather to be alert for potential systemic problems in complaint areas.      PAGE 4:  INITIAL REVIEW OF AAP AND SUPPORT DATA     Immediately upon receipt of the contractor's initial AAP and support data  submission, review it to ensure there is sufficient information to conduct  subsequent basic analyses of both affirmative action and potential  discrimination issues.     In conducting this initial review, be attentive to any information on the contractor's workforce structure and personnel practices that will be discussed on SCRR page 8.  Such information may be included in the AAP narrative, or may be reflected in the workforce analysis or support data on personnel activity.     Complete this page as follows:     oTimely Receipt:  Indicate whether the Executive Order AAP was received on  time by checking ""YES"" or ""NO.""  If the AAP was received on  time, complete the steps below.  For the Disabled/Veterans' (D/V) AAP, indicate  whether it was received.     If the Executive Order AAP was not received on time, on page 9 (Problems  with AAP and Support Data), indicate the date a Show Cause Notice was issued or,  if not issued, the reason.  If the D/V AAP was not received, on page 9 indicate  the date a 30-day Notice was issued or, if not issued, the reason.  When the  contractor does first submit its AAP(s), complete the steps below.     oIncluded?:  Review the Executive Order AAP and support data and the D/V AAP  to ensure that all listed elements are present.  Beside each item, enter a ""Y""  for yes if it is included, or a ""N"" for no if it is missing.     If an element is missing, no further entries are needed concerning it on  this page since it will automatically be neither ""reasonable"" (if a  central element) nor ""acceptable.""  Note any such missing elements on page 9.     oReasonable?:  Beside each central element of the Executive Order  AAP--Workforce Analysis, Utilization Analysis (and its components) and Current  Goals--enter a ""Y"" or ""N"" to indicate whether the element is reasonable (see OFCCP Federal Contract Compliance Manual--hereafter Manual--Section 2F).      If one or more of these central elements is not reasonable, on page 9  describe the specific problem and give the date a show cause notice was issued  or, if no Show Cause was issued, the reason.  If all central elements were  reason-    able, audit the submission for acceptability.     oAcceptable?:  Beside each listed element, enter a ""Y"" or ""N""  to indicate whether it is acceptable (see Manual, Sections 2G, 2H, and 2I).       If any element is not acceptable, list it on page 9 and describe the  specific problem.     If N, p. 9 Item #:  Beside each listed element with an ""N"" under ""Included,""  ""Reasonable,"" or ""Acceptable,"" give the SCRR page 9 item  number where the specific problem is discussed.     Later contractor corrections to an initial submission need not be recorded  here, but will be recorded on page 9 beside the particu-lar problem.     PAGE 5:  PERSONNEL ACTIVITY TABLE    This worksheet provides an EEO-1 category overview of the con-    tractor's major personnel activity over the last AAP year.  If you are doing  a university review, use the EEO-6 Personnel Activ-ity Table (supplied with this  package), which is the same form, but with EEO-6 category headings.     At the top of the page, enter the dates covered by the personnel activity  data to be recorded below.  The data will normally cover the last full AAP year,  but where data for that period are not available, enter the dates covered by  whatever data are avail-    able.     Enter the number of hires, promotions and terminations by minor-    ity group and sex in each EEO category.  If the category is not in use in  the contractor's workforce, enter N/A; if it is in use but had no activity,  enter ""no activity;"" if the contractor did not maintain data for the  category, enter ""no data.""     This information, together with the historical workforce data in the EEO  Trend Analysis (below), provides a framework for later review of affirmative  action progress and employment activity by job group.  Also, since both these  data and EEO trend data are by particular minority group, they can help identify  any potential problems for a particular minority group.    PAGE 6:  EEO TREND ANALYSIS WORKSHEET     This worksheet permits an assessment of net change in minority and female  representation over both the long-term (comparing the earliest EEDS EEO category  data with current data) and the short-term (comparing data for the beginning of  the last full AAP year with current data).     The appropriate EEDS report for EEO-1 data is EEO20; for EEO-6  data, EEO69.   EEO-1 categories are indicated beside the data entry space.  If you are doing a  university review, use the EEO-6 Trend Analysis Worksheet (included with this  package), which is the same form but with EEO-6 category headings.     At the top of the page beside A, enter the date of the earliest data on the  current EEDS report; beside B, the date of the beginning of the last full AAP  year; and beside C, the date of the end of the last full AAP year.     NOTE:  If the contractor has not previously been required to maintain an  AAP, for B use the date of its latest EEO-1 or EEO-6 submission shown on the  current EEDS report; and for C, the date of its most recent EEO-1 or EEO-6  submission not yet shown on EEDS.     To complete this page, for each EEO category and for the total workforce,  make the following entries:     oLine A - Enter the earliest data shown in the current EEDS report, then  calculate and enter the percentage of women and of minorities.     oLine B -  Enter data for the beginning of the last full AAP year, then  calculate and enter the percentage of women and of minorities.     oLine C - Enter data for the end of the last full AAP year, then calculate  and enter the percentage of women and of minorities.     The EOS may wish to make notes on net change and/or white collar and blue  collar subtotals, etc. preparatory to completing the     EEO Trend Analysis Narrative below.    PAGE 7:  EEO TREND ANALYSIS NARRATIVE    At the top of the page, check whether the data are from EEO-1 or EEO-6  information.  Then complete the narrative as follows:     Item 1 - EEO Trends     (a)Total Workforce:  Over the long-term (line A vs. line C on the preceding  worksheet), has the contractor's overall work-force been relatively stable or  has it been expanding or contracting?  If one of the latter, how substantial has  the change been?  Has it been due to marked expansion or con-    traction in particular categories?  What has the change been in the  representation of minorities and women in the over-    all workforce?  As a percent of total?  Numerically?     Address the same questions as above concerning short-term total workforce  trends (Line B vs. Line C on the preceding worksheet).     (b)White Collar:  Over the long and short-term, what has the change been for  minorities in the white collar workforce?  What has the change been for women in  nontraditional white collar categories (normally white collar exclusive of  Office and Clerical and retail Sales)?  Have there been notable minority/female  gains or losses in particular categories?  Give particular attention to  Officials and Managers and Professionals (and any other categories normally  considered favorable in the industry involved).     (c)Blue Collar:  Over the long and short-term, what have the changes been  for minorities and women in the blue collar workforce?  Have there been notable  minority/female gains or losses in particular categories?  Give particular  attention to Crafts.     NOTE:  In discussing short-term trends above, also consider the level and  type of personnel activity shown on page 5.  Lack of short-term progress may be  tied to few hiring/promotion oppor-    tunities in a category over the last AAP year; or to termina-    tions cancelling out hiring gains.  Such observations can help provide a  framework for later analyses by job group of goals (SCRR page 10) and employment  activity (IRAs, SCRR page 15).     Also, in considering page 5, note any obvious major discrepancies that may  need clarification.  For example, if a category shows a short-term gain of 50  persons, but page 5 shows little or no hiring in the category during the AAP  year, you may wish to ask the contractor the source of the growth.     Item 2 - EEO Category Patterns:  Are there any EEO categories in which  minorities or women have been persistently concentrated?  Are there other  categories in which minorities or women appear to be substantially  underrepresented?  In making these assessments, rely upon your general knowledge  of the contractor's labor area, type of business/skill needs, and the  representation of minor-    ities and women in possible feeder categories.     The intent here is not to make comparisons with some hypothetical ""category""  availability (which is inappropriate), but again, to establish a broad framework  for later examination of job groups within those categories, workforce patterns  and IRAs.     For example, if there are very few women in Crafts but many in Operatives,  the EOS is forewarned to look at the types of jobs    in Crafts; the distribution of women vs. men in Operative job     groups/departments/lines of progression; and the volume and type of promotions  from Operatives to Crafts.     Item 3 - Particular Minority Groups:  Identify any substantial disparity in  the representation of a particular minority group or men or women of a  particular minority group.  Is any such dispar-ity present in the workforce as a  whole or only in certain EEO categories?  In making this assessment, as above,  consider the representation of particular minority groups in the contractor's  labor area and in possible internal feeder categories.  Where you observe such a  disparity, plan to conduct standard desk audit discrimination analyses by the  particular minority group (rather than by minorities in the aggregate), at least  in those work-    force areas where the disparity exists and for the type of activ-ity most  likely to have created the disparity.  For example:    -  The contractor is located in a labor area that is 20% minority, composed  of 9% Blacks, 9% Hispanics and 2%     others.  Although the contractor has a large number of jobs probably filled  locally, it historically has employed less than 1% Hispanics.  Under these  circumstances, the EOS should plan to conduct all hiring IRAs specifically for  Hispanics.    -  The contractor has a predominantly blue collar workforce with good  overall minority representation.  However, Blacks are concentrated in Laborers,  poorly represented in Opera-    tives and absent in Crafts.  Under these circumstances, the EOS should:  (1)  in reviewing the workforce analysis, plan to identify blue collar jobs held by  Blacks and whether there is any structural/potential placement problem impeding  their upward mobility, and (2) plan to conduct blue collar IRAs (particularly  for hiring and promotion into Operatives and Craft job groups) separately for  Blacks.    Further discussion of separate minority group analyses is given in the  instructions for SCRR page 14 (Review of Workforce Analy-    sis) and SCRR page 15 (IRAs).  Please also note that if onsite investigation  of such a disparity does not indicate potential discrimination, the EOS should  then consider whether the imbal-    ance warrants separate affirmative action steps--whether goals and/or  specific action programs--for the group (see 41 CFR    60-2.12(l)).    PAGE 8:  ORGANIZATION OF CONTRACTOR'S WORKFORCE AND    REVIEW OF SUPPORT DATA ON PERSONNEL PRACTICES      The intent of this page is to describe those aspects of the par-    ticular contractor's structure and practices which will influence the  interpretation of both affirmative action and potential dis-    crimination issues.  DO NOT ADDRESS RACIAL OR SEX DISTRIBUTION ON THIS PAGE.      oItem 1:  Organization of Contractor's Workforce - Describe how the  contractor's workforce is organized using whatever information is available in  the contractor's AAP and support data (if there is an organization chart,  indicate where it is located in the AAP or case file).     If the contractor's AAP narrative is not helpful, scan the workforce  analysis to identify (a) major organizational units--i.e. those containing the  largest number of employ-    ees, and (b) the type of work that appears to be performed in these major  units.     Also identify any possible formal/informal lines of pro-    gression (LOPs).  If the contractor has not included pro-    gression line charts in its AAP, a union contract(s) may include information  on LOPs.  If neither source is helpful, does the workforce analysis show any  indicators of possible LOPs (for example, sequenced job titles--Assembler A, B,  C; Assistant Teller, Teller, Senior Teller; Scientist I, II, III, etc.)?     oItem 2:  Internal Mobility - Review the contractor's AAP and support data  on personnel practices for any information on how personnel processes work at  the establishment, with particular attention to internal mobility:     (a)Does the contractor indicate that it posts or otherwise makes job  openings known?  How?  At what levels?  Who is eligible to bid/apply?  What  factors are considered in choosing among internal candidates?     (b)Specifically address whether the contractor has one or more collective  bargaining agreements.  If it does, with what union(s)?  Covering what areas of  the work-    force?  Involving what provisions for promotion/transfer, layoff/recall, etc.?     (c)Also, review the contractor's hiring and promotion activity to identify:          Which job groups/areas have had the largest number of hires during the  past year?  Are there job groups  which have been filled only or almost  exclusively by hire?        Which job groups/areas have had the largest number of promotions during  the past year? Are there job groups which have been filled only or almost  exclusively by promotion?          oItem 3:  Pay Structure  - How is the contractor's pay system structured in  major portions of the workforce?  For example, are blue collar jobs paid by  grade level?  If so, what is the lowest and highest grade?  Are salaried jobs  organized into rate ranges identified by letter code?  If so, what is the lowest  and highest letter code?     PART B:  AFFIRMATIVE ACTION    PAGE 9:  PROBLEMS WITH AAP AND SUPPORT DATA     At the top of the page, check whether the page concerns the Executive Order  AAP and support data, the D/V AAP or both, then complete the columns as follows:      o# (a):  Assign a number to each problem identified as a  result of your  initial review of the contractor's AAP and support data submission (SCRR page  4).     oAAP AND SUPPORT DATA PROBLEMS (b):  Briefly describe each problem, and  indicate  whether it is that the AAP or support data item was not  included, was  not reasonable or was not acceptable.  This description should be specific  enough for a reader to clearly understand the issue involved--i.e. ""Current  goals are lower than the contractor's availability estimates in four  Professional job groups,"" NOT ""Goals are unacceptable.""     oACTION TAKEN and/or PLAN TO RESOLVE (c):  Describe the action(s) you have  taken or plan to take to resolve the problem.  For example, if the contractor  failed to submit     an Executive Order AAP, the normal entry would be ""Show Cause issued  (date),"" followed by ""AAP submitted (date).""  For an unacceptable  AAP or support data ingredient, the entry may be ""Called M. Jones to  request (appropriate revision) be made and ready onsite.""     Leave enough room between entries in this column to allow  for a description  of any probable subsequent desk audit developments.  For example, if the problem  is ""No informa-    tion on what job titles fall in what job groups,""  and the action is ""Called  S. Smith 9/5 to obtain listing of titles within group,"" a subsequent desk  audit development may be ""Received listing 9/10.""     oOnsite? (d):  Check those items that will require onsite follow-up.  These  checked items will be your onsite plan  for resolution of AAP and support data  problems.    NOTE:  Your onsite review must include confirmation of the contractor's  implementation of its AAP commitments (see Manual Section 3G01).  If onsite you  identify a problem with AAP implementation that is not covered elsewhere in the  SCRR,* add it to this page.  Enter ""ONS"" for onsite in column ""b""  and complete the other columns as indicated.    ONSITE    o# (e):  Enter the same item number assigned to this problem in column (a).      oFindings/Conclusions (f):  For each AAP and support data  problem for which  you checked onsite, enter your onsite  findings and conclusions.  For example,  if the problem were that the contractor's availability analysis appeared to   give insufficient weight to internal availability, you may note that an onsite  sample of records showed that the  majority of incumbents in the job group had  entered via promotion rather than new hire.    Where a fuller narrative description of findings (and/or resolution, column  (h) below) is needed, attach it to this page (labeled with the item number to  which it pertains).     oResolved? (g):  Enter ""Y"" for yes or ""N"" for no to  indicate whether the problem with the AAP or support data has been resolved.      ________    *AAP implementation issues covered elsewhere are those pertaining to:  (1)  good faith efforts on goals (SCRR p. 11); (2) the Sex Discrimination Guidelines  (SCRR p. 12); (3) Disabled/Veterans requirements (SCRR p. 13); and technical  requirements (if you use the SCRR optional worksheet on Technical Requirements).      oResolution (h):  If the problem has been resolved, describe the resolution.   For example, ""Contractor increased the weight of internal availability in  XYZ job group from 2% to 60% resulting in the following corrected final  availability figures:  Minorities - originally 10%, corrected to 20%; Women -  originally 5%, corrected to 30%.""  If the problem has not been resolved,  discuss the contractor's position on the matter and the actions you are  recommending.    oAAP or Other Reference Pages (i):  When a resolution has been reached,  indicate here the pages of the AAP, support data or other document in which the  resolution is incorporated.     oClose-Out Document (j-k):  If you plan to include the problem in a  close-out document, check ""Include?.""  Leave the ""Para. #""  column blank until the end of the review.     PAGE 10:  ANALYSIS OF AFFIRMATIVE ACTION PROGRESS    Prior Year AAP/Current Year AAP    This page is divided horizontally into two parts:  (I) Goals,    and (II) Workforce Change.  Part I is mandatory; Part II is optional.  Enter  data on job groups for which goals were established.     Prior year goals must always be addressed (unless the contractor was not  previously covered by 41 CFR Part 60-2).  Both prior and current year must be  addressed if the contractor was six months or more into its current AAP year at  the time it received the Scheduling Letter.     At the top of the page, check the appropriate box to indicate whether the  data are for the prior year or the current year. Enter the starting and ending  dates of the period involved and then complete this page as follows:     Part I - Goals:     oEEO Category (a):  Enter the initials or number of the EEO-1 or EEO-6  category in which the job group falls.  Goals should normally be analyzed by job  group within EEO category order, i.e. job groups within Officials and Managers first, then job  groups within Professionals, etc.     oJob Group (b):  Enter the name of the job group being analyzed.     oGoal (c):  Enter the minority/female percentage placement goal.*    oTotal Placements (d):  Enter the total number of placements into the job  group during the AAP year.     oExpected (Placements) (e):  Enter the number of minorities or women who  would have been placed under the percentage placement goal.  To find this  expected number of placements,    multiply the total placements (d) by the goal (c).  Round down to the  nearest whole number (i.e. 0.1 = 0, 11.7 = 11, 0.4 = 0, etc.).     EXAMPLE:  For the Crafts I job group, ABC Company set a goal of 10% for  minorities and 5% for women.  During the AAP year, there were 50 placements into  the job group.  For minorities, you would have expected 5 place-    ments (.10 X 50); for women you would have    expected 2 (.05 X 50 = 2.5 = 2).     oActual (Placements) (f):  Enter the actual number of placements into the job group during the AAP year who were minor-ity/female.     oDifference (g):  Subtract the actual number of placements of  minorities/women (f) from the expected number of placements (e) to find the  difference--preceded by a plus (+) or minus (-) sign.     EXAMPLE:        Expected     Actual     Diff.     Minorities         5           6         +1        Women              2           1         -1     Part II - Workforce Change:  As noted above, this portion is  optional.  It  can be useful in focusing attention on job groups where, although there has been  progress in placements, there has been little or no improvement in minority or  female representa-    tion.  This normally is caused by disproportionate minority or    _________    *If the AAP specifies a goal for a particular minority group or for men or  women of a particular minority group, either change the line heading here from ""Min.""  to an abbreviation for the identified group or use another copy of this page to  evaluate goals progress for the identified group.    female movement out of the job group, whether for positive (pro-motions out)  or negative (terminations) reasons, and alerts the EOS to look at Impact Ratio  Analysis (IRA) results for the job group.     Complete this portion of the page as follows:     oBeginning Workforce (h-i):  In column (h) enter the total number of  employees and in column (i), the total number of minorities and the total number  of women in each job group at the beginning of the AAP year.     oEnding Workforce (j-k):  In column (j) enter the total number of employees  and in column (k), the total number of minorities and the total number of women  in each job group at the end of the AAP year.     oNet Change (l-m):  In column (l) enter the difference be-    tween the beginning and ending total workforce in the job group.  ln column  (m), enter the difference between the minority and female beginning and ending  workforce in the job group, preceded by a plus (+) or minus (-) sign.     PAGE 11:  EVALUATION OF GOOD FAITH EFFORT     Evaluate the contractor's overall affirmative action performance.  Was there  progress in most areas where goals were established?  for minorities?  for  women?  for both?  In areas with little progress, are there any balancing  factors such as strong perform-ance in similar or higher level jobs within the  category or generally?  Do performance problems fall in categories with poor  long-term trends (compare SCRR p. 6)?     In evaluating fulfillment of AAP commitments, consider the  quality of those  commitments in terms of their probable long-    range as well as short-range contribution to improving the contractor's  affirmative action posture.  Also consider whether the contractor has used  positive problem solving to help remove any impediments to minority/female  utilization, vs. continued adherence to strategies that are not working.     As a result of this evaluation, identify any goal areas needing further  evaluation for good faith effort.  Complete the remainder of this page as  follows:     o# (a):  Assign an item number to the goal area which needs further  evaluation for good faith effort.     oGOAL AREA (b):  Enter the name of the goal area.  A goal area may be a job  group or a cluster of job groups with similar AAP commitments to be evaluated  for good faith effort.  For example, if the contractor committed to recruit  minority technicians from XYZ organization, and showed little progress in  several technician jobs groups, the goal area may be ""Technician (Elec.,  Mech., Test).""     oMIN./FEM. (c):  Indicate whether the goal(s) involved was for minorities,  for women or for both.  If it was for members of a particular minority group,  enter an abbrevia-    tion for the group.    oPR/CURR YR (d):  Indicate whether the goal(s) needing further evaluation  for good faith effort was for the prior year, the current year or both.     oPOSSIBLE CAUSES/PERTINENT AAP COMMITMENTS (e):  Review any contractor  description of good faith effort pertinent to the goal area.  Also review data  on employment activity in the area, and any relevant AAP information on  personnel prac-    tices/workforce structure.     What appear to be the reasons for the lack of progress?  What AAP  commitments would have helped?  For example:     -If jobs in the area were filled predominantly by hire,  does it appear that  insufficient applicant flow was the problem?  If so, does the contractor's  explanation ad-    dress recruitment efforts?  Were any commitments made in the prior AAP  concerning recruitment?  Were they  fulfilled?     -If most openings were via promotion, was there an adequate supply of  minorities/women in feeder jobs?  If so, did the contractor make any AAP  commitments con-    cerning the promotion process relevant to the area,  such as a commitment  to:  identify promotable minor-    ities/women (skills inventory); increase promotability (training, job  rotation); encourage upward mobility (counseling, encouraging bidding), etc.?   Were any such commitments fulfilled?     NOTE:  Where the problem is the candidate pool (low appli- cant flow, few  minorities/women in feeder jobs), the issue is normally affirmative action  (recruitment, goals at the feeder group level).     However, where the candidate pool is adequate, either affirmative action or  discrimination may be the issue, so pay close attention to the area involved  when conducting IRA analyses.  If you find an adverse IRA in the goal area    involved, pursue the matter first as a potential discrimin-ation issue, and  note that you are doing so here.  Only if you do not find discrimination, return  to complete this evaluation of good faith effort for the goal area.     oADDITIONAL INFORMATION NEEDED (f):  Describe the additional information you  will need to evaluate the contractor's good faith effort.  For example, records  of recruitment efforts, contact with community organizations to confirm  appropriate job listings, etc.  If you have obtained sufficient addi-    tional information at desk audit to conclude there was good faith effort, so  indicate here.     oONS (g):  Check here those items that will require onsite follow-up.  These  checked items will be your onsite plan for evaluation of good faith effort.       ONSITE    o# (h):  Enter the same number assigned to this item in column (a).     oFINDINGS (i):  Discuss your onsite findings on whether the contractor made  a good faith effort in the goal area.  For example, ""Contractor placed  timely and accurate job listings with the major community organizations  specified in its AAP, but received no referrals for this job group.  This was  con-firmed by contact with XYZ referral sources who cited a scarcity of  candidates with the skill specialty involved.""     Where a fuller description of findings (and/or the discus-    sion in column (k) below) is needed, attach it to this page (labeled with  the item number to which it pertains).    oGFE? (Good Faith Effort) (j):  Indicate by entering ""Y"" for yes  or ""N"" for no whether you conclude the contractor made a good faith  effort in this goal area.  If you conclude the contractor made a good faith  effort, no further entries are needed on this sheet, unless you have reached an  agreement with the contractor to take supplementary actions to help improve the  chances of progress during the next AAP year (if so, describe in the next  column).     oIF NO, SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION, CONTRACTOR POSITION, EVALUATION (k):  If  you conclude the contractor did not make a good faith effort, supply any  background information that may provide perspective on the lack of good faith  effort.     For example, ""This job group is seriously underutilized for minorities  (10% incumbency, 20% availability), and has been for at least the last three  years.  The contractor had adequate openings to make progress, but has  consistently failed to take steps to increase minority applicant flow for the  jobs involved, etc.""     Also discuss and evaluate the contractor's position on the matter.     oClose-Out Document (l-m):  If you plan to include the problem in a close  out document, check ""Include?.""  Leave the ""Para. #"" column  blank until the end of the review.    PAGE 12:  IMPLEMENTATION OF GUIDELINES ON RELIGION    AND NATIONAL ORIGIN AND SEX DISCRIMINATION     Verify the contractor's implementation of the Guidelines on Religion and  National Origin and the Sex Discrimination Guide-    lines.  In both cases it is only necessary here to address those policies  and practices that are not covered elsewhere in your evaluation of the  contractor's compliance with the Executive Order--for example, maternity leave  policy, leave for religious purposes, etc.  Since the contractor is not required  to address 41 CFR Part 60-50 in its AAP, and may or may not include a copy of  leave policies, evaluation of these items and their implemen-    tation is normally done onsite.    If, while verifying this implementation, you identify a potential  discrimination issue, check [  ] ""Pot. Disc."" and include the problem  on page 17, ""Summary of Potential Discrimination Problems.""     PAGE 13:  IMPLEMENTATION OF DISABLED/VETERANS    AFFIRMATIVE ACTION REQUIREMENTS      Determine if the contractor has fully implemented its obligations under the  individuals with disabilities and veterans programs.     Part I:     oDescribe Contractor Actions/How Verified:  For each listed  regulatory  item, indicate the actions the contractor has taken, and briefly state how you  made your determination.      For example, in item 4 concerning the Mandatory Job Listing requirement  under the veterans' program, a verification may    be:  ""9/7/88 conversation with J. Smith, Vets. Rep. at the Odgen County  State Employment Service office, confirms contractor's listing of suitable jobs.""      If you determine that the contractor has not taken adequate action, briefly  describe the problem and, if resolved, its resolution.     oProblem?  (D/V):  Enter an ""D"" for disabled, a ""V"" for  veterans, or ""D/V"" for both, to identify the program under which the  contractor has not taken adequate action on the item.     oResolved?:  Enter ""Y"" for yes or ""N"" for no to indicate  whether the problem has been resolved.     oClose-Out Document:  If you intend to include this item in  a close-out  document, check ""Include?.""  Leave the ""Para. #"" column  blank until the end of the review.       Part II:      The purpose of this part is to identify any contractor personnel  practices  or job requirements which may be screening out quali-    fied individuals with disabilities or special disabled veterans, including  those who could have performed the jobs involved given reasonable accommodation.      1.Determine if the contractor has any blanket medical stand-    ards, or medical standards applicable to particular jobs.     Such standards may be incorporated in a policy manual, a manual for medical  personnel or in position descriptions/    qualification standards.  They also may be identifiable through rejections  of persons with certain medical condi-    tions based on responses to application form medical ques-    tions and/or on results of physical examinations.     If you identify a medical standard, indicate the job(s) to which it applies,  and ask the contractor for the results of its review determining that the  standard is job related, consistent with business necessity and with the safe  per- formance of the job.     Evaluate the contractor's response.  If it does not adequately demonstrate  that the standard is job related, consistent with business necessity and with  the safe  performance of the job, include the matter on page 17, ""Summary  of Potential Discrimination Problems.""     Make sure the case file includes any available information relevant to  supporting your conclusions--such as any position description for the jobs  involved, notes on your worksite observations, copies of any physical tests used  and their instructions, etc.--along with standard information on discriminatee  qualifications.     Appendix A to Chapter 6 provides some guidance on the types of information  to obtain about the job and about rejectees who have disabilities or are special  disabled veterans.  Additional guidance will be issued in the future on  assessing job relatedness, business necessity and safety claims as they relate  to the Section 503/4212 programs.    2.In the course of your review above, also identify any qualified  individuals with disabilities or special disabled veterans who could have  performed the job(s) involved given reasonable accommodation to their  disability.  If you identify such persons, include the matter on page 17, ""Summary  of Potential Discrimination Problems.""     Appendix A to Chapter 6 also provides guidance on the types of information  to obtain in evaluating whether the con-    tractor has provided reasonable accommodation, and further guidance will be  issued in this area in the future.    This page, particularly Part II, is normally completed onsite.    PART C:  POTENTIAL DISCRIMINATION    PAGE 14:  RESULTS OF REVIEW OF WORKFORCE ANALYSIS     Review the contractor's workforce analysis to identify patterns of minority  and female employment.  Identify and discuss poten-    tial problem areas where minorities/women are underrepresented or  concentrated.     To focus this review, use the results of your earlier SCRR ana-    lyses such as:     1.EEO Trend Analysis Narrative (SCRR page 7).    (a)  Category Patterns.  Pay particular attention to areas with persistent  representation of minorities or women substantially above or below probable  availability.  Using an earlier example with many women in Operatives but few in  Crafts, what types of jobs are in Crafts?  At the Operative level, are men and  women in different types of jobs (which may have different progression  opportunities--see 2 below)?     (b)  Particular Minority Groups.  Pay specific attention to the distribution  of a particular minority group in areas where you identified a substantial  disparity in the repre-    sentation of that group.  Using an earlier example with Blacks concentrated  in Laborers, poorly represented in Operatives, and absent in Crafts,  specifically identify the blue collar jobs held by Blacks and look for any  structural (see 2 below)/potential placement problems that may be inhibiting  upward mobility.    Even when such disparities are not observed in the initial category screen,  if the labor area has a high representa-    tion of more than one minority group and/or the general employment patterns  in the industry involved have differed among minority groups, in reviewing the  workforce analysis the EOS should be alert for any indications of potential  problems in the distribution of a particular minority group.      2.Organization of the Contractor's Workforce and Review of Support Data on  Personnel Practices (SCRR page 8).  Focus on minority group and female  employment patterns in those work-force areas relevant for this particular  contractor.  Among the possibilities are:  departments/units; possible lines of  progression (LOP's); grade or salary levels; supervisory positions vs. those  supervised; etc.  For example:     (a)If the contractor has possible LOPs, are minorities and women fairly  evenly distributed among LOPs or are they concentrated in ones that offer less  favorable pay or  progression?  If there is no problem in distribution among  LOPs, are minorities/women within LOPs fairly  evenly distributed or are they  clustered toward the bottom?     (b)If departments or units are relevant in determining eligibility for  promotion (or other employment acti-    vity), how are minorities/women distributed among those departments or  units?  Where department/unit seniority is used for promotion, layoff or other  purposes, how are minorities/women distributed among the departments or units?      Please note that even where plant seniority is used for promotion, if it is  exercised first within the depart-    ment where the opening occurs it can limit access to more favorable  departments (since, in practice, all but entry-level and/or undesirable jobs may  be filled with-in the department).     (c)If the contractor announces job openings up to a certain salary level, is  there any marked drop in minority or female representation above that level?      The type of questions to ask and patterns to look for will be different in  each compliance review (as will the quality of desk  audit data) depending on  the organization and practices of the  particular contractor.  The important  thing is to focus on the factors pertinent to that contractor.     DISCUSSION OF RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN     REVIEW OF WORKFORCE ANALYSIS AND IRAS     The workforce analysis essentially reflects employment activity  over an  extended period of time, while IRAs reflect that activity during the most recent  period.  Therefore, pay particular atten-    tion to IRAs in those areas where review of the workforce analy-    sis showed marked underrepresentation or concentration of minor-    ities or women.     For example, in a seriously underrepresented job area, an adverse hiring  and/or promotion IRA suggests that any problem may be  longstanding and, if  discrimination is found, there are likely to be victims within the normal  liability period (with or without a showing of continuing violation).     Or, in a concentrated job area, an adverse promotion IRA may reflect  differing opportunities for minorities or women to move up and out of the area.   This may suggest a structural problem--    i.e. a present policy or practice inhibiting movement--that may constitute  discrimination as well as a continuing violation.    In any event, be aware of possible connections between what you observe in  the workforce analysis and the results of the IRA analysis below.    PAGE 15:  IMPACT RATIO ANALYSIS (IRA) WORKSHEET     GENERAL COMMENTS     The Impact Ratio Analysis (IRA) is a comparison of the selection rates of  different groups from an identified candidate pool.  If  the selection rate for  one group is less than 80% of that for another, the IRA is adverse.     The following mathematical procedure is used to calculate an     IRA:       Find the selection rate for minorities/women by dividing their number of  selectees by their number in the candidate pool.       Find the selection rate for others by dividing their number of selectees by  their number in the candidate pool.       Compare the selection rate for minorities/women to the rate for others.  As  a matter of administrative discre-tion in compliance reviews, OFCCP will focus  on situa-         tions in which the selection rate for minorities or women is less favorable  than the rate for others.*  For positive actions such as hires and promotions,  this will be where the minority or female rate is lower; for negative actions,  such as terminations, it will be where the minority or female rate is higher.      4.Consistent with #3 above, the IRA is calculated when the selection rate  for minorities/women is less favor- able.  Therefore, to find the IRA for  positive     personnel actions, divide the lower minority/female rate by the rate for  others; for negative personnel actions, divide the rate for others by the higher  minority/female rate.    5.If the result of #4 above is less than .8, the IRA is adverse for  minorities or women.     When, and ONLY when an IRA is adverse, this worksheet calls for  an  additional calculation of how many minorities or women poten-    tially were affected.  This, when considered in conjunction with other  review information, may assist in setting investigative priorities.     IRAs may be conducted for women vs. men, for minorities in the aggregate vs.  nonminorities, or for a particular minority  group.**  Where your earlier review  of EEO trends (SCRR page 7) identified a substantial disparity in the  representation of a     _________    *The EOS should be aware, however, that sometimes a more favor-    able rate for minorities or women may indicate a ""channeling"" into  different and perhaps less favorable jobs than others.    **While desk audit IRAs may be based on minorities in the aggre-    gate, an onsite finding of discrimination must identify the par-    ticular minority group(s) against whom discrimination is alleged (see  Appendix 3A instructions for Worksheet 17-1 on onsite refinement of IRAs).    particular minority group, IRAs should be conducted separately for that  group at least in the workforce area(s) where the disparity was observed and for  the type of activity most likely to have caused the disparity.  For example:      -If the disparity you observed was a historical absence of a particular  minority group, all hiring IRAs should be con-    ducted separately for that group.    -If the disparity was that Hispanics have historically been well represented  in Professional jobs but absent from Man-    agement, your IRAs for promotions and hires into Management job groups  should be conducted separately for Hispanics.    -If the disparity was that over the past year the represen-    tation of Black Technicians declined dramatically, termina-    tion IRAs (and probably promotion and hire IRAs also) in Technician job  groups should be conducted separately for Blacks.    Even where such a disparity was not observed in the initial category screen,  where the labor area has a high representation of more than one minority group  and/or the general employment patterns in the industry involved have differed  among minority     groups, in reviewing the contractor's activity data preparatory to  conducting IRA, the EOS should be alert for any indications of potential  problems in selections of a particular minority group.    IMPORTANT:  Remember that an adverse IRA is only a preliminary indicator of  a potential discrimination problem.  For example, a job group IRA may measure  selection for jobs with differing qual-ification standards and consequent  differing candidate pools.  These matters need to be explored further (normally  onsite) before any conclusions can be reached.     IRA INSTRUCTIONS      At the top of this sheet enter the names of the groups whose selection rates  you are comparing (minorities vs. nonminorities; women vs. men; Blacks vs.  Others, etc.) and, in the ""Rate for:"" headings for columns (b) and  (c), an abbreviation for those groups.  Also enter the dates covered by the  employment activity data and the date of the incumbency data you are using  (incum-    bency data should, to the extent possible, be from the beginning of the  activity period), then complete this sheet as follows.     Job Area (a):  Enter the name of the job area being analyzed. Assuming this  is a job group, also indicate the EEO-1/6 category  to which it belongs.     HIRES     The hiring rate of a group is the number of that group who were hired  divided by the number of that group who applied.     oRate for: (b):  Enter the hiring rate for minorities, members of a  particular minority group or women (include both numbers and percent).     oRate for: (c):  Enter the hiring rate for others (include both numbers and  percent).     If the minority/female hiring rate is lower than that for others, compute  the IRA [(d) below].  If the minority/female rate is higher, no further entries  are required.    oIRA (d):  Since this is a positive personnel action, divide the lower  minority/female rate by the rate for others.     If the IRA is .8 or more, STOP.  No further entries are needed for this IRA.   Complete the remaining columns ONLY if the IRA is less than .8.     oOverall Rate (e):  Find the overall hiring rate by dividing the total  number of hires by the total number of     applicants.     oExpected (f):  Enter the number of minorities/women who would have been  hired if all persons had been hired at the same rate.  To get this number,  multiply the overall rate (e) by the number of minority or female applicants  [the denominator in (b)].  Round the result down to the nearest whole number  (i.e. 4.3 = 4; 0.7 = 0, etc.).    oActual (g):  Enter the actual number of minorities or women hired.     oDifference (h):  Subtract the actual number from the expect-ed number and  enter the difference.  This is how many addi-    tional minorities or women you would expect to have been hired if all groups  had been hired at the same rate.     If the difference is zero, leave this column blank, and the IRA need not be  pursued further.     EXAMPLE:  1 of 10 women were hired (10%), 5 of 10 men  were hired (50%).   The IRA is .2 (.10/.50).     Since there were 6 total hires (1 woman + 5 men), and 20 total applicants  (10 women + 10 men)--the overall hiring rate was 6/20 or 30%.     If men and women had been hired at the same rate, you would have expected  30% of the 10 female applicants--or 3--to have been hired.  Since the actual  number hired was 1, the difference is 2--i.e. 2 women may not have been hired  because of potential discrimination.     Your IRA sheet for this example would look like this:    PROMOTIONS      Following the same procedure as for hires, enter the promotion rates for  minorities, members of a particular minority group or women and the promotion  rate for others, then, if the minority/    female rate is lower, divide it by the rate for others.  If the resulting  IRA is less than .8, use the same method as for hires to determine overall rate,  expected, actual and difference.     Please note, however, that to analyze promotion data sensibly, you must:   (1) know how the contractor has defined promotions, and (2) draw on the results  of your Review of Personnel Practices (SCRR page 8), to develop some idea of  what the probable candi-    date pool was for the promotions involved.     For example, if you have data on promotion to Crafts II (mid-    level), you may determine based on your earlier review of person-nel  practices that the prime candidate pool is probably Crafts I (lowest level).  In  that case your IRA would be as follows:      EXAMPLE:     Total  Min.  Nonmin.     Promotions to Crafts II   12     2  9     Persons in Craft I    50    10 40     The minority rate is the number of minority promotions to  Crafts lI,  divided by the number of minorities in Crafts I-- i.e. 2/10 or 20%.     The nonminority rate is the number of nonminority promotions to Crafts II  divided by the number of nonminorities in  Crafts I--i.e. 9/40 or 22.5%.     To find the IRA, divide the minority rate by the nonminority rate--here,  .20/.225 or .89.     Since the IRA is not adverse, no further entries are needed and your IRA  sheet would look like this:    Obviously, you can only conduct this analysis if you can make a fair guess  at what the appropriate feeder pool is for promotion, and you would need to  confirm the accuracy of that guess onsite.  If you cannot make any preliminary  determination of probable feeder groups for promotion, you should wait until you  are     onsite to conduct this portion of the IRA.     TERMINATIONS     Follow the same procedures as for hires and promotions, except that:        Since this is a negative personnel action, the IRA is conducted when the  rate for minorities, members of a particular minority group, or women is higher  than the rate for others.      To find the IRA, divide the termination rate for others by the higher  minority/female rate.       If the IRA is adverse, when you find the expected number, round the result  up* to the nearest whole number (i.e. 0.3 = 1; 6.8 = 7; etc.).       Since in an adverse termination situation, you would expect fewer  minorities/women to have terminated, subtract the expected number from the  actual.          EXAMPLE: 6 of 40 women terminated (15%); 1 of 10 men terminated (10%), for  an IRA of .10./.15 or .67.     Since the IRA is less than .8, find the overall termination rate by dividing  the 7 total terminations (6 women + 1 man) by the 50 total incumbents (40 women  + 10 men)--i.e. 7/50 or 14%.    Multiply the overall rate by the number of female incumbents to find the  number of women you would have expected to ter-    minate--i.e. .14 x 40 or 5.6 = 6.     Since the expected number is 6 and 6 women actually terminated, the  difference is zero, and the IRA need not be pursued further.     _______    *The reason for rounding up here (vs. down on hires and promo-    tions) is to eliminate ""fractional persons.""  For example, in a  positive action, with 3.7 expected hires and 3 actual, the dif-    ference would be .7 ""more"" of a person hired; similarly, in neg-      ative actions, with 4.4 expected terminations and 5 actual, the difference  would be .6 ""less"" of a person terminated.  However, see later  comments on interpreting IRA results.     For this example, your IRA sheet would look like this:     OTHER ACTIVITY ELEMENTS     You may wish to attach additional IRA worksheets (with headings  appropriately modified) for other relevant employment activity information the  contractor may provide, such as training data.  In determining what information  to enter, simply remember that the rate for the groups you are comparing will  always be the number of persons selected (for training, for transfer, etc.)  divided by the number of persons in the pool eligible for selec-    tion.  How you define eligible for selection will depend on the situation  and the quality of your data.     INTERPRETING IRA RESULTS     IRAs do not stand alone.  They must be interpreted in light of surrounding  review factors.  For example,"

Purpose .   To alert the Welfare-to-Work (WtW) delivery  system to the new WtW Census 2000 Employment project linking local WtW programs to Census 2000 temporary job opportunities, and to advise the system of the consultation requirements for project applicants.   2.   References .  Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (Pub. L. 105-33) (amending Title IV-A of the Social Security Act); the Welfare- to-Work Interim Final Rule, 20 CFR Part 645 (Published at 62 FR 61588 (Nov. 18, 1997)); and WtW Census 2000 Employment Project Solicitation for Grant Applications (Published at 64 FR 26440  (May 14, 1999)).    3.   Background .   Census 2000 presents a unique opportunity  for long-term welfare recipients to benefit from services provided through local WtW programs while gaining work experience and credentials through temporary jobs as Census 2000 enumerators.  The primary goals of the WtW Census 2000 Employment Project are to ensure that 1) WtW participants, who are successfully identified and recruited by the WtW Census 2000 Employment Project grantee, are part of a viable pool from which Census 2000 recruiters can hire and train enumerators; and 2) WtW Census 2000 hires receive the intensive community-based support they need to remain in the workforce after their Census 2000 jobs end.      Any private entity with a nationwide network of community-based local providers or affiliates may apply for this project.  The grantee will serve as an intermediary between local Census Bureau offices across the country and the WtW local level formula and competitive grantees.   In order to be eligible for the grant, applicants must apply  in consultation with every State that has received WtW formula funds and ""in conjunction with"" the Private Industry Council  (or its successor organization) or political subdivision in  every local area across the country in which the applicant proposes to operate.  Certification of consultation is required to document that the applicant has consulted with State and local WtW entities during the development of the application and that the activities proposed in the application are consistent with, and will be coordinated with, the WtW efforts of the certifying entity.    Because of the nationwide scope of the Census 2000 Employment project, in all likelihood, every WtW formula grantee will be asked to provide certification of consultation to several different applicants for this Census project.   4.   Certification Form .  Attached is a sample Certification  form which may be used to document that applicants have consulted with States, PICs and political subdivisions.  The sample format was included in the WtW Census 2000 Employment Project Solicitation for Grant Applications (SGA) and has been approved by the Office of Management and Budget for use in facilitating consultation for this project.     WtW programs should be aware that they may be asked to certify consultation with a number of applicants.  The Certification Format was developed to decrease the burden on WtW programs in responding to such requests from applicants for this WtW Census project.    5.   Action .   The Employment and Training Administration encourages State and local WtW grantees to cooperate with applicants for the WtW Census 2000 Employment project.  States are encouraged to disseminate this Training and Employment Information Notice (TEIN) to PICs and other local entities who are administering WtW programs.   6.   Inquiries .

How Are The Nondiscrimination Laws Enforced?   Generally, if an individual files a complaint alleging that he or she was denied benefits or otherwise discriminated against in a program or activity that received Federal funds, the agency that provided the Federal funds may conduct an administrative investigation of the complaint. An investigation may include interviews and collection of data from the complainant and welfare provider. If an agency believes discrimination has occurred, it will initially seek voluntary compliance by the welfare provider. The agency may also officer technical assistance to the welfare provider to prevent future instances of discrimination. If the complaint cannot be resolved voluntarily, the agency may seek to terminate a welfare provider’s Federal funding, or may refer the complaint to the United States Department of Justice, Civil Rights Division, which may file a lawsuit in Federal court to enforce compliance. Individuals may file private lawsuits to enforce their rights under Title VI, Title IX, Section 504, or the Age Discrimination Act and, in certain circumstances, may recover damages if they prevail.    Individuals who work also may have rights under the Federal employment discrimination laws that protect against unlawful discrimination in hiring, work assignments, promotions, etc., and may file a complaint with the appropriate Federal agency. Individuals, after complying with administrative complaint procedures at the Federal agency level, may also bring lawsuits to enforce their rights (including the potential for damages) under Title VII, the ADEA, and IRCA’s antidiscrimination provision. Individuals may file private suits to enforce their rights under the ADA, Section 504, and EPA without first filing an administrative complaint.   Federal contractors and subcontractors are required to comply with Executive order 11246, as amended; Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended; and the affirmative action provisions of the Vietnam Era Veterans’ Readjustment Assistance Act, as amended.    These laws ban discrimination and also require Federal contractors, subcontractors, and contractors working on federally assisted construction contracts to take affirmative action to ensure that all individuals have an equal opportunity for employment, without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, disability, or status as a Vietnam era or special disabled veteran. These laws are administered by the Department of Labor’s Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP). In certain circumstances, OFCCP also acts as an agent for the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in the enforcement of the ADA and Title VII.

Federal Employment Discrimination Laws    Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. 2000e et seq. (""Title VII""), the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, as amended, 42 U.S.C. Section 621 et. seq. (ADEA) and the Equal Pay Act of 1963, 29 U.S.C. Section 206 (d) (EPA) , are Federal employment discrimination laws that offer civil rights protection to all employees, including TANF beneficiaries who make the transition from welfare to employment.    Title VII prohibits private and State and local government employers with 15 or more employees and employment agencies from discriminating on the basis of race, color, sex (including pregnancy), religion or national origin in all aspects of an employment relationship, including hiring, discharge, compensation, assignments, and other terms, conditions and privileges of employment. The ADEA prohibits employers with 20 or more employees, and state and local governments from discriminating against persons 40 or older because of age. The EPA requires payment of equal wages to men and women performing substantially the same work unless the pay discrepancy is based on a seniority or merit system, a system that measures quantity or quality of production, or a factor other than sex. The EPA applies to employers of any size.    Set forth below are examples of conduct by welfare agencies that assign TANF participants to work activities and the employers to whom they are assigned that may violate Title VII:      Denying employment opportunities to a TANF participant because he looks ""foreign"" or has an accent.     Prohibiting an employee from wearing religious clothing would be religious discrimination unless this would pose an undue hardship for the employer, e.g. a young Muslim woman who wears a shawl covering her head in keeping with Muslim teachings, or a young man who wears a turban in keeping with Sikh religious teachings.     A male supervisor constantly makes remarks about a female mechanic trainee's anatomy and invites her to the movies after work. When she refuses he usually states that there are many other persons interested in her trainee position.     An employer refuses to hire female TANF beneficiaries between the ages of 18 and 25 on grounds that they may become pregnant.      Title I of the ADA  is another statute that offers protection to TANF beneficiaries engaged in work activities. Title I prohibits private and State and local government employers with 15 or more employees and employment agencies from discriminating in employment, on the basis of disability. As in Section 504, employers must make reasonable accommodation to the known physical or mental limitations of a qualified person with a disability unless the accommodation would impose an undue hardship. It also prohibits retaliation for opposing disability discrimination or participating in the complaint process. Title I applies to all employers who are covered by Title VII and prohibits discrimination based on disability in all aspects of the employment relationship.   In addition to the above statutes it should be noted that employment discrimination by recipients of Federal assistance also is prohibited by Title II of the ADA, Section 504, Title IX and Title VI (Title VI employment jurisdiction is limited to cases in which the primary purpose of the Federal assistance is to provide employment and to those cases in which the employment discrimination tends to discriminate against beneficiaries).Each of these laws prohibit retaliation against individuals because they oppose practices that they reasonably believe are unlawful under the employment discrimination statutes or because they participate in proceedings under the employment discrimination statutes.   The Federal agencies will continue to work with you and other benefit providers as welfare reform is implemented. Attached are addresses and telephone numbers of the Federal agencies as a helpful reference for questions related to civil rights and welfare reform. Each agency has provided a toll free number for your convenience and is available to provide technical assistance, and answer questions.

Employment Development Department   Welfare-to-Work           General Information      In August 1996, a comprehensive welfare reform bill, the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act, consolidated the  Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), Emergency Assistance, and  Job Opportunities and Basic Skills programs into a single block grant for  Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF). The primary purpose of TANF  is to move people from welfare to work.    The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 amended certain TANF provisions  and authorized the Secretary of Labor to provide Welfare-to-Work  (WtW) grants to states and local communities. These funds are allotted  to compliment the TANF program by providing transitional assistance to  move the hard to employ TANF welfare recipients into unsubsidized jobs  and economic self-sufficiency.     In California, the Employment Development Department has been  designated by the governor to be the state administrative entity for  the federal WtW grants. Within EDD, the Workforce Investment Division  will be responsible for disseminating policy and information concerning  the WtW program.    The Local Workforce Investment Boards (LWIB) will administer the  program for Local Workforce Investment Area (LWIA). There are some  circumstances when the Governor may submit a request to the Department  of Labor for a waiver designating an alternate administrative entity for  individual or multiple  LWIAs.  California's 50 LWIAs  and LWIBs cover the entire geographic area of the State.     For more information, contact the Workforce Investment Division, at (916) 654-7799.

GX047-36-12361685	"STATEMENT OF JOHN FRASER      DEPUTY ADMINISTRATOR,  WAGE AND HOUR DIVISION EMPLOYMENT STANDARDS   ADMINISTRATION U.S. DEPARTMENT OF LABOR before the                   SUBCOMMITTEE ON IMMIGRATION AND CLAIMS                      OF THE HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE                                June 29, 1995    Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee:        Thank you for the opportunity to appear today to  discuss H.R. 1915, the ""Immigration in the National Interest  Act of 1995,"" introduced by Chairman Smith late last week.  My statement this morning will be quite brief because --  while we have been working with the other agencies present  here today to review and analyze the bill -- our evaluation  is still at a preliminary stage. Therefore, I will confine  my remarks to a few issues of particular interest to the  Department of Labor, and express our eagerness to continue  working with you regarding these issues and other concerns  which may arise from our ongoing review.        First, we appreciate that the bill clearly recognizes  the important role that the Department of Labor plays in  helping control illegal immigration through work site  enforcement of minimum labor standards. Section 402 of H.R.  1915, ""Strengthened Enforcement of Wage and Hour Laws,""  authorizes (but does not appropriate funding for) 150  additional staff positions for the Wage and Hour Division  (Wage and Hour) to investigate violations of wage and hour  laws in areas where there are high concentrations of  undocumented workers. This provision parallels the  President's FY 1996 budget request, which, as part of the  President's comprehensive strategy to more  effectively control illegal immigration, called for 202  additional positions for the Department -- 186 for Wage and  Hour, and 16 for the Solicitor's office to prosecute the  most serious labor standards violations arising from our  investigators' work.        We applaud that this provision of H.R. 1915 -- as did  the Commission on Immigration Reform in its recommendations  last fall -- appropriately recognizes that the Department of  Labor makes an important contribution to reducing incentives  for illegal immigration. Curbing illegal migration and  effectively enforcing worker protection laws have a direct  if too seldom noted policy connection. Illegal immigrants  can be attractive to some employers and are frequently  subjected to exploitation in the form of sub minimum wages,  dangerous workplaces, excessively long hours and other poor  working conditions because they are desperate for work and  in an extremely weak position to assure their rights.  Knowingly hiring illegal workers thus both reveals and  rewards an employer's willingness to break the law, and  undermines wages and working conditions for authorized  workers.        Vigorous enforcement of minimum employment standards  serves as a meaningful deterrent to illegal migration by  denying some of the business advantage that can be gained  through the employment of highly vulnerable and exploitable  workers under substandard wages and working conditions.  Labor standards enforcement -- combined with our routine  inspection of employers' compliance with their employment  eligibility verification obligations -- not only helps  ensure fairness and minimally acceptable wage and employment  conditions in the workplace, but also  helps foster a level competitive playing field for the large  majority of honest employers who seek to comply with the  law.        The Administration strongly believes -- and the  President has emphasized -- that enhanced work site  enforcement of both minimum labor standards and employer  sanctions are essential components of the comprehensive  strategy needed, and proposed by this Administration, to  more effectively control illegal migration, which poses the  greatest single threat to our generous and beneficial system  of legal immigration. We support this provision of H.R. 1915  -- indeed, we strongly support the Administration's request  for even more Wage and Hour enforcement personnel -and again  urge that all the Members of the Subcommittee work to ensure  that the additional funds necessary to implement this  provision are ultimately appropriated.        Second, Section 403 of the bill, ""Changes in the  Employer Sanctions Program,"" requires development of a  telephone verification system for employment eligibility  verification along the lines contemplated by the  Administration's pilot programs, and as called for by the  Commission on Immigration Reform and S.269. While deferring  to our colleagues from INS and SSA regarding any technical  and data problems presented by this provision, we note that  the bill clearly contemplates a continuing role for DOL/ESA  programs in assuring verification compliance.        Third, with respect to Title V of H.R. 1915, which  changes the Nation's system of legal immigration, we are  carefully reviewing the proposals. We will be examining them  in light of the recommendations of the Commission on  Immigration        Reform which will be more fully elaborated and  explained over the next few weeks. To assist our review, we  are also interested in fully understanding the rationale  that underlies some of the significant changes proposed by  H.R. 1915 and the basis for the divergences of the  Chairman's proposals from the Commission on Immigration  Reform's recommendations, and look forward to a constructive  dialogue with the Members of this Subcommittee in this  regard. For example, we note that, while quite significantly  reducing family-based immigration, H.R. 1915 essentially  maintains current levels of employment-based immigration. In  addition, H.R. 1915 would significantly reduce the annual  ceiling on the admission of the most highly qualified and  talented employment-based immigrants -- those with  ""extraordinary ability"" -while increasing the ceilings for  advanced degree professionals, and skilled and professional  workers. We are interested in understanding the rationale  for such changes.        Fourth, with respect to Title VI, Section 602, ""Making  Unauthorized Aliens Ineligible for Unemployment Benefits,""  we would point out that unauthorized workers already are  ineligible for unemployment as a result of the Immigration  Reform and Control Act of 1986. We are, therefore, unclear  as to the intent of this provision.        Fifth, we note that the only provision of H.R. 1915  which modifies current law affecting non immigrant  categories (Title VIII, Section 806) makes a number of  changes in the H-1B program governing temporary admission  and employment of non immigrant ""professionals"" (and fashion  models of distinguished merit and ability).   If we understand them correctly, these provisions would:    (1)  Overturn a provision of the Department's H-1B       regulations by directing that employers shall not be       required to- have and document an objective system to       determine the actual wages of their workers.     (2)  Make certain of the Department's H-1B regulations       inapplicable to a subset of H-1B program users --       ""Non-H-1B-Dependent Employers."" Such employers which       use relatively few H-1B workers would:        .    not be required to provide notice of their            employment of H-1B workers at additional work            sites within an ""area of intended employment"" for            which the employer has filed a Labor Condition            Application (LCA);                    .    not be required to file a new LCA -- nor, apparently,            comply with any requirements attendant to such LCA --            to place any H-1B worker in an area of intended            employment for which it has not previously filed an LCA            so long as each non immigrant worker is not assigned to            the new area for more than 45 days in any 12-month            period, nor more than 90 days in any 36-month period.            Nor would the employer of such H-1B worker be required            to pay per diem or transportation costs at any            specified rate for the worker during such assignment;            and,           not be subject to compliance investigation except            based on a complaint            alleging violations, retroactively effective on            January 15, 1995;     (3) Increase the time to adjudicate the LCA of an  NH-1B-Dependent"" employer.     (4) Require all employers filing H-1B LCAs to attest  that they have not laid off workers ""with the same  qualifications and experience in the specific  employment for which the non immigrant is being sought""  within the six months preceding the date of filing the  LCA, and will not lay off such ""protected individuals""  within 90 days following the date of filing the LCA --  unless ""the employer pays an actual wage to each non  immigrant that is at least 110 percent of the median of  the last wage earned by the laid off employees."" In  addition, a ""job contractor"" must attest that it will  not place an H-1B worker with another employer if the  other employer (i.e., client) would not meet the above  requirements (i.e., had or would lay off its workers)  if it were presumed that the contractor's H-1B worker  were an employee of the client-employer.          We perceive that the last of these proposed changes  represents a welcome effort to implement a modification in  the H-1B program previously requested by Labor Secretary  Reich -- to prevent U.S. workers from being laid off or  otherwise displaced by non immigrants -- though it does not  reflect the language requested by the Secretary and provides  a means of circumvention. We also note that H.R. 1915 does  not  include an additional change to the H-1B program requested  by the Secretary -- a requirement that H-1B employers attest  to taking timely and significant steps to recruit and retain  U.S. workers in the jobs for which they are seeking foreign  workers. While we have a number of concerns about the  changes to the H-1B program contained in H.R. 1915 (and  would like to address more non immigrant programs, and in a  broader context on the array of non immigrant programs for  which the Department has responsibility), we find promise in  the general framework provided in the bill and look forward  to working with you and interested parties to address our  concerns and attempt to fashion H-1B amendments which the  Administration could fully endorse.        Finally, we note that H.R. 1915 does not address the  H-1A non immigrant (registered nurses) visa category which  sunsets under current law on September 1, 1995. The  Secretary of Labor has received a report and recommendations  from the Immigration Nursing Relief Advisory Committee, and  we expect that he will soon make recommendations to Congress  about this pilot program. It should also be noted that H.R.  1915 does not contain some provisions of the  Administration's illegal immigration bill, ""The Immigration  Enforcement Act of 1995,"" introduced by Congressman Berman,  which would benefit the Department in carrying out its  immigration and work site enforcement responsibilities. We  would urge your favorable consideration of these provisions.        Mr. Chairman, that concludes my statement and I will be  pleased to respond to questions from the Members of the  Subcommittee.    Judiciary Homepage"

Purpose . To provide coordinated guidance developed jointly by the Departments of Health and Human Services (HHS), Labor (DOL), and Transportation (DOT), to assist States and communities in taking full advantage of existing transportation resources available to help move people from welfare to work.     2.   Authorities and References . Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA) of 1996 (Pub. L. 104-193) and Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (Pub. L. 105-33) amending Title IV-A of the Social Security Act;  Transportation Equity Act for the 21st century (TEA-21) (Pub. L. 105-178);  Child Support Performance and Incentive Act of 1998 (Pub.

Reg. 61588 (Nov. 18, 1997));TANF Policy Announcement No. TANF-ACF-PA-97-1, dated January 31, 1997;  Training and Employment Guidance Letter (TEGL) 9-97.     3.   Rescission . The attached guidance paper was originally issued on May 8, 1998.  Since then two major pieces of legislation have passed that significantly altered the programs described in the original guidance document.  In order for this revised guidance to be most useful, it is being reissued in its entirety as a new TEGL, rescinding TEGL 9-97.      4.   Background . The guidance, intended to augment the current statutory and regulatory provisions, has been revised to incorporate legislative changes since the initial issuance.  In particular, the Job Access and Reverse Commute (Job Access) program was created by Congress to provide new resources to address transportation issues for low-income people.  The revised guidance paper also clarifies policy issues that have come to light in the areas of:   the definition of ""assistance"" under the TANF program, data reporting under TANF and the Welfare-to-Work (WtW) program, and appropriate cost principles for federally-funded projects.     5.   Information .  The new Job Access program creates opportunities at the local level for communities to leverage existing resources to help solve transportation issues for low income neighborhoods.  The revised guidance describes, in detail, a number of limitations on how these funds may be appropriately used in cost sharing arrangements.  State and local employment and training providers should review the example set forth on page 13 regarding how a jointly funded transportation project could operate.     >6.   Action .   Please share the joint guidance paper, as well as the joint Secretarial memorandum, with State and local staff who are involved in providing transportation services, to welfare recipients.  This guidance is being issued simultaneously through the policy guidance systems of the three agencies involved.     7.   Inquiries .   Inquiries on this joint guidance should be addressed to the appropriate Regional Office contacts which can be found at:  Administration for Children and Families (HHS),  Federal Transit Administration (DOT) ,  Employment and Training Administration (DOL) .      8.   Attachments .      I.    Joint letter from Secretaries of Health and Human Services, Labor, and Transportation.    II.  Joint Paper on ""Use of TANF, WtW and Job Access Funds for Transportation.""     Attachment I     Dear Colleague:     As President Clinton said in his 1998 State of the Union address, ""A society rooted in responsibility must first promote the value of work, not welfare.""  In order for families to transition from welfare to work successfully, the Federal Government, States, communities, businesses, and non-profit agencies must work together to create opportunities and remove barriers.  Your involvement is crucial to overcoming one of the biggest challenges facing those transitioning from welfare to work:  finding reliable, affordable, and efficient transportation to jobs, training, and support services such as child care.       President Clinton recognizes the challenge this poses to job seekers, and has asked us to create new strategies to help them get to where the jobs are.  As he has said, ""Each and every one of us has to fulfill our responsibility, indeed, our moral obligation, to make sure that people who now must work,  can  work.""     In February, the President wrote a letter to the Nation's Governors highlighting the critical role of transportation and urging them to use existing funds for transportation services wherever possible.  To encourage each State and community to take full advantage of current resources, the U.S. Departments of Health and Human Services, Labor, and Transportation are working closely together on this issue and are jointly issuing the written guidance enclosed with this letter.       The guidance encourages coordination among transportation, workforce development, and social service providers to ensure the most efficient use of Federal funds.  Such partnerships are an excellent way to create new, more effective transportation alternatives and to enable businesses to get the workers they need while stimulating local economies.  We know some of you are already engaged in such partnerships and applaud these efforts, many of which are described in a recent publication by the Department of Transportation and the Community Transportation Association of America entitled  Access To Jobs, A Guide to Innovative Practices in Welfare-to-Work Transportation .  This publication is available on the Internet at http://www.ctaa.org/welfare.     We are confident that with adequate attention to, and investment in, transportation and other support services, welfare recipients will have the resources they need to find and keep jobs.  We greatly appreciate your help in making welfare reform a success.    Rodney E. Slater   Donna E. Shalala  Alexis M.

As in the United States, which has undertaken similar initiatives during the last several years, British efforts make employment the primary goal, marking a shift from income support to a work-centered welfare system. This shift puts employers at the heart of reform.    On behalf of the New Deal Task Force, Jobs for the Future (JFF) has researched early lessons from the U.S. experience to stimulate planning and discussion among British employers and policymakers. This paper summarizes those lessons, with particular attention to the experience of a select group of large U.S. firms that have British subsidiaries and effective welfare-to-work programs.   These companies are: Allied Signal, American Airlines, Anheuser-Busch, Bristol-Meyers Squibb, Chevron, EDS, Federal Express, Ford, General Motors, Hewlett-Packard, Manpower Inc., Marriott International, McDonald’s, Monsanto, Pizza Hut, Salomon Smith Barney, United Airlines, United Parcel Service, and Xerox Business Services.   Because the United States and the United Kingdom have very different political and economic structures and traditions, as well as different welfare and workforce development systems, no attempt is made to transfer JFF’s findings about the American experience into recommendations for Britain. Social policies from one country can never be adopted wholesale by another. However, we believe that the lessons from the past few years of welfare-to-work practice in the United States are instructive and relevant to the future development of the New Deal and other welfare-to-work initiatives.    Social and Economic Context     Political and economic factors have accelerated the rate at which U.S. employers are hiring people on welfare.     The ""push"" of federal legislation is increasing the number of welfare recipients seeking work : The 1996 Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act transforms welfare into a work-based system by limiting welfare recipients to a lifetime maximum of five years of federally financed assistance. The Act requires most recipients to find employment or participate in activities leading to work. It also places a clear priority on immediate labor market attachment— known as a ""work-first"" approach—rather than longer-term education and training strategies.    The ""pull"" of a shortage of qualified entry-level employees is forcing employers to seek new sources of labor : Tight labor markets combined with rising employer demand for basic and soft skills in entry-level positions have prompted employers to  look to new sources of potential employees, including the welfare population. Through most of the 1990s, the demand for qualified entry-level employees has increased more quickly than the supply. During the last five years, the number of companies reporting skill shortages has doubled. In addition, the literacy, numeracy, communications, and teamwork skills demanded by employers have increased. In this environment, many firms are experimenting with new ways to find qualified, entry-level staff, reduce turnover, and improve productivity.    Welfare has traditionally provided income to poor families with dependent children.    Consequently, adult welfare recipients are overwhelmingly female and between the ages of 20 and 45. The typical family that receives welfare is a single mother with two children. (Able-bodied adult men and women without children are not eligible for most welfare programs; those who have recently lost their job are eligible for short-term income support through the Unemployment Insurance system.) Welfare recipients are distributed fairly evenly across racial groups, and as many as a third have dependents under the age of three. They are unevenly distributed geographically: they are overwhelmingly concentrated in the nation’s cities and, to a lesser extent, rural poverty areas.    As a group, welfare recipients face serious skill deficiencies.    At least 42 percent of welfare recipients lack a high school diploma. A sizable minority have physical and other disabilities that make work difficult. One-third have never held a job for longer than six months. According to one estimate, only 10 percent of the welfare population is skilled enough to advance beyond entry-level work. Other non-skill barriers to employment include inadequate transportation to where jobs are located, a lack of daycare resources, and inexperience in strategies for finding suitable employment.    As the welfare system becomes more work-centered, welfare and workforce policy are becoming more closely linked.    Recent reforms of both welfare and workforce development policy in the United States emphasize the priority of work. Welfare policy promotes work as a way to reduce dependency on public assistance. Workforce development policy has moved toward skill-development strategies that are more work-based and responsive to employers than in the past. New policy priorities include: an emphasis on serving employer needs, increased roles for business-oriented intermediary organizations and private-public partnerships, a one-stop service-delivery system, and an accountability system that includes performance measures on retention and advancement as well as hiring. These reforms constitute a major paradigm shift in the role of the Employment Service at the local level.    The success of a work-centered welfare policy is linked necessarily to the dynamics of the low-wage, low-skill labor market.    Many individual employers can change—and are changing—hiring and employment practices to better help welfare recipients find work. However, important questions remain about whether the U.S. economy has enough jobs for all welfare recipients; whether recipients are qualified for available jobs; and whether the jobs that are available to these individuals, in combination with government income support, make it possible for welfare recipients eventually to achieve family-supporting incomes.   These are challenges that individual employers alone cannot address. It is why many U.S. experts—and employers—see a necessary role for public policy not just in helping welfare recipients escape dependency but also in making it easier for the millions of low-wage workers who are not on welfare to achieve self-sustaining incomes through a combination of employment, education, job training, tax, and income-support policies.    General Trends in Employer Welfare-to-Work Efforts     Many employers are hiring welfare recipients.    Hiring of welfare recipients by U.S. firms has grown rapidly, more rapidly than many predicted even two years ago. The national Welfare to Work Partnership, an organization dedicated to helping companies set up welfare-to-work programs, has enlisted 7,500 firms. In 1997, Partnership members hired over 135,000 welfare recipients. Two recent surveys conclude that more than half of U.S. firms report they have hired from the welfare population. However, most welfare recipients get low-wage jobs. And unfortunately for both firms and welfare recipients, turnover rates in low-wage jobs are high, unless    employers design programs to promote retention.    Participation is dominated by larger firms in a few industries.    Larger firms in a small number of industry sectors are the major employers of welfare recipients, with firms of more than 100 employees estimated to employ 61 percent of working welfare recipients.   The service and retail sectors account for 60 percent of all employment but 80 percent of the jobs secured by welfare recipients. Business services, eating and drinking places, and health services alone account for 45 percent of employment for welfare recipients.   However, as Jobs for the Future’s research and interviews indicate, firms in diverse—and frequently higher-paying—industries, such as high technology, transportation, health, and heavy manufacturing, have successful welfare-to-work policies. Efforts to diversify target industry sectors are beginning to bear fruit.    There is potential for continued expansion of employer participation, particularly among smaller businesses.    Further expansion of employer hiring from the welfare population is both likely and feasible, assuming continued economic growth. Even in a recession or a period of slower growth, firms will face ongoing challenges in finding and retaining qualified, entry-level workers.   While participation of small firms in welfare-to-work programs has been relatively weak, two-thirds of small firms that used local intermediary organizations to recruit candidates for employment reported hiring welfare recipients. Smaller firms that hire welfare recipients have a much higher ratio of welfare hires to total employees than do larger firms. Marketing to firms by employer associations, business networks, and other local intermediaries, an idea that is gaining momentum in many communities, may help increase small-business involvement in welfare-to-work efforts.    Most employers focus primarily on recruitment and hiring, but strategies to improve retention are becoming more common—and they are receiving support from public policy.    The primary emphasis of welfare-to-work efforts to date has been recruitment and hiring. However, employers are increasingly interested in ways to lower turnover and improve retention of entry-level employees.   Federal and state policies have also focused on moving recipients off welfare and into employment. Increasingly, though, policymakers recognize the need for additional funds to support strategies that help recipients stay employed and advance in careers. The newly enacted Workforce Investment Act authorizes resources for training current employees, with an emphasis on low-skill workers. Federal welfare-to-work legislation provides $3 billion for measures to improve retention and advancement of the hardest-to- employ welfare population. One target group for this assistance is non-custodial parents with significant barriers to market success. These resources can be used for pre-employment training and related services delivered by public agencies, local One Stop Centers, or other community-based organizations that are part of the local workforce development system.    The Welfare-to-Work Experience of Leading U.S. Firms    Jobs for the Future interviewed 19 leading U.S. companies about their welfare-to-work activities. (Profiles of 11 of these large firms, all of which have a presence in the United Kingdom, are included in the full report.) The interviews explored: corporate motivation for developing and sustaining welfare-to-work programs, the benefits firms derive, the kinds of activities in which the firms engage, and the role of local partnerships in simplifying and strengthening employer participation.    The primary motivation for employer participation is to meet business objectives.    Wage subsidies motivate firms to begin welfare-to-work efforts but are not by themselves sufficient to sustain involvement. Public funding of recruitment, training, and support services encourages sustained efforts by improving welfare recipients’ job performance while reducing companies’ financial exposure. That said, firms report two other motives for initiating welfare-to-work efforts: the desire to be good corporate citizens and peer pressure or influence from other companies they see as leaders in their industry or community.    Employers identify a number of important business benefits from their welfare-to-work involvement.      Three benefits are foremost: more effective access to an expanded labor pool, reduced employee turnover, and increased motivation and loyalty among new hires.   Firms report other benefits as well. These include: reduced recruitment and hiring costs; better-than-average quality and performance for new hires; and improved morale among a firm’s incumbent workforce.   An additional benefit comes from public subsidies for hiring welfare recipients and for training and other services that improve job-readiness and productivity. Employers appreciate subsidies because they help reduce the risks and costs of employing welfare recipients.   Finally, employers enjoy ""spill-over"" benefits from innovations that benefit not just welfare recipients but all entry-level employees in a company. Examples include: more effective mentoring and orientation programs for all new hires and strategies for addressing transportation needs or other barriers to work that can extend beyond the welfare population.    Employers identify several challenges to expanding their efforts.    These include:    How well local service providers can customize their activities to meet employer needs;  The need for quality referrals and screening of potential hires, given the poor job-readiness of many welfare recipients and other low-skill workers;  Perceived inflexibility of welfare and workforce development agencies;  The time and resources commitment required to develop new programs; and  Complexities of integrating services needed by many welfare recipients into a firm’s existing human resource practices.    Partnerships play a critical role in successful business experience.    U.S. companies have found it particularly helpful to enlist local agencies who excel at providing services that are beyond the firm’s core competencies. Every firm interviewed by Jobs for the Future stressed the importance of working in partnership with effective local organizations. Examples include: community-based organizations and temporary help firms that help companies recruit and assess potential new hires; regional bus lines or private firms that provide transportation to and from workplaces; community colleges that provide training and skill development; and a range of organizations that collaborate with employers to design and deliver work-based training and post-placement support.   From the company perspective, successful partnerships must meet clearly defined business objectives. Partners must provide excellent customer service, understand an employer’s specific entry-level labor needs, and be committed to continuous improvement in meeting employer standards.    Large, engaged firms are involved in two kinds of welfare-to-work efforts:     Activities that increase their access to quality employees and help the firm retain and advance those employees; and   Collaborative inter-firm activities that share best practice, increase overall business involvement, and influence public policy.    1. Activities that increase access, retention, and advancement     Firm-specific efforts focus primarily on expanding access to sources of new employees, improving the quality of the job match.  Effective strategies include:    Better screening and matching of job seekers to job vacancies;   Pre-employment preparation in basic skills, communication, and ""soft skills"" and short-term training targeted to the firm or industry; and   Improved orientation to the job, training on the job, and support during socialization to the job.    Examples of firms interviewed by JFF that engage in these efforts : Allied Signal, American Airlines, Chevron, EDS, Federal Express, General Motors, Hewlett-Packard, Manpower, Marriott, McDonald’s, Monsanto, Pizza Hut, Salomon Smith Barney, United Airlines, United Parcel Service, and Xerox Business Services.     Companies are increasingly concerned with strategies for increasing retention and lowering turnover . Activities include:    Supervisor training on working with new hires;   Mentoring and coaching by company staff;       Post-placement support to address logistical and personal barriers to employment; and   Provision of health and other benefits to entry-level workers.   Examples of firms interviewed by JFF that engage in these efforts : American Airlines, EDS, Federal Express, Marriott, McDonald’s, Pizza Hut, Salomon Smith Barney, United Airlines, United Parcel Service, and Xerox Business Services.    Many companies are developing efforts to strengthen career-advancement opportunities for entry-level workers.  Activities include:     Helping entry-level employees to develop career plans;   Encouraging employees to engage in additional training and education (within and outside the firm); and   Joining consortia of firms in the same industry or occupational cluster to collaborate on training, job matching, and other efforts that can improve advancement opportunities within and outside a single firm.   Examples of firms interviewed by JFF that engage in these efforts : EDS, Federal Express, Manpower, Marriott, McDonald’s, Pizza Hut, United Airlines, United Parcel Service, and Xerox Business Services.    While effective participation in welfare-to-work efforts requires staff, companies vary in how they organize and manage their activities . There is great variation in how firms organize the operational management of welfare- to-work efforts, depending upon the extent to which a firm’s operations and management are centralized. Xerox Business Services decentralizes most decision-making in welfare-to-work efforts to local managers; EDS, on the other hand, has more centralized roles for planning, program design, goal-setting, and reporting. Regardless of organizational structure, corporate staff often play important roles in providing local offices with guidance, tools and materials, examples from other parts of the company, and other ways of simplifying local start-up and implementation.     2. Collaborative, inter-firm activities that promote business engagement     Large firms frequently contribute staff time and resources to help coordinate and advance business involvement in local welfare-to-work efforts  through membership on local Workforce Investment Boards that set policy and priorities for federal workforce-related spending or through other local partnerships. Companies provide leadership in planning and governance. They are well-positioned to provide detailed labor market information, advocate for quality and continuous improvement in placement and training programs, and offer practical advice to local welfare and work-force agencies on simplifying the system and making participation more attractive to employers.    Employers also find it advantageous to collaborate with other firms in their region or their industry . Examples include United Parcel Service’s Employee Share program and American Airlines’ efforts to improve transportation for employees. Collaborations can be especially helpful to smaller firms with more limited staff and resources. They can be strengthened and formalized through technical assistance from public and quasi-public institutions at the state and local levels.    At the national level, membership in business-led organizations and learning networks facilitates joint activities  around sharing best practices and representing employer interests in national policy debates. Business organizations, such as the Welfare to Work Partnership, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Alliance of Business, the Conference Board, and Business for Social Responsibility, provide interested and member companies with important opportunities for inter-firm collaboration, learning, and direct technical assistance.    Lessons and Implications from U.S. Experience    Although U.S. experience with a work-centered welfare system is modest and the long-term results unknown, the experience of participating firms and individuals has yielded important lessons for employers; their partners in designing and implementing programs to employ welfare recipients; and the policymakers who are reshaping the U.S. welfare system and its public institutions. These lessons fall into two categories: implementation advice to employers and lessons for the public system at the regional and national levels.    Implementation Lessons to Employers     Successful initiatives require strategic planning      and high-level corporate commitment , so that participation meets clear business objectives and the commitment to participate is communicated effectively throughout the company.   Local partnerships can simplify and strengthen employer efforts to hire welfare recipients who can succeed.  By working and contracting with local service deliverers for help on recruitment, screening, skill-development, and support services, firms can improve their job matches and, as a result, increase employee productivity.   Productivity and employer satisfaction can be increased by greater emphasis on post-placement services for new hires.  Employers are more likely to be satisfied with their involvement in welfare-to- work if they derive long-term productivity benefits, not just short-term public subsidies. Promising retention strategies include these post-placement services: mentoring and coaching; supervisor training; help overcoming logistical and personal barriers to long-term employment; and access to company benefits plans.   Companies frequently find it advantageous to integrate efforts for welfare recipients into their overall human resource practices.  It is frequently easier—and less controversial within a worksite— to provide all entry-level staff with the kinds of support services that can help welfare recipients succeed in the transition to employment. Whether they receive public assistance or not, most low-wage, low-skill employees can benefit from access to employee assistance programs, on-the- job training, and help with personal barriers to employment. Broad availability of such assistance can help reduce high turnover in entry-level positions.    Policy Lessons for the Public System    For welfare-to-work to expand significantly and become sustainable in more U.S. firms, large and small, changes in government policies and practice will be needed. We highlight five policy priorities that can help the United States achieve the public goal of meeting both employer and individual needs:    Change policies and funding to better balance ""work first"" and effective longer-term skill development strategies , with a particular emphasis on:    Pre-employment skill development programs customized in response to the needs of specific employers.  Salomon Smith Barney’s close collaboration with Wildcat Service Corporation is a good example of a program that is responsive to an employer while preparing welfare recipients for jobs that pay well and offer career-advancement opportunities.  Skill advancement strategies while individuals are employed , including access to career planning; innovative partnerships with education and training providers; more on-the-job training opportunities for all entry-level employees; and support for additional training and credentials.    Increase public investment in activities that support the decision to work . For example, provide additional resources to help pay for on-the-job support services; transportation, child-care; and substance-abuse services, and other activities that can make work more viable for welfare recipients.   Create and expand income supplements for low-wage workers , such as the gradual expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit, which supplements wages of the working poor, rewarding them for work and raising their effective earnings through the tax system.   Remake the culture of the public-sector welfare system . Fund efforts to accelerate and support the transition of government from the role of simple administrator of income maintenance to that of a partner in promoting work, with responsibility for setting performance standards, developing accountability systems, and strengthening partnerships with the private sector and non-profit community organizations.   Provide public support to build the capacity of local intermediary organizations . Successful local welfare-to-work efforts combine the strengths of the public, business, and non-profit sectors. Public funding should promote the engagement of employers and their partners in both governance structures and in a one-stop service-delivery system that provides a single point of contact for individuals and employers.           FOREWORD         Through the New Deal, the British government has embarked upon a major reform of the welfare state, with a focus on reducing dependency and increasing the employability of long-term unemployed individuals. As in the United States, which has undertaken similar initiatives during the last several years, British efforts make employment the primary goal, marking a shift from income support to a work-centered welfare system. This shift puts employers at the heart of reform.    On behalf of the New Deal Task Force, Jobs for the Future (JFF) has researched early lessons from the U.S. welfare-to-work experience to stimulate planning and discussion among British employers and policymakers. This paper summarizes those lessons, with particular attention to the experience of a select group of large U.S. firms that have undertaken welfare-to-work activities and that also have a significant corporate presence in Britain.   Because the United States and the United Kingdom have very different political and economic structures and traditions, as well as different welfare and workforce development systems, no attempt is made to transfer JFF’s findings about the U.S. experience into recommendations for the U.K. In fact, we recognize that no program or policy can simply be transported wholesale from one country to another. However, we believe that the lessons from the past few years of welfare-to-work practice in the United States are both instructive and relevant to the future development of the New Deal.   This paper is written with that goal: to characterize and summarize the experience of a select group of U.S. firms and their public, private, and non-profit partners as they implement new welfare-to-work efforts. Lessons we highlight for policy and practice are derived from the U.S. context. We leave it to our British colleagues to distill appropriate lessons for the U.K.            PART ONE       Introduction      What is Driving U.S.Welfare-to-Work Efforts?    The United States is in the early stages of an unprecedented social experiment: remaking welfare policy to emphasize employment. The vehicle is national legislation that limits the amount of time an individual can receive welfare benefits and sets work requirements for recipients. Enacted in 1996, this federal legislation accelerated a policy shift—from income support to a work-centered welfare system— that was already occurring in many states.   Employers are now central to welfare policy. This has come at a time when economic forces are also leading U.S. employers to embrace new strategies for finding qualified staff, including individuals from the welfare population. Economic and political realities are combining to push employers and welfare recipients toward one another, presenting both parties with new opportunities. At the same time, moving welfare recipients into work poses many challenges that are beyond the influence of individual employers, given the characteristics of this population, on the one hand, and available low-wage employment opportunities, on the other.    The Policy Context: New Legislation and System Reform    The 1996 Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act transformed welfare into a work-based system. The Act limits almost all welfare recipients to a lifetime maximum of five years of federally financed assistance, ending the previously assumed right of poor parents to federal welfare assistance. 1  The Act also requires most welfare recipients to find employment or participate in activities leading to work. It places a priority on job search and immediate entry into the labor market—this is known as a ""work-first"" approach—rather than longer-term education and training strategies.   Prior to the legislation, in the 1970s and 1980s, most publicly funded employment and training programs, including those targeted to welfare recipients, had focused on improving individuals’ skills and abilities—a human-capital approach. However, unless these programs had close connections with employers, participants rarely secured better-paid work than those who did not participate, especially over the long run. 2    Public support of welfare eroded during the 1980s. Calls mounted for increased personal responsibility and an end to income and other entitlements for the poor. Welfare policy continued to produce poor outcomes, and evidence mounted regarding the negative impact of long-term dependency. States responded by testing a range of work-based welfare strategies.   The 1996 federal legislation accelerated the shift to the work-first approach to welfare reform over a human-capital approach. Just as important, it gave the states responsibility for designing and administering public assistance. The federal government now provides states with block grants, with the amount based on each  state’s allocation of federal welfare spending between 1992 and 1995. States have broad discretion in: allocating block-grant funds to different purposes, establishing the respective roles of state and local governments, determining the stringency of work requirements, and deciding the amount and form of supportive services available to recipients. As the federal government’s role has diminished, considerable variation in strategy and emphasis has emerged among the 50 states.   As the U.S. welfare system becomes more work-centered, its connections to the public workforce-development system are becoming closer and more important. Meanwhile, that public system has significantly changed. In recent years, states have experimented with ways to improve the performance and accountability of a very decentralized employment and training system, which is delivered locally by public, private, and non-profit institutions that include: the Employment Service, community colleges, community-based organizations, employer intermediary organizations, and One Stop Centers created by local Workforce Investment Boards.   The 1998 Workforce Investment Act has reformed the public U.S. workforce-development system, based on the following principles:    A more market-driven system of resource allocation and accountability;   Greater emphasis on quality service and responsiveness to both employer needs and those of the labor force;   An increased role for public/private partnerships and for intermediary organizations at the local level, organized by industry or occupational cluster, that serve as brokers among employers, job seekers, and service providers; and   A priority on outcomes that include measures of retention and advancement, not just hiring.   Publicly funded at the federal level, the workforce system is governed at the local level by Workforce Investment Boards. The Chair and a majority of the members must be employers. The system is anchored in local labor markets by publicly funded One Stop Centers that can be managed by public, private, or non-profit entities. 3     Economic Factors: Rising Skill Demands, Tight Labor Markets    While public policy pushes welfare recipients toward work, tight labor markets and rising demand for better-skilled, entry-level workers have forced employers to become more aggressive in their search for new employees. Emerging recruitment strategies have included welfare recipients in their outreach.   Through most of the 1990s, the demand for entry-level employees in the United States has increased faster than the supply. 4  Unemployment is at its lowest point since the early 1970s. Employers are reporting difficulty filling entry-level and more skilled positions. During the last five years, the number of companies reporting shortages of skilled workers has doubled, reaching almost seven out of every ten employers. 5    Finding qualified, entry-level workers has emerged as a major problem. In focus groups in three U.S. cities, employers agreed that among new applicants for entry-level jobs, many appear to have ""significant motivational, attitudinal, and life skill problems [and that] very basic screening dramatically limited the pool of eligible employees."" 6    American companies also face serious and growing difficulties with high turnover among entry-level employees. A survey of 500 representative U.S. employers found that 26 percent of entry-level employees stayed on the job for six months or less; 23 percent remained seven months to one year; only 15 percent stayed over two years. 7    Employer concerns about the availability and cost of qualified staff are being fueled by long-term workplace trends. Firms increasingly expect those they employ to be able to learn new tasks and adapt to changing job requirements. 8  In many industries, more flexible production methods, rapid changes in production processes and technology, shorter prod-uct cycle times, and the search for custom and niche markets have raised employer expectations of front-line employee skills. In addition, changes in work organization and hiring and in promotion patterns have increased employer reliance on the external labor market for new hires, undercutting career ladders that once existed inside many firms.   Job requirements at the low-end of the labor market have risen. Employers more frequently expect basic numeracy and literacy, as well as basic computer    facility and ""soft skills,"" such as communication, teamwork, problem solving, reliability, and a positive attitude. 9  In an era of tight labor markets, rising employer expectations of entry-level recruits create serious and costly mismatches between job seekers and employers. In this environment, firms have become far more concerned about the costs of inefficient recruitment and hiring, high turnover, and poor productivity.   In response to these challenges, many employers are experimenting with new ways to find and keep qualified entry-level staff. The openness to new approaches to recruiting, hiring, and retaining workers is noteworthy—and leads naturally to exploration of the potential of hiring new workers from the welfare rolls.    Welfare Reform and Low-Wage Labor Markets    Individual employers can change—and many are changing—their hiring and employment practices to help welfare recipients find jobs and succeed at work. However, a work-centered welfare policy is of necessity linked to the dynamics of the low-wage, low-skill labor market. It is also linked to questions about whether enough jobs exist for all welfare recipients, whether recipients are qualified to fill available jobs, and how public policy can improve the functioning of that labor market.    The welfare population : In the United States, public assistance has traditionally targeted poor families with dependent children. Consequently, adult welfare recipients are overwhelmingly female and between the ages of 20 and 45. The typical welfare family is a single mother with two children. (Able-bodied adult men and women without children are not eligible for most welfare programs; those who have recently lost their job are eligible for short-term income assistance through the Unemployment Insurance system.) Welfare recipients are distributed fairly evenly across racial groups. The total welfare caseload (adults and their children) in mid-1998 was 8.4 million individuals. This is a 42 percent drop from its peak in 1994 of 14.4 million.   The welfare population is disadvantaged when it comes to skills and work-readiness. The Urban Institute reports that 42 percent have not completed high school. One-third of welfare recipients have never held a job for over six months. According to some estimates, without additional education or training, only about 10 percent of the welfare population has the skills to advance beyond entry-level work. 10  A sizable minority has physical, psychological, and other disabilities that make work difficult. As many as a third have children under the age of three. Long-term recipients are particularly ill-equipped to enter the workforce. Although around 70 percent of welfare recipients report recent work experience, a study of long-term recipients in Los Angeles found that less than 25 percent reported working during the prior two years. 11    While welfare recipients vary significantly in their ability to succeed at work, many are capable of moving from dependence to employment. Even before reform, over 40 percent of recipients typically left welfare in fewer than two years. Recent studies indicate that about half of the adults leaving welfare move directly into employment and others find jobs within a few months. 12  That said, as more welfare recipients move into employment, it is inevitable that those who remain will be less educated, less skilled, and plagued by other barriers to employment.    The low-wage labor market : If policy is to reduce welfare dependency through work, there will have to be enough jobs for this population—jobs that pay wages high enough for families to escape poverty. Urban Institute scholars estimate that the new welfare rules will push at least 140,000 recipients a year into the labor market between now and 2002. 13  (High-end projections are above 300,000 a year.) 14    The Urban Institute and others have concluded that absorbing these new workers will be possible in a growing economy. However, barriers such as limited access to information about job openings, inconvenient shifts, poor transportation to work, and inadequate child care pose problems for matching welfare recipients with those jobs.   The jobs available to these new workers are unlikely to pay wages sufficient to pull families out of poverty. Data from 11 state welfare offices show that the hourly wage for most jobs that welfare recipients hold is between $5.50 and $7.00 per hour. 15  A study in four states found that the average quarterly earnings for welfare-to-work participants were less than full-time, minimum-wage employment and substantially below the poverty standard for the typical welfare family, due to part-time work and short tenure in each position held. 16  This and similar studies     reflect earnings during a booming economy, among recipients likely to have relatively better education and skills. Economist Gary Burtless has concluded: 17    When employer demand is high and unemployment is low the great majority of recipients who diligently seek work will eventually find it. But because of the nature of the jobs they find, and the poor preparation they bring to those jobs, unskilled single parents will usually find jobs that pay low wages and do not last long.   The earnings of those moving from welfare to work remain near poverty levels. This is a challenge that individual employers alone cannot address. It is why many U.S. policy experts—and employers—see a necessary role for public policy in two areas: (1) helping welfare recipients escape dependency through employment; and (2) making it easier for the millions of low-wage workers who are not on welfare to achieve self-sustaining incomes through a combination of employment, tax, and income-support policies. To reduce both dependency and poverty, policy must help local, entry-level, labor markets become more efficient, but it will also have to address the serious problem of low earnings for individuals who succeed in obtaining those jobs.         PART TWO         General Trends in Employer  Welfare-to-Work Efforts      Based on the experience of U.S. firms during the first few years of large-scale welfare-to-work initiatives, we draw several general conclusions:    Many employers are hiring welfare recipients.   Participation is dominated by larger firms in a few industries.   There is potential for continued expansion of employer participation, particularly among smaller businesses.   Most employers are concerned primarily with recruitment and hiring, but strategies to improve retention are becoming more common, and they are receiving support from public policy.    Many employers are hiring welfare recipients.    Hiring of welfare recipients by U.S. firms has grown rapidly, more rapidly than many predicted even two years ago. By December 1997, after one year in operation, the national Welfare to Work Partnership had enlisted 3,200 companies, which reported hiring more than 135,000 welfare recipients that year. 18  A survey of these firms found that 79 percent expect to hire welfare recipients during 1999, for a total of 250,000 additional workers from the welfare population. 19  Membership in the Partnership continues to grow; in late 1998, it reached 7,500 firms, each of which had hired at least one welfare recipient.   Two recent surveys conclude that over half of U.S. firms report that they have hired from the welfare population. In a 1998 survey of 500 employers, selected to reflect the distribution of U.S. firms, 62 percent reported having hired welfare recipients. 20  In Michigan, over half of 900 employers in three metropolitan areas had hired someone who had been on welfare at some point, according to a 1997 survey. 21    In addition, far more welfare recipients who get jobs are staying employed. In 1992, the percentage of welfare recipients who left welfare and were employed a year later was only 19 percent. In 1997, that figure had climbed to 32 percent. 22  Improving this rate for former welfare recipients and for other low-skill workers would reduce employer costs and improve productivity.   This does not mean that all these firms made special efforts to recruit welfare recipients. Each year, millions of jobs are filled by people with no more skills than those of many welfare recipients. Employers hire these individuals through routine recruitment practices, such as classified ads and employee networks. And many welfare recipients land positions through their own efforts, without an employer’s participation in formal welfare-to-work programs.    Participation is dominated by larger firms in a few industries.    Larger firms in a few industries are the major employers of welfare recipients, according to a study of employment patterns in Florida, Maryland, Missouri, and      Oregon. 23  Mid-size and large firms (i.e., over 100 employees) employ 61 percent of working welfare recipients but constitute a far smaller proportion of all business establishments. As Table 1 indicates, large firms are far more likely to hire at least one welfare recipient, and the number of hires per firm, on average, rises with firm size. However, these data also demonstrate an important fact: while smaller firms have been less likely to hire welfare recipients, those that do so have a much higher ratio of welfare hires to total employees than do larger firms.   The service and retail sectors account for 60 percent of all employment but 80 percent of the jobs secured by welfare recipients. 24  Business services, eating and drinking places, and health services alone account  for 45 percent of employment for welfare recipients. 25    Efforts to diversify the industry sectors in which welfare recipients are employed appear to be effective. Firms reporting success in hiring welfare recipients can be found in manufacturing, construction, high technology, and transportation, in addition to the service and retail sectors.   In many larger firms that invest in strategies to promote retention and advancement of welfare hires, wages of those leaving welfare are higher than the average. For example, the large companies JFF interviewed reported paying their employees hired off welfare from a low of $6.25 per hour to a surprisingly high $11.75 an hour.       Table 1: Firm Size and Employment of Welfare Recipients 24      Firm Size   Percent of Firms Employing at Least One Welfare Recipient   Hires per Firm   Employees per Welfare Recipient Hired     Large (500+) 78.6 12.4 187.2   Mid-size (100–499) 29.1 3.1 72.2   Small (20–99) 9.2 1.7 29.3   Very small (1–19) 1.2 1.2 7.2        Table 2: Employment of Welfare Recipients by Industry Sector 26       Industry Sub-sector Percent of Total Hires    Business Services 19.0  Eating and Drinking Places 14.7  Health Services 10.8  Food Stores 5.5  Social Services 4.9  Hotels/Lodging 4.6  General Merchandise Stores 3.6  Educational Services 3.4  Miscellaneous Retail 2.5  Real Estate 2.4   TOTAL 71.4          There is potential for continued expansion of employer participation, particularly among small businesses.    Further expansion of employer hiring from the welfare population is both likely and feasible. Marketing the benefits of recruitment and hiring from the welfare population has been uneven, particularly among small and mid-sized firms. A survey of Michigan employers showed that while over half had hired someone currently or previously on welfare, under 17 percent had been contacted by a public or private placement agency explicitly trying to place welfare recipients. Significantly, two-thirds of firms contacted by such agencies reported hiring a referral. 28    If small businesses are to reach their potential to contribute to increased numbers of welfare recipients hired, new and different outreach methods will be needed that take advantage of the capacity and motivation of business associations to serve their members’ workforce needs. Such marketing strategies are emerging, particularly from business groups, such as local Chambers of Commerce and industry-specific trade associations, many of whose members are eager to expand their sources of qualified, entry-level hires. 29    This optimistic view is premised on continued economic growth. Of course, in a recession or even in a period of slower growth, some of the pressure for new hiring that many firms feel may weaken. For this reason, advocates of welfare-to-work efforts are striving to establish, expand, and institutionalize local initiatives now. They hope that if they succeed now, it will be easier—in a less-heated economic environment—to sustain strong partnerships and initiatives that seek to improve recruitment, matching, and productivity in entry-level work.    Most employers are concerned primarily with recruitment and hiring, but strategies to improve retention are becoming more common, and they are receiving support from public policy.    The primary emphasis of welfare-to-work programs to date, and of employer efforts, has been recruitment and hiring. However, employers are increasingly interested in ways to lower turnover and improve the retention of entry-level staff. Employers are introducing or expanding a range of policies that can influence how long welfare recipients—or any new entry-level employees—stay on the job. These include:    Better screening, pre-employment training, and matching of job seekers to job vacancies;   Improved orientation to the job, training on the job, and support during socialization to the job;   Training for front-line supervisors on working with new hires;   Mentoring, coaching, and other ongoing on-the-job support;   Help with child-care, transportation, and other personal barriers to work; and   Provision of health and other benefits to low-wage employees.   Employers increasingly see skill development (prior to hiring and on the job) as a means of reducing turnover and increasing employee loyalty, adaptability, and productivity. In recent years, U.S. firms have increased the percentage of employees they train. While better-educated employees still receive the lion’s share of firm-provided training, U.S. companies are now training more front-line employees. 30    Federal and state policies are beginning to encourage individual firms and local welfare-to-work partnerships to pursue strategies that focus on retention and advancement as well as hiring. Federal welfare-to-work legislation, enacted in 1997, provides communities with $3 billion in new resources for interventions that can improve the retention and advancement of hard-to-employ welfare recipients. Also, the 1998 Workforce Investment Act authorizes communities to invest more effectively in supporting training for current employees.        PART THREE         Welfare-to-Work Experience of Leading  U.S. Firms: Motivation and Benefits     On behalf of the New Deal Task Force, Jobs for the Future interviewed representatives of 19 American firms regarding their involvement in welfare-to-work initiatives. 31  (Case studies of the welfare-to-work efforts of 11 of these firms accompany this report.)   These are not typical U.S. firms. Rather, they are multinational companies that have demonstrated a commitment to hiring welfare recipients and taking leader-ship positions in designing, promoting, and implementing welfare-to-work efforts. They include firms in a range of sectors: business services, transportation, retail, high technology, and financial services. In addition, while they are headquartered in the United States, each has a significant business presence in the United Kingdom.   In these interviews, we addressed five key issues:    The firms’ motivation for their efforts;   The benefits that accrued;   The kinds of high-value activities they undertook;   How companies managed and implemented these activities; and   Lessons from their experiences.   The first two issues are summarized in this section. The others are covered in sections four and five of this report.     Business Motivation to Participate    Among the firms interviewed by JFF, meeting business needs was the primary reason for participating in welfare-to-work initiatives.    Business reasons : Entry-level labor needs spur many employers to seek expanded sources of qualified staff. Public subsidies for hiring, training, and/or support services can influence employer decisions to participate. Successful welfare-to-work programs have also reduced turnover markedly.   Companies reported two other motives for initiating welfare-to-work efforts, but they emphasized that business reasons would determine whether their efforts continued and grew:     Corporate citizenship : Many firms, particularly those with a local customer base, are committed to improving the quality of life in the community and earning local goodwill. Recognition as a good corporate citizen is frequently an important motive.   Peer influence : Firms are frequently influenced by others they see as competitors for leadership in an industry or community. Peer recruitment of corporate CEOs can play an important role in initial decisions to participate.        Employer Perceptions of Business Benefits    The companies we interviewed identified a number of business benefits that derived from their welfare-to- work involvement. Foremost are: access to an expanded labor pool, reduction in employee turnover, and increased employee loyalty. Employers also report reductions in hiring costs and better-than-average quality and performance levels among new recruits. Many firms report improved morale among existing employees in participating facilities, as well as greater attention to human resource issues that affect entry-level staff generally.    Access to an expanded labor pool : By partnering with community-based organizations with roots in particular neighborhoods or ethnic communities, companies have expanded the pool from which they recruit. This benefit is significant in tight labor markets and in firms or industries where workforce diversity is valued. Over half of the firms JFF interviewed stressed this benefit. ""As a responsible corporate citizen, United Parcel Service’s goal is to have a workforce that reflects the diversity of the communities we serve,"" says Ken Parks, Vice President of Corporate Human Resources. ""We have a continuing need to fill UPS jobs with dedicated people, and our approach has always been to partner with education, government, and non-profit organizations to locate, employ, and retain them.""   Many firms are partnering with temporary employ-ment companies to both gain access to new labor pools and reduce hiring risks. As Manpower CEO Mitchell Fromstein notes, ""Welfare-to-work makes good business sense because there are many jobs going unfilled and many candidates who want to work.""    Satisfaction with quality of hires : Among companies with welfare-to-work programs interviewed by JFF, every one reported that it is satisfied or very satisfied with individuals employed through these programs. This is consistent with a survey of members of the Welfare to Work Partnership, which found that 76 percent of responding firms value the welfare recipients they employ as good, productive workers. 32  Almost all the firms we interviewed expect to expand their welfare-to-work efforts in the coming year. Two noted that a rise in unemployment might change their plans, but no firm we interviewed expects to reduce its commitment in the coming year.    Reduction in turnover : Effective recruitment, screen-ing, and pre-employment preparation can help improve job matches and lower turnover. Salomon Smith Barney reports a 90 percent retention rate for welfare-to-work program participants it has hired over two years, compared to an average of 82 per-cent for all employees in equivalent positions. UPS reports a 30-day retention rate of 70 percent for welfare- to-work program participants, about 10 percent better than for all new entry-level employees. (One of the company’s most successful sites reports an 88 percent retention rate for new hires.) Marriott reports a 65 percent retention rate after one year for welfare recipients, compared to 50 percent for entry-level employees in general. According to Gerald Greenwald, Chairman and CEO of United Airlines, after one year, ""United employees hired from public assistance have one-half the attrition rate of similarly placed employees not from public assistance."" Just over half of Welfare to Work Partnership firms report that welfare hires show the same or higher retention rates when compared to employees hired through standard procedures. 33     Subsidies for training and hiring : Companies that hire welfare recipients are eligible for a range of state and federal tax credits and subsidies, including the federal Work Opportunity Tax Credit and the Welfare-to-Work Tax Credit. 34  These subsidies help offset employer investments and the risks they take of making poor job matches as they reach further down the employment queue for new hires.   For example, the federal government subsidized about two-thirds of the average $5,000 cost to the Marriott Corporation of its highly regarded Pathways to Independence training program. EDS has identified seven sources of federal and state resources that can offset training and support costs for welfare recipients. Federal job training funds have helped support the pre-employment training that has successfully prepared welfare recipients to work at Salomon Smith Barney (through Wildcat Services Corporation) and EDS (through the Advanced Technology Program). Among firms we interviewed that have programs in place, about three in four say they take advantage of public subsidies.    Spill-overs from welfare-to-work efforts to general human resource policies : Some companies report that developing welfare-to-work as a human resource priority strengthens the firm’s commitment    to existing staff in lower-level jobs. Relationships with local organizations that recruit and screen welfare recipients help companies identify other qualified employees. Mentoring and orientation programs designed for welfare recipients can be useful for all new employees. Strategies for addressing child care or other barriers to work can be easily extended beyond the welfare population.   United Airlines created a 60-day mentoring program targeted to its new welfare employees. It was not long, though, before the program was extended to all entry-level staff. As a United manager explained, ""Not only did we improve retention, but a survey of mentors found that they actually felt better about their jobs and the company."" EDS has expanded an effort to identify government training grants and subsidies for its welfare-to-work efforts into a corporate initiative to identify and make use of all available sources of public funding for human resource development.   Employers that make family-friendly policies into a competitive advantage tend to integrate welfare recipients relatively easily into their organizations. American Airlines, for example, has contracted with the private firm, Ceridian, to provide resource and referral services for entry-level employees, not just welfare-to-work hires. Many firms that hire welfare recipients, such as AT&T and Eli Lilly, have also been recognized for their progressive work-life policies.   To encourage loyalty and retention, a number of firms extend the company’s benefits package to all part-time staff. Xerox provides health insurance for all employees who work more than 20 hours a week, as well as flexible work schedules, child-care resources, and a dependent-care fund. This enables many welfare recipients, who frequently work part-time, to take advantage of company benefits. Of the firms interviewed by JFF, six are among those selected by  Working Mother  magazine as the 100 Best Companies for Mothers in 1998. 35     Concerns and challenges : Employers we interviewed were overwhelmingly positive about their experiences (many attributed this to their focus on strategies to hire qualified employees and promote their retention.) At the same time, they voiced several important concerns. They acknowledged that:    It is difficult to build collaborative relationships at the local level that are sufficiently responsive and customized to meet firm-specific needs. The employment and training system has historically served clients and their skill needs, rather than to seeing employers as an equally important customer.   Some of the regulatory and bureaucratic routines of local public agencies introduce an inflexibility that complicates and impedes business involvement.   Even in large firms, the time commitment required to design and implement new programs can be significant, and local managers may not be able to participate to the extent they would like.   It takes careful consideration to find the most appropriate way to balance services to new hires from the welfare system with those provided to all entry-level employees. At times, different services seem necessary, but differential treatment can have repercussions with the existing workforce.   Organizations with the capacity to provide effective recruitment, screening, training, and support services are crucial to successful welfare- to work programs. Without them, few firms believe that hiring welfare recipients would produce good outcomes.

The employers we surveyed understand that successful welfare-to-work efforts require more than a simple exchange of public subsidies for targeted hiring by private-sector firms. We found impressive examples, particularly in the areas of improved pre-employment preparation and retention strategies, of corporate commitments to new approaches and a willingness to work closely with public-sector and community-based institutions.   In all these firms, activities are fairly new, localized in particular facilities and communities, and still evolving; none would claim that their efforts adequately or comprehensively address access to work, job retention, and career advancement. Taken together, however, these efforts illustrate some of the most promising strategies for employers who want to improve their entry-level labor force while helping to address a critical societal problem.   Large, engaged firms tend to be involved in two kinds of welfare-to-work efforts in the United States:   Activities that increase their access to quality employees and help the firm retain and advance those employees; and   Collaborative, inter-firm activities that share best practice, increase overall business involvement, and influence policy.    1. Activities that Increase Access, Retention, and Advancement    The companies we interviewed have developed innovative approaches to addressing their needs for quality, entry-level and better skilled workers. These include strategies to improve access, retention, and advancement. All of the most innovative— and effective—approaches involve collaborative partnerships with non-profit, public, and private organizations that supply welfare-to-work services to individuals and employers. Business-oriented intermediary organizations frequently serve as brokers for arranging these services.    Expanding Access to Employment    Companies are eager to find new sources of qualified employees—employees with good basic skills, motivation, and discipline. Increasingly, they are tapping expanded labor pools—from different neighborhoods, diverse countries of origin and ethnic/racial backgrounds. Targeted recruitment, outreach, and screening assistance from organizations that know and understand welfare and other low-skill, disadvantaged populations can be very valuable to employers. For employers to stay engaged, programs must also assure that identified job candidates are ready to work hard and be productive. For welfare recipients, who tend to be less-job ready than the population as a whole, this challenge cannot be minimized.      Several strategies for improving the quality of the job match stand out from our interviews, all of which are consistent with other research. These are:    Recruitment and screening;   Pre-employment preparation; and   Short-term training targeted to the firm or industry.    Recruitment and screening : Many companies are turning to publicly sponsored community-based organizations for assistance in recruiting staff and screening them for overall job readiness and for their ""fit"" with particular labor needs. All the firms interviewed by JFF that had welfare-to-work programs developed partnerships with local organizations to improve job matching.    Monsanto has organized networking sessions so its human resources staff can get to know community-based sources of potential employees. Marriott contracts with public agencies and community-based organizations to recruit for its Pathways to Independence training program, and it restricts participation to referrals from those organizations. Chevron’s service-station territory managers contract with local placement agencies to recruit and screen applicants. American Airlines partners extensively with community-based non-profit organizations rather than building in-house programs, because the company does not consider preparing welfare recipients for employment to be a core competency.   Temporary help firms and other for-profit placement companies can also play an important role in improved recruitment. Manpower has developed assessment tools that help it determine whether applicants are qualified for various office or light industrial positions. To facilitate its welfare-to-work efforts, Manpower has adopted a strategy of locating offices in inner cities to tap the labor pool there. Many firms routinely use staffing firms to help them recruit from new sources. Anheuser-Busch has formed a partnership with the staffing firm Interim for help with recruitment and screening of its entry-level workers. Hewlett-Packard’s San Francisco office houses a dedicated Manpower staff member to recruit and screen for entry-level positions. Through this relationship Hewlett-Packard has met its initial goal of placing 30 welfare recipients in temporary positions and moving several into permanent jobs.   Employee screening can help firms take advantage of tax benefits available for hiring welfare recipients. One aspect of screening can be welfare recipients’ eligibility for tax credits available to firms. Some companies, including fast-food giants, Pizza Hut and McDonald’s, contract with outside firms to process applications for these tax credits.    Pre-employment preparation : Improved screening is often followed by pre-employment preparation that increases the ability of welfare recipients or other entry-level workers to meet firms’ job qualifications. Many welfare recipients need to improve both basic skills and communications and ""soft skills"" if they are to succeed at work. In the current environment, which stresses ""work first"" and discourages long-term education and training, short ""orientation to work"" courses are becoming more common.   One influential model is the three-week ""boot camp"" created by STRIVE, Inc., a non-profit organization based in New York that works with hard-to-employ young adults, including welfare recipients. Graduates have demonstrated the discipline needed to keep a job; the program weeds out those who are not ready. Another model is Sprint’s six-week, soft-skills training program, which is held at a community college and followed by fourteen days of in-house training. Local social service agencies, education and training service providers, and community colleges provide pre-employment training to FedEx job candidates as part of the firm’s involvement with Tennessee’s Families First program. Xerox Business Services values highly the pre-employment training in work attitudes, communication, and XBS expectations that local organizations provide to prospective employers.    Assistance with non-work barriers to employment : Companies believe it is essential to provide assistance to welfare recipients in overcoming the many serious barriers to initial employment, such as lack of child care and transportation. Although the overwhelming majority of companies we interviewed assist welfare recipients with these needs, they tend to see these services as properly provided by publicly funded programs and agencies.    Pre-employment job-specific training : Companies are particularly interested in working with education and training partners to design and deliver customized pre-employment preparation that relates directly to a firm’s job openings. Some companies that have worked closely with education and training    institutions have found that jointly designed programs can successfully prepare potential employees for a specific workplace culture and work assignment. Four out of five firms with ongoing programs, interviewed by JFF, emphasized the value of the job-specific pre-employment training welfare recipients received.   Short-term training programs that introduce potential hires to job-specific skills related to a firm or industry are gaining favor. Salomon Smith Barney’s (SSB) partnership with Wildcat Service Corporation, a community-based training provider in New York City, is one example. Wildcat and SSB designed the training together, and each runs components of it. The program includes 16 weeks of training and a 16- week internship at SSB. The firm hires those who complete the program successfully as permanent employees.   The publicly subsidized Advanced Technology Partnership run by EDS prepares welfare recipients to work as EDS system administrator associates, business analysts and help-desk staff. EDS has found that closely linking pre-employment training to the firm’s needs yields new hires from the welfare rolls who are more settled in their work environment, more committed to their work, and quicker to grasp new concepts. An important element of training is exposure to real workplaces: potential hires learn by doing, and their preparation is grounded in the realities of the work they will perform.    Improving Job Retention    The companies we interviewed understand that if new hires are to remain employed beyond a few weeks, long enough to make a positive contribution to the enterprises, serious attention must be paid to supporting them through the series of transitions that returning to work requires. While this is generally true for hires in entry-level positions, where wages are low and hours are often inconvenient, it is particularly true for welfare recipients returning to the job market.   The companies we interviewed are experimenting with a range of strategies for increasing employee retention. These include:    Improved orientation and mentoring by company staff;   Supervisory training in interpersonal and managerial skills;   Post-placement support to address personal barriers; and   Access to company benefits.    Orientation and mentoring : To ease the transition to a new job, some employers are revising the orientation they give new hires to make it less perfunctory and more supportive. Among firms with programs in place and interviewed by JFF, more than half highlighted their welfare-to-work program’s orientation and mentoring components. UPS has redesigned its orientation program. A number of firms have found that establishing a kind of ""buddy system"" that pairs new hires with supervisors or experienced workers who can serve as mentors can help new hires adjust more quickly and effectively. At Xerox Business Services, the ""Friends at Work"" program engages existing staff to help support new entry-level employees as they make the transition to work. Pizza Hut favors job coaching by outside partners to support new hires as they learn the job and interact with supervisors and co-workers, a model that is common among organizations that place individuals with disabilities. These strategies can be implemented at relatively low-cost, with internal staff and resources.     Supervisory training : Improved training for supervisors of entry-level staff is an efficient way to help new hires succeed. These employees are the interface between new hires and the company, yet few have any significant training in either interpersonal or managerial skills. Supervisory staff are particularly ill-prepared for the aspects of their job that approach ""social work."" However, few of the firms we interviewed provide supervisor training, a finding that is consistent with other research on employer activities.   Innovative private- and public-sector efforts to train supervisors exist. Ceridian Performance Partners, a for-profit unit of Ceridian Corporation, provides their supervisors with a two- to four-hour training course and ongoing telephone access to support from experienced managers. Ceridian’s Partners in Progress program, which helps firms hire, train, and retain qualified welfare recipients, also provides training to supervisors.   At least 20 companies have received training for supervisors and entry-level employees from the Denver Workforce Initiative, a demonstration program designed to improve the access of low-income    young adults, and in particular men aged 18 to 35, to family-supporting employment. Its ""Managing to Work It Out"" training curriculum prepares supervisors to teach new hires to anticipate and solve certain workplace problems, in order to increase retention rates. 36     Post-placement support : Companies looking to help new hires address personal barriers to employment, including psychological adjustment to employment and logistical issues such as child care and transportation, frequently partner with outside organiza-tions to provide welfare recipients (or any new hire) with necessary long-term support. In general, companies we interviewed see the need for this kind of support, are eager to have outside agencies provide it, and would like to see public funds support it. Among the firms with ongoing programs which JFF interviewed, about two-thirds offered some form of post-placement support.   STRIVE case workers maintain regular contact with the individuals they place throughout the first year of employment, helping them to deal with conflicts with supervisors, family or personal problems that might lead them to quit. Salomon Smith Barney contracts with Wildcat for similar post-placement support. Marriott worked with a contractor to set up and manage an extensive Employee Assistance phone line service, which can respond to employees in 150 languages. This service has been adopted by other employers including Allied Signal, American Airlines, and some McDonald’s. UPS developed an innovative transportation program to help welfare recipients in Camden, New Jersey, get to night-shift jobs at the company’s Philadelphia facility, ten miles away—a program that the local public bus line now operates without a subsidy.    Access to company benefits : About one-third of the firms we interviewed, including UPS, United Airlines, and Xerox Business Services (XBS), provide part-time employees with access to full company benefits. This is a strategy to encourage loyalty and improve retention. UPS, XBS, and some other firms also see access to on-the-job skill training, particularly in new technologies, as a benefit that workers value, not simply an unavoidable cost.    Promoting Advancement    If retention is more challenging than hiring, providing advancement opportunities for welfare recipients is even more daunting. The public-sector employment and training system is only beginning to make available resources for training low-wage individuals who are working. Welfare recipients frequently lack technical and other job-specific skills required to advance from entry-level work to jobs that pay family- supporting wages. And many firms have moved away from internal career ladders that enabled lower-level employees to advance within the company.   Among the firms which JFF interviewed, there are notable examples of career-advancement efforts targeted to welfare recipients and other low-wage workers. The companies cite the value of skill upgrading to productivity and the effect that skills expansion and promotion opportunities have on retention and commitment. These businesses also recognize that minimum-wage jobs or part-time work at low wages will not lift families out of poverty and frequently weaken employee resolve to remain on the job.   Employer strategies for promoting career advancement include:    Help in assessing career options and planning next steps : For example, all welfare recipients and other entry-level account associates at XBS participate in a competency- based development system that includes self-assessment of the skills they need to move from their current assignments to future ones of their choice.    Access to education and training on the job or with employer subsidy : Additional skill development is typically critical to any employee’s ability to advance into more complex job assignments. XBS makes available on-the-job training, computer-based training on-site, and tuition assistance for courses taken at traditional educational institutions. At UPS, extensive internal training programs are available, and pay is linked to skill development. UPS partners with a number of community colleges to deliver courses on-site at workplaces, and it reimburses successful completers for 50 percent of the tuition. Among firms with welfare-to-work programs interviewed by JFF, over half highlight the internal training opportunities  they provide; about a third assist welfare recipients with career advancement planning.        Employer efforts can only go so far in promoting advancement for individual staff members. Consortia of firms within the same industry sector or cluster of occupations can spread the cost and increase overall employer demand for skill development for front-line employees. 37  Similarly, community- based brokering organizations can help individuals identify career pathways to better opportunities within the same or a different industry or occupation sector. ""Community career ladder"" initiatives of this type are underway in a number of communities, although little public money is available for them. 38     Organizing and Managing Firm Activities    Welfare-to-work programs must meet the needs of specific business units and local facilities if they are to survive and mature. At the corporate level, staff often play important roles in providing local offices and facilities with guidance, tools and materials, examples from other parts of the company, and other ways of simplifying local start-up and implementation.   In the companies we interviewed, the level of oversight from corporate headquarters varies with the extent to which the firm’s operations and management are centralized. For example, XBS decentralizes decision-making to local managers, and this principle guides its company-wide welfare-to-work efforts. Because it is largely dependent upon franchisees, McDonald’s creates standardized training curricula for interested franchises, but it cannot compel local franchises to participate in welfare-to-work efforts. EDS is about to centralize its welfare-to-work planning, goal-setting, and reporting in its newly created office of the Executive Vice President of Human Resources Worldwide.   The extent to which a corporate headquarters sets quantifiable participation goals and requires local offices to report on progress also varies. American Airlines has no specific goals or monitoring. EDS and Marriott require regular reports from managers. Pizza Hut and Marriott make participation by local establishments voluntary but structure their programs to provide strong business incentives to participate. At Pizza Hut, Work Opportunity Tax Credits go directly to the profit line on a store’s income statements, so hiring welfare recipients affects the store manager’s performance measures and year-end bonuses.   Corporate staff roles frequently include:    Identifying the business objectives for welfare-to-work and priority strategies for achieving them;   Developing program models or identifying successful local initiatives to disseminate to local offices;   Disseminating directives regarding corporate participation goals, if they exist; and   Collecting and disseminating learning from local experience for use in the design of future initiatives.   Local managers typically are responsible for deciding when and how to participate in local programs and partnerships, championing the effort within the facility, and ensuring the quality and value of the effort.     2. Collaborative, Inter-Firm Activities that Promote Business Engagement    In addition to activities that firms pursue to address their particular business or public-relations needs, many companies also engage in efforts to organize business’s involvement and voice on issues of welfare policy and practice. The firms JFF interviewed are engaged in three types of inter-firm activities:    Involvement in governance and program planning at the local level;   Participation in networks of businesses in the same industry or region; and   Membership in national organizations and networks.    Local Governance Structures and Program Planning    Employers across the country are playing an increasingly important role in the governance and planning of local, public, workforce investments. Recent passage of the Workforce Investment Act formalizes private- sector involvement: local Workforce Investment Boards, which bring together representatives of business, labor, and government to jointly govern the use of federal workforce development funds, must have a majority of members representing businesses and be chaired by a business representative. Among firms JFF interviewed that are involved in welfare-to- work efforts, over a third participate in local governance boards.      Large firms frequently contribute staff time and resources to help coordinate and advance business involvement in welfare-to-work efforts. For instance, United Airlines has loaned an executive to run the Chicagoland Business Partnership. Employers are well-positioned to provide detailed labor market information, advocate for quality and continuous improvement in placement and training programs, and advise the public system on how to make services simpler and more attractive to employers.    Business Networks    Increasingly, firms are finding it advantageous to collaborate with other firms in their region or industry. Among firms JFF interviewed that have ongoing welfare-to-work programs, a majority participate in such collaborative activities. These collaborations can be very helpful to smaller firms whose staff and resources are limited. For example:    Ford is collaborating with General Motors and other automobile industry firms in the Detroit area to establish widely recognized, entry-level, skill standards;   FedEx is organizing a consortium to improve transportation to firms at the Dallas/Fort Worth Airport;   UPS facilities coordinate with small, local firms so that part-time employees can more easily balance the demands of two part-time jobs;   Ford Motor Company has made natural-gas-powered vehicles available to transport welfare recipients to jobs in the Detroit area;   American Airlines and McDonald’s have developed and disseminated curricula for preparing employees for an industry, not just a single company.    National Networks and Organizations    At the national level, membership in the Welfare to Work Partnership, a government-sponsored network, is one vehicle for sharing best practice and articulating employer concerns and interests in national policy debates. UPS has loaned a seasoned executive, who ran the firm’s welfare-to-work program in Philadelphia, to the Partnership. Every firm with an ongoing welfare-to-work program that JFF interviewed is a member of the Partnership, as are three out of four companies we interviewed that are just starting programs.   Other national organizations, such as the National Alliance of Business, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Conference Board, and Business for Social Responsibility, also provide important venues for sharing effective practice in welfare-to-work and other human resource policies. Companies pick up promising ideas and strategies through these organizations and the opportunities they provide for inter-firm collaboration and direct technical assistance. Some of this interaction is informal. For example, EDS and Xerox consulted with other multinational firms before beginning their welfare-to-work efforts. An employee-assistance hot line developed by Marriott has been adopted by other Partnership members. Government-funded agencies that are part of the reformed workforce development system also help facilitate inter-firm communication and learning.        PART FIVE          Lessons and Implications from  U.S. Experience      Although U.S. experience with a work-centered welfare system is modest and the long-term results unknown, the early experience of participating companies and individuals has yielded practical lessons for employers. It has also provided lessons for their partners in designing and implementing local welfare-to-work programs and for the U.S. policymakers who are reshaping the welfare system and its public institutions.   These lessons fall into two categories:    Implementation lessons for employers; and  Lessons for the public system that can make a work-centered and employer-responsive welfare system more effective for employers and welfare recipients.    Implementation Lessons for Employers    There is no ""cookie cutter"" model for an effective welfare-to-work program—and no implementation manual to pull off the shelf. However, from our research and from the experience of firms we interviewed, important lessons emerge about program design and implementation.    Successful initiatives require strategic planning and high-level commitment.    Companies find that it is important to develop clear business objectives and evaluate available resources, priority needs, and the appropriate division of labor between in-house staff and outside organizations (see box on page 21 for a recom-mended planning process). CEOs and senior management must signal the effort’s importance to corporate and local office staff.    Local partnerships can simplify and strengthen employer efforts to hire and retain welfare recipients.    Successful welfare-to-work efforts invariably involve collaborative partnerships. Employers partner with local welfare agencies charged with moving recipients into employment. They also partner through the public workforce development system with public- and private-sector organizations that can help them improve their performance in hiring, retaining, and increasing productivity from new hires off the welfare rolls. Firms want to ""buy"" expertise in provision of services that are not part of their core competencies. They also want to increase the efficiency and reduce the costs and risks of their efforts to improve hiring and job retention. Intermediary organizations that are well-grounded in labor market realities in particular industries and occupations or that have particular skills in brokering among employers, job seekers, and service providers are becoming increasingly important partners in local workforce service delivery.      From the company perspective, valuable partnerships are those that provide its staff with excellent customer service, understand employers’ specific labor needs, and are committed to continuous improvement in meeting employer standards. They are based on mutual commitment to meet clearly defined business objectives.   U.S. firms have found it particularly helpful to enlist partners who specialize in services, such as:    Temporary help firms and community-based organizations for recruitment and assessment of potential new hires;   Regional bus lines or private firms for help with transportation to and from work-places;   Community colleges and private education and training providers for skill development; and   A range of organizations that have the capacity to collaborate on designing and delivering effective work-based training programs and post-placement support services.   Companies can encourage and strengthen these partnerships through various means. Large firms can set performance standards for programs and offer assistance to partners in achieving them.   Xerox Business Services, for example, sets standards for out-comes, evaluates the extent to which its partners meet them, and provides informal advice on improvements. UPS and Bristol- Meyers Squibb fund innovative service providers through their corporate philanthropic activities. McDonald’s provides customer-service training for the staff of its partner organizations.      Recommendations for Planning a Welfare-to-Work Program 39    Based on the experience of its member firms, the Welfare to Work Partnership recommends the following planning process:    Find or assign a company champion : A CEO or other high-level decision-maker who cares can make a big difference in a company’s level of commitment and its resolve to sustain or expand initial efforts.    Assess the company’s internal situation : A firm must assess its staff and financial resources, labor needs, personnel practices, company culture, and level of commitment to decide whether to hire welfare recipients, how many to hire, and what services to make available.    Review recruiting and hiring options : A company must decide whether it will create a program in-house, contract with a local intermediary organization that brokers recruitment, training, and placement, or hire directly through the public sector.    Understand the welfare population : The welfare population is diverse, with different levels of skills, work experience, and readiness to meet employer standards. Employers need to communicate to potential employees the quality standards they expect from new hires.    Develop a strategic plan for hiring : Firms that develop successful programs identify their workforce needs clearly, communicate them to partners, identify support services for new hires that will increase their likelihood of retention, and develop close working relationships and communication with organizations that recruit, assess, place, train, and support welfare recipients who enter the labor force.      Productivity and employer satisfaction with welfare- to-work can be increased by greater emphasis on post-placement support services and activities that reduce turnover and increase job retention.    Too often, employers appear to perceive welfare-to-work participation as a single transaction: hire a person from the welfare system and get a public subsidy. This view is likely to disappoint all concerned. While there is no doubt that companies welcome public subsidies, many employers regard this as a weak incentive. Focus groups with employers repeatedly conclude that companies would rather public funds be used to help prepare potential employees for on-the-job success than to subsidize employers for hiring ill-prepared staff who are likely to quit or be fired soon after hiring. 40    Moreover, employers are most eager to hire qualified individuals who will stay with the firm for a reasonable length of time and be productive. For this reason, employers who are looking for long-term value rather than short-term wage savings pursue strategies that promote job retention. As noted above, primary among these strategies are: improved orientation and mentoring; supervisory training; supports to help employees address personal barriers; and benefits that can substitute for income, offer hope for advancement, and encourage workers to stay with the firm.       Integrate welfare-to-work efforts into a firm’s overall workforce practices .   Many companies find that effective strategies to improve retention of welfare recipients are worth extending to entry-level workers generally. The non-welfare population that works at entry-level jobs, particularly adult men or working adult women not receiving public assistance, shares with the smaller welfare population many barriers to economic self-sufficiency: poor education and family, child-care, and transportation problems. Innovative services developed for, and successful with, welfare recipients can be expanded and can be made more cost effective at a larger scale. In addition, on a practical level, it is difficult to provide welfare-to-work participants with services and benefits not available to other employees in similar jobs.    Policy Lessons for the Public System    For welfare-to-work to expand significantly and become sustainable in more firms, large and small, changes in U.S. governmental policies and practice will be needed. Through our interviews and other research, we identified five policy priorities that can help promote continued progress toward a welfare and workforce development system that meets both employer and individual needs. These are:    Change policies and funding priorities to better balance ""work first"" with effective skill development.    The basis of current welfare policy is ""work first""— job search and rapid labor market attachment above all else. Federal legislation and state implementation reward quick placement and make it far more difficult for welfare recipients to qualify for publicly funded pre-employment education and training. While ""work first"" has enabled many work-ready recipients to move more quickly into the labor force and has forced education and training providers to be more aware of and responsive to employer demands, there are indications that this strategy must be balanced and tempered.   From an employer’s perspective, ""work first"" can be impractical and problematic. A large segment of the welfare population is not qualified for most entry-level jobs. Forcing ill-prepared recruits upon employers may alienate companies.   From the job seeker’s perspective, constraints on access to education and training can cut off routes into better-paying jobs and career advancement. And being pressured to apply for jobs that are beyond a person’s skill levels can further undercut self-esteem and motivation to work.   Public policy must continue its aggressive encouragement of work. However, as the National Governors’ Association has concluded, ""Getting a job, keeping it, and using it to develop new skills are important steps along the road to economic security . . . [but] for many welfare recipients, work will not provide a path out of poverty unless they can access education and skill training that will enable them to advance into better jobs."" 41  In a society where post-secondary education and credentials are the primary route to decent wages, a more flexible, balanced approach to welfare policy is needed that combines job search, education, job training, and work in ways that help individuals build marketable skills quickly and move up to better jobs over time. 42    Two important areas for greater public support are: 1) customized pre-employment skill development programs linked to offers of jobs upon successful completion (e.g., EDS’s Advanced Technology Program and Salomon Smith Barney’s relationship with Wildcat Services Corporation); and 2) skill development strategies for individuals while they are employed (including through courses and credentials granted in-house or at local educational institutions).    Increase public investment in activities that support work and career advancement.    A work-centered welfare system cannot succeed without broad-based participation and support of business. This approach places new responsibilities on employers to help solve serious social problems. Public policy must not demand too much of employers. Private sector responsibility should be coupled with public sector support that lessens the risks and costs that companies incur in playing a more active role in reducing welfare dependency.   In the United States today, significant public resource are available. One source is the federal government’s allocation of $3 billion for new welfare- to-work programs that promote retention and advancement. These funds are helping pay for such    activities as pre-employment services, on-the-job training and supports, transportation and child-care services, substance abuse counseling, and other ways to ""make work work"" for particularly hard-to-employ welfare recipients.   Another source is the substantial savings states have realized as federal welfare block grants they receive have remained stable while their welfare caseloads, and payment obligations have shrunk. However, it appears that only a few states have chosen to expend these funds, which they control, on additional services and supports for welfare recipients and their families. Many states have chosen to hold them in reserve, spend more on politically popular programs unrelated to work or welfare, or return some of the money to taxpayers through tax cuts.   The temptation to reduce public welfare spending should be resisted. If anything, addressing serious barriers to employment will cost more money in the short-run, not less. Yet without adequately addressing the supports and services that can help prepare all but the most poorly equipped welfare recipients for work, the progress being made in moving people from dependence into employment will likely stall. Companies will collaborate with public authorities on welfare reform initiatives only if they feel they are having their needs met and are not being asked to take on unreasonable risks and costs. Companies will only hire and retain people who have motivation and basic skills. As the most-employable welfare recipients leave the rolls, leaving those who need more skills and more help, significant public investment will be needed to prepare this population for keeping and succeeding in private-sector jobs.    Create and expand income supplements for low-wage workers and their families.    Low-wage work does not lift families out of poverty. The U.S. government has recognized this through the gradual expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit, which supplements wages of the working poor and thus rewards them for work by raising their effective earnings through the tax system. While use of this tax credit is expanding, the government has made little concerted outreach effort to employers or community-based organizations to help those who are eligible learn about and take advantage of the credit. If the public goal is to reduce poverty, not just public-assistance payments, expansion of the tax credit and other strategies to raise earnings through government policy will be needed. Such efforts are in keeping with an approach to welfare reform that focuses on working poor families in general, rather than solely on public assistance recipients.    Remake the culture of the public-sector welfare system.    Welfare reform has changed the role of government from simply an administrator of income mainte-nance to a partner in efforts to move people into work and keep them employed. The system is driven now by employment-related goals—and by public payments that are increasingly based upon meeting performance benchmarks for placement, retention, and wage rates. The welfare and workforce development systems are becoming more inter-dependent.   This shift will require significant change in state and local agencies and the way they do business. They will need help in building their capacity to serve employers, partner with multiple non-governmental agencies, and become more entrepreneurial. Public agencies also need help moving toward accountability systems based on accurate information about outcomes for individuals and families, which requires investment in the design and implementation of better management information systems. Private-sector involvement in governing the local welfare and public- employment system can help increase the capacity of public agencies. To accomplish this remaking of the U.S. welfare system, states and the federal government will need to provide adequate resources for professional development of public-sector employees, as well as resources for organizing greater private-sector involvement and assistance to the public system.    Provide public support to build the capacity of local intermediary organizations.    Successful local welfare-to-work efforts combine the strengths of the public, business and non-profit sectors. Public funding should promote the engagement of employers and their partners in both local governance structures and in a one-stop service-delivery system that provides a single point of contact for individuals and employers.        NOTES           1  Not all welfare recipients are expected to be able to work. Twenty percent can be exempted for reasons of hardship. Under federal legislation, states must meet a requirement of 50 percent of recipients in jobs or work-related activities by 2002.     2  Julie Strawn. 1998.

Decisions about entities that operate local One Stops are left to the discretion of local Workforce Investment Boards, which are required by the new law for all local labor markets. The boards, which must have majority representation of local businesses, oversee workforce development within the labor market, set policy, and establish performance standards and accountability measures. To insure maximum independence, the boards do not deliver services.    4  Since 1992, labor demand has risen 16 percent, while labor supply has risen only 7 percent. National Alliance of Business.

Information on companies was gathered from our own research, with additional assistance from the Boston College Center for Corporate Community Relations, Business for Social Responsibility, the National Alliance of Business, and the Welfare to Work Partnership. Nineteen firms agreed to in-depth interviews, which lasted 40 to 90 minutes. By design, these firms are atypical U.S. companies. They are large, multinational businesses. They have already chosen to be active in welfare-to-work activities at the level of firm practice and, frequently, national policy. These are engaged employers with sizable corporate human resources staff. We chose them for this study precisely so that the experience of leading firms could be examined. It would be misguided to draw conclusions from these interviews alone about typical or overall employer partici-pation in welfare-to-work. For this reason, we distinguish in the report between general trends and the experience of this sample of firms.    32  Wirthlin Worldwide. 1998. ""Survey of the Partnership’s Business Partners.""

Introduction The soccer ball industry of Pakistan, principally concentrated in the city of Sialkot, has been under scrutiny in recent years for employing child workers. Manyreports describe children stitching soccer balls in small rural workshops or in homes.  1  The widespread coverage of children stitching soccer balls galvanized consumers,labor and religious groups and government officials to call for a stop to this practice.In June 1996, the U. S. Secretary of Labor and members of Congress helped launch the  FoulBall  campaign to ensure that soccer balls used by American children arestitched by adults and not children.  2 The public attention led U. S. importers to enter into an agreement with Paki-stani manufacturers, the ILO and UNICEF to stop using child labor.  3  More recently, public attention has focused on the use of child labor in India's soccer ball industry, leading to negotiations between Indian soccer ball manufacturers, exporters, NGOsand international organizations to develop a code of conduct prohibiting child labor. In addition, individual companies have taken steps to assure consumers thattheir products are not made by children. They have done so by revising their production process or creating child labor labels. For instance, Reebok has centralized all its soccer ball production in a new factory.  4  Nike also changed its manufacturing process in Pakistan by creating new stitching centers in order to better ensure chil-dren are not stitching Nike soccer balls.  5  Some U. S. importers, including Reebok and Baden Sports, have begun to label their soccer balls as produced without child labor. These labeling programs are the primary focus of this chapter. Information about labeling programs has been obtained from the companies using labels, from surveys of U. S. importers and retailers, and from field visits to India, Pakistan and China by Department of Labor officials. Section B of this chapter presents an overview of the industry and the market for soccer balls in the United States. Section C examines the role children play in the production of soccer balls around the world. Section D describes various labelingprograms. Finally, Section E reports responses of U. S.- based soccer ball importers and retailers to the child labor issue, based on a voluntary survey.  B. Industry Profile Soccer, or ""football"" as it is known in most countries, is the world's mostpopular sport.  6  Although soccer gained popularity slowly in the United States, enthusiasm for the sport has grown in recent years.  7  In 1980, there were fewer than 1 million youths registered to play soccer; by 1996 this figure had tripled to over 3 million.  8 Growth in the volume of U. S. imports of soccer balls reflects this trend. AsTable IV- 1 illustrates, in 1989, U. S. soccer ball imports were valued at $15.7 million;by 1996, the comparable figure was $34.2 million, a growth of 118 percent.  9  FigureIV- 1 lists U. S. imports of soccer balls by country and value. Some 71 percent ofthose imports came from Pakistan, 19 percent from China, 5 percent from Indonesia,1 percent from India, and the remaining 4 percent from other countries.  10  Soccerballs are not produced in the United States.  11 Soccer balls generally consist of a number of synthetic leather panels stitchedtogether in geometric patterns on the outside with an inflatable bladder inside.  12   Panels in high quality balls are hand- stitched for durability.  13  Hand- stitching these panels together is a very labor- intensive process and is where children have been found working. Figure IV- 2 illustrates the chain of production within the international soccerball industry. This schematic also highlights relationships among the various entitiesresponsible for production. The key actors can be described as follows:  14     Retailers typically sell a wide range of sporting goods, including soccer balls. They are not normally direct soccer balls importers; instead, they order the balls from brand name merchandisers. Retail outlets selling soccer balls include nationwide sporting goods or soccer specialty stores, independent sporting goods stores, department stores, mass-merchandisers, and toy stores.   Importers/ Design and Marketing Firms/ Merchandisers develop ball specifications and marketing strategies to promote their particular brand. They do not own the factories producing the balls, but contract with foreign manufacturers who produce the made-to-order balls. Some merchandisers have their own retail outlets for the sale of soccer balls and other products.   Contractors are foreign manufacturers who produce soccer balls for U. S. importers/ design and marketing firms/ merchandisers. They may produce soccer balls for several different buyers. Contractors usually do some of the production in their factories (e. g., cutting and packing), and outsource stitching and other tasks to subcontractors.

As of 1996, Korea no longer produced soccer balls for the U.S. market.   Source: Official Statistics of the U.S. Department of Commerce          Subcontractors are individuals who function as middlemen between the  contractor and village   stitchers.  15  Subcontractors typically deliver soccer ball kits to workers in surrounding villages. After the stitching is completed, the subcontractor pays the stitchers and returns the completed kits to the contractor.   Stitchers sew together the panels of a soccer ball and glue in the inflatable bladder. They are employed by subcontractors, typically on a piece rate basis, and may work in a stitching center, small village workshop, or in homes.      C. Child Labor in the Soccer Ball Industry The use of child labor in the production of soccer balls has been documentedprimarily in Pakistan and India.  16  Soccer balls are also made in China and Indonesia, but there are no known allegations of child labor in the soccer ball industries of these countries. The manufacture of soccer balls is controlled from the city but decentralized to homes and small workshops in surrounding villages. At the city factories or warehouses, the designs are printed and the pieces are cut. These are then packed into sacks and handed over to middlemen or subcontractors who distribute them in villages to families and workshops, where stitching traditionally is done both by adults and children. Subcontractors provide soccer ball kits to village workshops and/or households, where workers hand-stitch individual pieces together, glue the bladder to the material, and sew in the final piece. Some of the larger subcontractors in Pakistan have up to 300 stitchers working for them.  17  In some instances, there may be two or more tiers of subcontractors, with the balls passing through many hands on the way from the stitcher to the manufacturer. Once completed, the stitched soccer balls are then brought back by the middlemen to the factories for packing andshipment.  Pakistan Nearly all soccer balls are made in and around Sialkot, Pakistan  a regionfamous as a soccer ball producing hub for at least 80 years.  18  Seventy-five percent of the world's soccer balls were produced in Sialkot in 1996.  19  It is estimated that there are about 10,000 urban workers and 30,000 rural workers in the 1,450 surrounding villages of Sialkot involved in the production of soccer balls.  20 As recently as 1995, Pakistani soccer ball manufacturers denied that children were stitching soccer balls. The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan noted that when they visited Sialkot in 1995, manufacturers seemed to have instructed their contractors not to talk about child labor, and taken the contractors to task, ""not so much for employing child labor as for letting it become visible.""  21  At the time, theCommission reported that they found many children working in the soccer ball industry, despite the local industry's best efforts to conceal the children from view.  22 In 1996, an ILO study in the Sialkot region estimated that more than 7,000 Pakistani children between the ages of 5 and 14 stitched balls on a regular, full- time basis.  23  In addition, large numbers of children worked part-time outside of school hours. The great majority of these children were boys. More than 90 percent of the children stitching soccer balls are between theages of 10 and 14.  24  Most work in small shops or at home.  25  Seventy percent of the children work 8 to 9 hours a day; others work 10 to 11 hours per day.  26  It is estimated that 19 percent of the boys and 36 percent of the girls have never attended school.  27  Twenty-two percent of the boys and 25 percent of the girls attend school and work.  28  Although most of the child workers can read and write, many havedropped out of school because of uninteresting curricula, unsympathetic teachers and an uncomfortable school environment.  29 A recent study conducted for the Soccer Industry Council of America (SICA)found that stitchers make between 20 to 30 Pakistani rupees, or approximately $0.50 to $0.75, per ball.  30  On average, children are paid 20 to 22 Pakistani rupees per ball, or about $0.50 to $0.55. Payment tends to vary according to ball quality.  31  Most high quality balls are stitched by adults at stitching centers. The ILO reports that children are not likely to stitch high quality balls because they are not strong enough to make the required stitches. The wages for high quality balls are almost double than thosefor lower quality balls.  32  Depending upon skill and experience, a person is reportedly able to stitch between 1 and 5 balls a day.  33 There have been allegations of debt servitude in the soccer ball industry in Pakistan,  34  charges denied by Pakistani manufacturers  35  and a recent Save the Children-UK report.  36  However, the study commissioned by the Soccer Industry Council of America (SICA), the Save the Children report and a study conducted jointly by the ILO and the Punjab Department of Labor acknowledge that many families in thesoccer ball industry take loans or advances from subcontractors.  37  The advances are generally repaid through a deduction in the amount paid to the stitchers.  38  Most reports, however, are careful to note that intergenerational debt-bondage is not prevalent in the soccer ball industry. India India's sporting goods industry has its roots in Sialkot, Pakistan. When India was partitioned at independence in 1947, many of Sialkot's skilled Hindi craftsmen migrated across the border into the Punjab, settling in Jalandhar, where the Indian sporting goods industry is now based.  39  The Indian sporting goods industry has expanded to include the areas of Meerut, Uttar Pradesh, and Gurgaon, Haryana. Most of India's sporting goods, including soccer balls, are exported to the United Kingdom. Allegations of child labor in India's soccer ball industry have appeared since 1994.  40  Although these allegations were initially repudiated by some members of the Indian Sports Goods Export Promotion Council, recent public statements by members of the industry are more qualified, denying that child labor is used inmembers' factories, but acknowledging that the practice may occur through the process of contracting out to homeworkers.  41  About 300,000 persons work in the sporting goods industry producing over 200 different products.  42  It is estimated that about 10 percent of this work force, or 25,000 to 30,000 workers, are children.  43 Soccer ball production in India is similar to that in Pakistan: middlemen distribute soccer ball kits provided by large factories to small workshops and homes in surrounding villages, where soccer balls are stitched and returned. A 1997 study by Christian Aid, a British NGO, found children as young as seven stitching soccerballs in their homes.  44  The report described children working in small workshops orat home in urban slum areas and remote villages.  45  They work for many hours stitching the soccer balls while sitting in a hunched, squatting position. Some of thechildren go to school as well as work.  46  The report quotes the director of a Jalandhar soccer ball company as saying, ""the football industry uses children at the age of 10or 12. The quantity of footballs exported is too much to employ all the people we need in factories. Women and children do it in their houses whenever they get freetime.""  47 As in Pakistan, stitchers are paid per completed ball. One major exporter stated that stitchers average 13 to 14 Indian rupees per ball ($ 0.37 - $0.39) for the low quality soccer balls, and between 20 and 22 Indian rupees per ball ($ 0.56-$0.62cents) for the most commonly produced medium quality balls. Some Indian children reportedly earn as little as 7 Indian rupees per ball, or about $0.20.  48   D. Consumer Labeling Programs in the Soccer Ball Industry 1.  Introduction Adverse publicity in the United States and Europe about children stitchingsoccer balls prompted some importers to adopt labels informing consumers that their products have been produced in a child labor-free environment. In some cases, these programs are accompanied by changes in production processes to prevent theemployment of children. Although some individual companies have developed labels for their soccer balls, the majority of the soccer ball industry has opted instead to implement avariety of different codes of conduct to prohibit and prevent child labor. At a November 1996 meeting of the World Federation of the Sporting Goods Industry (WFSGI), companies rejected the possibility of labeling products, concluding that ""our ownindustrial brand names were statements of quality and ethics in their own rights and any disclaimer put on a separate label would only weaken that statement and the perception of the brand.""  49  They emphasized that by labeling only some balls, unlabeled balls might unfairly be thought to be made by children.  50  On the other hand, the President of the WFSGI commented that over time, it might be conceivable that products would carry a stamp indicating membership in WFSGI. Since the WFSGI isan endorser of the Pakistan Partners' Agreement, such a stamp would imply that aball made in Pakistan fulfilled the no child labor requirements of this agreement.  51  In making this proposal, the President noted that for such a stamp to be credible, it must be backed up by a strong and transparent monitoring system in addition to an enforcement mechanism capable of denying the use of the stamp or expelling members found violating the agreement.  52 Notwithstanding the WFSGI policy, recent evidence shows that child labor labeling is becoming more common in the soccer ball industry. For example, both Reebok and Baden Sports recently began selling soccer balls with a label stating that the balls are not made by children. The Reebok balls are made in Pakistan, while the Baden balls are made in China. The retail chain Dunkin' Donuts sold promotional soccer balls with a no child labor label during the 1997 summer months. Additionally, in response to a Department of Labor survey, the Kmart Corporation provided letters from their suppliers indicating that their balls are, or will be, labeled child labor-free. These labeling programs are described in the next few pages.  2.  Reebok a. Program Overview Reebok International Ltd. (Reebok) is a leading designer, marketer and worldwide distributor of sports, fitness and casual footwear, apparel, and sporting equipment. Total sales for 1996 were approximately $3.5 billion.  53  Reebok, a publicly held corporation, issued a code of conduct known as the Reebok Human Rights Production Standards in 1992. Among other things, the code of conduct bars the use of child labor in making Reebok products.  Recognizing the high incidence of child workers in the Pakistani soccer ball industry, in June 1996 Reebok officials said they were planning to buy Pakistani-made soccer balls that they ""knew with certainty"" were not made with child labor.  54  Reebok contracted with Moltex Sporting Goods (Pvt.) Ltd., a Pakistani soccer and rugby ball manufacturer, and Reed and Associates, a French company specializing inresearch and development, sourcing and manufacturing of high quality soccer and rugby balls, to build a soccer ball manufacturing plant. The new facility, located in Sialkot, has been making Reebok balls since March 1997. Soccer balls produced for Reebok by Moltex bear the following label on one of the panels: "" Guarantee: Manufactured without child labor. "" According to company officials, the use of the label allows Reebok to communicate their policy to consumers and stakeholders interested in ending exploitative child labor. Reebok's decision to label soccer balls was based on two factors: (1) increasing concern by consumers about children stitching soccer balls;  55  and (2) Reebok's desire to distinguish itself from other brands by centralizing stitching and all other production processes in a single factory and requiring rigorous external monitoring of the facility. Reebok officials state they will be able to place their label on Reebok balls ""with absolute confidence. Our consumers will know that Reebok balls are, without any doubt, child labor-free.""  56 b. Program Structure The three major elements of Reebok's program include:  57     containment of all production inside a new facility in which all work on Reebok balls is performed, including stitching. All workers must be age 15 or older;   external monitoring to ensure that: a) children are not entering the workplace, and b) soccer ball panels are not leaving the factory where the risk exists that they may be stitched by children in stitching centers or in homes; and   support of education and/ or vocational education training for children in the  soccer ball manufacturing region or Pakistan.     Reebok officials acknowledge that there are additional costs associated with creating a new facility that will house all production processes. According to Peter Moore, Senior Vice President of the Global Soccer/ Rugby Division, this shift in manufacturing processes will cost Reebok approximately 15 percent more.  58  Reebok saysthese additional costs  associated with pensions, health insurance and transportation for workers at the new factory  will be absorbed by the company; the salesprice of Reebok soccer balls will remain the same.  59 c. Program Implementation According to Reebok, the Sialkot facility began making soccer balls in March1997. Reebok hired three independent monitors to check the effectiveness of the program. Two of the monitors are associated with human rights organizations,  60  and the third is a Lahore-based affiliate of a major U. S. accounting firm.  61  The two human rights monitors were asked to monitor the factory, interview workers, maintain ties to the local community, and visit surrounding villages to be sure no Reebok panels are stitched outside the factory. Each monitor has the right to inspect the facility on an announced or unannounced basis.  62  The third monitor was hired to audit factory records in order to correlate the number of balls produced with the number of stitchers in the factory.  63  Reebok intends to make monitoring reports publicly available upon request.  64 Reebok says the auditing firm conducted a test audit in March 1997.  65  A representative of the auditing firm acknowledged they visited the plant and recommended that a number of accounting measures be implemented so that the firm could begin auditing records by August 1997.  66  Reebok notes that because other soccer balls are also being made by Moltex, the auditing process is very difficult.Reebok plans to reassess the value of engaging the outside auditing firm in addition to the human rights monitors.  67 Reebok issued the human rights monitors' first report on August 14, 1997, summarizing their findings from March through July 1997.  68  During the first five months of the project, the monitors visited the Moltex facility nine times to determine if children were present; three of the visits were unannounced. As of June 4, the monitors had found 236 workers in the factory, including 176 stitchers; 179 artisans working on a contract basis were also present. No children were found at the Moltex facility. During an April 29 visit, the human rights monitors observed balls being made at Moltex for another major buyer.  69  The factory management said these balls were being sent out of the factory for stitching, but were not Reebok balls. In August, Reebok stated it had given Moltex a large enough order to fill up the company's manufacturing capacity, and non-Reebok balls would be out of the factory by September 30.  70 The monitors recommended that a plan be devised to clearly assure them that Reebok balls were not being stitched outside the factory. In May, Reebok authorized the human rights monitors to hire a guard to stand at the factory gate tomake sure no Reebok ball panels are commingled with panels for other buyers as they leave the factory to be stitched elsewhere. The guard, who reports directly to the human rights monitors, was hired in June. He has been instructed to make sure that no Reebok panels leave the factory, and that no completed Reebok balls are coming in from the villages or outside stitching centers where children might bepresent. As of the end of July, the monitors informed Reebok that the guard has not observed any problems with Reebok balls entering or leaving the factory. Reebok has commented on the monitors' report, stating that a number of health and safety concerns in the factory had been communicated to Moltex.  71  In response, large posters with Reebok's human rights production standards translated into Urdu are being sent to Pakistan. Finally, Reebok acknowledges that a number of record keeping procedures are not yet complete, such as establishing personnel records with historical data and creating worker identification cards. In addition to its new ball factory and monitoring project, Reebok is planning an educational project.  72  The company has a three-year plan to improve educational opportunities for children in villages in the Sialkot area, specifically targeting displaced child workers. Reebok is working with the Society for Advancement of Education in Sialkot to implement the plan.  3.  Baden Sports a. Program Overview Baden Sports, Inc. is a family- owned athletic ball manufacturer. Founded eighteen years ago, Baden sells baseballs, basketballs, broom balls, footballs, soccer balls,volleyballs and water polo balls. Baden now imports soccer balls directly from one manufacturer in China. Baden recently shifted suppliers from Pakistan to China due to ""complications facing the industry in solving this [the child labor] problem,""  73  and because they ""never found the manufacturers in Pakistan to be reliable or trustworthy, and our experience is that you cannot inspect with confidence or expect that the Pakistani companies will adhere to any monitoring programs.""  74  Recent consumer inquiries, combined with market research indicating great consumer interest in the elimination ofchild labor, are Baden's primary reasons for changing its supplier and production practices. Baden claims that by switching suppliers to China, it has ensured elimination of child labor in its production of soccer balls: ""With our newly automated manufacturing process for patent-pending stitched balls, we can now guarantee, and certifyon the ball itself, that no child or slave labor has been used in the production of oursoccer balls.""  75  A Baden representative also stated that the shift to China coincided with a corporate decision to produce machine-sewn balls.  76 Soccer balls imported by Baden bear the label: ""Certified: No Child or Slave Labor Used on this Ball."" Baden also intends to produce packaging and advertisements stating that no child labor is used in the production of their soccer balls. Baden began marketing soccer balls bearing the child labor-free label in 1997.  77  In a press release announcing the availability of the product, Baden CEO E. C.Schindler stated ""it is our goal to ensure that soccer is played by children, not made by children. We are so sure of the integrity and quality of our products, we certify it.""  78 b. Program Structure Baden soccer balls are stitched in China using sewing machines, leaving only the last patch to be hand-stitched after the ball is turned right side out and the bladder inserted.  79  This process is done entirely at a factory run by Kuan Ho Sporting Goods Company Ltd., a manufacturing facility located in Dongguan, Guangdong Province, China.  80  Baden believes that through machine stitching it can obtain better quality and greater production volume using fewer workers. Baden claims that it can produce soccer balls 50 percent faster using sewing machines than stitching the balls by hand.  81 Kuan Ho's manager explained the plant's recruitment policy to visiting Department of Labor officials. Under China's labor laws, no one under 16 years of age is permitted to work. About 400 of the 2,400 workers at the factory produce soccer balls.  82  According to Kuan Ho's manager, most of the workers are female, earning about 60 to 70 percent above the local minimum wage of 500 yuan ($ 60) a month, or up to 900 yuan ($ 108).  83  The work force is made up almost entirely of migrants from other provinces within China; according to the Kuan Ho manager, they have a stable workforce due to fairly liberal benefits, which include vacations and the possibility of returning home once a year.  84 Baden requires written certification from the manufacturer that child labor is not used in the manufacture of Baden products. According to Baden's Asia representative, the company also requires Kuan Ho to allow access to personnel records. c. Program Implementation Baden management states that the company's factory representative monitors the Kuan Ho facility weekly. The factory representative explained that he visits the plant to check for quality, design and child labor but did not indicate the frequency of his visits.  85  A form verifying the absence of child labor in the production of soccer balls is to be filled out during each visit and signed by Baden's factory representative and an officer of Kuan Ho.  86 Baden management states that, in addition to the procedures noted above, it requires its representatives to verify the no child labor statements and representations made by Kuan Ho officials. The factory representative told U. S. Department of Labor officials that during his factory visits, he accepts the word of the plant manager that they are not employing child labor.  87  In addition, Baden management stated that a representative from Baden's headquarters occasionally accompanies the factory representative on site visits to verify company policies are being carried out correctly. The Department of Labor team received a copy of Baden's inspection report of Kuan Ho that certifies no child labor (i.e., no workers under sixteen) was being used in the production of soccer balls.  88  The copy of the inspection report itself had been prepared but not yet signed by the Baden representative or the Kuan Homanager.  89 Baden has no set policy to deal with the discovery of a child worker.  90  KuanHo's plant manager was aware of Baden's child labor concerns even though Baden does not have a written corporate policy on human rights or a special training program that covers this topic.  91  Workers at Kuan Ho were not aware of the purpose of Baden's labeling program.  92  The firm's management believes that workers do not need to know about such a program, although human resource managers  who are responsible for the hiring  do.  93 Baden states that the price of its soccer balls will likely increase slightly as a result of the new manufacturing and monitoring process.  4.  Other Child Labor Consumer Labels More and more soccer ball companies are promoting child labor labels particularly since the February 14, 1997 signing of the Partners' Agreement to Eliminate Child Labor in the Soccer Ball Industry in Pakistan ( see Section E. 1). The Department of Labor has received information on seven such labels. All the labelspromise that the soccer balls are not made by children. Only one of the labeling programs, sponsored by Dunkin' Donuts, has a monitoring and certification component. Four of these labels are associated with brand-name soccer balls that are soldin retail outlets. The other two labels are produced both for retail outlets and youth soccer leagues/clubs in the United States. a. Dunkin' Donuts Promotion The spread of child labor-free labels for soccer ballsis illustrated by a soccer ball promotion conducted by Dunkin'Donuts franchise outlets in New England during the 1997summer season.  94  With any purchase, a customer could buy for $9.99 a hand-stitched soccer ball bearing three logos: the Dunkin' Donuts logo; that of the New England Revolution, the region's professional soccer team; and the statement ""Produced Without Child Labor."" Posters with a photo of Alexi Lalas, one of the star players of the New England Revolution, were placed in participating Dunkin' Donut stores; many of the posters stated ""Ball Produced Without Child Labor"" in their right bottom corner.  95  The promotion was originally intended to run during the months of June and July but was extended until all the balls in stock are sold. The idea to put child labor-free labels on the promotional soccer balls came from Dunkin' Donuts New England franchisees, who expressed concern about child labor being used in the production of soccer balls made in Pakistan.  96  In response, letters from the U. S. Sporting Goods Manufacturers Association (SGMA) and Talon Sports  97  (the Pakistani manufacturer) were sent to Dunkin' Donuts stating that the balls would not be made by children. A committee of Dunkin' Donuts franchisees was uncomfortable relying solely on the promises of the manufacturer and the trade association. They agreed to approve the campaign only if the balls were certified ""child labor-free"" by an independent organization. As a result of the franchisees' concern about the credibility of a ""no child labor"" guarantee, Dunkin' Donuts, working through a sports marketing consultant in charge of the campaign (Sports Team), requested that a Washington, DC- based NGO the International Labor Rights Fund (ILRF)  serve as an independent monitor. Consequently, ILRF designed a monitoring program to ensure that soccer balls produced by Talon in Pakistan for Dunkin' Donuts were child labor-free. A six- month agreement between Sports Team and ILRF granted ILRF monitors total access to all Talon facilities, including its factories and stitching centers. Talon provided the ILRF with a map of the 43 stitching centers, a list of the names of all workers, and all of its records. Talon also consented to unannounced visits by the monitors, granting them access to all facilities and the ability to talk to workers without the presence ofsupervisory personnel.  98  ILRF monitors reported that they did not find any instances of illegal child labor. At the end of the summer, Dunkin' Donuts representatives were to evaluatethe soccer ball promotion program and determine whether to launch a spring campaign and whether it should be expanded beyond New England.  99 b. Individual Company Labels Another example of new labels informing consumers that a soccer ball ismade without child labor is that of individual companies promising that their balls are made only by adults. In response to the Department of Labor's voluntary survey, the Kmart Corporation provided the Department with letters from Seneca Sports,Inc., Franklin Sports, Inc., Molten U. S. A. and Spalding Sports Worldwide stating thatthey have or are planning to have a labeling program for soccer balls sold in Kmart stores. All four of the companies have endorsed the Partners' Agreement to Eliminate Child Labour in the Soccer Ball Industry in Pakistan and seem to base some of their no child labor assurances solely on this agreement. The following is some brief information about the claims made by each company to Kmart.      In its letter to Kmart dated February 18, 1997, Seneca Sports,  Inc. certified that its manufacturing facility in Pakistan ""prohibits inhumane conditions, violations of human rights and the use of child labor."" The letter further states that ""our packaging will certify that no child labor was used in the manufacturing of Seneca Soccer Balls.""    100  The package containing the Seneca ball states, ""Seneca® balls are certified as free from child labor."" The box also states ""Seneca Sports® Certified."" A Seneca official informed the Department of Labor that in the past year it has been asking its Pakistani supplier, Awan Sports, for assurances that soccer balls produced for Seneca are child labor- free. The Seneca representative further stated that Awan Sports has consolidated all its soccer ball production into one facility, preventing the outsourcing of stitching operations, and thereby minimizing the chance of child labor. Both Seneca and Awan Sports endorse the Partners' Agreement.    101     Franklin Sports, Inc. informed Kmart on February 18, 1997 that  it is a member of the Partners' Agreement, noting that a monitoring system had been implemented to ensure compliance with the Agreement.    102  In addition, Franklin stated it will independently assure that: 1) factories manufacturing Franklin soccer balls will be monitored by an independent contractor on a quarterly basis, with reports available for review by Kmart management; 2) factories will use only factory managed labor in the production of soccer balls, eliminating any possibility that child labor could be used in a cottage industry environment; and 3) Franklin will include a visible mark/logo on packaging and/ or product stating clearly that no child labor has been used in the production of the product, no later than July 1, 1997.    103       The president of Franklin Sports explained that placing a child  labor-free label on the balls ""is a visible way to tell people that we are in compliance with the Partners' Agreement. Also, retailers want assurances that our balls were not made by children.""  104 In a follow-up interview with the Department of Labor, Franklin confirmed that effective July 1, 1997, a label reading ""Manufactured Without Child Labor"" is being printed on balls made in Pakistan and exported to the United States. Franklin believes that stitching centers are being set up to centralize production and better manage who stitches the soccer balls. Franklin notes that they are relying solely on the Partners'Agreement to monitor production. Franklin requires all its Pakistani manufacturers to be members of the Partners' Agreement.  105      Molten U. S. A., in a letter to Kmart dated February 21, 1997, stated that ""we can now guarantee that no child labor will be used in any phase of the production of soccer balls supplied to Kmart Corporation."" The letter further states that Molten U. S. A. ""will begin to include a sticker on the cosmetic package referencing the child labor issue as soon as the stickers are produced. This should be no later than March 15."" A representative of Molten explained that its soccer balls are made in Pakistan, India and China, although the labels described in their letter to Kmart refer only to balls made in Pakistan. The representative stated that both Molten and their Pakistani supplier, Sublime Sports, are members of the Partners' Agreement. As of mid-August, however, Molten had not put ""no child labor"" labels on its Pakistani-made soccer balls. The company maintains that it is in the process of investigating the issue of child labor in Pakistan, and wants to ensure that any child labor- free guarantee made by Molten is absolutely credible.    106     Spalding Sports Worldwide stated in a February 21, 1997 letter to Kmart that all Spalding soccer ball manufacturers comply with the industry criteria and Spalding's Worldwide Labor Policy. The letter further states that Spalding is a member of the Partners' Agreement. Finally, the letter states that Spalding has added the following logo to all its soccer packages: ""No Child Labor Used to Produce This Product."" A representative of Spalding explained that Spalding sources 75 percent of its soccer balls from Pakistan; the remaining balls are made in China, but are molded and not hand- stitched. Spalding's two Pakistani manufacturers, Recto Sports    107  and Taj Mahal, are members of the Partners' Agreement. Spalding requires its manufacturers to certify Spalding balls have been produced without the use of child labor. Additionally, Spalding says that its quality control personnel visit the Pakistani facilities frequently and ensure that no child labor is used.    108       c. Child Labor Labeled Soccer Balls Provided to Youth Soccer Leagues In addition to the five companies listed above, other companies selling ballsdirectly to youth soccer leagues are making no child labor"" claims. While there maybe a number of companies supplying labeled balls to youth soccer leagues, the following two have come to the attention of the Department of Labor.      The Department of Labor obtained a soccer ball used at ""The  1997 Virginian Tournament,"" held in Springfield, Virginia, which carries the label ""No Child Labor Involved: Adult Sewn Product."" According to the information printed on the ball, it was made in Pakistan and imported by American Challenge, a U. S. importer of soccer balls. American Challenge officials informed the Department of Labor that its Challenge soccer balls are manufactured exclusively by JSD Sports (Pvt.) Ltd. in   Sialkot, Pakistan.  109  American Challenge has provided the Department of Labor with a letter from the Assistant Director of Labour Welfare, Government of the Punjab, stating that the mentioned manufacturer ""is abiding by all the by-laws in relation with employment of 'child labor' and there is no worker in the factory below the age of fifteen years. It is further certified that all workers/employees are free to leave the job and no bonded labour is involved in the manufacturing of products of the said concern.""    110  American Challenge stated that the company has been producing soccer balls with a ""no child labor"" label since January 1997. The soccer balls are sold to various dealers and individuals.    111     The American Soccer Company supplies soccer balls to ADULT  youth soccer leagues, soccer clubs, and stores under thebrand name SCORE. In the past year, the American Soccer Company began to distribute SCORE soccer balls with a PRODUCT label stating, ""Adult Sewn Product."" A SCORE representative said that placing the labels on the balls coincided with the signing of the Partners' Agreement, of which they are a member. SCORE requires that its Pakistani manufacturers be members of the Partners' Agreement as well. One of SCORE's suppliers in Pakistan is Talon Sports. Talon has provided letters to SCORE assuring that they do not use child labor in the production of their soccer balls. SCORE hopes to send company representatives to Pakistan at the end of the year to visit Talon and verify the no child labor assurances are accurate.    112     The two major organizations that sponsor and regulate youth soccer leagues in the United States, the United States Youth Soccer Association, Inc. (USYSA), andthe American Youth Soccer Organization (AYSO), have both publicly condemned the use of child labor in the manufacturing of soccer balls.  113  The official equipmentsupplier of the USYSA, the larger of the two groups, is Adidas, which does not place labels on its balls. The official ball of the AYSO is Spalding, which is placing child labor-free labels on AYSO sanctioned balls (see above). The AYSO states that is has obtained a guarantee from Spalding that its manufacturers do not engage in violation of children's rights, and that no child labor is used in the manufacturing of any of its products. Prior to this year, the official ball of the AYSO was SCORE, which is now placing no child labor labels on some of its balls.  E. Codes of Conduct in the Soccer Ball Industry In addition to the increase in child labor labels in the soccer ball industry, voluntary codes of conduct prohibiting child labor are also becoming more common. Such codes have been adopted by soccer organizations, sporting goods manufacturers, importers and retailers of soccer balls. This section first describes codes adopted by national and international organizations. The section then discusses the implementation of codes of conduct by individual U. S. importers and retailers of soccer balls, based on responses to a U. S. Department of Labor survey, other information gathered during the research for this report, and field visits by U. S. Department of Labor officials. 1.  Partners' Agreement to Eliminate Child Labor in the Soccer Ball Industry in Pakistan On February 14, 1997, in Atlanta, Georgia, representatives of the Sialkot Cham-ber of Commerce and Industry (SCCI),  114  the International Labor Organization (ILO) and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) signed the Partners' Agreement toEliminate Child Labour in the Soccer Industry in Pakistan.  115  The goals of the Partners' Agreement are the elimination of child labor in soccer ball production and the eventual elimination of child labor in other industries in the Sialkot area. This will beaccomplished through the creation of new opportunities for children with an emphasis on education and training. The Partners' Agreement has two basic programelements: a prevention and monitoring program and a social protection program. A Coordinating Committee comprised of the Partners and NGOs will administer theproject.  116  Both segments of the Partnership Agreement are due to begin in late 1997. Companies endorsing the agreement ""agree to source balls made in Pakistanexclusively from manufacturers who indicate their commitment to act responsibly toensure that children are not utilized to make soccer balls by participating in the voluntary industry program.""  117  In all, 55 soccer ball companies have endorsed the Partners' Agreement.  118 a. Prevention and Monitoring Program The prevention and monitoring program will set up a registry and internaland external monitoring systems and replace home-based production with village-based stitching centers. The program will be managed by the ILO. The objective ofthe program is to have the factories and stitching units of at least 22 manufacturersand their subcontractors free of child labor within 18 months:  119     Internal monitoring:  In order to determine whether soccer ball manufacturers are complying with the Partners' Agreement, a registry of personnel and production sites will be established. This registry is the core of the internal monitoring system. Manufacturers participating in the program must provide the following information to the ILO by January 1, 1998. i) registration of the names and contact information of all subcontractors; ii) registration of the names, addresses and ages of all stitchers working for the subcontractors and identification of child workers under the age of 14 to be removed and placed in social protection programs; iii) a reasonable estimate of the annual target capacity of soccer balls to be produced by the manufacturer and a reasonable estimate of the number of stitchers to produce this amount; iv) registration of all stitching units no less than 25 percent of the annual target capacity; and v) registration of names and contact information of new subcontractors, and names, addresses and ages of new stitchers. The manufacturers are required to update the list of new subcontractors and stitchers every six months, and to have registered all the stitching units representing one-hundred percent of the annual target capacity by January 1999.     External monitoring:  The accuracy of the internal monitoring system will be checked by establishing an external monitoring system. The ILO will hire and train independent monitors to visit the stitching centers on an unannounced basis to verify the information provided by the internal monitoring system. The monitors will have free access to all stitching centers operated by manufacturers and subcontractors. Weekly and monthly monitoring reports will be made available to the   ILO; reports of violations of the Agreement will be given to the Coordinating Committee on a monthly basis or whenever requested.     b. Social Protection Program At the same time that a system is being put into place to phase children out of the soccer ball industry, a program will be established to provide the children with education and rehabilitation. The program includes a campaign to change community attitudes toward child labor in the soccer ball industry. Children and families identified by the internal monitoring program will receive non-formal education, counseling, health services, training in income generation for adults, provision of credit/savings facility for adults and pre-vocational training. Younger children will be mainstreamed to formal schools. A number of village education and action centers (VEA centers) will be set up to provide these services. The centers will be run by the Bunyad Literacy Community Council, a Pakistani NGO focusing on basic education, and the Pakistan Bait-ul-Mal, a social welfare agency set up by the Prime Minister'soffice. 2.  Sportsgoods Manufacturers and Exporters Association (India) As programs to eliminate child labor in the Pakistani soccer ball industrygained momentum and attention this year, representatives of the sporting goods industry in India also have begun deliberations about combating child labor. In April1997, members of the Indian Sportsgoods Manufacturers and Exporters Associationjoined representatives of NGOs, government, trade unions and international organizations in the First National Consultation on Child Labor in the Sports Goods Industry, organized by the Indian human rights group South Asian Coalition on Child Servitude (SACCS). The purpose of the meeting was to discuss the problem of child labor in the industry and create a plan of action for the elimination of child labor. Among the coalition's recommendations was to establish an ethical code of conductand an independent, professional and credible monitoring system to ensure the absence of child labor.  120  The Joint Committee on Child Labor in the Sporting Goods Industry was created, consisting of 8 industry representatives, 3 NGO representatives, the Sports Goods Export Promotion Council (a governmental body), the ILO and UNICEF. At the same time that the Joint Committee was being established by SACCS,members of the Sportsgoods Manufacturers and Exporters Association of India  121  held a special meeting to discuss child labor in May 1997. The meeting, attended by 25 of the largest soccer ball manufacturers and exporters in India, the ILO and the World Federation of Sporting Goods Industry,  122  was called in response to a May 1997 Christian Aid report on child labor in the Indian sporting goods industry and recent negative media coverage in the United Kingdom.  123 In a declaration prior to the May meeting, the Indian Sportsgoods Manufac-turers and Exporters Association stated its opposition to child labor. Similar to the industry leaders in Pakistan, the Indian association explained that there are no children producing soccer balls in the factories themselves,  124  but that subcontractors could be distributing work to village shops and homes where child labor is more likely to be found.  125  To deal with this problem, the Association adopted a self-monitoring system consisting of the following elements:    the industry will: (1) identify stitchers and prepare lists of their names, address, ages, sex, address of workplace, etc.; (2) identify children working in homes or in factories; and (3) cross check the lists of stitchers with the number of stitched balls, and/ or other goods exported annually from India;      the first monitoring of the lists will be conducted by the Sportsgoods Manufacturers and Exporters Association,   Jalandhar;     a second monitoring will be conducted by the Sports Good Export Promotion Council; and     the third monitoring will be done by an outside agency such as the Indian Labor Department or the   ILO.  126     At a June 1997 meeting, the chairman of the Sportsgoods Manufacturers and Exporters Association asked that all members fill out forms ""to identify child labour""  127   employed directly or indirectly in the production of soccer balls. While the Association deems the monitoring system as self-certifying, it acknowledges that some form of independent monitoring is necessary for the system to be credible.  128  Whether an Indian government agency is considered to be independent for purposes of monitoring is open to question. The Sportsgoods Manufacturers and Exporters Associationhas also encouraged members to work with the Punjabi state government, which will reportedly provide assistance if members are interested in setting up centralizedstitching centers in lieu of using individual subcontractors.  129 On September 13, 1997, the Sportsgoods Manufacturers and Exporters Association reported that 27 exporting companies have provided information on their stitchers. Eighteen of these companies have obtained lists of stitchers from their contractors.  130 3.  FIFA The International Federation of Football Associations (FIFA)  131  authorizes the use of its logo on soccer balls that meet international matchball standards. On September 3, 1996, FIFA announced an agreement with three international unions  132  on a Code of Labor Practice for all goods bearing its logo.  133   Use of the FIFA logo bya licensee would signify that production was carried out in compliance with ILO Conventions banning child labor and forced labor, ensuring non-discrimination in employment, guaranteeing the right of workers to form and join trade unions and to bargain collectively, and ensuring payment of a minimum wage.  134  These commitments would be binding not only on the licensees, but also on each contractor and subcontractor in the production and distribution of FIFA- licensed products.  135  The FIFA Code of Labour Practice has not been embraced by soccer ball manufacturers or importers. In the year since the Code of Labor Practice was announced, FIFA has endorsed the Partners' Agreement but has not issued any information on the implementation of the FIFA code.  136 4.  Survey Results In addition to endorsing the Partners' Agreement, some U. S. importers of soccer balls have issued their own codes of conduct that prohibit the use of child labor. Some retailers have also adopted similar codes of conduct. In order to gather information on the extent and implementation of codes of conduct and labeling programs regarding child labor in the soccer ball industry, the U. S. Department of Labor conducted a voluntary survey of 7 importers and 3 retailersof soccer balls.  137  ( See Box IV- 1 for a list of the companies surveyed and Appendix B for the Company Questionnaire). Nine companies responded to the survey: Adidas, Baden Sports, Brine, Kmart, Nike, Pentland (Mitre), Reebok, Umbro, and Wal-Mart. The respondents indicated they import soccer balls either directly from foreign manufacturers in China, Indonesia or Pakistan, or through a U. S.- based purchasing agent.    Six of the seven importers source their soccer balls directly from a foreign manufacturer; one firm   (Pentland) also sources its balls through a purchasing agent. The seventh, Adidas, currently imports its soccer balls through a licensee, Molten, U. S. A. None of the seven importers own foreign manufacturing facilities. However, Reebok and Nike have invested in special facilities being built by their Pakistani producers in order to meet their child labor-free production policies.     The two retailers responding to the survey use U. S. licensees or purchasing agents to obtain soccer balls. Kmart, for example, purchases soccer balls from Seneca Sports, Franklin Sports, Molten U. S. A., and Spalding Sports ( see Section D. 4. b. above).     Seven of the companies responding to the survey indicated they have a written corporate policy prohibiting child labor. The written policies take the form of a code of conduct, vendor agreement, purchase order, or statement of principles.In cases where the company purchases and/or sells numerous products, the code applies to all the products, not just soccer balls. Copies of the policies are reproduced in Appendix C.    All seven importers (Adidas, Baden Sports, Brine, Nike, Pentland (Mitre), Reebok and Umbro) have endorsed the Partners' Agreement in addition to their individual corporate policies against child labor.    Brine stated that it has no written policy prohibiting child labor, although it is a member of the Partners' Agreement and has always made it clear to suppliers that child labor is unacceptable. However, this policy is not included in their purchase orders or vendor agreements.     Adidas' licensing agreement requires its licensees and manufacturers to comply with all applicable laws, including those prohibiting child labor. Manufacturers are also required to ensure that subcontractors comply with these standards. Failure to comply may be a basis for terminating the agreement.     Although Baden has no written code of conduct prohibiting child labor, they  require their factory representatives to verify that no children are engaged in making their products.     Nike's code of conduct prohibits the use of child labor. Child labor is defined as a person under the age of 15, unless national law states that the minimum age for work is fourteen  or  the age at which compulsory schooling has ended, whichever is greater.     TABLE IV-2 Type of Policy Prohibiting Child Labor (Based on Responses to Department of Labor Questionnaire)     * Company participates in the Partners' Agreement to Eliminate Child Labour in the Soccer Ball industry in Pakistan a  Company has its own labeling program b  Company has a formal code of conduct, statement of principals or compliance certificate c  Company has a purchase order, letter of credit, or buying agent agreement, which contains a specific prohibition on child labor in overseas production.        Pentland's letter of credit requires suppliers to certify that items were not mined, produced, manufactured, assembled or packed by the use of child labor as defined by national law.     Kmart's Workplace Code of Conduct is applicable to all suppliers and the suppliers' subcontractors in the United States and abroad. Kmart's code requires suppliers and their contractors to comply with local child labor laws and regulations. Children under the local legal age should not be employed by the supplier.     Reebok's code of conduct states that it will not work with business partners that use child labor. Reebok defines child labor as work performed by a person under 14, or younger than the age for compulsory schooling, whichever is higher.     Umbro requires its suppliers to sign a pledge every year certifying that they are observing national child labor laws.     Wal-Mart's Standards for Vendor Partners declares that Wal- Mart will not tolerate the use of child labor in the manufacture of products it sells. The standard applies to vendor partners as well as to their contractors, subcontractors or any other entity with whom they have a relationship for the manufacture of products sold by Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart defines child labor as work by a person younger than 15 (or 14 if so designated by national law) or younger than the age for completing compulsory education if that age is higher than 15.     Only three respondents  all importers  indicated that they communicatetheir no child labor policy directly to consumers. The remaining importers and retailers report either that they have no method to inform consumers that no childlabor is used in the foreign production of soccer balls, or that their suppliers label the balls.    Reebok and Baden have adopted labels to inform consumers that their soccer balls are made without child labor ( see Section D above). Reebok's code of conduct is reproduced on its internet website.     Nike said that consumers can learn about their no child labor policy on its internet website or by calling a toll- free number set up by the Soccer Industry Council of America that lists the names of companies participating in the Partner's Agreement.     Kmart noted that their four suppliers (Seneca Sports, Franklin Sports, Molten U. S. A., and Spalding Sports) have submitted letters indicating that they would label the balls child labor- free. Three of the four suppliers (Seneca Sports, Franklin Sports, and Spalding Sports) are now selling labeled balls to Kmart ( see Section D. 4. b. above for a more detailed discussion).     Brine noted that they do not have a separate mechanism for informing consumers that a soccer ball is not made by children, as their brand name alone should stand for not using child labor. Brine raised the concern that creating a special ""not made with child labor"" designation will lead to exploitation of the situation, and that smaller manufacturers that are financially unable to mount a large no child labor public relations campaign are bound to suffer even if they do have a no child labor commitment.     The companies surveyed indicated that they utilize a variety of means to monitor that their codes of conduct or policies on child labor are respected by their suppliers. Details of Reebok, Baden, and Kmart's monitoring procedures are found in Section D above. Table IV- 3 illustrates the type of monitoring the respondents employ. Seven of the nine respondents (Adidas, Baden, Brine, Kmart, Nike, Reebokand Wal- Mart) stated that they use contractual monitoring, i. e., they require their suppliers, through contractual agreements, to certify that their soccer balls are not made by children. The two retailers (Kmart and Wal- Mart) use only contractual monitoring to ensure their policy is being properly implemented. Seven of the nine respondents (Adidas, Baden, Brine, Nike, Pentland, Reebok and Umbro) send company staff, buyer agents or other parties to inspect facilities to verify that suppliers are actually implementing their code of conduct. Nike andReebok indicated that, in addition to contractual and internal monitoring, they use external accounting, auditing, testing or consulting firms, and/ or NGOs to monitor labor practices. In response to the Department's survey, some respondents submit-ted letters from the local Pakistani Labor Department certifying that a factory manufacturing soccer balls is free of child labor. Adidas, Brine, Nike, Pentland, Reebok and Umbro explained that they relyon the system established by the Partners' Agreement to monitor their child labor policy  in addition to any monitoring they might conduct on their own. Companies that support the Partners' Agreement pledge only to do business with Pakistani manufacturers who participate in the Agreement and consent to internal and external monitoring. As indicated above, however, the internal and external monitoring programs established by the Agreement have not yet been fully implemented.  TABLE IV-3 Monitoring Strategies for Compliance with International Child Labor Policies (Based on Responses to Department of Labor Questionnaire)     a  Company relies on guarantees made by suppliers through contractual documents or certificates that they are adhering to the company's policies. b  Company uses site visits and inspections by company staff, buyer agents, or other parties to verify that suppliers are actually implementing the codes of conduct. c  Company uses external accounting, auditing, testing or consulting firms, NGOs, or international organizations to monitor labor practices.        Local and quality control personnel employed by Adidas regularly visit manufacturers facilities. Adidas submitted a letter from the Punjabi Directorate of Labour Welfare attesting that children have never been found in the factory of their supplier, Sublime Sports.     Kmart's code of conduct requires suppliers and their subcontractors to allow full access to their facilities at all times for inspections by Kmart representatives or independent firms retained by Kmart. Kmart states that it has never found any child labor in the production of soccer balls.    138 It is not clear whether Kmart's monitoring system specifically applies to the soccer balls sold in their stores. However, in February 1997, Kmart received letters from four soccer ball suppliers assuring the retailer that the balls were not made by children. The suppliers' letters informed Kmart that each company is participating in the Partners' Agreement.     Nike imports soccer balls from SAGA Sports in Sialkot. Nike and SAGA  determined jointly that the best way to eliminate child labor was to create village stitching centers where it would be easier to monitor the ages of the   stitchers. By mid-1997, three stitching centers were operating with two additional centers scheduled to be completed by September 1997.    139  One of the centers is exclusively for women. Nike states that it monitors its code of conduct in Pakistan through its own internal procedures, and by using a Pakistani affiliate of Grant Thornton as an external monitor.     Pentland's soccer ball product managers visit their production facilities about three times a year to monitor compliance with their child labor policy. Pentland noted, however, that it is difficult to monitor for child labor since children are seldom found in the factories, but stitch soccer balls in homes and small workshops in the rural areas.   Over the next two years, Pentland plans to implement a China- specific monitoring plan in response to their concern about the use of child labor in China's soccer ball industry. The policy will have three components: 1) better factory control of home working situations; 2) documenting the age of young factory workers; and 3) protecting older working children (14, 15, 16 and 17 year olds) by restricting overtime and identifying areas of potential hazard where they should not be working.   Umbro personnel make spot- checks at suppliers' factories in 4- 8 week cycles. Umbro stated that although they conduct spot checks on ""external stitching facilities,"" they can never be completely certain that no child labor is being used.    F. Conclusion There has been significant public attention focused on the use of child laborin the soccer ball industry.  140  Most reports describe Pakistani children sitting forhours a day in small workshops stitching soccer balls. Other more recent reportsdescribe a similar situation in India's soccer ball industry. Soccer balls are also madein China and Indonesia, but the Department is not aware of any child labor allegations in the soccer ball industries of these countries. One company surveyed for this report, however, plans to implement an internal monitoring system in China due to concerns of child labor. Children stitch soccer balls in small workshops or homes, many times inremote rural areas. It is rare for a child to be found working in a large soccer ball factory. In Pakistan and India, child labor laws prohibit children from working in factories, but not in the type of subcontracting or homework arrangements common to the soccer ball industry. Some of the children work full-time. Others work during non-school hours. Many work for up to nine or ten hours a day. The international soccer ball industry has responded to the child labor accusations by creating codes of conduct and monitoring systems. In February 1997,Pakistani manufacturers signed an agreement (Partners'Agreement) with the ILO andUNICEF to phase children out of the industry, to provide education and other services to them, and to participate in internal and external monitoring programs. Over 50 U. S. and Pakistani companies pledged to support the agreement. By the time this report was written, the Partners' Agreement was not yet fully operational. In India,the industry is moving toward an agreement to stop the use of child labor. Discussions are underway between representatives of the industry, ILO, UNICEF, NGOs,trade unions and government to determine how best to accomplish this goal. Some individual companies are responding to public pressure by placingchild labor-free labels on their balls. The Department of Labor has identified eight companies that are using such labels. Reebok and Baden are both changing their production processes and implementing monitoring systems to support the use ofthe label. Reebok has hired independent human rights monitors to verify that no children stitch Reebok balls. Dunkin' Donuts sold promotional soccer balls duringthe 1997 summer months bearing a child labor-free label. Dunkin's Donuts asked a U.S.-based NGO to monitor the production of these balls and certify that they were not made by children. The other companies are making their no child labor claimsbased upon their participation in the Partners' Agreement. It is premature, however,to make such a claim because the monitoring components of the Partners' Agreement have not yet been fully implemented. Other companies are changing their production processes to prevent the use of child labor. For instance, Reebok has centralized all soccer production in one factory. Nike has created stitching centers in order to better monitor where production takes place. Baden has changed from Pakistani to Chinese suppliers and mecha-nized the stitching process. Although some individual companies have developed labels for their soccer balls, the majority of the soccer ball industry has opted instead to implement a variety of different codes of conduct to prohibit and prevent child labor. All companies responding to a Department of Labor survey on codes of conduct and labeling programs indicated that they have some type of corporate policy prohibiting child labor. Not all these policies are in writing, and very few are enforced through a rigorous monitoring system.

In a preaward review, the desk audit is normally conducted onsite (also  see Section 3C).    2A01  PURPOSE OF DESK AUDITS     Desk audits are a major component of compliance reviews.  By careful and  systematic review of the documents and materials provided by covered contractors  and subcontractors, the Equal Opportunity Specialist (EOS) can begin to  determine whether they are complying with relevant provisions of 41 CFR Chapter  60, are not discriminating and are taking affirmative action to ensure equal  employment opportunity without regard to race, color, religion, national origin,  sex, disability, or status as a special disabled or Vietnam era veteran.  Desk  audits enable the EOS to review a contractor's compliance with its affirmative  action and equal opportunity obligations at a particular establishment, and  specifically to:      (a) Workforce Structure, Personnel Policies and Procedures:  Examine the  contractor's basic organizational structure, personnel policies and procedures.      (b) Good Faith Efforts:  Identify areas: (1) where there has been a lack of  goals progress and further information is needed onsite to evaluate the  contractor's good faith effort, including the development and implementation of  programs designed to improve opportunities for minorities and women.    (c) Potential Discrimination:  Identify areas for an in-depth investigation  of potential discrimination: (1) where minorities and women are  underrepresented and concentrated in the workforce; (2) where employment  activity has been disadvantageous to minorities or women; and (3) where there  may be problems in the compensation of minorities or women vs. others.     2A02  PURPOSE AND PRINCIPLES OF AAPS    Desk audits should be conducted with the following AAP principles as points  of reference:    (a) Equal Employment Opportunity:  Equal employment opportunity requires  that a contractor eliminate and remedy all discrimination.  A contractor's  personnel policies and practices must not discriminate against any persons  because of their race, color, religion, national origin, sex, disability or  covered veteran status.       (b) Affirmative Action:  An affirmative action program is a set of specific  and result-oriented policies and procedures to which a contractor commits itself  to apply every good faith effort.  The objective of those procedures plus such  efforts is equal employment opportunity.      (c) Completeness, Reasonableness, Acceptability:  The affirmative action  program will be judged for its completeness, reasonableness, and acceptability.      2A03  RELATIONSHIP TO THE STANDARD COMPLIANCE REVIEW REPORT (SCRR)      The Standard Compliance Review Report (SCRR) and its instructions (Appendix  2A) constitute a framework for conducting the desk audit and developing and  implementing an onsite investigative plan.  The organization of this Chapter  generally parallels that of the SCRR, and it should be read in conjunction with  the SCRR instructions.    (a) Organization of the SCRR:  The SCRR is organized into three parts:    (1) Part A:  Preparation:  Part A covers preparation for the desk audit,  including such areas as the contractor's past review history, overall EEO  trends in its workforce, its organizational structure, and the initial review  of its AAP and support data for completeness, reasonableness, and  acceptability.    (2) Part B:  Affirmative Action:  Part B summarizes prob- lems with the AAP  and support data; provides for analysis of affirmative action progress and  identification of areas where additional information is needed to determine  good faith effort; and covers implementation of other affirmative action  obligations.  For each affirmtive action problem unresolved at the conclusion  of desk audit, the SCRR provides for an onsite plan.    (3) Part C:  Potential Discrimination:  Part C includes review of the  workforce analysis for concentrations/    underrepresentations), impact ratio analyses, and compensation analyses.   For each potential discrimination problem unresolved at the conclusion of desk  audit, the SCRR provides for an onsite investigative plan.    (b) SCRR Potential Discrimination Worksheets:  The SCRR also includes a  series of Potential Discrimination Worksheets designed to illustrate the steps  normally necessary to establish particular types of discrimination.  These  Worksheets and their instructions are in Appendix A to Chapter 3.  Their use,  although encouraged, is optional.  However, the ""Key Factors""  highlighted at the beginning of the instructions for each Worksheet must be  addressed in an analysis if the Worksheet applies to the type of potential  discrimination problem involved.  In developing an onsite plan for the  investigation of potential discrimination issues, therefore, the EOS may find it  useful to review at least the ""Key Factors"" for the initial onsite  step of data refinement (Worksheets 17-1 and 17-2).     2B  PRE-DESK AUDIT ACTIONS    2B00  COMPLIANCE REVIEW INFORMATION SYSTEM (CRIS)    CRIS is used to record basic information about the contractor, to track  major review events, and to summarize violations found and remedies obtained.   To enter a contractor into CRIS, the Area Of-fice completes CRIS Form 100 and  sends it to Region.  The Region then generates a CRIS Form 100a, which is the  first page of the SCRR.  Full instructions for completing the 100a are given in  the CRIS Manual.    2B01  MAINTENANCE OF CASE CHRONOLOGY    The EOS should prepare a case chronology (CC-53; see Figure 2-1) for each  compliance review.  It should cover events occurring from the date of initial  contact with the contractor to the date case closing documents are prepared and  approved.  All telephone conversations, correspondence and meetings associated  with the review should be recorded, indicating the date, nature of contact,  person contacted, summary of discussion or actions taken, and EOS' name.  Events  should be logged in as they occur, since it is difficult to reconstruct these  after a review is completed.  The case chronology is an integral part of the  case file and will be an invaluable tool if enforcement action is necessary.   All notes and logs should be legible (preferably typed).    2B02  INITIAL CONTACT WITH CONTRACTOR    (a) Identifying Information:  Identifying information should be obtained by  contacting the contractor before the start of the compliance review.  The name  of the establishment chief executive officer (CEO), the name of the person  responsible for preparation/implementation of the AAP, and the correct     mailing address for the establishment should be obtained.  If the  establishment is part of a larger entity, the name of the corporate CEO, the  name of the corporate person responsible for Equal Employment  Opportunity/Affirmative Action matters, and the correct corporate mailing  address should also be obtained.  This basic identifying information should be  entered on page 2 of the SCRR, along with contract data, labor force  information, and the other items specified in the SCRR instructions.    (b) Representation by Counsel:  If the contractor indicates, at this point  in the review or later, that an outside counsel or consultant will represent the  company, the contractor will be asked to provide written confirmation of  representation, including: (1) the representative's name, address and phone  number; (2) the scope of the representative's authority (including whether  he/she is authorized to negotiate settlement for the contractor); (3) whether  all contacts, including routine ones to make appointments or to clarify  submitted data or other information, should be made through the representative;  and (4) whether all correspondence should be mailed only to the representative  or if copies should also be mailed to the contractor.  Upon receipt of this  written confirmation, contacts and correspondence will be handled accordingly  for the duration of the review (unless the contractor specifies a different time  period).  NOTE:  This same written confirmation should be obtained from the  contractor if OFCCP is contacted by a person who indicates that he/she  represents the contractor.    (c) Special Circumstances:  The EOS should also determine if there is any  information which would preclude selection of the contractor for a compliance  review (e.g., bankruptcy, debarment, closure of the establishment), or would  influence the timing of the review (i.e. vacation shutdown, strike, lockout,  heavy layoffs, etc.).    2B03  SCHEDULING LETTER    The notice used to schedule a compliance review and request the Affirmative  Action Program (AAP) and supporting documentation is called a Scheduling Letter  (Figure 2-2).  This letter will be sent, by certified mail with return receipt  requested, to the top official at the contractor's establishment with a copy to  the chief executive officer at the corporate address (unless the establishment  and corporate office are the same).  Scheduling Letters shall be signed by the  AOD or FOD.  Letters should include the name and telephone number of the EOS who  will be conducting the review and/or the appropriate Module Chief.      2B04  FOLLOW-UP CONTACT WITH CONTRACTOR    Within fifteen working days after sending the Scheduling Letter, the EOS  should contact the contractor to ensure that the contractor's representatives  fully understand the requirements outlined.  The EOS should also make sure there  have been no special circumstances which may require postponing or cancelling  the scheduled review (see 2B02(c) above).    2B05  CONTACT WITH EEOC, STATE AND LOCAL FEP AGENCIES AND VETS    (a) EEOC and State and local Fair Employment Practices (FEP) Agencies:   Simultaneously with the Scheduling Letter, the standard inquiry letter (Figure  2-3) should be sent to the district office of the EEOC and to State and local  FEP agencies, requesting information on complaints filed against the contractor  and any other information that may be pertinent to assessing the contractor's  EEO posture.  If after 15 days no response is received, the EOS should follow-up  by telephone.     (b) Veterans Employment and Training Service (VETS):  The EOS must contact  the VETS representative at the appropriate State Employment Security office to  request information he or she may have which could be pertinent to the review.   This contact must be recorded in the case chronology record.    2B06  REVIEW OF COMMUNITY RESOURCE FILES    Each AO or FO should maintain resource files on the communities within its  geographic area.  For each community, these files should contain at least: (1)  basic data on minority/female availability; (2) information on public  transportation systems; and (3) identification of local organizations  representing covered group members.  The EOS should review the resource file for  the community where the contractor is located, with particular attention to  organizations which can be helpful in evaluating the contractor's compliance  posture.  If the contractor is located near an Indian reservation, the EOS  should contact the reservation's Tribal Employment Rights Council (TERO).    2B07  STANDARD AFFIRMATIVE ACTION FORMATS    If the contractor scheduled for review has an approved Standard Affirmative  Action Format (SAAF), the Module Chief should obtain a copy of the format and  provide it to the EOS conducting the review.  The EOS should become familiar  with the provisions of the SAAF, preparatory to evaluating the contractor's AAP.      2B08  REVIEW OF PREVIOUS COMPLIANCE ACTIONS    When scheduling the contractor for a compliance review, the EOS should  determine whether the contractor has previously been audited.  If so, the EOS  should examine at least the previous case file for problem areas, with  particular attention to commitments made in a Conciliation Agreement or Letter  of Commitment.  The EOS also should determine whether the contractor has been  subject to an OFCCP complaint investigation and, if so, review the file for any  problems identified.  Problems in these past compliance actions should be  recorded on page 3 of the SCRR. As the review progresses, the EOS should be  alert to any indications that past problems have remained unremedied or have  recurred.    2B09  INFORMATION ON COMPLAINTS    (a) Response to the Standard Inquiry Letter:  The EOS should carefully  examine all information on complaints received from Federal, State, and local  agencies in response to the Standard Inquiry Letter.  Basic information on these  com- plaints should be entered on page 3 of the SCRR, including the agency with  which the complaint was filed, the basis, issue, current status, and the area of  the contractor's workforce involved in the complaint.    (b) Relationship to Desk Audit:  The EOS should note any patterns in the  types of complaints filed, particularly ones that might indicate potential  systemic discrimination problems.  For example, there may be a clustering of  complaints filed by employees in certain job areas, or by applicants or  employees from a particular race, religion, ethnic group, or sex, or by covered  veterans or individuals with disabilities.  As the review progresses, the EOS  should cross reference complaints to potential problem areas identified.  For  example, there may be indications of lack of good faith efforts, adverse IRA's,  and/or concentrations/underrepresentations in areas where complaints have been  filed.      (c) Review of Case Files:  Where appropriate, the EOS should contact the  appropriate EEOC office or State or local fair employment agency to arrange to  review case files as part of the compliance review.  This can be useful when, as  a result of the desk audit, potential systemic problems are indenti- fied in  complaint areas.    (d) Contractor Complaint Information:  Upon receipt of the AAP and  supporting data, any information provided by the con- tractor with respect to  current or past complaints should be compared to the information received from  the agencies.  Discrepancies and/or information not provided by the contractor  should be noted by the EOS for particular attention during the review.      2B10  RELATIONSHIP OF OFCCP COMPLIANCE ACTIVITIES TO EEO LITIGATION OR COURT  ORDERS    If, during the conduct of a compliance review, the EOS finds that the  contractor is involved in litigation or is under a court order on EEO matters,  he/she should identify the EEO issues involved, the court, the parties, the case  name and number, and bring the matter to the attention of the AOD (or FOD, where  appropriate).  The AOD/FOD, in consultation through channels with the Regional  Solicitor's Office, will determine whether there are any limitations which may  be imposed on the conduct of the compliance review by the litigation or court  order.    2C  SUBMISSION OF AAPS FOR DESK AUDIT    2C00  DELAYED RECEIPT OF AAPS    If current AAPs are not received by the 30th calendar day after the  contractor received the notification of the scheduled review, the EOS should  telephone the contractor to determine whether the AAPs have been mailed.  If the  contractor advises that they are en route, a reasonable period of time, not to  exceed five (5) calendar days, will be allowed for receipt.      2C01  NON-RECEIPT OF EXECUTIVE ORDER AAP    If there is no reason to believe that the AAP is en route, or if an AAP  reported en route has not been received at the end of 5 calendar days following  the 30th day, a show cause notice should generally be issued (see Chapter 8).   However, the regulations at 41 CFR 60-1.26(a)(2) give the Director, OFCCP the  discretion to go directly to administrative enforcement where a contractor  refuses to submit an AAP and efforts to conciliate the matter are unsuccessful.       2C02  NON-RECEIPT OF SECTION 503/38 U.S.C. 4212 AAPS    A Section 503 and 38 U.S.C. 4212 AAP may be included in an Executive Order  AAP, may be combined in one document, or may be submitted as separate documents.   Action to be taken where Section 503 and/or 38 U.S.C. 4212 AAP(s) are not  submitted may take either of two forms, depending on circumstances:      (a) Concurrent Failure to Submit EO 11246 AAP or Submission of Unreasonable  EO 11246 AAP:  If the contractor failed to submit both an Executive Order AAP  and the AAP(s) for Section 503/38 U.S.C. 4212, or if the Executive Order AAP is  determined to be an unreasonable submission (see Section 2F    below) and no Section 503/38 U.S.C. 4212 AAP(s) was submitted, then the Show  Cause Notice being issued for the Executive Order violation will include the  failure to submit the Section 503/38 U.S.C. 4212 AAP and offer the contractor a  concurrent 30-day period to submit that AAP (see Sections 8B01(b) and 8D00(b)  and Figures 8-1 and 8-2).    (b) Reasonable EO 11246 AAP Submitted:  If the contractor's Executive Order  AAP has been received and is determined to be reasonable, but no Section 503/38  U.S.C. 4212 AAP(s) was received, the EOS will telephone the contractor to  request that the missing AAP(s) be provided.  If the materials are received  before the end of the desk audit, they will be reviewed for completeness and  acceptability (see Sections 2E01 and 2I below) as part of the desk audit.  If  they are not received before the end of the desk audit, they will be reviewed  onsite.  If, however, it is determined onsite that the contractor did not have  Section 503 and/or 38 U.S.C. 4212 AAPs in place in accordance with the  regulations, this will be cited as a major problem, and its resolution addressed  in a Conciliation Agreement.    2C03  EVALUATION PERIOD    (a) General:  The EOS should evaluate the contractor's perform- ance (e.g.,  goals progress, good faith efforts, personnel activity, etc.) for at least the  last full AAP year.  Cur- rent year performance should also be examined if the  con- tractor is six months or more into its current AAP year.  For example, if  the AAP is established on a calendar year basis, and the compliance review is  scheduled for August 1988, the EOS would evaluate the contractor's performance  from January 1, 1987 through June 30, 1988 (1/1/87 through 12/31/87 under the  prior AAP, and 1/1/88 through 6/30/88 under the current AAP).    (b) When Discrimination Found:  Note, however, that if potential  discrimination is found, analysis of personnel activity/policy implementation  should be extended to cover the normal liability period (providing coverage can  be established during the full normal liability period).  The normal liability  period for a compliance review is the full two years preced-ing the date the  contractor received the Scheduling Letter.  Additionally, where the alleged  discrimination involves a continuing violation, the analysis may be extended  further (see Chapters 3 and 7).    Revised 5-25-90    2C04  TIMEFRAME FOR COMPLETION OF COMPLIANCE REVIEW    The 60-day period for completing the compliance review (refer to 41 CFR  60-60.7) begins when the AAP and support data (whether reasonable or not) are  recieived in the AO/FO.  While completion of the review within the 60-day period  is not a procedural prerequisite to an enforcement action, substantial effort  should be made to complete the review within that period of time.  Should it  become apparent that a review cannot or will not be completed within 60 days of  receipt of the AAP and support data (irrespective of whether a Show Cause Notice  has been issued), the EOS should request an extension through his or her Module  Chief.  All extension requests must be made sufficiently in advance to allow for  necessary processing and entry into the CRIS.      2C05  REVIEWS OF CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS, REGIONAL AND DISTRICT OFFICES    (a) Maintenance of Establishment AAPs:  When reviewing corporate  headquarters, the EOS should review documentation that the corporation's  establishments have developed AAPs.    (b) Corporate-Level Selection Decisions:  The EOS should ensure that the  workforce analysis, utilization analysis and goals in the corporate  headquarter's AAP include all positions filled by headquarters decision-makers,  regardless of where those jobs are physically located.  For example, mid- and  upper-level management jobs at establishments other than headquarters must be  included in the corporate AAP if the selection decisions for those jobs are made  at the corporate level.     Where because of informal or fluctuating managerial appointment authorities,  the appropriate level for job title placement cannot be clearly or consistently  defined, the managerial and other appropriate titles should be placed in the  AAP of the highest organizational level where ultimate approval authority may  reside.  As a result, there may be instances when the majority of mid- and  upper-level manage-ment and other titles should appropriately be placed in the  corporate headquarters AAP, notwithstanding personnel responsibility at  intermediate organizational levels.  Management should be given substantial  discretion in determining proper organizational levels for job title placement  provided such placement is not inconsistent with the purpose of this Section.      (c) Regional or District-Level Selection Decisions:  Similarly, if a  regional or district office has decision-making authority over positions in a  lower-level establishment unit, the regional or district office AAP should  include those positions in its workforce analysis, utilization analysis and  goals.     Revised 5-25-90    (d) Establishments with Positions Filled by Higher-Level Decision Making:   When reviewing establishments which are subordinate to a higher-level  establishment in the contractor's organization, the EOS will ensure that all  positions in the workforce of the lower-level establishment for which the  selection decisions are made at a higher corporate level are excluded from the  utilization analysis and goal setting of the establishment under review.  Such  positions, however, must be shown in the lower-level establishment's workforce  analysis (in order that the complete workforce structure of that establishment  is readily apparent).      2D INITIAL REVIEW OF AAP AND SUPPORT DATA - GENERAL    2D00  CONTENTS OF INITIAL REVIEW    Upon receipt of an AAP and support data, the EOS should immedi- ately review  the material to make sure that it provides an adequate basis for conducting  desk audit analyses of both affirma- tive action and potential discrimination  issues.  This initial review includes a determination of the completeness,  reasonableness and acceptability of the AAP(s) and support data as described  in the sections which follow.    2D01  RECORDING RESULTS OF INITIAL REVIEW    The results of this initial review are recorded on page 4 of the SCRR.   Where problems are identified, each specific problem should be described on page  9 of the SCRR (Problems with AAP and Support Data), along with the actions the  EOS plans to take to resolve it.  Where the matter is unresolved at the  conclusion of desk audit, page 9 will constitute the onsite plan for resolution of AAP and support data problems.     2E REVIEW FOR CURRENCY AND COMPLETENESS    2E00 ACTION WHEN AAP NOT CURRENT    Upon receipt of an AAP for desk audit, the EOS should first determine  whether the AAP is current.  If it is not, the submission should be treated as  if the contractor had failed to submit an AAP.  See Section 2C01 above.      2E01  COMPLETENESS    If the AAP is current, the EOS should review the AAP and support data for  completeness.  To do so, the EOS should first determine whether all materials  requested in the Scheduling Letter and itemized listing, including the Section  503 and 38 U.S.C. 4212 AAPs, have been submitted.  Then the EOS should determine  if the Executive Order and Section 503 and 38 U.S.C. 4212 AAPs contain all  ingredients required by the regulations:    oExecutive Order AAP ingredients required by 41 CFR 60-2.11 and 2.13(a)  through (j);    oRequired Executive Order support data, including the report of prior year  goal progress required by 41 CFR 60-1.40(b) and (c); and    oSection 503 and 38 U.S.C. 4212 AAP ingredients required by 41 CFR  60-741.6(a) through (f) and 41 CFR 60-250.6 (a) through (f) respectively.    2E02 CENTRAL EXECUTIVE ORDER AAP ELEMENT MISSING    If one or more of the following central Executive Order AAP ingredients is  missing, the submission is automatically considered unreasonable and the desk  audit should be suspended and a show cause notice issued:    oA workforce analysis;    oA utilization analysis, including its component parts of job group  formation, availability estimates and, as appropriate, identification of  underutilization; and    oGoals for areas declared underutilized.    If these central ingredients are included, the EOS should then evaluate them  for reasonableness.    2F REVIEW OF EXECUTIVE ORDER AAP FOR REASONABLENESS    For a submission to be considered a reasonable effort to meet the  requirements of 41 CFR Part 60-2, the central Executive Order AAP  ingredients  of workforce analysis, utilization analysis and goals development must meet the  following standards:    2F00  WORKFORCE ANALYSIS    The submission must contain a workforce analysis which lists all  jobs at  the establishment by title (not EEO-1 category, job group or some other  combination of job titles) and by organizational unit, showing at least total  employees, total women and total minorities for each job title.    2F01UTILIZATION ANALYSIS    In the following components of the utilization analysis, the submission must  show:    (a)Job Groups:  An attempt to combine job titles into job groups (defined as  one or more jobs with similar content, wage rates, and opportunities).    (b)Availability Analyses:  An attempt to establish separate availability  estimates for minorities and for women for each job group.    (c)Underutilization Determination:  A comparison of availability to current  incumbency to determine the existence of underutilization.    2F02GOALS    The submission must show an attempt to establish goals for those job groups  identified as underutilized.    2F03  ACTION FOR UNREASONABLE SUBMISSION    If the Executive Order AAP does not meet one or more of these standards for  reasonableness, the desk audit should be suspended and a show cause notice  issued (see Chapter 8).  If the Executive Order AAP is considered reasonable,  the EOS should evaluate the submission for acceptability.    2G REVIEW OF EXECUTIVE ORDER AAP FOR ACCEPTABILITY    2G00GENERAL     Having determined that the elements necessary to proceed with the desk  audit--the workforce analysis, utilization analysis and current goals--are  included in the contractor's submission and are reasonable, the desk audit  proceeds with an evaluation of the acceptability of each required ingredient.   The determination of the acceptability of the items listed on page 4 of the SCRR  will be limited to the evaluation which can be conducted during the desk audit.   This is different from an evaluation of a contractor's implementation of the  requirements, which in most instances cannot be determined without further  investigation onsite (see Chapter 3).      2G01     WORKFORCE ANALYSIS    An acceptable workforce analysis is one which meets the requirements of 41  CFR 60-2.11(a).  It must contain:    oA listing of each job title, as it appears in applicable collective  bargaining agreements or payroll records;    oIn wage rate or salary range order;    oWithin each department or other similar organizational unit, including unit supervision; and    oWhere there are separate work units or lines of progression within the  department or organizational unit, a separate listing must be provided.     More specifically:    (a)Information by Job Title:  Each job title listed must show the total  number of persons in the job title, the total num-ber of men and of women, and  the total number of men and of women in each of the following groups:  Blacks,  Hispanics, Asian/Pacific Islanders, and American Indians/Alaskan Natives.  All  job titles, including managerial job titles,  must be listed.  Positions which  are filled above the estab-lishment level must be included in an establishment's  work-force analysis even though they may be included for goal-setting purposes  in a corporate or mid-level AAP.  In deter-mining whether jobs are listed by  title, the EOS should be alert for the use of plurals in job titles; broad,  general titles, such as ""Manager"" or ""Machine Operator;"" or  inclu- sion of multiple pay ranges for one job title.  The pre- sence of any of  these suggests that jobs may not be listed by title.      (b)Wage Rate:    (1)General:  The wage rate or salary range for each job title must be given  (although this information may be coded--see (2) below).  Titles must be listed  in wage rate or range order within department or other similar organizational  units.  The listing may either be from highest to lowest paid or from lowest to  highest paid.      (2)Coded Data:  Where wage rate or salary range are coded, the contractor  must provide the key to the code onsite.  Any codes must be consistent across  department/unit lines (i.e. a job with a salary code ""57"" in  Department A, pays the same as one coded ""57"" in Department B) and in  wage rate or salary range order within each department or other similar  organization unit.  Also, the submission should include a list of the codes used  in wage/salary order with the highest and lowest codes so labeled.    (c)Organizational Unit:  The organizational units used in the workforce  analysis should be identifiable, and should reflect the contractor's  organizational structure.  If an organizational chart is provided as part of the  supporting documentation, it should be compared to the units used in the  workforce analysis.    (d)Lines of Progression:  Lines of progression or usual promotional  sequences must show the order of jobs in the line through which an employee  moves to reach the top of the line. Lines of progression or promotional  sequences may be identified from collective bargaining agreements as well as  from organizational charts.  If this information is not available at desk audit,  a final determination of acceptability cannot be made until after the onsite review.    2G02JOB GROUPS    Job groups, to be acceptable, must consist of a group of jobs having similar  content, wage rates, and opportunities.    (a)List of Titles in Each Group:  In order for the EOS to assess job group  acceptability, the AAP must include, for each job group, a listing of the job  titles which make up that group.  If such lists have not been provided, the EOS  should immediately contact the contractor and request that such lists be  provided for desk audit.    (b)Criteria for Acceptability:  The following criteria are to be used in  assessing the acceptability of job groups:    (1)Similar work content:  Similarity of work content refers to the duties  and responsibilities of the job titles which make up the job group.  While it is  difficult to confirm similarity without reference to position descriptions, some  steps can be taken during the desk audit to make at least a preliminary  assess-ment of acceptability of work content.  For example:    oAppropriate EEO Category:  The EOS should review the establishment's job  titles that make up each of the job groups to verify they are within the proper  EEO-1 categories.  Job titles in each job group normally would be within the  same EEO-1 category.     oUse of Dictionary of Occupational Titles:  The Dictionary of Occupational  Titles can be referred to, as well as labor agreements, organizational charts,  and other data provided by the contractor, in evaluating the manner in which the  contractor has formulated job groups.  The Dictionary of Occupational Titles  lists standard job titles for  most positions, and codes them based on their  duties, requirements, and other factors.  Descriptions of job duties and  commonly required qualifications are also given.    (2)Similar rates of pay:  Pay rates should be reviewed in conjunction with  job content.  Large apparent differences in pay, when associated with  differences in job title and/or location within an organization, suggest an  unacceptable job grouping.      (3)Similar opportunities:  Opportunity refers to the ability to take  advantage of training opportunities, transfers, promotions, mobility to  desirable wage/ salary situations, and other employment benefits.  Most often,  it refers to upward mobility.  Ideally, each job within a job group should offer  the same opportunities as any other job title within that job group.  As a  result:    oJobs in Separate Unions:  Jobs in separate unions, or jobs in different  departments when interdepartmental mobility is impossible, should not be   grouped together.  For example, nonunion clerical jobs and clerical jobs which  are covered by a collective bargaining agreement should not normally be grouped  together.    oJobs in Lines of Progression:  Jobs that are in lines of progression should  be separated from those that are not.  Where transfer or hire into jobs above  entry level is rare, each line of progression should be analyzed separately.   Where there are lines of progression governed by strict seniority, the job  titles in lines should be considered as a single job group.    (c)Job Groups Must Not Obscure Underutilization:  Job groups which combine  jobs with different content, wages, or opportunities may obscure  underutilization and are not acceptable.  Any job groups that combine jobs in  which minorities or women are concentrated with jobs in which they are  under-represented should be targeted for special scrutiny onsite.  Such job  groups often unacceptably include jobs with different content, wages, or  opportunities.        (d)Effects of Size of Contractor's Workforce:  In assessing the  acceptability of the contractor's job groups, the EOS must remember that the  size of the contractor's workforce is a major factor in determining how well  these three criteria will be met.      (1)Job Groups Must Permit Meaningful Analyses:  Job groups should have  enough incumbents to permit meaningful utilization analyses and goal setting.   Optimally, if a job group is identified as underutilized, it should be large  enough so that a goal of at least one whole person can be established.  No  minimum size has been established for this purpose, however, since it is  dependent not only on the size of the job group, but also on the size of the  availability percentage and the number of minorities or women already in the job  group.    (2)Job Groups Should Not Normally Cross EEO Categories:  Because of the  minimum size of a contractor subject to written AAP requirements, it may not be  possible for any of a smaller contractor's job groups to meet this guideline.   While there are usually two or more job groups within each EEO-1 or EEO-6  category, for smaller contractors some or all of their job groups may  correspond to those categories.  In any event, when job titles are combined to  maintain minimal job group size, EEO category lines should not normally be  crossed.      (e)Relationship Between Job Groups and Availability:  The organization of  jobs into groups allows contractors to tie specific jobs to availability  statistics in order to assess the degree to which their own workforce  representation approximates availability.      2G03AVAILABILITY ANALYSIS - GENERAL      (a)Standard for Acceptability:  The reasonable submission test requires only  that a contractor make an attempt to develop availability estimates.  For the  availability analysis to be found acceptable, however, it must contain a proper  definition of labor area and must show consideration of each of the eight  factors at 41 CFR 60-2.11(b)(1) and (2).      (b)Principles for Evaluation:  In evaluating the acceptability of the  availability analysis, the EOS should be guided by two principles.  First, the  contractor's consideration of each of the factors should reflect its actual  recruitment and employment practices.  Second, the contractor's recruitment and  employment practices should demonstrate the con- tractor's compliance with its  affirmative action and non-discrimination obligations.      (c)Professional Judgement:  The audit of the availability analysis for  acceptability is as much an art as a science.  There are no hard-and-fast, ""mechanical""  methods for evaluating the availability analysis.  The EOS must make a  professional judgement as to the adequacy of the contractor's analysis.  This  requires familiarity with the quality and variety of data available, with  industry and contractor personnel practices, and knowledge of available  recruitment sources.      2G04AVAILABILITY ANALYSIS - DEFINING LABOR AREAS    (a)Importance of Labor Area Definition:  Six of the eight fac-tors for  assessing minority or female availability are tied to the contractor's  definition of labor areas.  How the con-tractor defines its immediate labor area  determines the data used for population, workforce, unemployment/seeking work,  and requisite skills within that immediate area.  How the contractor defines its  reasonable recruitment area determines the data used for requisite skills  within that area.  Definition of both these areas, therefore, heavily impacts  the results of the contractor's availability analysis.  A critical first step in  evaluating the contractor's availability analysis is to assess the  acceptability of both immediate labor area and reasonable recruitment area.    (b)Immediate Labor Area:  In evaluating the contractor's determination of  its immediate labor area, the EOS should consider the following:    (1)Definition:  The immediate labor area is that geographic area from which  employees may reasonably commute to the contractor's establishment.  It may  include one or more contiguous cities, counties or Metropolitan Statistical  Areas (MSAs) or parts thereof, in which the establishment is located.  For  example, it may be defined as the major city in or near which the  establishment is located; the county(ies) surrounding the establishment; the  MSA in which the establishment is located or which borders the establishment; or  a combination of any of the three.  (Note, however, that if the contrac-tor  chooses to combine figures from more than one area, it must be prepared to  provide the raw numbers used to produce the final percentage, since the  percentages themselves cannot be added together).  However defined, the  immediate labor area is normally the same for all job groups.    (2)Must Not Underestimate Availability:  In reviewing the contractor's  definition of immediate labor area, the EOS must ensure that the contractor has  not defined that area in a way that underestimates minority or female  availability.  For example, the definition should not exclude a nearby area with  a large minority workforce.      (3)Commuting Patterns:  In assessing the immediate labor area definition,  the EOS needs to consider commuting patterns, including the availability of  public transportation, approximate normal driving times, etc. in the labor area.      (4)Relationship to EEO/AA Obligations:  The immediate labor area definition  should be consistent with the contractor's nondiscrimination and affirmative  action obligations.  For example, if a contractor's workforce is largely  nonminority and it recruits primarily by word of mouth, defining the immediate  labor area based on the source of applicants may reflect its actual re-  cruitment practices, but does not meet the contractor's affirmative action  obligations (and could, in fact, be found to be discriminatory).  Similarly,  defining the immediate labor area based on residence patterns of current,  nonminority employees, whether as of the time of hire or the time of the review,  may also artificially lower availability for minorities.    (5)Need for Further Investigation:  If the EOS disagrees with the  contractor's definition of the immediate labor area because it appears to  artificially lower the  availability of minorities and women, the EOS should  investigate further onsite to determine whether the contractor, in fact, does  recruit from an area with higher minority/female availability and/or whether the  contractor could expand its area to increase the numbers of minority group  persons and women in the per-centage of available workers.  In this evaluation,  the EOS, based on his or her review experience, may consider where other  nearby employees with similar jobs normally obtain workers.    (6)Sources of Data:  As noted earlier, immediate labor area data are  normally used for factors on population, unemployment/seeking work and  workforce.  For these factors, the contractor should use the best data  available.  Resources for this data include the Research Division of each  State's Division of Employment Security (DES).  This DES Division annually  updates data on population, unemployment/seeking work and workforce for its  State and for MSAs and counties within its State (See Appendix 2B for other  information available from DES).  For a discussion of data on requisite skills  in the immediate labor area, and considerations in their use, see Section  2G05(e) below.    (c)Reasonable Recruitment Area:  The definition of the reason-able  recruitment area is very important in assessing the proportion of minorities and  women available for employment.  It influences the number or proportion of  minorities or women who could--at least theoretically--get through the  contractor's door (be hired) if minority group membership and sex were not taken  into consideration in employment decisions.  In assessing how the contractor has  defined reasonable recruitment area, the EOS should consider the following  factors:    (1)Relationship to Immediate Labor Area:  The reasonable recruiting area  represents the area from which the contractor usually seeks or reasonably could  seek workers for a particular job group.  It may coincide with the immediate  labor area, or it may cover a larger area (state, region, or nation).  Thus,  while the immediate labor area is normally the same for all job groups, the  reasonable recruitment area will vary depending on the types of jobs in the job  group.    (2)Pay and Skill Levels:  Generally, the scope of the reasonable recruitment  area is closely related to pay, based on the assumption that the more a job  pays, the farther people are willing to go to apply for it.  Also, because there  is often a relationship between pay levels and skill levels, for job groups  containing jobs with minimal to intermediate skill requirements, the reasonable  recruiting area will often be the same as the immediate labor area.  As pay  levels and skill requirements increase, however, the likelihood that recruiting  will expand beyond the immediate labor area also increases.      (3)Supply and Demand:  In addition to pay and skills, supply and demand  plays a part in defining the scope of the reasonable recruiting area.  For  example, at times when nurses are in short supply, it may be necessary to expand  recruitment efforts beyond the immediate labor area.  At other times, the supply  of nurses available in the immediate labor area exceeds the demand, and may   reduce the reasonable recruiting area.  Supply and demand can also be influenced  by the specificity of skills required by the contractor.  For example, while the  supply of teachers generally may exceed demand, the demand for teachers with  specific skills, such as math     or science, may exceed the supply and result in an expansion of the  recruitment area.  Further, high unemployment in one area may create a labor  surplus which effectively expands the ""reasonable recruitment area""  elsewhere.  For example, when unemployment is high, persons often search for  work in a wider area, becoming more willing to either relocate or to commute  further to a job than they normally would.  As a result, the ""reasonable  recruitment area"" for other areas expands.    (4)Summary:  As a result, while in most instances job groups in the Service  Worker, Laborer, Operative,  Office and Clerical and retail Sales categories  tend to have reasonable recruitment areas which are the same as the immediate  labor area, this will not always be the case.  Jobs in the Crafts and  Technicians categories are often particularly susceptible to supply and demand  factors related to level and specificity of skill required.  Therefore, while  in most instances, such jobs tend to have reasonable recruitment areas which  coin-cide with the immediate labor area, some job groups within the categories  may have a broader recruitment area.  Similarly, while job groups in the Sales  (non-retail), Professional, and Officials and Managers categories usually have  reasonable recruitment areas which are larger than the immediate labor area (and  often significantly larger, e.g. national), this will not always be the case.      (5)Sources of Data:  See Section 2G05(e) below.       2G05  AVAILABILITY ANALYSIS - EIGHT FACTORS    The contractor's AAP must show, for each job group, consideration of each of  the eight factors for minorities and each of the eight factors for women.  All  factors are expressed as the percentage that minorities or women are among all  persons who meet the factor.  These factors are as follows:    (a)The minority population of the labor area surrounding the facility (Refer  to 41 CFR 60-2.11(b)(1)(i)):  The extent to which this factor is given  consideration in determining the final availability factor for a given job group  will depend on whether or not that job group contains entry level posi- tions  which are filled primarily through outside hire and which require minimal or no  prior skills.  Job groups which fall into the Service Worker, Laborer, and to  some extent, Operatives EEO-1 categories will be more likely to incorpor-ate  minority population percentages into the final availability estimate than  would job groups requiring more specialized skills, such as those falling into  the Technician or Professional categories.      (b)The availability of women seeking employment in the labor or recruitment  area of the contractor (Refer to 41 CFR 60-2.11 (b)(2)(v):  The figure used may  be based on the percentage that unemployed women are among all unemployed  persons in the labor area (41 CFR 60-2.11(b)(2)(i)), since that rate includes  only persons actively seeking work; the percentage of women applying for work at  the local unemployment service office in job categories comparable to those in  the contractor's job groups; or the contractor's prior year applicant flow for  women for that job group.  Generally, the highest figure should be used.  As  with  minority population, inclusion of this figure in developing final  availability estimates for a particular job group will depend on whether or not  the job group is entry level, is filled through outside hire, and requires  little or no prior skills or experience.  The less skill required, the more  consideration this factor should receive.    (c)The size of the minority/female unemployment force in the labor area  surrounding the facility (Refer to 41 CFR 60-2.11(b)(1)(ii) and 41 CFR  60-2.11(b)(2)(i)):  The figure used should be the percentage that unemployed  minorities (or women) are among all unemployed persons in the labor area.   Please note that this is not the same as unemployment rate, which is generally  expressed as the percentage of a given group that is unemployed--e.g., the  percentage that unemployed minorities are among all minorities in the  workforce (employed plus unemployed).  As with minority population and women  seeking employment, the size of the minority/female unemployment force should  receive greater consideration where job groups are entry level, filled by  outside hire, and require little or no skill or experience.  The factor will  receive less consideration where job groups are above entry level, require more  skill or are filled solely or primarily through internal placement.    (d)The percentage of the minority/female workforce as compared with the  total workforce in the immediate labor area (Refer to 41 CFR 60-2.11(b)(1)(iii)  and 41 CFR 60-2.11(b)(2)(ii)): The percentage of minorities/females in the  workforce will have greater applicability for those job groups which draw from a  larger recruiting pool (entry level, filled through external hire, and requiring  few or no skills).  For those job groups which draw from a smaller recruiting  pool (those above entry level, with higher skill requirements, and/or filled  solely or primarily through internal placement), this factor is likely to have  less importance.  (Note:  The term workforce is used elsewhere in the  regulations to mean the incumbent employees of the contractor (e.g., workforce  analysis).  However, as used here in the availability analysis, the term  workforce is synonymous with the term ""labor force"" as defined by the  Census Bureau and other government agencies--e.g., as those persons in the  population, aged 16 and older who are either employed or unemployed (unemployed  is further defined as actively seeking employment).    (e)Requisite Skills:    oThe general availability of minorities/women having requisite skills in the  immediate labor area (Refer to 41 CFR 60-2.11(b)(1)(iv) and 41 CFR 60-2.11(b)(2)  (iii));      oThe availability of minorities/women having requisite skills in an area in  which the contractor can reasonably recruit (Refer to 41 CFR 60-2.11(b)(1)(v)  and 41 CFR 60-2.11(b)(2)(iv));    In assessing these factors, contractors should use the best data available.   While the most recent decennial census data normally provide the most detailed  information on requisite skills, they become increasingly outdated the more  years it has been since the census was conducted.  Also, the decennial census shows only persons employed in a given occupa tion at the time the census was conducted, rather than those with the skills  to be employed in that occupation.  Therefore, the following adjustments to decennial census data are normally needed:    (1)Adjustment for Time Since the Last Decennial Census: Some State Divisions  of Employment Security continue to publish periodic updates of decennial census  data on occupations of persons employed in labor areas within their State.   While these updates are often for fairly broad job categories, they provide a  reliable means of update for job categories where skills are normally  not very  specialized (i.e. service workers, laborers, operatives, entry-level clerical,  retail sales), and at least an indication of overall trends in job categories  where skills often are specialized (see Section 2G05(e) (4) below).   Additionally, for job groups which do have legitimate specialized education  requirements, any available data on the percentage of minority and/or female  graduates at the level (Associates, Bachelor's, etc.) and in the field involved  may be used to update census data.  Since, in many fields, minority and female  enrollment has risen since the last decennial census, these data are often  considerably more accurate than the census as a measure of requisite skills for:   (1) entry-level jobs which legitimately require a particular level and type of  post-high school degree; and (2) such jobs above entry (i.e. with legitimate  experience as well as degree requirements), if the data are corrected for the  year of degree.      (2)Adjustment for Employment vs. Requisite Skills:  The adjustment discussed  immediately above for recent graduates also provides some correction for the  census' focus on persons employed in a given occupation when the census was  conducted.  Additionally, however, care must be taken to ensure that such census  data do not, in effect, perpetuate past discrimination against mi- norities or  women in certain occupations and/or out-dated ""job applied for""  patterns.  This is particularly important for jobs in which, in terms of basic  skill requirements, the availability of minorities and/or women has long been  considerably better than their representation--for example, some management,  professional and sales training programs in which the major legitimate  requirement is a college degree.  Similarly, in entry-level blue collar jobs  where the contractor provides training--and the major skill requirement,  therefore, is ""trainability""-- past employment patterns may simply  reflect who employers in the area choose to train rather than true availability  (which in this situation should normally approximate labor area workforce  representation).      (3)Match Between Data and Skills:  The particular requisite skills  classification(s) from which the data are obtained should closely approximate  the skills required for performance in the job group.  The closeness of the  match between data and skills will depend on how much job content varies within  the job group and the degree of detail in the source data for requisite skills.      (i)Varied Job Content:  Where job content is quite varied (i.e. a Scientist  I job group composed of Chemists and Physicists), the contractor may either  refine the job group further, where appropriate, or combine requisite skills  data for the two or more types of jobs in the group.  Where the data are  combined, the contractor should have available the raw numbers from which the  average percentage was derived.    (ii)Degree of Detail in Data:  The most refined data available are usually  those contained in the most recent decennial census.  Detailed census data are  available from, among other sources, the National Technical Information Service  (NTIS) of the U.S. Department of Commerce (see Appendix 2B).  The NTIS's Report  #5, ""Equal Employment Indicators,"" contains decennial census  information on the employment of minorities and women in 503 job  classifications.  Data from other sources may be considerably broader.  For  example, State Divisions of Employment Security that continue to update  occupational data usually do so for a limited number of job categories, similar  to but not the same as EEO categories.  In the case of either very broad or very  refined data, some adjustment may be needed to approximate requisite skills for  a particular job group.      (4)Adjustment for Broad Data:  Data based on broad job categories (e.g. ""Professionals"")  may either overstate or understate availability.  For example, if the job group  consists of engineering titles, using data for ""all Professionals""  (which includes primary and secondary school teachers) will usually overstate  minority and female availability.  On the other hand, if the job group is  nurses, data on ""all Professionals"" will substantially understate  female availability.  Thus, while the contractor may make adjustment for broad  data, the EOS should evaluate the direction and degree of adjustment made given  the job group involved.    (5)Adjustment for Narrow Data:  Where data based on narrow job categories  are used, they may sometimes show no minorities or women for particular job  titles (either because there were none at the time the census was taken, or  because the actual number was so low as to cause the number to be ""suppressed.""    Where this occurs, contractors should be encouraged to broaden the area of  consideration to include other, related categories, which do show minorities  and/or women.     (f)The availability of promotable and transferable minority/fe-male  employees within the contractor's organization (Refer to 41 CFR  60-2.11(b)(1)(vi) and 41 CFR 60-2.11(b)(2)(vi)).    This is the percentage of minorities/women who are in feeder job groups and  who are (at the start of the AAP year) or who will become (during the AAP year)  promotable or transferra-ble from those job groups into the job group under  consideration.    In evaluating this factor for acceptability:     (1) Determine the Accuracy of Feeder Job Groups:  The EOS should identify  the feeder job groups, if any, from which individuals are, or reasonably could  be, promoted or transferred to the job group under consideration.    oThe EOS can determine actual feeder job groups by examining where persons  who were promoted or transferred into the job group under consideration came  from.  This may be done by identifying the  previous job group of persons who  entered the  target job group during the last AAP year and/or--where that  activity has been too limited to be representative--through examination of the  work histories of persons in the target job group to determine their immediately  preceding job group.  Feeder groups may also be identified through review of  labor agreements and/or written promotion/transfer policies.     oThe EOS, however, should be observant of any indications that the skills  brought by promotees/    transferees to the target job group are similarly available in other  potential feeder groups, particularly if those other potential feeder groups  have substantially better representation of minor-ities or women.  Where this is  the case, the contractor should broaden its feeder group defini-tion,  consistent with its affirmative action obligations.    (2)Percentage of Minorities/Women:  The contractor may  conclude that the  percentage of promotable minorities/ women in the feeder job groups is  approximately equivalent to their representation in those groups.  Where,  however, there are legitimate seniority or special qualification requirements  for promotion/transfer to the target job group, the contractor may identify  those persons who are or will become qualified during the AAP year and the  percentage that minorities/women represent among those persons (for a discussion  of ""legitimate"" qualification requirements, see Chapters 3 and 7).   Where the contractor identifies specific promotable/ transferable persons, this  can be verified by identifying the legitimate criteria used in determining who  is promotable or transferrable, and by reviewing the employment histories of  persons in the feeder job groups.      (3)Relevance of Factor:  The importance of this factor will be related to  whether the contractor normally fills jobs in the target job group by promotion  from within or by hire.  Review of employment activity for the prior AAP year  will show the proportion of placements which resulted from internal movement as  opposed to new hire.  Where this activity has been too limited to be  representative, the work histories of persons in the target group may be  reviewed to determine the proportion who came via promotion or transfer vs. by  new hire.  In addition, labor agreements often contain rules governing promotion  and transfer for jobs in certain sectors of the workforce.    (g)The existence of training institutions capable of training persons in the  requisite skills (Refer to 41 CFR 60-2.11(b) (1)(vii)and 41 CFR  60-2.11(b)(2)(vii)):  This may be the percentage of minorities and women  enrolled in those educational and training institutions serving the  contractor's recruitment needs.      (1)Sources of Data:  Contractors should contact those educational and  training institutions with programs which match their employment needs.  These  can range from local high schools with business or vocational programs through  local technical schools to colleges nationwide.  Such institutions should be  able to provide data on the number and percentage of minorities and women  enrolled in programs appropriate to the contractor's employment needs.     (2)Relevance of Factor:  The extent to which the contrac- tor considers this  factor will depend on the degree to which new graduates of such programs are or  can be utilized in making placements to a particular job group.  For example, a  contractor filling positions in an entry-level clerical job group may hire new  graduates from local high schools and business colleges, but may hire only  experienced persons for a non-entry level clerical job group.     (h)The degree of training which the contractor is reasonably able to  undertake as a means of making all job classes available to minorities/women  (Refer to 41 CFR 60-2.11(b) (1)(viii) and 41 CFR 60-2.11(b)(2)(viii)):  This  factor requires the contractor to make an assessment of the number of employees  who could, with appropriate training, become promotable or transferrable during  the AAP year, and to determine what percentage minorities/women constitute of  that number.     (i)Data Used Must Be Accurate:  Data used for each availability factor must  be accurate and up-to-date.  Sources of data must be identified in the AAP.    (j)Consideration of Each Factor:  The contractor must consider each factor  and must explain in its AAP how it has done so. It may not be necessary,  however, for the contractor to make each factor a part of any final availability  estimate.  Only those factors which are relevant to the actual availability of  the job group under evaluation need be used.  Moreover, contractors may give  differential consideration (e.g., by mathematical weighting or by other means)  to some or all of the individual factors in determining final availability     estimates for each job group.  Where a contractor gives such differential  consideration to factors, the AAP should specifically identify the weights  applied or other methods used.  If the AAP contains no explanation of how the  contractor has considered each factor, or if an explanation is provided but  further investigation and verification is needed  (e.g., if the AAP states that  certain job groups are filled solely by internal means, and this cannot be  verified from the AAP), the EOS should plan to address the matter onsite.    (k)Summary Guidelines For Audit of Acceptability:  In summary, in evaluating  a contractor's final availability estimates for acceptability, the following  general guidelines can be used:    (1)Entry Level Jobs, No Special Skills/Experience:  For entry level jobs  which do not require any special skills or experience, availability for  minorities and women should be close to their workforce participation rates;      (2)Entry Level Jobs, Some Skills/Experience:  For entry level jobs which  require some skills (education and/or experience), availability for minorities  and women should be at least equal to the requisite skills figure for either the  reasonable recruiting area or immediate recruiting area, whichever figure is  larger;    (3)Jobs Filled Through Internal Means Only:  For jobs which are filled  solely through internal means, availability should normally be at least equal to  the percentage which minorities and women represent in all appropriate feeder  job groups.      2G06IDENTIFICATION OF UNDERUTILIZATION    The regulations at 41 CFR 60-2.11(b) define underutilization as ""...having  fewer minorities or women in a particular job group than would reasonably be  expected by their availability.""  Contractors are required in the AAP to  compare availability to incumbency for each job group, and to identify those job  groups which are underutilized.  In evaluating the acceptability of the method  used by a contractor to determine underutilization, EOSs must ensure that the  method used conforms to the requirements of the regulations, that it is  appropriate, and that it has been accurately applied.    2G07GOALS    Having identified a job group as underutilized for minorities and/or women,  the contractor must establish employment goals and exert every good faith effort  toward meeting them.  Such goals must be established separately for minorities  and women.  In setting goals, the contractor should consider:     (a)Level of Goals:  Goals for an underutilized job group must be at least  equal to the percentage availability of minorities or women (as appropriate)  for the job group, as determined by a properly developed utilization analysis  which considers at least those factors discussed in section 2G05 above (see 41  CFR 60-2.11(b)).    (b)Goals Are not Quotas:  41 CFR 60-2.12(e) indicates that goals "". . .  may not be rigid and inflexible quotas which must be met, but must be targets  reasonable attainable by means of applying every good faith effort to make all  aspects of the entire affirmative action program work.""    (c)Separate Goals by Particular Minority Group:  Where appropriate,  separate goals may also be required by particular minority group(s) or by sex  within a particular minority group if there is a substantial disparity in the  utilization of a particular minority group or of men or women of a particular  minority group.  Where the EOS identifies such a substantial disparity (see  Section 2K01(d) and the instructions for SCRR page 7) and the contractor has  not estab-lished a separate goal, the EOS will first determine if the disparity  represents potential discrimination.  If potential discrimination is not found,  separate affirmative action goals to eliminate the disparity may be required  (see 41 CFR 60-2.12(l)).  In order to ensure that such goals are reasonable,  they should be based on a separate availability analysis for the minority group  (or men or women of the minority group) involved in the job group(s) where the  disparity is observed.      2G08ADOPTING AN EEO POLICY    41 CFR 60-2.13(a) requires that a contractor commit itself, in writing, to a  policy of equal employment opportunity in all personnel actions.  The policy  statement must be in the AAP.  It should be signed by the top establishment  official and dated.  It must be reaffirmed annually.  41 CFR 60-2.20 provides  guidance for evaluating the content of the contractor's EEO policy statement.      2G09DISSEMINATION OF THE POLICY    41 CFR 60-2.13(b) requires that the AAP provide for formal inter-nal and  external dissemination of the contractor's policy.  To be acceptable, the AAP  must address how the policy is disseminated, internally and externally.  41 CFR  60-2.21 provides guidance for evaluating dissemination of the policy.  For  example, the AAP may state that the policy is posted in conspicuous places  accessible to employees and applicants for employment, and that the policy is  discussed with management employees having responsibility for making employment  decisions.  External dissemination may include notifying recruitment sources,  community organizations, subcontractors and labor unions, where applicable, of  its policy on equal employment opportunity and affirmative action.     2G10RESPONSIBILITY FOR IMPLEMENTATION    Under 41 CFR 60-2.13(c), contractors are required to provide for the  implementation of the AAP.  To be acceptable, the AAP must identify the person  who is responsible for implementation of the policy and must describe how the  policy is implemented, in sufficient detail for the EOS to be able to audit  compliance.  Guidance as to the types of actions a contractor may take to  implement this requirement is provided at 41 CFR 60-2.22.  For example, an EEO  officer is central to the success of the affirm-ative action program, since he  or she is responsible for ensuring that the contractor takes steps to implement  the AAP.  The AAP should identify the EEO Officer by name and/or title, and may  describe his or her duties and responsibilities as well as those of line  managers with respect to EEO.      2G11IDENTIFICATION OF PROBLEM AREAS    41 CFR 60-2.13(d) requires that problem areas (or deficiencies) be  identified by organizational unit and by job group.  41 CFR 60-2.23 provides  additional guidance on some types of self-analyses which contractors may conduct  in identifying problem areas.  To be acceptable, the AAP must provide evidence  that the contractor has addressed the following:    (a)Employment Processes:  The contractor must examine its basic employment  processes (recruitment, hiring, training, promotion, transfer, termination) to identify any impediments to the full utilization of minorities and women.  To do so, in its AAP, the contractor may  use any analysis that measures how these processes affect minorities and women.   For example, the contractor may use Impact Ratio Analyses (NOTE:  Please also  see Sections 2H01(a) and 2O04 of this Chapter for the contractor's obligations  under 41 CFR Part 60-3 to maintain employment activity data and analyze them for  adverse impact.  While not a required AAP ingredient, the    contractor may choose to use this analysis as a tool for problem  identification in this section of its AAP).    (b)Organizational Unit:  The contractor must examine the distribution of  minorities and women among its organization-al units.  To do so, the contractor  may use any analysis that identifies any problem areas in such distribution, for  example, the contractor may use a Job Area Acceptance Range (JAAR) type analysis  to identify areas of minority or female concentration/underrepresentation)  and/or a utilization analysis applied to job groups within such units.    2G12ESTABLISHMENT OF GOALS AND OBJECTIVES - GOALS BY ORGANIZATIONAL UNIT       41 CFR 60-2.13(e) requires that goals and objectives by organ-izational unit  as well as job group be established to correct identifiable deficiencies.  Goals  by organizational unit, however, refer to action-oriented efforts rather than  percentage goals.  Where problem areas by organizational unit have been  identified in accordance with 41 CFR 60-2.13(d), the AAP must include a  description of the efforts which the contractor has taken or will take to  correct those problem areas. This correc-tive action may be addressed in the AAP  section on Development of Action-Orientated Programs (below), and may include  goals for the improvement of recruitment efforts, dissemination of additional  information on job openings (e.g., pay, opportunities, duties), encouraging  transfers and promotions, creating training opportunities, etc.      2G13DEVELOPMENT AND EXECUTION OF ACTION-ORIENTED PROGRAMS    41 CFR 60-2.13(f) requires the development and execution of action-oriented  programs to correct identified problem areas and to attain established goals and  objectives.  41 CFR 60-2.24 provides suggested standards which the EOS can use  to assess the contractor's compliance with this requirement.  For example, the  contractor may commit to increasing the number of qualified minorities and women  in the appropriate candidate pool, since with more women and minorities in the  candidate pool, the logical outcome, absent discrimination, is an increase in  the number of minorities and women hired, promoted, etc.     (a)Contractor Responsibility:  It is the contractor's responsibility to both  develop and execute action-oriented programs.  However, it is the EOS'  responsibility to make a professional judgement as to:    (1)Specificity:  Whether the action-oriented programs are sufficiently  specific and result-oriented to accomplish the aims for which they were created;  and     (2)Execution:  Whether the action-oriented programs were properly executed.      (b)Specific Action-Oriented Programs:  A specific action-oriented program is  one that indicates what the action is, who will accomplish it, how it will be  accomplished and when it will be accomplished.  An action-oriented program  without any one of these ingredients cannot be considered specific.  Action-oriented programs designed to increase candidate pools can be developed  in two stages, (1) steps to be taken immediately to develop internal pools and  to establish a link with potential external pools; and (2) steps to be taken  each time a vacancy occurs in an underutilized area.    (c)Results-Oriented Programs:  A results-oriented action program is one  tailored in such a way that proper execution will result either in an increase  in the minority group/female representation in the job group, if vacancies occur, or clear  documentation of contractor action sufficient to constitute good faith effort.   An action-oriented program that does not meet this standard cannot be considered  results-oriented.    (d)Acceptability of Action Items:  The AAP's action items must be  sufficient, if implemented in good faith, to ensure that each of its specific  objectives and the overall intent of equal employment opportunity are achieved.      2G14INTERNAL AUDIT AND REPORTING    41 CFR 60-2.13(g) requires the contractor to design and implement internal  audit and reporting systems which measure the effectiveness of its total  affirmative action program.  This system must be detailed in its AAP.  The  system must permit adequate monitoring of progress made toward goal  accomplishment and implementation of other affirmative action commitments.    (a)Guidelines for Assessing Acceptability:  The regulations at 41 CFR  60-2.25 provide guidance for assessing the acceptability of a contractor's  internal audit and reporting system.  An acceptable audit and reporting system  is one which allows the contractor to measure the effectiveness of its total  program.  Such a system should include specific procedures for monitoring goals  progress and analyzing employment activity.    (b)Monitoring Goals Progress:  Since utilization and availability analyses  are conducted by job group, and where problems are identified, goals are  established by job group, monitoring of goals progress should be at least by  job group.  The importance of effective internal audit and reporting systems in  goal areas is further underscored by 41 CFR 60-1.40(c), which requires that the  results of the AAP shall be compiled annually (see Section 2H00 below).      (c)Monitoring Personnel Activity:  Audit and reporting systems should also  monitor personnel activity (e.g., hires, promotions/transfers, terminations, and other activity) at least by job group and, where appropriate, by organizational unit.  The regulations at 41 CFR  60-1.40(b) require that a contractor's analysis include hiring practices,  upgrading, transfer and promotion for the past year.    (d)Information to be Maintained:  The regulations at 41 CFR 60-3.4 and  60-3.15A require that contractors with 100 or more employees: (1) maintain and  have available for each job, records sufficient to disclose the impact of the  selection process for that job on women and on each minority group for whom  EEO-1 reporting is required; and (2) conduct adverse impact analyses for women  and for each minority group that constitutes 2% or more of the relevant labor  area or of the  applicable internal workforce.  Where a contractor deter-    mines that a selection process has an adverse impact, evi-dence of validity,  as described in 41 CFR Part 60-3 must also be maintained and made available.   Contractors with fewer than 100 employees must maintain the records set forth in  41 CFR 60-3.15A(1)--e.g. the number of applicants and persons hired, promoted  and terminated by sex and by each minority group (as defined in (d)(1) above)  which consti-    tutes 2% or more of the labor force in the relevant labor area.  Such small  employers, however, are not required to conduct adverse impact analyses of these  data.  See further discussion under Sections 2H01(a) and 2O04 below and in  Questions and Answers Nos. 82-88 of Adoption of Questions and Answers to Clarify  and Provide a Common Interpretation of the Uniform Guidelines on Employee  Selection Procedures.      2G15SEX DISCRIMINATION GUIDELINES    The regulations at 41 CFR 60-2.13(h) require that the AAP contain evidence  of the contractor's compliance with the Sex Discrimina-    tion Guidelines at 41 CFR Part 60-20.  The requirements of the Executive  Order are deemed to preempt any State or local laws restricting the employment  of women.  See 41 CFR 60-2.31 and 41 CFR 60-20.3(f).      To be acceptable, the AAP must address each of the required subitems listed  in the regulations; specifically 41 CFR 60-20.2 through 60-20.6.  The contractor  should delineate in the AAP how each subitem is being implemented.  These  subitems include, but are not limited to:     (a)Conditions of Employment (Refer to 41 CFR 60-20.3, 60-20.4, 60-20.5 and  60-20.6):  A contractor must not make a distinc-tion based on sex in conditions  of employment.  Where State laws provide special minimum wages, overtime pay, or  brief rest periods for women, these benefits must also be given to men.  In  addition, contractors may not use these laws as bases for refusing to hire women  or for limiting their hours of work, etc.  AAPs must provide for the elimination  of any policies, procedures, or working conditions inconsistent with the  requirement of equal treatment.      (b)Distinctions Based on Marital Status (Refer to 41 CFR 60-20.3(d)):  Any  distinction between married and unmarried persons must apply equally to both  sexes.  For example, a contractor cannot refuse to hire women with young  children unless it applies the same exclusionary policy to men.      (c)Bona Fide Occupational Qualification (BFOQ) (Refer to 41 CFR 60-20.3(b)):   A contractor must consider women as well as men for all jobs, unless sex is a  bona fide occupational qualification (BFOQ).  Under Title VII, sex has been  found to be a BFOQ for a job only in extremely rare instances.  Among these have  been:    (1)Authenticity:  Jobs involving a need for authenticity or genuineness,  such as actors or models.    (2)Personal Privacy:  Jobs where the performance of essen-tial job elements  would entail substantial invasion of personal privacy (for example, a permanent  restroom attendant).  This is limited to situations where the normal operation  of the contractor's business depends on the employee being of the same sex as  its employees or customers and there is no other way that privacy could be  ensured.  IMPORTANT:  This is different from customer preference.  For example,  a contractor cannot refuse to hire female salespersons in the belief that they  will not be as well accepted by customers as males.     (d)Employment Opportunities (Refer to 41 CFR 60-20.3(b), 3(c) and 5(b):    (1)Hazardous Jobs:  A contractor may not exclude women from a job it may  believe is dangerous or unsuitable for women to perform unless sex is a BFOQ  (see Section 2G15(c) above).    (2)Reproductive Hazards:  OFCCP follows Title VII prin-ciples when  determining whether a policy excluding     women from a job because of a concern about reproduc-tive hazards is  discriminatory.  If a question relat-ing to reproductive hazards arises during a  compliance review, the EOS should consult, through appropriate channels, with  the Regional Solicitor's Office.    (e)Wage Discrimination (Refer to 41 CFR 60-20.3(c) and 41 CFR 60-20.5(a)and  (b)):  A contractor must compensate employees without regard to sex.  The most  obvious form of wage discrimination occurs when men and women are paid different   wages for performing the same jobs, or jobs which are substantially equal.       (f)Employment Advertising (Refer to 41 CFR 60-20.2(b)):  A con-tractor's  advertisements in newspapers or other media must not express a sex preference  unless the job is one for which sex is a BFOQ (see Section 2G15(c) above).  The  placement of ads in columns headed ""male"" or ""female"" (or ""male  interest"" or ""female interest"") or which otherwise indicate an  orien-tation with regard to sex is considered an expression of preference,  limitation, or specification based on sex and is prohibited.    (g)Employee Benefits:  Refer to discussion of this issue in Chapter 3.     (h)Maternity Leave:  Refer to discussion of this issue in Chapter 3.    2G16SUPPORT OF COMMUNITY ACTION PROGRAMS    The AAP must address the contractor's active support of local and national  community action programs and community service programs which are designed to  improve the employment opportunities of mi-norities and women, as required by 41  CFR 60-2.13(i).  The regu- lations at 41 CFR 60-2.26 provide guidance on the  types of activ-ities which demonstrate active support of local and national  com-munity action and community service programs.  Among these are the  appointment of key members of management to serve on the boards of such  organizations, and active participation in pro- grams for youth sponsored by the  National Alliance of Business-men.  To be acceptable, the AAP should identify  the programs supported, and indicate the type of support (i.e., personnel,  equipment, etc.) given to local and national programs designed to improve  employment opportunities for minorities and women.  The EOS should be familiar  with the types of programs available, both locally and nationally.  The types of  programs, and the degree of support provided, should be consistent with the  nature of the problems identified in the AAP, and may form a component part of  the contractor's organizational goals and development of action programs.    2G17CONSIDERATION OF MINORITIES AND WOMEN NOT CURRENTLY IN THE WORKFORCE      The regulations at 41 CFR 60-2.13(j) require that the AAP address the  contractor's consideration of minorities and women not cur- rently in the  workforce having requisite skills who can be re- cruited through affirmative  action measures.  To be acceptable, the AAP should specify the contractor's  involvement with programs which facilitate the employment of minorities and  women.  Pro- grams offered by the contractor could include providing part-time  employment, flexible hours (flexitime) or dependent care bene-fits, as well as  participating in high school or college co-op programs, particularly with  educational institutions with signi-ficant minority and/or female enrollments.       2HREVIEW OF EXECUTIVE ORDER SUPPORT DATA FOR ACCEPTABILITY    2H00REPORT ON GOALS    41 CFR 60-1.40(c) requires that the contractor prepare a report of results  of its prior year AAP.  This report is part of the support data for the AAP, and  is requested on the itemized list-ing enclosed with the Scheduling Letter  (Figure 2-2a, paragraph f).  The listing requests summary data and information  indicating the numerical and other results of affirmative action goals for each  job group for the current year and for the preceding year.  For each goal not  attained (prior year) or not being attained (current year), the contractor is  requested to describe its good faith efforts.  Prior year data should always be  submitted, unless the contractor was not previously covered by 41 CFR     Part 60-2; current year data should be provided at least where the  contractor is six months or more into its current AAP year at the time it  receives the Scheduling Letter.      (a)Data Required:  As noted above, the contractor must provide summary data  indicating the numerical results of affirmative action goals for each job group.       (1)Information on Job Groups with Goals:  To measure results of goals, one  must first know for which job groups goals were established and what those goals  were.  The contractor's current AAP submitted for desk audit will show this  information for current year goals.  Where the contractor's report on prior year  goals does not specifically state what the prior year goals were, the EOS will  contact the contractor and request that a copy of the goals section of its prior  year AAP be forwarded to permit evaluation of prior year goals progress.    (2)Information on Placements into Job Groups with Goals: Since an annual  goal is established in terms of a per- centage placement rate, evaluating  progress towards it requires knowledge of the total number of placements into  the job group and the number of minority or female placements, as appropriate.   If the contractor's prog-ress report does not give this information or gives it  only in part (i.e., the number of minority/female but not total placements,  etc.), the EOS will determine if the information can be extracted from the  contractor's submission of personnel activity data.  If it cannot be so  extracted, the EOS will contact the contractor and ask that it forward a copy of  reports on goals progress prepared under its internal audit and reporting  systems (41 CFR 60-2.13(g)) and/or, if the contractor employs 100 or more  persons, a copy of the underlying data it used for its adverse impact  determinations on hires, promotions and any other placements into job titles  within the job group (see Section 2H01(a)(2) below).      (b)Good Faith Effort:  Where the contractor's report does not describe its  good faith efforts in a job group where a goal was established but not attained,  or does not describe those efforts in sufficient detail for the EOS to evaluate  their adequacy, the EOS will include the job group as part of the onsite plan  for evaluation of good faith effort (SCRR page     11).    2H01 PERSONNEL ACTIVITY DATA    The itemized listing enclosed with the Scheduling Letter requests  information on personnel activities (e.g., selection--applicant flow and hiring,  promotion and transfer, and terminations) for the prior and current ""goal""  (AAP) years.  The listing requests that the data be provided by race (meaning by  each minority group for whom EEO-1 reporting is required) and sex for each job  group, but permits a contractor to submit the information ""...in the form  in which it is available.""     (a)When Data Are Not Submitted:  If, in response to the Scheduling Letter,  the contractor does not submit any personnel activity data, or does not submit  data for one or more of the activity elements of applicants, hires, promotions  or terminations, a Show Cause Notice should be issued.    (1)If a Show Cause Notice is being issued at desk audit for other reasons  (e.g., see Sections 2C01 and 2F), the failure to submit the activity data will  be included in that Notice.    (2)If the only reason a Show Cause Notice is being issued is failure to  submit the activity data, see Chapter 8, Figure 8-3.    Revised 5-25-90    (b) Regulatory Citations:    (1)General Data Requirements under the Uniform Guidelines on Employee  Selection Procedures (41 CFR Part 60-3):    41 CFR 60-3.4(A) requires that each contractor "". . . maintain and have  available for inspection records or other information which will disclose the  impact which its . . . selection procedures have upon the employment  opportunities of persons by identifiable race, sex, or ethnic groups. . .""   Such identifiable groups are defined by 41 CFR 60-3.4(B) as those groups for  whom     EEO-1 reporting is required--i.e., Blacks, Hispanics, Asian/Pacific  Islanders, American Indians/Alaskan Natives--along with Whites and totals.    (2)Data Requirements under 41 CFR Part 60-3 for Contractors with 100 or More  Employees*:  Contractors with 100 or more employees are more specifically  required by 41 CFR 60-3.15A(2) to maintain and have available records for each  job on applicants, hires, promotions and terminations (and any other selection  decisions) by sex and by each minority group for whom EEO-1 reporting is  required (also see Sections 2G14(d) and 2O04(a)).     (3)41 CFR Part 60-2 Requirements:  In addition to the basic record keeping  requirements in 41 CFR 60-3.4 and 60-3.15, the requirements discussed earlier in  this Chapter that the AAP identify problem areas (41 CFR    60-2.13(d)) and include internal audit and reporting systems (41 CFR  60-2.13(g)) may be cited because they cannot be acceptably implemented without  maintenance and analysis of the basic data on employment activity required by 41  CFR 60-3.4 and 60-3.15.  Failure to submit specific types of employment activity  may be cited as follows:    (a)Applicant Flow and Hires:  41 CFR 60-2.12(m) requires that the AAP  contain, as part of the supporting data, applicant flow data and applicant  rejection ratios (hiring IRAs) indicating minority and sex status. Such  applicant rejection ratios cannot be computed without data on hires by minority  group and sex.  Also, 41 CFR 60-1.40(b)(2) requires that the AAP contain an  analysis of hiring practices for the past year (including recruitment sources  and testing).    __________    *Simplified record keeping requirements for employers of under 100 persons  are described at 41 CFR 60-3.15A(1), and summarized in 2G14(d).  They are not  reiterated here because OFCCP only occasionally reviews supply and service  contractors with under 100 employees.    Revised 5-25-90    (b)Promotions (Transfers, Upgrading Generally):  41 CFR 60-1.40(b)(3)  requires that the AAP include an analysis of upgrading, transfer, and promotion  for the past year.    (c) Review of Data Submitted for Acceptability    (1)Data Format:  To be acceptable for desk audit, the data must be presented  either by job group (as requested in the Scheduling Letter) or by job title (as  required by 41 CFR Part 60-3; see Section 2H01(b)(1) and (2)     above.  If data are submitted in some larger aggrega-tion than job group,  see Section 2H01(d) below.  For example, data by total workforce are not  acceptable, nor are data by EEO category, unless a category legit-imately  constitutes a job group at the particular establishment (see Section 2G02).    (2)Information to be Included:  For each job group or job title, support  data in each major area (applicant flow, hires, promotions and terminations)  must include at least:  the total number of actions, the total number of actions  for women, and the total number of actions for each minority group (as specified  in 2H01(a)(1) above).  For example, applicant flow for a job group or job must  include at least total applicants, total female applicants and total applicants  of each minority group; hires for a job group or job title must include at least  total hires, total female hires and total hires of each minority group, etc.      (3)Period To Be Covered:  Generally, the longer the period covered the  better, because the data are more likely to reflect the contractor's usual way  of operating.  At minimum, however, the data must cover the prior AAP year and,  if the contractor is six months or more into its current AAP year when it  receives the Scheduling Letter, the data must also at least cover the first six  months of the current AAP year.    (d)Action When Data Are Unacceptable:  If employment activity data are  submitted, but are not acceptable (are, as noted immediately above, in  aggregations larger than job group; are not provided by sex and/or by each  minority group, etc.), the EOS should call the contractor and request that the  appropriate changes be made and the data resubmitted within 10 calendar days.   If, at the end of 10 calendar days, the data have not been received in a form  that is acceptable, a Show Cause Notice should be issued which itemizes the  regulatory sections with which the contractor has been found in violation. (see  Section 2H01(b)(1) and (2) and Figure 8-4).    Revised 5-25-90    2IREVIEW OF SECTION 503 AND 38 U.S.C. 4212 AAP(S) FOR ACCEPTABILITY    2I00GENERAL    As with an Executive Order AAP, the determination of the accept-ability of  items listed on page 4 of the SCRR for Section 503 and 38 U.S.C. 4212 AAPs is  limited to the evaluation which can be conducted at desk audit.  This is  different from an evaluation of the contractor's implementation of these items  which normally is done onsite (see Chapter 3).  Additionally, the Section 503  and 38 U.S.C. 4212 regulations require a number of contractor actions that,  while they need not be addressed in the AAP (although most contractors choose to  do so) must be carried out.  These addi-tional requirements are covered on SCRR  page 13, which is nor-mally completed onsite.     2I01ITEMS TO BE INCLUDED    The regulations at 41 CFR 60-741.5(a) require that a Section 503 AAP set  forth the contractor's policies, practices, and proce-dures in accordance with  41 CFR 60-741.6.  To be acceptable, a contractor's Section 503 AAP must address  at least those items listed in 41 CFR 60-741.6(a) through (f).  Similarly, the  regula-tions at 41 CFR 60-250.5(a) require that a 38 U.S.C. 4212 AAP set forth  the contractor's policies, practices and procedures in accordance with 41 CFR  60-250.6.  Therefore, to be acceptable, a contractor's 38 U.S.C. 4212 AAP must  address at least those items listed in 41 CFR 60-250.6(a) through (f).  Since  these items--(a) through (f)--are similar in both regulations, they are  discussed together below (where there are differences, it is pointed out).     2I02POLICY STATEMENT (Refer to 41 CFR 60-250.4(a) and 250.6(a) and 41 CFR  60-741.4(a) and 741.6(a).)    Contractors are required to take affirmative action to employ and advance in  employment qualified special disabled veterans, veterans of the Vietnam era,  and individuals with disabilities.  The con-tractor must affirm its commitment  to this affirmative action re-quirement by incorporating it in a policy  statement included in its AAP(s).      2I03REVIEW OF PERSONNEL POLICIES FOR PROPER CONSIDERATION OF QUALIFICATIONS  (Refer to 41 CFR 60-250.6(b) and 41 CFR 60-741.6(b).)    To be acceptable, the AAP(s) must affirm that the contractor has reviewed  its personnel processes to determine whether its present procedures ensure  careful, thorough, and systematic consideration of the job qualifications of  known individuals with disabilities, special disabled veterans, and Vietnam era  veterans who are applicants for job vacancies filled by employment or promotion,  and for all training opportunities offered or available.      (a)Use of Appendices B and C:  The procedures described at 41 CFR Part  60-250, Appendix B and/or 41 CFR Part 60-741, Ap- pendix C may be utilized in  fulfillment of this requirement.  Those procedures describe how the applications  or personnel forms of covered veterans and persons with disabilities may be  annotated regarding consideration for employment opportunities.     (b)Additional Requirement Under 41 CFR Part 60-250:  41 CFR 60-250.6(b) also  requires the contractor to limit its consider-ation of a covered veteran's  military record to only the portion of that record which is relevant to the  specific job qualifications for which the veteran is being considered.  This  should be affirmed in the AAP.    (c)Adequacy of Present Procedures:  If the contractor asserts that its  present procedures are adequate, this is acceptable if the EOS' investigation  shows that individuals with disabilities and covered veterans are afforded  hire, promotion and training opportunities.      2I04PHYSICAL AND MENTAL QUALIFICATIONS (Refer to 41 CFR 60-250.6(c)(1) and  41 CFR 60-741.6(c)(1).)    The AAP must contain the contractor's schedule for the review of all  physical and mental job qualification requirements.    (a)Scheduled Review:  To be acceptable, the AAP must either affirm that the  review of physical and mental job qualifications requirements has been completed, or provide a specific time schedule by which jobs are to be reviewed.  Where the AAP indicates that the review has  been completed, the contractor is not required to review those physical and  mental job qualification requirements again unless there is a change in working  conditions.  The AAP should state, however, that where there is such a change  in working conditions--for example, through increased automation--the re-  quirements will be reevaluated.    (b)Job-Relatedness of Physical and Mental Qualifications:  The AAP must  affirm that physical or mental job qualification requirements, to the extent  that such requirements tend to screen out qualified individuals with  disabilities or qualified special disabled veterans, shall be related to the  specific jobs for which such individuals are being considered, and shall be  consistent with business necessity and the safe performance of the job (refer to  41 CFR 60-250.6(c)(2) and 41 CFR 60-741.6(c)(2)).    (c)Confidentiality of Information:  To be acceptable, the AAP must affirm  that whenever the contractor inquires into an applicant or employee's physical  or mental condition or conducts a medical examination prior to employment or  change in employment status, information obtained as a result will be kept  confidential, except as otherwise provided for in the regulations (see 41 CFR  60-250.6(c)(3) and 41 CFR 60-741.6(c)(3)).      2I05REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION TO PHYSICAL AND MENTAL LIMITATIONS (Refer to 41  CFR 60-250.6(d)and 41 CFR    60-741.6(d).)    Contractors are required to make reasonable accommodation to the physical  and mental limitations of individuals with disabilities and special disabled  veterans, unless the contractor can demonstrate that such accommodation would  impose an undue hardship on the conduct of its business.  In determining the  extent to which a contractor is obligated to make accommodations, such factors  as business necessity and financial costs and expenses may be considered.  To  be acceptable, this section of the AAP must contain the contractor's policy with  respect to reasonable accommodations.  That statement must be consistent with  the requirements of the regulations.      2I06COMPENSATION (Refer to 41 CFR 60-250.6(e) and 41 CFR 60-741.6(e).)    In order to address this requirement in an acceptable manner, the AAP must  affirm that, in offering employment or promotion to in- dividuals with  disabilities, special disabled veterans, or veterans of the Vietnam era, the  amount of compensation offered is not reduced due to their receipt of any  disability income, pension or other benefit received from another source.      2I07OUTREACH, POSITIVE RECRUITMENT, EXTERNAL DISSEMINATION OF POLICY Refer  to 41 CFR 60-250.6(f) and 41 CFR    60-741.6(f).)    An acceptable AAP must affirm that the contractor reviews its employment  practices, and must at least state that appropriate outreach and positive  recruitment activities are undertaken where indicated by the findings of such  reviews.  The AAP may also describe in some detail the steps taken by the  contractor in its review of employment practices and the resulting outreach and  recruitment activities.  41 CFR 60-250.6(f) and 41 CFR 60-741.6(f) provide  additional guidance in assessing the accept- ability of this part of the  contractor's AAP(s).    2I08ADDITIONAL AAP INGREDIENTS    The following additional ingredients should be included in the contractor's  Section 503 and 38 U.S.C. 4212 AAP(s):    (a)Internal Dissemination of Policy (Refer to 41 CFR 60-250.6 (g) and 41 CFR  60-741.6(g)):  The AAP should address the contractor's procedures for internal  dissemination of its affirmative action policy.  The regulations cited above  provide examples of the types of activities contractors may take in this area  (e.g., contractors may conduct meetings with executive, managerial, and  supervisory personnel to explain the intent of the policy and to delineate  individual responsibility for its implementation, include the policy in internal  publications, etc.).    (b)Responsibility for Implementation (Refer to 41 CFR 60-250.6 (h) and 41  CFR 60-741.6(h)):  The AAP should identify the person(s) responsible for  implementing the contractor's policy with respect to individuals with  disabilities and covered veterans and should describe his or her  responsibilities.  It should also describe the responsibilities of line  man-agement in carrying out the policy.  The regulations cited  above provide  further guidance in this area.     (c)Development and Execution of Action Programs (Refer to 41 CFR 60-250.6(i)  and 41 CFR 60-741.6(i)):  The AAP should include a description of the specific  action programs which have been developed and implemented by the contractor.   The regulations cited above provide guidance on types of action programs.  While  the action programs described are guide- lines, not requirements, they do  provide a means by which the contractor's efforts to comply with its affirmative  action and equal employment opportunity obligations, as described in the AAP(s),  can be evaluated.    2JSUMMARY OF PROBLEMS WITH AAP AND SUPPORT DATA AND DEVELOPMENT OF ONSITE  PLAN    Problems identified with the completeness, reasonableness and/or  acceptability of the AAPs and support data are checked on page 4 of the SCRR,  and the specific problem described on SCRR page 9.  For each such problem,  actions taken at desk audit to resolve it and/or actions planned for onsite are  described.    2J00ITEMS RESOLVED AT DESK AUDIT    Some problems with the AAP(s) and support data may be resolved at desk audit  after further contact with the contractor.  For exam-ple, if the problem were ""Can't  evaluate job group acceptability because there is no information on what job  titles are in each group,"" the entry may be ""Called J. Smith 5/1/88  and asked him to send a list of titles in each group.  List received 5/8/88.""      2J01ITEMS TO BE RESOLVED ONSITE - ONSITE PLAN    Other items will only be resolvable onsite, and an onsite plan for each  should be briefly described.  For example, if the problem were ""Minority  availability for Foremen group appears low given minority % in blue collar area,""  the entry may be ""Determine how foreman jobs filled.  If internally,  examine incumbents' files to identify feeder jobs.""  If a problem has not  been resolved by the conclusion of desk audit, the column labeled ""Onsite?""  on SCRR page 9 is checked.  These checked items constitute the onsite plan for  resolving AAP and support data problems.    2KOVERVIEW OF PERSONNEL ACTIVITY, EEO TRENDS AND WORKFORCE  STRUCTURE/PERSONNEL PRACTICES    2K00PERSONNEL ACTIVITY (SUMMARY)    Page 5 of the SCRR provides an overview, by EEO-1 category, of personnel  activity during the prior year.  A summary of data on hires, promotions and  terminations should be abstracted from the data provided by the contractor, and  entered on the page.  A similar report, using a substitute SCRR page, can be  prepared from EEO-6 data for educational institutions.  This information, used  in conjunction with historical data analyzed through the EEO Trend Analysis  (below) provides a broad framework for later detailed review by job group of  affirmative action progress (placement goals) and potential discrimination in  employment activity (Impact Ratio Analysis).  Also, because this information is  by particular minority group, it can be used in conjunction with the EEO Trend  Analysis (below) to identify any potential problems for a particular minority  group.    2K01EEO TREND ANALYSIS    An initial assessment of the contractor's workforce and utilization trends  can be made by reviewing EEO-1 reports.  Page 6 of the SCRR is a Worksheet for  entry of EEO-1 data and page 7 provides for a narrative evaluation of those  data.    (a)Long-Term, Short-Term:  Current AAP data are compared with:  (1) the  contractor's profile approximately five years ago    (drawn from the earliest data on the current EEDS report) to look at  long-term trends; and (2) that profile approximately one year ago to look at  short-term trends.  An alternate SCRR page 6 is available for use with EEO-6  data (which are reported on a two-year cycle) for university reviews.  This  information provides an overview of:    oThe distribution of jobs within the contractor's workforce (white-collar,  blue-collar, predominant EEO categories);    oThe direction of change in the total workforce and particular categories  (expanding, contracting, stable); and    oWhether minority and female representation has been increasing or  decreasing, and in what areas.    (b)Changes Due to Reclassifications:  If the EOS observes major changes in  the sizes of EEO categories (p. 6) with little or no corresponding activity (p.  5), further investigation onsite may be needed to determine if the changes are  due to the reclassification of jobs with concentrations of minorities or women  from one EEO-1 category to another.  For example, suppose the total number of  positions in the craft category increases from one year to the next and  indicates an increase in women. Over the same time period, however, both the  total number of operative positions and the total number of women listed as  operatives decreases.  The EOS may then infer that the increase in crafts may  have resulted from the contractor's changing the EEO-1 category of the women's  jobs, rather than from genuine promotions.    (c)EEO Category Patterns:  This analysis also permits identification of  broad areas where minorities/women have been persistently underrepresented or  concentrated, setting a framework for the detailed review of the workforce  analysis for potential discrimination problems and review of the contractor's  goals progress by job group.    (d)Particular Minority Group:  Additionally, this analysis permits  identification of any substantial disparity in the representation of a  particular minority group--whether in the workforce as a whole or in certain  categories--when compared to the distribution of particular minority groups in  the contractor's labor area and/or in possible internal feeder categories.   Where such a disparity is identified, the EOS should plan to conduct standard  discrimination analyses by the particular minority group, at least in those  workforce areas where the disparity exists and for the type of activity most  likely to have created the disparity.  For example, if Hispanics are well  represented in the labor area, but have historically been absent from the  contractor's workforce, the EOS should plan to conduct hiring IRAs separately  for Hispanics.  Or, if Blacks have historically been concentrated in Laborers,  but poorly represented in Operatives and Crafts:  (1) the EOS' review of the  workforce analysis should focus on the types of jobs held by Blacks and any  structural impediments to upward mobility from those jobs; and (2) the EOS' blue  collar IRAs--particularly for promotions and hires into jobs above  Laborers--should be conducted separately for Blacks.  Further discussion of such  separate discrimination analysis for a particular minority group is given at  Sections 2N00 and 2O02 below.  Please also note that if investigation of such a  disparity does not show discrimination, the EOS should consider whether goals  and/or specific affirmative action steps for the particular group are warranted  (see Section 2G07(c) above).    2K02WORKFORCE STRUCTURE, PERSONNEL PRACTICES     In the initial review of the AAP and support data, the EOS eval-uated the  workforce analysis for reasonableness and acceptabil-ity.  As a result, the EOS  should have a basic understanding of the contractor's organization and  operations.  For example, the workforce analysis should show whether the  contractor's facility is organized by department or other unit (e.g., division),  whether lines of progression exist, how pay is structured, and other  characteristics which may prove useful for subsequent analyses of both  affirmative action and potential discrimination issues.  Other supporting data  which may be provided with the AAP, such as copies of labor agreements, should  provide additional information regarding pay rates, work performed,  organizational structure, and rules for internal mobility, at least in the blue  collar sector.  This information, to the extent that it is available during the  desk audit, should be entered on page 8 of the SCRR.      2LGOALS PROGRESS AND GOOD FAITH EFFORTS    A contractor's compliance posture is not measured by whether it met all its  goals, but rather whether it made a good faith effort to do so.  Generally,  however, if properly determined goals in a job group were met, further  examination of good faith effort with respect to that job group is unnecessary.   Therefore, in order to focus the investigation of good faith effort, the  following steps are taken:  (1) measure the degree of progress in job groups  where goals were established and opportunities occurred; (2) evaluate the  contractor's resulting overall goals performance; and (3) identify areas where  specific additional information is needed in order to evaluate good faith  effort.    2L00  ANALYSIS OF GOALS PROGRESS    As noted earlier, to be acceptable, AAP support data must include a report  of progress on prior AAP year goals.  Also, a report of progress on current  goals should be included at least if the con-tractor is six months or more into  its current AAP year when it receives the Scheduling Letter.  This report should  be used to conduct the analysis of goals progress on page 10 of the SCRR.    (a)Data Needed:  To conduct this analysis, first the EOS must identify the  job groups for which goals were established at the beginning of the period under  review.  Second, the percentage placement goal for each such group must be  determined.  Third, for each such job group, the number of total placements and  the number of minority and of female placements must be determined.  If this  information has not been submitted for desk audit (see Section 2H00 above), the  EOS will conduct the analysis below at whatever point in the review sufficient  information is obtained.    (b)Analysis:  The analysis itself takes into consideration the number of  opportunities in relationship to the goal.  More specifically, the percentage  placement goal is multiplied by the number of placements that actually occurred  to determine how many minorities/women would have been placed if the goal were  met.  This result is then compared to the number of minorities/women who  actually were placed, and the difference--plus or minus--entered.    EXAMPLE:  If the contractor set a goal of 10% for minorities in XYZ job  group and had 20 openings, the goal would have been met if it placed 2  minorities (.10 X 20).  If the contractor actually placed one minority, the  difference would be ""-1.""  On the other hand, if it actually placed  five minorities, the difference would be ""+3.""    If the contractor established a goal for a particular minor-ity group or for  men or women of a particular minority group (see Section 2G07(c) above), the  evaluation of progress on that goal is conducted in the same fashion as in the  above example.  See the SCRR instructions for page 10 for further examples.       (c)Net Change:  SCRR page 10 also has an optional part II on Workforce  Change, which provides for entry of data on job group incumbency (total, women  and minorities) at the begin-ning of the period and at the end of the period,  and determination of net change (plus or minus).  This information may be  useful in identifying job groups where, although  there has been progress in  placements, there has been little or no improvement in minority and/or female  representation (this can be for either positive or negative reasons--i.e.,  disproportionate promotions out, terminations, etc.).  It can also help the EOS  to focus on anomalies in the contractor's data, such as increases in job group  size without evidence of placement activity.    2L01EVALUATION OF GOOD FAITH EFFORT    (a)Overall Performance:  In evaluating the contractor's good faith effort,  an overall assessment of its goals/affirmative action performance should first  be made (SCRR page 11,    part I).  For example, was there progress in most areas where goals were  established?  In areas with little progress, are there any balancing factors  such as strong performance in similar but higher level jobs?  For example,  little progress in Operatives II, but progress well above expectations in  Operatives III.  Were there performance problems in areas with poor long-term  trends (SCRR page 6)?  This evaluation should also take into account fulfillment  of AAP commitments and the quality of those commitments in terms of creative  problem solving to remove any impediments to minority/female utilization over  both the long and short term.    (b)Goal Areas Needing Further Examination for Good Faith Effort:  As a  result of the above evaluation, identify any goal areas which need further  evaluation for good faith effort (SCRR page 11, part II).  For each such goal  area, review any contractor description of good faith efforts pertinent to the  area.  This should be presented as part of the contractor's report on goals.   Also use the AAP and support data to try to identify the probable reason for  lack of progress and the type of AAP action items that would be pertinent.  For  example, do the support data on employment activity show that the jobs were  filled predominantly by hire or by promotion?  If by hire, was there low  applicant flow?  What AAP commitments did the contractor make on recruitment  efforts?  Is there any evidence they were fulfilled?  If jobs were filled  primarily by promotion, was there an adequate representation of minorities/women  in probable feeder groups?  What AAP commitments did the contractor make  concerning the promotion process (job posting, encouraging bidding, training,  etc.).  Is there any evidence they were fulfilled?    2L02ONSITE PLAN FOR EVALUATION OF GOOD FAITH EFFORT    For each goal area where there is insufficient desk audit information to  determine good faith effort, list (on SCRR page 11a, part II) the additional  information needed.  For example, in a Clerical I job group there may have been  no goals progress for minorities, and low applicant flow appears to be the  reason.  The AAP may state that a particular agency would be used to recruit  minority applicants for the Clerical 1 job group.  The additional information  needed here may include contact with the agency to confirm its use by the  contractor (as well as other action, such as identifying additional recruitment  sources while onsite).  If questions concerning good faith effort in a job area  have not been resolved by the conclusion of desk audit, the ""Onsite?""  column on SCRR page 11 is checked.  These checked items form the onsite plan for  this portion of the review.    2MPOTENTIAL DISCRIMINATION ANALYSES - GENERAL    2M00TITLE VII PRINCIPLES    It is OFCCP policy, in conducting analyses of potential discrimi-nation  issues under the Executive Order, to follow Title VII principles.    2M01USE OF TERM ""MINORITIES""     The term ""minorities"" means those four groups for which EEO-1  reporting is required--i.e. Blacks, Hispanics, Asians/Pacific Islanders and  American Indians/Alaskan Natives.  As used in these instructions for desk audit  potential discrimination analyses, ""minorities"" may mean those groups  in the aggregate or individually, depending on the characteristics of the labor  area and/or on patterns in the contractor's workforce.  In general, where there  is an observed disparity in the representation of a particular minority group,  standard desk audit potential discrimination analyses will be conducted  separately for that group.  See further discussion of this matter under EEO  Trend Analysis, Review of Workforce Analysis and Impact Ratio Analyses below.      2NREVIEW OF THE WORKFORCE ANALYSIS    2N00GENERAL    An understanding of how employees obtained their jobs, the effects of  seniority, rules for promotion and transfer, etc., is necessary in order to  understand how the contractor's employment system works.  Patterns of minority  and female employment must be examined, and apparent disparities (e.g., where  they are or are not employed in departments, progression lines, job titles, and  other relevant job areas) identified for further investigation onsite.  For  example, men may supervise work units which are composed predominantly of women;  or, a job title may be composed predominantly of minorities in one department,  and predominantly of nonminorities in another.  Such disparities may indicate  dis-criminatory placement or promotional practices or other Executive Order  violations.  The results of the review of minority and female employment  patterns is summarized on page 14 of the SCRR.     2N01MINORITY GROUP ANALYSIS    If the EOS' review of the contractor's EEO category data (SCRR page 7)  showed substantial disparities in the representation of a particular minority  group in the workforce as a whole or in distribution among EEO categories, the  review of the workforce analysis should focus on that minority group, at least  in those workforce areas where the disparity was observed.  For example, if  category data showed that Blacks were concentrated in Laborers, poorly  represented in Operatives and absent in Crafts, the EOS' review of the workforce  analysis should specifically identify the types of blue collar jobs in which  Blacks are employed, whether these jobs fall into lines of progression or  departments/ units that tend to inhibit progression to Operatives and Crafts,  etc.  Even where such disparities are not observed in the initial category  screen, where the labor area has high representation of more than one minority  group and/or the general employment patterns in the industry involved have  differed among minority  groups, in reviewing the workforce analysis the EOS  should be alert for any indications of potential problems in the distribution  of the particular minority groups.    2N02UNDERREPRESENTATIONS AND CONCENTRATIONS    In examining patterns of minority group and female employment, the EOS is  looking for evidence of concentrations and under-representations.    (a)Concentration:  The term concentration means that minority groups and/or  women are found in a particular section (job area) of a contractor's workforce  (however that section is defined) in numbers substantially greater than would be  expected in terms of their overall representation in the contractor's workforce,  or in a relevant sector (however defined) of that workforce.    (b)Underrepresentation:  The term underrepresentation means the  opposite--that minority groups and/or women are found in a particular section of  a contractor's workforce in numbers substantially fewer than would be expected  in terms of their overall representation in the contractor's workforce or  relevant sector of that workforce.      (c)Interpreting Results:  The identification of a concentration or  underrepresentation does not mean that discrimination has been found.  It is  only an indicator that further investigation is warranted.      2N03DETERMINING THE RELEVANT WORKFORCE SECTOR AND JOB AREAS     (a)Relevance of Other Information:  In determining the relevant workforce  sector and job areas for the analysis, the EOS must be guided by the findings of  the desk audit up to this point.  For example, the information obtained from the  EOS' earlier analysis of EEO trends (SCRR, page 7) can assist in identifying  areas, by EEO-1 category, which may show persistent minority or female  representation above or below comparable availability; or, as discussed in 2N00  above, the EOS may have identified a substantial disparity in the  representation of a particular minority group.  Information derived from the  earlier review of the organization of the contractor's workforce and personnel  practices (e.g., internal mobility, pay structure), (SCRR, page 8) may be  helpful in making further comparisons.    (b)Workforce Sector/Job Area - General:  In determining the relevant sector  of the contractor's workforce with which minority group or female representation  in a particular job area is to be compared (e.g., blue collar, white collar,  clerical, the entire workforce, or even job group), the EOS should remember that  there should be a reasonable expectation that, absent discrimination,  minorities/women would be fairly evenly distributed among the job areas within  the sector.  That expectation is high when (1) entry-level jobs in the sector  share similar qualification requirements; and (2) jobs above entry-level in the  sector are filled primarily by promotion.  The expectation gets progressively  lower as entry-level jobs in the sector become more differentiated in skill  requirements (since it becomes more likely that minority/female availability  will differ) and/or jobs above entry are filled predominantly by hire.    (c)Relationship to Particular Contractor:  An appropriate definition of the  workforce sector is, therefore, related to the particular contractor's  structure, legitimate skill needs and personnel practices.  In general, analyses  that focus on where minorities/women are located organizationally (which  departments, units, lines of progression, etc.) will tend to identify potential  placement problems.  Analyses that focus on the level at which minorities/women  are employed (concentrated in lowest level jobs within an LOP, department, etc.)  tend to identify potential promotion problems (that may, in turn, be related to  placement).  For example:    (1)Workforce as Sector/Departments as Job Area:  Where there are departments  or organizational units with largely similar qualifications for entry-level positions (e.g., unskilled and, to a more limited extent, semi-skilled, in blue-collar; undifferentiated trainee jobs in white-collar ), representation in each department may be compared to representation in the total workforce of all such departments.      (2)Workforce as Sector/Lines of Progression as Job Area: Where there are  lines of progression (LOPs) or usual promotional sequences that cut across  department lines and have similar entry-level requirements, representa-ion in  each LOP may be compared to representation in the total workforce of all such  LOPs.      (3)Department as Sector/LOPs within Department as Job Area:  Where there are  separate lines of progression and/or usual promotional sequences within a  department or similar organizational unit, representation in each LOP may be  compared to their representation in the department as a whole.    (4)Department as Sector/Jobs within Department as Job Area:  In the absence  of LOPs or usual promotional sequences, where jobs within a department are  usually filled by promotion from within--or might reasonably be filled in such a  manner based on the nature of the jobs involved and the training which the  contractor could reasonably be expected to offer (e.g., on-the-job  training)--representation in a particular job area within that department may be  compared to representation in the department as a whole.      (5)EEO Category as Sector/Type of Job as Job Area:  It can be useful to  compare representation in an EEO category or job group against distribution  within titles in that category/group.  For example, in an Office and Clerical  category, women may be concentrated in General Clerical positions, but  underrepresented in Production and Material Control clerical jobs.      (6)Lines of Progression as Sector/Jobs in LOP as Job Area: A line of  progression or usual promotional sequence--particularly one with a large number  of incumbents--may also be treated as a ""sector,"" and minority/female  representation in the LOP compared with their representation in jobs at  different levels in the LOP.    (7)Job Title as Sector/Job Title within Department as Job Area - Where a job  title--particularly one with a large number of total incumbents--appears in  several depart-ments, representation in the title as a whole can be compared  with representation in the title in each department.    (d)Applicability to Both White-Collar and Blue-Collar Jobs:  These analyses  can be applied to both white collar and blue collar situations.  In all cases,  the EOS should ensure that the sector of the contractor's workforce which is  used as a basis for comparison with a particular job area is, in fact, relevant.   Particularly in the white collar area, differences with respect to factors  such as education or skills may make establishing a basis for comparison  difficult.  However, where it appears that the majority of a white collar  workforce consists of highly specialized jobs (an engineering firm, a scientific  research laboratory), it is generally best to separate clerical positions from  other white collar jobs when defining the base of comparison.    (e)Defining ""Substantially"":  Once the job area and the relevant  workforce sector have been selected, the next step is to identify those job  areas which have ""substantially"" more or fewer minorities and/or women  than would reasonably be expected by their representation in the workforce  sector selected.  These are the job areas which will be investigated further  onsite.  The term ""substantially"" as used here, however, cannot be so  precisely defined as to fit all cases.  In identifying job areas for further  investigation, EOSs must be guided by common sense, reasonableness, and the  nature of the information available up to that point.  In some instances, areas  of minority group/female concentration and underrepresentation will be readily  apparent from review of the workforce analysis.  In others, there may be a need  for more precise identification of potential problem areas.  One method which  may be used to identify job areas for further investigation onsite is the Job  Area Acceptance Range (JAAR).    (f)Use of the Job Area Acceptance Range (JAAR):  The JAAR is a formula which  may be used to determine whether a particular job area represents an area of  concentration or underrepresentation for minorities and/or women.  There is an  optional SCRR Worksheet for using the JAAR.    (1)Relationship to ""80% or four-fifths"" Rule of Thumb:   The JAAR  is based on the ""80% or four-fifths"" rule of thumb, similar to that  used in identifying whether a selection rate for a particular group represents  an adverse impact in selection (see Impact Ratio Analyses below).  For the JAAR,  the assumption is that the percentage representation of minorities and/or women  in a particular job area will normally fall in a range plus or minus 20% of  their representation in the relevant base workforce sector.    (2)Computing the JAAR:  To find this range, therefore, the percentage of  minorities or women in the base sector is multiplied by .20 and the result is  added to and subtracted from the percentage of minorities or women in the base  sector.  For example, if the broad sector had 50% minorities, the JAAR range  would be found by multiplying 50% X .20, and the result, 10%, would be  subtracted from and added to 50% for a JAAR range of 40% to 60%.    (3)Applying the JAAR:  The minority/female percentage in each job area  within the base sector is then compared to the range.  If the percentage in a  job area falls below the range (in the example, less than 40%), the area is  considered underrepresented; if it exceeds the range (in the example, more than  60%), the job area is considered concentrated.    (g)Role of Recent Personnel Activity Data:  Employment data shown in the  workforce analysis represent a cumulative record of past employment activity.   Data summarized in Impact Ratio Analyses (IRAs, below) represent more recent  employment activity.  As a result, in determining which job areas should be  investigated further onsite, EOSs should give a high priority to areas in which  recent employment activity appears to mirror the effects of prior activity.  For  example, there may be adverse IRAs for placement into job groups in areas where  minorities and/or women are underrepresented.    (h)Recording Results:  When, as a result of the review of the workforce  analysis, job areas exhibiting concentrations and underrepresentations are  identified for further investigation onsite, this information is entered on  page 17 of the SCRR, and an onsite plan developed for their investigation.  This  plan may include a request for the contractor's adverse impact determinations  for job titles in concentrated/under- represented areas.  Such information may assist the EOS, in onsite analysis  of potential placement problems, in determining whether there has been activity and of what type during the normal liability period, etc.  See Section 2O04(a) below and Chapters 3 and 7.    2OAUDIT OF PERSONNEL ACTIVITY - IMPACT RATIO ANALYSES    2O00DEFINITION    The Impact Ratio Analysis (IRA) is a method for identifying personnel  activity which should be investigated further onsite.  The IRA is a ratio  between two selection rates, one for minorities or women, and one for others.  Generally, a selection rate for minorities or women which is less than 80% of the selection rate for  nonminorities or men, as appropriate, for a particular personnel activity (e.g.,  hiring, promotion, termination) should be investigated further during the  onsite.  Although related, adverse IRAs should not be confused with the term ""adverse  impact.""  Refer to Chapter 7, Section 7E01, for a definition of the latter  term.     2O01  CALCULATING THE IRA    Page 15 of the SCRR provides a Worksheet for conducting impact ratio  analyses.  The Worksheet is used to compute IRAs for hiring, promotions, and  terminations, and may be adapted to compute IRAs for other data the contractor  may provide (e.g., training, transfers, etc.).     (a)Selection Rates:  The first step in calculating the IRA is to find the  selection rate for minorities or women and the selection rate for others.    (b)Focus on Unfavorable Selection Rate of Minorities/Women:  The next step  is to compare the selection rate for minorities/women to the rate for others.   As a matter of administrative discretion in compliance reviews, OFCCP will  focus on situations in which the selection rate for minorities or women is less  favorable than the rate for others.*  For positive actions, such as hires or  promotions, this will be where the minority or female rate is lower; for  negative actions, such as terminations, it will be where the minority or female  rate is higher.    (c)Finding the Impact Ratio:  Consistent with (b) above, the IRA is  calculated when the selection rate for minorities or women is less favorable.   Therefore, for positive personnel actions the IRA is found by dividing the lower  minority or female rate by the rate for others.  The IRA for negative personnel  actions is found by dividing the rate for others by the higher minority or  female rate.      (d)Number of Persons Potentially Affected:  For adverse IRAs, the SCRR  Worksheet referenced above provides an additional calculation to determine how  many minorities or women are potentially affected.  This information may be  useful in setting investigative priorities.  See Appendix 2A for detailed  instructions for using the Worksheet.     __________    *The EOS should be aware, however, that sometimes a more favorable rate for minorities or women may indicate ""channeling"" into different--and perhaps, less favorable--jobs than others.    2O02MINORITY GROUP ANALYSIS    If the EOS' review of the contractor's EEO category data (SCRR page 7)  showed substantial disparities in the representation of a    particular minority group in the workforce as a whole or in distribution  among EEO categories, IRAs should be conducted for that group(s) separately, at  least for those workforce areas where the disparity was observed and for  activity elements likely to have contributed to the disparity.  For example, if  category data showed that Hispanics were persistently absent from the workforce,  all hiring IRAs should be conducted separately for Hispanics.  Or, in an example  used earlier (2N00), where Blacks were concentrated in Laborers, poorly  represented in Operatives and absent from Crafts, IRAs for blue collar job  groups--particularly for promotions and hires into Operatives and Crafts    --should be conducted separately for Blacks.  Even where such disparities  are not observed in the initial category screen, where the labor area has high  representation of more than one minority group and/or the general employment  patterns in the industry involved have differed among minority groups, in  reviewing the contractor's activity data preparatory to conducting IRA analyses,  the EOS should be alert for any indications of potential problems in selections  of particular minority groups.    2O03  PROPER USE OF THE IRA     It is important to remember that an adverse IRA is only a pre-liminary  indicator of a potential discrimination problem.  It is not proof, in and of  itself, of discrimination, or of the existence of an affected class.  For  example, an adverse IRA in a job group may have been computed using an  insufficiently refined candidate pool.  Only further investigation onsite can  determine whether discrimination has occurred.      2O04 IRA SUMMARY AND ONSITE PLAN    Where adverse IRAs are identified, and further investigation is needed, the  EOS should describe the problem on SCRR page 17 (Summary of Potential  Discrimination Problems) and indicate that will be needed onsite to determine  whether the adverse IRA represents apparent discrimination.    (a)Contractor Adverse Impact Determinations (Contractors with 100 or More  Employees):    (1)Maintenance of Records:  As noted earlier in the discussion of the  acceptability of support data, the Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection  Procedures at 41 CFR 60-3.4 and 60-3.15 require contractors with 100 or more  employees to maintain records by job title sufficient to disclose the impact which its selection procedures (including hiring, promotion and termination) have on the employment opportunities of  women and on each minority group for whom EEO-1 reporting is required.    (2)Analysis of Impact:  The Guidelines at 41 CFR 60-3.4 and 3.15(A)(2) also  require that contractors with 100 or more employees annually analyze these data  to determine whether the total selection process for each job is having adverse  impact.  These determinations are required by sex and for each race/national  origin group (e.g., Black, Hispanic, Asian/Pacific Islander, American  Indian/Alaskan Native) which constitutes 2% or more of the labor force in the  relevant labor area or 2% or more of the applicable workforce (i.e. for jobs  filled internally).      (3)Requesting Contractor Determinations:  When the EOS has identified a job  group with an adverse IRA, and the contractor employs 100 or more persons, the  contractor should be requested to furnish (at desk audit or onsite) its relevant  adverse impact determinations for the job titles which fall within the job  group.  For example, if the adverse IRA is for female hires into a  Administrative Professionals job group, the contractor should be asked to submit  its adverse impact determinations for the hiring of women in each title within  the Administrative Professionals group.  This will assist the EOS in determining  whether the IRA does or does not need to be refined before investigating further  (see Chapter 3).  The EOS may also request the contractor's adverse impact  analyses in other areas.  For example, review of the workforce analysis may have  shown concentrations/underrepresentations that suggest a potential placement problem.  Job group activity data, however, may not show placements into the titles of concern, and the EOS could request the contractor's adverse impact analyses for hires, promotions and transfers into  those titles.  Where appropriate, the EOS may also ask to review the contractor's adverse impact analyses generally and/or may ask the contractor to identify those jobs where its analyses showed adverse impact.    (b)Need for Information about the Selection Process:  The EOS should also  plan to obtain the contractor's description of how employment decisions are made  for positions in the job group, including the steps in the process and, for each  step, the decision makers, criteria used and a description of how they are used,  and records maintained.  Steps may include, for example, review of application  forms by personnel, written tests, formal or informal interviews, physical  examinations, or on-the-job tests.  The EOS should plan to verify the  contractor's statements through review of records, interviews with applicants  and/or employees, and, if possible, observing the process by which applicants  are screened and selected.     (c)Multi-Component Selection Processes - Contractor Obligations:     (1)Adverse Impact in Total Selection Process:  Where the contractor's  adverse impact analyses are requested (per 2O04(a) above) and submitted for desk  audit, if the analysis shows adverse impact in the total selection process for a  job, 41 CFR 60-3.4 and 60-3.15(A)(2) require the contractor to evaluate the  components of the total selection process for adverse impact.  Therefore, in a  multi-step and/or multi-criterion selection process with adverse impact, the EOS  should plan to request the contractor's records showing at what step(s) and/or  by what criterion(ia) minorities or women are being disproportionately screened  out.      (2)No Adverse Impact in Total Selection Process:  If the total selection  process for a job does not have an adverse impact, a contractor would not  normally be expected to evaluate the individual components for adverse impact or  to validate those components, and enforcement action would not normally be taken  based on a component.      (i)Special Circumstances:  In some circumstances, enforcement action may be  taken based on an individual component which has an adverse impact (e.g., height  and weight requirements) that cannot be justified based on job relatedness or  business necessity.    (ii)Relationship of ""Bottom Line"" to Individual Complaints of  Discrimination:  The ""bottom line"" standard with respect to adverse  impact does not mean that complaints alleging discrimination caused by a  component of a selection process will not be investigated.  However this  standard may be applied in an exercise of administrative discretion on whether  to file an enforcement action.  See Question and Answers Nos. 25 and 26 in  Adoption of Questions and Answers to Clarify and Provide a Common  Interpretation of the Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures.       2PCOMPENSATION ANALYSES    2P00GENERAL    While reviewing the workforce analysis for potentially discriminatory placement patterns, the EOS should be especially alert to potential disparities between the wages or salaries shown in the underrepresented areas as compared to those in areas of concentration.  For example, the same or similar job titles may appear in both areas, but show different wage rates or salary ranges, with the higher  wages/salaries shown in those areas where minorities, members of a particular minority group or women are under-represented.      2P01WAGE AND SALARY DATA    As noted earlier in the discussion regarding the reasonableness of a  workforce analysis, coded salary data are acceptable for desk audit purposes.   However, the workforce analysis (wage coded or not) must show titles in wage  rate order within each department or similar organizational unit and the coding  must be consistent across departments/units.  Therefore, when a workforce  analysis contains alpha or numeric codes for salary designations, a salary  analysis may still be conducted by assigning numeric equivalents to the codes (1  to the lowest code, 2 to the second lowest, etc.) and averages computed.  Where  potential problems are identified, the areas should be flagged for further  investigation onsite.  Actual salary information and/or the keys to the codes  for flagged areas should be obtained from the contractor at that time.       2P02IDENTIFICATION OF JOB TITLES FOR COMPARISON    During the desk audit the EOS should also identify specific job titles which  are held by both minorities (or members of a partiticular minority group) and  nonminorities, or both women and men, for onsite comparison of actual salaries.       2P03METHODS USED TO DETERMINE PAY    The EOS should also plan to review onsite how starting pay levels (wage or  salary) are established, and how raises (wage or salary) are determined.      2QSUMMARY OF POTENTIAL DISCRIMINATION PROBLEMS AND ONSITE INVESTIGATIVE PLAN      2Q00  FOCUS ON PROBLEM    While potential discrimination can be divided into problems identified  through analysis of personnel activity (IRAs), and problems identified in the  review of the workforce analysis (e.g., JAAR, Compensation analyses), and/or  problems highlighted by complaints, the focus should be on the problem itself.   Potential discrimination problems which have been identified during the desk  audit on pages 3 (Past Problems/Known Complaints), 14 (Results of Review of  Workforce Analysis), 15 (Impact Ratio Analyses), and 16 (Compensation and Other  Analyses) of the SCRR, should be summarized on page 17 of the SCRR.  As noted  above, the focus is on the problem itself, which although it may have been  identified through more than one analysis, need be  listed only once (e.g., an  area of minority concentration with an adverse IRA for minority promotions out  of the area).    2Q01  ONSITE PLAN    For each such potential discrimination problem, the EOS describes an onsite  investigative plan.  This plan should be as specific as possible, and should set  priorities for the documents to be gathered, the statistical data needed, the  people to be interviewed, and the materials to be reviewed while onsite.  For  example, if the compensation analysis identified job titles for salary  review,  the onsite plan should state that the personnel files of a specific number of  minorities/women and a specific number of others in the identified job title(s)  will be reviewed for actual salary information.  If the IRA indicates a  potential problem in minority hires into a particular job group, the procedures  to be followed (persons to interview, applications and personnel files to be  reviewed, information to be obtained) should be described.      2RPREPARING FOR THE ONSITE    2R00  DECISION TO GO ONSITE     Based on the results of the desk audit, the EOS must decide whether further  investigation onsite is warranted.  However, in most cases an onsite review will  be necessary, because even where potential problems in personnel activity or the  workforce are not identified during the desk audit, many contractor commitments  contained in the AAP cannot be evaluated without an onsite inspection,  corroborating interviews, etc.  Preparation for the onsite phase of the review  is therefore a necessary part of virtually every compliance review.      2R01  SCOPE OF ONSITE    If, at the end of desk audit, the EOS determines that an onsite review is  appropriate, that review will cover: (1) problem areas identified during desk  audit and unresolved at the conclusion of desk audit; and (2) examination of the  contractor's implementation of pertinent AAP items and of those regulatory obligations not  specifically required to be included in the AAP(s).  Refer to Chapter 3 of this  Manual for a complete discussion of onsite activities.    2R02ONSITE PLAN - RESULTS OF DESK AUDIT     The onsite plan is based primarily on the findings obtained as a result of  the desk audit.  These findings fall into two categories, affirmative action  and potential discrimination.     (a)Affirmative Action:  Affirmative action can be further subdivided into  two areas, written AAP and supporting data, and goal attainment and good faith  efforts.      (1)Written AAP and Supporting Data:  Problems identified in the written AAP  and supporting data, were described on page 9 of the SCRR and, for each such  problem, actions taken at desk audit to resolve it and/or actions planned for  onsite were described (see Section 2J above and SCRR Instructions).  If a  problem is not resolved by the conclusion of desk audit, the column on SCRR page  9 labeled ""Onsite?"" is checked.  These checked items constitute the  onsite plan for resolving AAP and support data problems.    (2)Goals Progress and Good Faith Efforts:  Specific job groups/areas where  additional information is needed to assess good faith effort were summarized on  SCRR page 11, part II.  For each such goal area, the specific information needed  to resolve the question of good faith effort was listed (see Section 2L02 above  and SCRR Instructions).  If a question of good faith effort is not resolved at  the conclusion of desk audit, the column on SCRR page 11 labeled ""Onsite?""  is checked.  These checked items constitute the onsite plan for resolving good  faith effort issues.    (b)Potential Discrimination:  Specific potential discrimination problems  (whether identified through the workforce analysis, IRAs, complaints or some  combination of these) were entered on page 17 of the SCRR.  For each such  potential problem, an investigative plan was developed, giving the specific  information needed to determine whether discrimination had occurred (see Section  2Q above and SCRR Instructions).  If a potential discrimination problem is not  resolved at the conclusion of desk audit, the column on SCRR page 17 labeled ""Onsite?""  is checked.  These checked items constitute the onsite plan for resolving  potential discrimination issues.    (c)Summary:  The onsite plan, therefore, consists of checked items in the ""Onsite?""  columns on SCRR pages 9, 11 and 17 in the major review areas of AAP and support  data problems, questions of good faith effort, and potential discrimination  issues.  These items, together with an examination of the contractor's  implementation of the AAP(s) and of the non-AAP areas discussed below, will  direct the onsite review.    2R03OTHER ONSITE INGREDIENTS - GENERAL     The onsite review also covers the contractor's implementation of Executive  Order AAP commitments generally, and specifically must address implementation  of:    oThe Guidelines on Religion and National Origin and Sex Discrimination (SCRR  page 12);    oSection 503 and 38 U.S.C. 4212 affirmative action/    nondiscrimination requirements (SCRR page 13); and     oTechnical requirements (SCRR optional Technical Requirements Worksheet).      2R04IMPLEMENTATION OF GUIDELINES ON RELIGION AND NATIONAL ORIGIN AND SEX  DISCRIMINATION GUIDELINES    (a)Guidelines on Religion and National Origin:  These Guidelines, at 41 CFR  Part 60-50, are not a required AAP ingredient under 41 CFR 60-2.13.  The  contractor's implementation of them, therefore, must be evaluated onsite.  Chapter 3, Section 3G provides detailed guidance on conducting this aspect of  the onsite review.    (b)Sex Discrimination Guidelines:  While these Guidelines, at 41 CFR Part  60-20, are a required AAP ingredient and will have been evaluated for  acceptability (See 41 CFR 60-2.13(h) and Section 2G15 above), the contractor's  implementation of them must be evaluated onsite.  This evaluation should include  a review of the contractor's maternity leave policy (which may not have been  submitted for desk audit) and its implementation as discussed in Chapter 3.  In  addition, although not specifically mentioned in the Guidelines, sexual  harassment (as well as harassment on the basis of race, national origin or  religion) is a violation of the Executive Order.  During the onsite, the EOS  should be alert for any indications of such harassment.  OFCCP follows Title VII  principles in determining whether sexual harassment has occurred.  Further  guidance in this area will be issued.    (c)Recording Results:  The evaluation of both Guidelines is entered on SCRR  page 12.  Particular attention should be directed to those portions of both  Guidelines that are not addressed elsewhere in the regulations--e.g., leave for  religious purposes, maternity leave.      2R05IMPLEMENTATION OF SECTION 503 AND 38 U.S.C. 4212 REQUIREMENTS    (a)Scope:  The onsite review must include examination of the contractor's  implementation of its affirmative action and nondiscrimination obligations with  respect to individuals with disabilities, special disabled veterans and veterans  of the Vietnam era.  Chapter 3 provides detailed guidance on conducting this  aspect of the onsite review.    (b)Non-AAP Requirements:  Along with findings on the contractor's  implementation of AAP ingredients, the  following non-AAP requirements must be  evaluated onsite.  Results of this evaluation are recorded on SCRR page 13, part  I.  Chapter 3 provides detailed guidance on conducting this aspect of the onsite  review.    (1)Invitation to Self-Identify:  Contractors must invite all applicants and  employees to identify themselves as covered veterans or persons with  disabilities.  Refer to 41 CFR 60-250.5(d) and 41 CFR 60-741.5(c).    (2)Availability of the AAP for Inspection:  Contractors must make the AAP  available for inspection by employees and applicants for employment.  The  location and hours during which the AAP is available must be posted.  Refer to  41 CFR 60-250.5(c) and 41 CFR 60-741.5(d).     (3)Listing of Employment Openings:  The Affirmative Action Clause at 41 CFR  60-250.4 requires that covered con-    tractors list all suitable employment openings with the local office of the  State Employment Service.    (4)VETS 100 Filing Requirement:  A contractor covered by 41 CFR Part 60-250  must report at least annually to DOL's Office of the Assistant Secretary for  Veterans' Employment and Training (OASVET) on the number of covered veterans in  its workforce and the number of covered veterans hired.  See 41 CFR Chapter 61.   A copy of the VETS 100 Form and its instructions is included in Chapter 3  (Figure 3-3).     (c)Discrimination:  The onsite evaluation of the contractor's implementation  of its affirmative action obligations under Section 503 and 38 U.S.C. 4212, also  includes investigation for discrimination against individuals with disabilities  or covered veterans.  This includes identification of any qualified individuals  with disabilities or covered veterans screened out by personnel practices or job  requirements not shown to be consistent with business necessity and the safe  performance of the job, and any who could have performed the job involved given  reasonable accommodation to their disability.  The types of materials that may  be examined onsite in this area are discussed on SCRR page 13, Part II and its  instructions, and in Chapter 3.    (d)Technical Requirements:  Additionally, there are a number of technical  requirements which the Section 503 and 38 U.S.C. 4212 programs share with the  Executive Order program.  These are addressed in 2R06(a) below.     2R06TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS    The onsite review must also cover the contractor's implementation of  technical requirements.  These fall in the following areas:  (1) those mandated  by the EEO/AA clauses of all three OFCCP programs; (2) those specific to the  Executive Order program; and (3) those pertaining to OFCCP responsibilities  under the Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA).  There is an optional SCRR  Worksheet for recording the results of the audit of Technical Requirements.    (a)All Three Programs:  In addition to requiring that covered contractors  not discriminate against and take affirmative action on behalf of covered group  members, the Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action Clauses at 41 CFR  60-1.4(a), 41 CFR 60-250.4, and 41 CFR 60-741.4, contain a number of other  requirements.      (1)Inclusion of Clauses:  Each EEO/AA clause must be included, either in its  entirety or by reference, in all covered contracts, subcontracts, and purchase  orders.  Additionally, notice of the VETS 100 filing requirement must be  included.    (2)Informing of Obligations - Vendors and Subcontractors:  Contractors must  advise vendors and subcontractors of their obligation to develop an AAP if they  meet coverage thresholds.    (3)Informing of Obligations - Unions:  Contractors must inform any labor  unions or worker representatives with which they have a collective bargaining  agreement or other agreement of the contractor's commitments under the  regulations.    (4)Posting of Notice:  Contractors must post notice of their EEO/AA  obligations in conspicuous places, available to both employees and applicants  for employment.    (b)Requirements Specific to the Executive Order Program:  The Executive  Order regulations additionally require:    (1)EEO Tag Line:  Advertisements and solicitations for employment must state  that all qualified applicants will be considered, regardless of race, color,  sex, national origin or religion (see 41 CFR 60-1.4(a)(2) and 60-1.41).    (2)Standard Form 100:  The contractor must have filed a current Standard  Form 100 (EEO-1 or, for universities, EEO-6) as required by 41 CFR 60-1.7(a)(1).  (NOTE:  Where the contractor is found not to have filed a Standard Form 100, the  EOS--in addition to including the matter in a Conciliation Agreement--will  notify the OFCCP National Office by completing and forwarding the form provided  in the EEDS Manual for this purpose.)  The contractor must also notify its  vendors and subcontractors of their obligation to file a Standard Form 100  annually.    (c)IRCA - Forms I-9 Inspection:  The onsite review also must include a  review of the contractor's INS (Immigration and Naturalization Service) Forms  I-9.  This form is used to verify that employees hired since November 7, 1986,  are legally eligible to work in the United States under the provisions of the  Immigration Reform and Control Act.  As noted below, the contractor must be  given at least three days advance notice of a Forms I-9 inspection.  Chapter 3  includes a copy of the I-9 Form and its instructions (Figure 3-1), specific  guidance on the contents of this inspection (3E), and a copy of the ESA Form 91  used to record the results of this inspection (Figure 3-2).    2SNOTICE OF ONSITE REVIEW    EOSs are required to provide written notice of the scheduling of the onsite  review to contractors.  This notice of onsite should be a follow-up to an  earlier telephone contact establishing the date and time that the onsite review  will begin.      2S00TELEPHONE NOTICE     In telephoning the contractor to establish the date the onsite will begin,  the EOS should also request that the contractor have additional required  information available at the beginning of the onsite.  This information will  have been identified as a result of problems with the data that the contractor  submitted or failed to submit for the desk audit, or potential problems found  during desk audit.  This contact provides the contractor with lead time to  locate the information.  It also allows the EOS to determine whether the  information is available and in what form.  During the conversation the  contractor would also be told of the need to inspect I-9 forms.      2S01WRITTEN CONFIRMATION OF ONSITE    A letter must be sent to the contractor confirming the phone notice of the  onsite, the date and time the onsite will begin, and that an I-9 inspection will  be conducted (to provide the required formal 3-day notice of such an  inspection).    (a)List of Materials:  The onsite confirmation letter must include a list of  the materials which the contractor should make available at the start of the  onsite.    (1)Materials Related to Specific Findings:  Items which relate to specific  preliminary findings noted during the desk audit should be requested.  For  example, where the EOS has identified adverse IRAs, a list of the employment  actions involved or the contractor's adverse impact determinations for titles in  the job group and type of activity involved should be requested; or,  where the  desk audit has indicated salary questions, the key to any salary codes should be  requested.  Also, the EOS should note that personnel files, applications, and  resumes should be available for inspection.      (2)Materials Not Included in Original Submission:  Items which may not have  been included in the original AAP and supporting data submission--such as copies  of employment advertisements, purchase orders, employment applications, labor  agreements, and policy manuals, should be requested.  Where appropriate, the EOS  may also ask that the contractor's adverse impact determinations be available for review or that the contractor identify those jobs where the results of its analysis showed adverse impact.    (3)I-9's and VETS 100 Report:  Because EOSs must review I-9 forms and verify that the contractor has filed the VETS 100 Report, the contractor must be informed of the need to have these available for inspection.       (4)Additional Information:  A request should also be made for the names of  applicants and employees who have responded to the contractor's invitation to  self-identification or who have otherwise become known to the contractor as  individuals with disabilities, as special disabled veterans, and/or as veterans  of the Vietnam era.  Where special disabled veterans and/or individuals with  disabilities have been identified, the contractor should also be asked to  provide a description of any accommodations made.       (b)Mailing:  The letter confirming the onsite, signed by the AOD/FOD, should  be mailed to the contractor (by certified mail, return receipt requested)  sufficiently in advance of the onsite date to ensure that the letter arrives at  least 3 days before the EOS.  In addition, should the contractor encounter  unanticipated problems in obtaining the items requested, there should be  sufficient lead time to allow for the substitution of alternate materials, where  possible and appropriate.      Figure 2-1:    CHRONOLOGY LOG - CC-53    Figure 2-2:  SCHEDULING LETTER REQUESTING AAP AND SUPPORT DATA    CERTIFIED MAIL    RETURN RECEIPT REQUESTED    Dear (name of contractor official) :    Your establishment located at___________has been selected for a compliance  review under Executive Order 11246, as amended, Section 503 of the  Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, and the Vietnam Era Veterans'  Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974, as amended, (38 U.S.C. 4212), and their  implementing regulations.    The compliance review will be conducted as described in the regulations at  41 CFR Part 60-60 which outlines the three phases of the process.  These phases  normally include a desk audit, an onsite review, and where appropriate, offsite  analysis.    For desk audit purposes we are requesting a copy of your Affirmative Action  Programs (AAPs) and supporting documentation.  These should be prepared in  accordance with the requirements set forth in 41 CFR 60-1.40, 60-2.1 through  60-2.15, Part 60-741 and Part 60-250.  The AAPs' contents and supporting data  such as indicated in the enclosed itemized listing are to be submitted.    Our audit of the AAP and supporting documentation is designed to assist us  in preparing for the onsite review and to reduce the amount of time and level of  effort required by OFCCP and your representatives during this phase of the  compliance process.     You should note, however, that 41 CFR 60-2.2 authorizes the initiation of  enforcement procedures in circumstances where materials submitted for desk audit  do not represent a reasonable effort to meet the affirmative action program  requirements.      Please submit your AAPs and supporting documentation as soon as possible,  and in any case no later than 30 days from the date of receipt of this letter.      If you have any questions concerning OFCCP's compliance review, please feel  free to contact______________.    Sincerely,    AOD/FOD    Attached:  Itemized listing, 41 CFR Chapter 60    Figure 2-2a:  ITEMIZED LISTING    ITEMIZED LISTING    Required AAP contents, including supporting documentation such as those  indicated by check ( ) mark, are essential to conduct the desk audit phase of  the compliance review.      ____a.  Copies of your Employer Information Reports EEO-1 (Standard Form 100  Rev.) for the last three years (____, ____, and ____).  (See 41 CFR 60-1.7).      ____b.  Workforce Analysis (See 41 CFR 60-2.11(a)).    ____c.  Copies of progression line charts (See 41 CFR 60-2.12(m)).    ____d.  Job group and availability analysis (See 41 CFR 60-2.11(b)).      ____e.  Documentation that areas of underutilization have been identified  and goals and timetables have been established to correct any deficiencies,  together with a plan of action to achieve those goals and timetables.  (See 41  CFR 60-2.12(g), (h), and (i) and 41 CFR 60-2.13(d), (e), and (f)).    ____f.  Summary data and information which indicate the numerical and other  results of your affirmative action goals for each job group for the current goal  year and the preceding goal year.  For each goal not attained/being attained,  describe the good faith efforts which were/are being made to achieve them.  (See  41 CFR 60-1.40(c) and 41 CFR 60-2.12).    ____g.  An analysis of your selection process, including a determination of  whether it eliminates a significantly higher percentage of minorities or women  than nonminorities or men.  (See 41 CFR 60-1.40(b)(2), 60-2.23(b)(3), 60-2.25).   This analysis may consist of a summary of applicant and hire activity identified  by race and sex for each job group for (a) the present goal year and (b) the  previous goal year and include:  total applicants, total offers of employment,  total hires, total rejections.  However, if you do not have the data arranged in  that manner you may choose to submit them in the form in which they are  available.    Figure 2-2a:  ITEMIZED LISTING (continued)    ____h.  Analysis of your transfer and promotion practices to determine if  lateral and/or vertical movement of minority or female employees is occurring at  a lesser rate (compared to workforce mix) than nonminority or male employees.   (See 41 CFR 60-1.40(b)(3), 60-2.23(b)(2), 60-2.25).  The analysis may consist of  a summary of promotion and transfer activity during (a) the present goal year  and (b) the previous goal year, identified by race and sex, including the  department/job group/job title into which employees were promoted and each  department/job group/job title from which promoted.  However, if you have  performed the analysis under a different arrangement you may choose to submit it  in the manner in which it is available.    ____i.  Summary of monitoring reports which reflect the degree to which the  nondiscriminatory policy is carried out with respect to terminations of  employment.  (See 41 CFR 60-2.25).  This information may consist of a summary of  employee terminations with identification of race and sex and the departments  and job titles from which they were terminated.  However, if you have not  compiled the data in this form you may choose to submit them in the form in  which they are available.    Although it is not specified as one of the required contents of the AAP, it  would assist us in conducting the desk audit if you would also attach a copy of  your collective bargaining agreement, if any, or other available information  indicating your policies and procedures governing employee mobility (i.e.  promotions, transfers, etc.).    Figure 2-3:STANDARD INQUIRY LETTER FOR REQUESTING COMPLAINT DATA FROM EEOC  AND STATE AND LOCAL FEPS     Dear:    A compliance review of the following Federal contractor has been scheduled:      The review will audit this contractor's compliance with Executive Order  11246, as amended,  Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended,  the Vietnam Era Veterans Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974 (38 U.S.C. 4212),  and implementing regulations.  The Order and Acts prohibit employment   discrimination and require affirmative action to ensure equal employment  opportunity without regard to race, color, religion, national origin, sex,  disability or status as a special disabled or Vietnam era veteran.    Please forward any information you have concerning complaints filed against  this contractor and/or any other information you may have concerning its EEO  posture which you believe we should consider during the course of the review.

STANDARD COMPLIANCE REVIEW REPORT (SCRR) INSTRUCTIONS     OVERALL SCRR STRUCTURE     This SCRR is both a desk audit and onsite report.  It consists     of three parts: (a) Preparation, (b) Affirmative Action and     (c) Potential Discrimination.     Each part contains analytical sheets, followed by a narrative     summary of problems identified in major review areas.  For prob-    lems not resolved at the conclusion of desk audit, the summary sheets  provide for an investigative plan and a description of onsite  findings/conclusions.  These summary sheets are under-    lined in the following SCRR outline:     PART A:  PREPARATION     Page 1   CRIS, CC-100A     2   Introduction     3   Past Problems/Known Complaints     4   Initial Review of AAP and Support Data     5   Personnel Activity     6   EEO Trend Analysis Worksheet     7   EEO Trend Analysis Narrative     8   Organization of the Contractor's Workforce and Review               of  Support Data on Personnel Practices     PART B: AFFIRMATIVE ACTION     9   Problems with AAP and Support Data    10   Analysis of Affirmative Action Progress     11   Evaluation of Good Faith Effort    12   Implementation of Guidelines on Religion and National     Origin and Sex Discrimination     13   Implementation of Disabled/Veterans Affirmative     Action Requirements     PART C: POTENTIAL DISCRIMINATION     14   Results of Review of Workforce Analysis     15   Impact Ratio Analysis (IRA) Worksheet     16   Compensation/Other Analyses     17   Summary of Potential Discrimination Problems     For convenience when an onsite must be approved by a reviewing     official, an optional Desk Audit Summary is included as page 18.     Also included are the following optional SCRR forms:  for     university reviews, a substitute Personnel Activity and EEO     Trend Analysis worksheet with EEO-6 category headings; a     Technical Requirements worksheet covering all three OFCCP     programs; and a Job Area Acceptance Range (JAAR) worksheet.     How much of this SCRR can be done at desk audit will depend on     the quality of data submitted by the contractor.  It is more     important that all analyses are completed by review close out,     than when in the review process they are completed.     SCRR AS A NARRATIVE REPORT    As noted above, the SCRR is both a desk audit and onsite report.  No  separate onsite narrative is required.  What is required is a narrative  description of onsite findings and conclusions on each problem identified* in  the major review areas of AAP and Support Data, Evaluation of Good Faith Effort  and Potential Discrimina-    tion.  This narrative should be as long or short as the facts of the  situation warrant (and, regardless of length, must be backed up by case file  material).    For example, many problems in a written AAP (page 9) can be adequately  addressed in a sentence or two with a reference to corrected AAP pages.  Even  some potential discrimination problems (p. 17) can be briefly addressed--for  example, an Impact Ratio Analysis (IRA) adverse for female hires that when  refined onsite showed that the women applied after the last opening.  On the  other hand, findings on some problems will require substantially more  elaboration.  This will usually be the case for discrimina-    tion issues that are not resolved through such initial onsite data  refinement.    Where such a longer description of findings is appropriate, the EOS should  briefly summarize findings on the SCRR page (9, 11 or 17, as applicable)* and  attach the fuller narrative description--labeled with the item number to which  it pertains--to that page.**  Some examples of when this narrative is needed and  a description of its contents are given following the instructions for SCRR page  17.    ____________       whether identified at desk audit, but not resolved by the conclusion of  desk audit, or onsite.      *EOSs using word processing equipment, see alternative below.           FOR COMPUTER USERS    OFCCP has developed a computer program for IRAs (p. 15) and JAARs (SCRR  optional worksheet).  Once the EOS identifies the appro-    priate raw data and it is entered into the computer, the math- ematical  calculations called for by these SCRR pages are auto- matically made and a  print-out generated with column headings corresponding to these pages.*  Such  computer-generated pages may be substituted for these SCRR pages.  If you want  further infor-    mation on this program, contact your Regional representative to the OFCCP  Technical Support group or the NO Branch of Special Analysis.    Additionally, computer users may wish to use word processing for the rest of  the SCRR.  A distinct advantage of doing so is that once the form is in the  computer, the space allocated to any page/item is fully flexible--i.e. it can be  tailored to the particular review, thus avoiding the need for continuation  sheets.  For example, on the SCRR pages calling for onsite find-    ings/conclusions (see section above), rather than summarizing findings and  expanding on them in an attachment, simply convert the page to a vertical format  (addressing all headings for problem # 1, then all for problem #2, etc.) and use  whatever amount of space is needed for each problem.    RELATIONSHIP OF SCRR    TO POTENTIAL DISCRIMINATION WORKSHEETS     Sample worksheets and instructions for investigating potential   discrimination are given in Appendix 3A.  Key factors that must be addressed in  such an investigation are highlighted in those instructions.     ________    *For IRAs, in addition to the page 15 headings, this program calculates the  number of standard deviations.  This may be of some assistance in setting  investigative priorities.  However, the number of standard deviations must not  be used either to conclude discrimination has occurred or to conclude that  inves-    tigation is not warranted.  Statistical tests mean nothing apart from the  data to which they are applied, and it is entirely pre-    mature to base either such conclusion on unrefined desk audit data.  See IRA  instructions and ""Interpreting IRA Results"" in this Appendix and, in  Chapter 3, the discussion of refined IRAs and statistical tests for small  numbers.    COMMENTS APPLICABLE TO THE SCRR AS A WHOLE     Format/Administrative    oThose SCRR pages and worksheets that are ""fold-out"" have a  perforation in the middle which divides them into two stand-ard 8 1/2"" X 11""  sheets.  These sheets may be separated at the perforation for ease in copying.   In the copy, the two sides of a sheet (they are labeled ""a"" and ""b""--i.e.  11a, 11b, etc.) should be filed in sequence.     Because of their format, some of these sheets have ""Item #""  columns on both sides to permit cross-referencing in a copy.  The EOS assigns an  item number to each problem identified on the left side of the fold-out and uses  the same item number on the right side of the fold-out.     oSCRR pages which present a conclusion on problem areas have  a final column  labeled ""CLOSE OUT DOCUMENT"" which asks ""Include?"" and ""Para.  #.""  If you plan to address the prob-    lem in a close out document, check ""Include?,"" but leave the ""Para.  #"" column blank until the end of the review.     At the end of the review, examine all problems checked and base the type of  close-out document on the most serious problem.  For example, if there are three  deficiencies, two of which--standing alone--would require a Letter of  Commit-ment (LOC), but the remaining deficiency requires a Concil-  iation  Agreement (CA), use a CA to cover all three defi-    ciencies.  When the close-out document is drafted, go back and insert the  paragraph number in which each problem is addressed.     oEach Area and Field Office should maintain extra copies of those SCRR  analytical pages where additional copies may be needed in the average  review--primarily the Analysis of Affirmative Action Progress and IRA  Worksheets.     Other      oIn a preaward review, as at present, all SCRR analyses are normally  completed onsite.    oMinorities means men and women of those minority groups for whom EEO-1  reporting is required--i.e. Blacks, Hispanics, Asians/Pacific Islanders and  American Indians/Alaskan Natives.  It may mean those groups in the aggregate or  an individual group for whom a problem has been identified (see instructions for  SCRR page 7).  Women means both minority and nonminority women.     oWhen reference is made in the SCRR to a particular item included in an AAP,  the AAP page number(s) should be given.  However, please note that an AAP page  reference, standing alone, is not an adequate response to any question concern-      ing the contractor's implementation of an item (for example, see SCRR page  13 on Implementation of Disabled/Veterans' Affirmative Action Requirements).      PAGE INSTRUCTIONS     PART A:  PREPARATION     PAGE 1:  CRIS, CC-100A    See the Compliance Review Information System (CRIS) Manual for instructions  on completing this page.     PAGE 2:  INTRODUCTION    Item 1 - Establishment Name, Address and CRIS Control #:  Enter the name and  address of the establishment being reviewed.  Also enter the CRIS Control number  assigned to this review on page 1.     Item 2 - Parent Name and Address:  If the establishment being reviewed is  part of a larger firm, enter the name and address of the parent firm.     Item 3 - Labor Area:  Enter the name of the Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) in which the establishment is located or, if it is not in an MSA, enter the name of the county or other  appropriate labor area in which it is located.  Then enter the percent of the labor force within the named geographic area that is female and the percent that is minority (in the aggregate and by each minority group).    Item 4 - Complaints Investigated During Review:  Enter the complaint number  of each complaint you plan to investigate as  part of the compliance review.   This will permit a cross- reference to the Complaint Administration System (CAS)  and to the complaint investigation file.  At the end of the review, check    [  ] those complaints that have been resolved.       NOTE:  Further information on these complaints, and on any other open OFCCP  complaints, will be entered on SCRR page 3.    Item 5 - Contract Establishing OFCCP Jurisdiction:  Enter the indicated  information on the contract which establishes OFCCP jurisdiction.  If a  subcontract is used, under ""Agency"" enter the name of the awarding  agency, then check ""SUB TO"" and enter the name of the prime  contractor.     If you have information on several contracts or subcontracts,  use one in  which the work is performed at the establishment level and/or one with the  highest dollar amount or the most relevant time period.  Where more than one  contract is needed to establish and/or further support coverage, include  information on these contracts in item 8 below (Introductory Statement).     Item 6 - Company Contacts:  List the name, title and phone number of the  corporate and establishment Chief Executive Officer (CEO), and the corporate and  establishment contact persons for Equal Employment Opportunity and Affirmative  Action (EEO/AA) matters.       Item 7 - EEDS Contractor Selection Research Documentation Form:  Check here  to confirm that this Equal Employment Data System (EEDS) form--which indicates  why this contractor was selected for review--is included in the case file.    Item 8 - Introductory Statement:  To the degree known, this should include,  but need not be limited to:     oType of Business.  Describe the nature of the establish-    ment's business--for example, its type of industry, main product line, etc.   If it is part of a larger firm, indicate its relationship with its parent--i.e.  ""part of the Consumer Electronics Division of XYZ Company,"" ""a  subsidiary of ABC, Inc.,"" etc.     Also include any general information on the establishment,  such as its  total employment, whether its workforce is predominantly white-collar or  blue-collar, etc.     If the establishment's AAP covers more than one physical location (i.e.  outstationed sales offices, branch banks, etc.), generally describe those  locations and approximately how many people they employ.     oAdditional Coverage Information.  Include information on any contracts or  subcontracts (beyond that given in item 5 above) needed to establish or further  support OFCCP juris- diction.  If coverage is not based on the establishment's  Federal contracts, but on those of a related entity--such as a parent company, a  subsidiary, or another subsidiary of the parent--identify the entity holding the  Federal contracts and the establishment's relationship to it.     To the degree known, also indicate the main product(s) or service(s)  provided under Federal contracts and the approximate volume of such contracts as  a percentage of the contractor's business.     oLabor Area Characteristics.  Describe any relevant informa-    tion on the labor area in which the Contractor is located.     For example:  minority and/or particular minority group distribution within  that geographic area (i.e.  ""The  largest Hispanic community in the MSA is  in Hillsdale, two miles from the plant."" etc.); availability of public/  private transportation; relevant community resource file information,  including the results of any general contacts with community organizations, etc.      Item 9 - Signature Blocks.  Upon completion of the review, the EOS signs and  dates the report in the space provided.  Upon approval of the report, the Module  Chief and appropriate official (ARA or AOD) sign and date it.     PAGE 3:  PAST PROBLEMS/KNOWN COMPLAINTS    Part I:  PAST PROBLEMS.  Review available Area Office files on any past  OFCCP compliance reviews or complaint investigations of this establishment.  If  there have been no prior reviews or complaints, so state, and no further entries  are needed under this part.  If there have been, complete this Part as follows:      oItem a - Past Problems - Give the date of any past compliance review or complaint investigation and list any major problems identified. If there is a current Conciliation Agreement (CA) or Letter of Commitment  (LOC), include a copy of the CA/LOC monitoring record in this case file and list  here any items that may need further investigation.     oItem b - Recurrence?  Do not complete this item now, but in conducting the  rest of the review, be alert for any indications that a past problem has or has not recurred.  At whatever point in the review you have evidence one way or the other, return to this page and enter  your finding.  If you conclude that a problem has, in fact, recurred, also reference the SCRR page number where your findings are presented in more detail.    EXAMPLE:  A past review resulted in a CA because (1) the  contractor's  workforce analysis was by EEO category rather than  by organizational unit, and  (2) the contractor failed to make a good faith effort to recruit minorities for  professional positions.     If, in reviewing the current AAP (SCRR page 4), you find that the current  workforce analysis is properly by organizational unit, return to this page and  so state in item ""b.""  If contractor records and contacts with  recruitment sources show that the contractor did not list professional jobs, so  state in item ""b"" and refer to the SCRR page where your findings are  discussed (for this problem, normally SCRR page 11 on Evaluation of Good Faith  Effort).     Part II:  KNOWN COMPLAINTS.  Review responses received (to Manual Figure  2-3) from other agencies on any complaints filed against this establishment  since the last OFCCP compliance review.  Also review available Area Office  records of any open OFCCP complaints against this establishment.  If there are  no such complaints, so state, and no further entries are needed in this part.   If there are, complete this Part as follows:     oItem a - For each complaint, indicate with what agency it was filed, its  basis, issue, current status and the area of the contractor's workforce it  appears to concern (i.e. clerical, professional, entry-level blue collar, etc.).      oItem b - Potential Systemic?  Do not complete this item now, but in  conducting the rest of the review, be alert for any indications of a potential  systemic discrimination problem in complaint areas.  At whatever point in the  review you have evidence that there is or is not a potential systemic problem,  return to this page and so state.  If you conclude that there is a potential  systemic problem, refer to the SCRR page where your findings are presented in  more detail.     EXAMPLE:  There is (1) an open EEOC complaint alleging discrim-    ination against women in terminations from Operative jobs, and (2) a State  human rights commission individual complaint alleging failure to hire because of  diabetes.     In the first case, if your Impact Ratio Analysis (IRA) did not show an  adverse IRA for women in Operative terminations, return to this page and so  state in ""b.""  In the second case, if examination of the contractor's  policies concerning diabetes and/or applications of diabetics rejected showed a  systemic problem, return to this page, so state in ""b"" and refer to  the SCRR page where your findings are discussed (for this problem, normally page  13, Part II).     The intent here is not to investigate any complaint filed with other  agencies (or any open OFCCP complaint other than those assigned for  investigation during this review--i.e. those listed in SCRR Introduction, item  4), but rather to be alert for potential systemic problems in complaint areas.      PAGE 4:  INITIAL REVIEW OF AAP AND SUPPORT DATA     Immediately upon receipt of the contractor's initial AAP and support data  submission, review it to ensure there is sufficient information to conduct  subsequent basic analyses of both affirmative action and potential  discrimination issues.     In conducting this initial review, be attentive to any information on the contractor's workforce structure and personnel practices that will be discussed on SCRR page 8.  Such information may be included in the AAP narrative, or may be reflected in the workforce analysis or support data on personnel activity.     Complete this page as follows:     oTimely Receipt:  Indicate whether the Executive Order AAP was received on  time by checking ""YES"" or ""NO.""  If the AAP was received on  time, complete the steps below.  For the Disabled/Veterans' (D/V) AAP, indicate  whether it was received.     If the Executive Order AAP was not received on time, on page 9 (Problems  with AAP and Support Data), indicate the date a Show Cause Notice was issued or,  if not issued, the reason.  If the D/V AAP was not received, on page 9 indicate  the date a 30-day Notice was issued or, if not issued, the reason.  When the  contractor does first submit its AAP(s), complete the steps below.     oIncluded?:  Review the Executive Order AAP and support data and the D/V AAP  to ensure that all listed elements are present.  Beside each item, enter a ""Y""  for yes if it is included, or a ""N"" for no if it is missing.     If an element is missing, no further entries are needed concerning it on  this page since it will automatically be neither ""reasonable"" (if a  central element) nor ""acceptable.""  Note any such missing elements on page 9.     oReasonable?:  Beside each central element of the Executive Order  AAP--Workforce Analysis, Utilization Analysis (and its components) and Current  Goals--enter a ""Y"" or ""N"" to indicate whether the element is reasonable (see OFCCP Federal Contract Compliance Manual--hereafter Manual--Section 2F).      If one or more of these central elements is not reasonable, on page 9  describe the specific problem and give the date a show cause notice was issued  or, if no Show Cause was issued, the reason.  If all central elements were  reason-    able, audit the submission for acceptability.     oAcceptable?:  Beside each listed element, enter a ""Y"" or ""N""  to indicate whether it is acceptable (see Manual, Sections 2G, 2H, and 2I).       If any element is not acceptable, list it on page 9 and describe the  specific problem.     If N, p. 9 Item #:  Beside each listed element with an ""N"" under ""Included,""  ""Reasonable,"" or ""Acceptable,"" give the SCRR page 9 item  number where the specific problem is discussed.     Later contractor corrections to an initial submission need not be recorded  here, but will be recorded on page 9 beside the particu-lar problem.     PAGE 5:  PERSONNEL ACTIVITY TABLE    This worksheet provides an EEO-1 category overview of the con-    tractor's major personnel activity over the last AAP year.  If you are doing  a university review, use the EEO-6 Personnel Activ-ity Table (supplied with this  package), which is the same form, but with EEO-6 category headings.     At the top of the page, enter the dates covered by the personnel activity  data to be recorded below.  The data will normally cover the last full AAP year,  but where data for that period are not available, enter the dates covered by  whatever data are avail-    able.     Enter the number of hires, promotions and terminations by minor-    ity group and sex in each EEO category.  If the category is not in use in  the contractor's workforce, enter N/A; if it is in use but had no activity,  enter ""no activity;"" if the contractor did not maintain data for the  category, enter ""no data.""     This information, together with the historical workforce data in the EEO  Trend Analysis (below), provides a framework for later review of affirmative  action progress and employment activity by job group.  Also, since both these  data and EEO trend data are by particular minority group, they can help identify  any potential problems for a particular minority group.    PAGE 6:  EEO TREND ANALYSIS WORKSHEET     This worksheet permits an assessment of net change in minority and female  representation over both the long-term (comparing the earliest EEDS EEO category  data with current data) and the short-term (comparing data for the beginning of  the last full AAP year with current data).     The appropriate EEDS report for EEO-1 data is EEO20; for EEO-6  data, EEO69.   EEO-1 categories are indicated beside the data entry space.  If you are doing a  university review, use the EEO-6 Trend Analysis Worksheet (included with this  package), which is the same form but with EEO-6 category headings.     At the top of the page beside A, enter the date of the earliest data on the  current EEDS report; beside B, the date of the beginning of the last full AAP  year; and beside C, the date of the end of the last full AAP year.     NOTE:  If the contractor has not previously been required to maintain an  AAP, for B use the date of its latest EEO-1 or EEO-6 submission shown on the  current EEDS report; and for C, the date of its most recent EEO-1 or EEO-6  submission not yet shown on EEDS.     To complete this page, for each EEO category and for the total workforce,  make the following entries:     oLine A - Enter the earliest data shown in the current EEDS report, then  calculate and enter the percentage of women and of minorities.     oLine B -  Enter data for the beginning of the last full AAP year, then  calculate and enter the percentage of women and of minorities.     oLine C - Enter data for the end of the last full AAP year, then calculate  and enter the percentage of women and of minorities.     The EOS may wish to make notes on net change and/or white collar and blue  collar subtotals, etc. preparatory to completing the     EEO Trend Analysis Narrative below.    PAGE 7:  EEO TREND ANALYSIS NARRATIVE    At the top of the page, check whether the data are from EEO-1 or EEO-6  information.  Then complete the narrative as follows:     Item 1 - EEO Trends     (a)Total Workforce:  Over the long-term (line A vs. line C on the preceding  worksheet), has the contractor's overall work-force been relatively stable or  has it been expanding or contracting?  If one of the latter, how substantial has  the change been?  Has it been due to marked expansion or con-    traction in particular categories?  What has the change been in the  representation of minorities and women in the over-    all workforce?  As a percent of total?  Numerically?     Address the same questions as above concerning short-term total workforce  trends (Line B vs. Line C on the preceding worksheet).     (b)White Collar:  Over the long and short-term, what has the change been for  minorities in the white collar workforce?  What has the change been for women in  nontraditional white collar categories (normally white collar exclusive of  Office and Clerical and retail Sales)?  Have there been notable minority/female  gains or losses in particular categories?  Give particular attention to  Officials and Managers and Professionals (and any other categories normally  considered favorable in the industry involved).     (c)Blue Collar:  Over the long and short-term, what have the changes been  for minorities and women in the blue collar workforce?  Have there been notable  minority/female gains or losses in particular categories?  Give particular  attention to Crafts.     NOTE:  In discussing short-term trends above, also consider the level and  type of personnel activity shown on page 5.  Lack of short-term progress may be  tied to few hiring/promotion oppor-    tunities in a category over the last AAP year; or to termina-    tions cancelling out hiring gains.  Such observations can help provide a  framework for later analyses by job group of goals (SCRR page 10) and employment  activity (IRAs, SCRR page 15).     Also, in considering page 5, note any obvious major discrepancies that may  need clarification.  For example, if a category shows a short-term gain of 50  persons, but page 5 shows little or no hiring in the category during the AAP  year, you may wish to ask the contractor the source of the growth.     Item 2 - EEO Category Patterns:  Are there any EEO categories in which  minorities or women have been persistently concentrated?  Are there other  categories in which minorities or women appear to be substantially  underrepresented?  In making these assessments, rely upon your general knowledge  of the contractor's labor area, type of business/skill needs, and the  representation of minor-    ities and women in possible feeder categories.     The intent here is not to make comparisons with some hypothetical ""category""  availability (which is inappropriate), but again, to establish a broad framework  for later examination of job groups within those categories, workforce patterns  and IRAs.     For example, if there are very few women in Crafts but many in Operatives,  the EOS is forewarned to look at the types of jobs    in Crafts; the distribution of women vs. men in Operative job     groups/departments/lines of progression; and the volume and type of promotions  from Operatives to Crafts.     Item 3 - Particular Minority Groups:  Identify any substantial disparity in  the representation of a particular minority group or men or women of a  particular minority group.  Is any such dispar-ity present in the workforce as a  whole or only in certain EEO categories?  In making this assessment, as above,  consider the representation of particular minority groups in the contractor's  labor area and in possible internal feeder categories.  Where you observe such a  disparity, plan to conduct standard desk audit discrimination analyses by the  particular minority group (rather than by minorities in the aggregate), at least  in those work-    force areas where the disparity exists and for the type of activ-ity most  likely to have created the disparity.  For example:    -  The contractor is located in a labor area that is 20% minority, composed  of 9% Blacks, 9% Hispanics and 2%     others.  Although the contractor has a large number of jobs probably filled  locally, it historically has employed less than 1% Hispanics.  Under these  circumstances, the EOS should plan to conduct all hiring IRAs specifically for  Hispanics.    -  The contractor has a predominantly blue collar workforce with good  overall minority representation.  However, Blacks are concentrated in Laborers,  poorly represented in Opera-    tives and absent in Crafts.  Under these circumstances, the EOS should:  (1)  in reviewing the workforce analysis, plan to identify blue collar jobs held by  Blacks and whether there is any structural/potential placement problem impeding  their upward mobility, and (2) plan to conduct blue collar IRAs (particularly  for hiring and promotion into Operatives and Craft job groups) separately for  Blacks.    Further discussion of separate minority group analyses is given in the  instructions for SCRR page 14 (Review of Workforce Analy-    sis) and SCRR page 15 (IRAs).  Please also note that if onsite investigation  of such a disparity does not indicate potential discrimination, the EOS should  then consider whether the imbal-    ance warrants separate affirmative action steps--whether goals and/or  specific action programs--for the group (see 41 CFR    60-2.12(l)).    PAGE 8:  ORGANIZATION OF CONTRACTOR'S WORKFORCE AND    REVIEW OF SUPPORT DATA ON PERSONNEL PRACTICES      The intent of this page is to describe those aspects of the par-    ticular contractor's structure and practices which will influence the  interpretation of both affirmative action and potential dis-    crimination issues.  DO NOT ADDRESS RACIAL OR SEX DISTRIBUTION ON THIS PAGE.      oItem 1:  Organization of Contractor's Workforce - Describe how the  contractor's workforce is organized using whatever information is available in  the contractor's AAP and support data (if there is an organization chart,  indicate where it is located in the AAP or case file).     If the contractor's AAP narrative is not helpful, scan the workforce  analysis to identify (a) major organizational units--i.e. those containing the  largest number of employ-    ees, and (b) the type of work that appears to be performed in these major  units.     Also identify any possible formal/informal lines of pro-    gression (LOPs).  If the contractor has not included pro-    gression line charts in its AAP, a union contract(s) may include information  on LOPs.  If neither source is helpful, does the workforce analysis show any  indicators of possible LOPs (for example, sequenced job titles--Assembler A, B,  C; Assistant Teller, Teller, Senior Teller; Scientist I, II, III, etc.)?     oItem 2:  Internal Mobility - Review the contractor's AAP and support data  on personnel practices for any information on how personnel processes work at  the establishment, with particular attention to internal mobility:     (a)Does the contractor indicate that it posts or otherwise makes job  openings known?  How?  At what levels?  Who is eligible to bid/apply?  What  factors are considered in choosing among internal candidates?     (b)Specifically address whether the contractor has one or more collective  bargaining agreements.  If it does, with what union(s)?  Covering what areas of  the work-    force?  Involving what provisions for promotion/transfer, layoff/recall, etc.?     (c)Also, review the contractor's hiring and promotion activity to identify:          Which job groups/areas have had the largest number of hires during the  past year?  Are there job groups  which have been filled only or almost  exclusively by hire?        Which job groups/areas have had the largest number of promotions during  the past year? Are there job groups which have been filled only or almost  exclusively by promotion?          oItem 3:  Pay Structure  - How is the contractor's pay system structured in  major portions of the workforce?  For example, are blue collar jobs paid by  grade level?  If so, what is the lowest and highest grade?  Are salaried jobs  organized into rate ranges identified by letter code?  If so, what is the lowest  and highest letter code?     PART B:  AFFIRMATIVE ACTION    PAGE 9:  PROBLEMS WITH AAP AND SUPPORT DATA     At the top of the page, check whether the page concerns the Executive Order  AAP and support data, the D/V AAP or both, then complete the columns as follows:      o# (a):  Assign a number to each problem identified as a  result of your  initial review of the contractor's AAP and support data submission (SCRR page  4).     oAAP AND SUPPORT DATA PROBLEMS (b):  Briefly describe each problem, and  indicate  whether it is that the AAP or support data item was not  included, was  not reasonable or was not acceptable.  This description should be specific  enough for a reader to clearly understand the issue involved--i.e. ""Current  goals are lower than the contractor's availability estimates in four  Professional job groups,"" NOT ""Goals are unacceptable.""     oACTION TAKEN and/or PLAN TO RESOLVE (c):  Describe the action(s) you have  taken or plan to take to resolve the problem.  For example, if the contractor  failed to submit     an Executive Order AAP, the normal entry would be ""Show Cause issued  (date),"" followed by ""AAP submitted (date).""  For an unacceptable  AAP or support data ingredient, the entry may be ""Called M. Jones to  request (appropriate revision) be made and ready onsite.""     Leave enough room between entries in this column to allow  for a description  of any probable subsequent desk audit developments.  For example, if the problem  is ""No informa-    tion on what job titles fall in what job groups,""  and the action is ""Called  S. Smith 9/5 to obtain listing of titles within group,"" a subsequent desk  audit development may be ""Received listing 9/10.""     oOnsite? (d):  Check those items that will require onsite follow-up.  These  checked items will be your onsite plan  for resolution of AAP and support data  problems.    NOTE:  Your onsite review must include confirmation of the contractor's  implementation of its AAP commitments (see Manual Section 3G01).  If onsite you  identify a problem with AAP implementation that is not covered elsewhere in the  SCRR,* add it to this page.  Enter ""ONS"" for onsite in column ""b""  and complete the other columns as indicated.    ONSITE    o# (e):  Enter the same item number assigned to this problem in column (a).      oFindings/Conclusions (f):  For each AAP and support data  problem for which  you checked onsite, enter your onsite  findings and conclusions.  For example,  if the problem were that the contractor's availability analysis appeared to   give insufficient weight to internal availability, you may note that an onsite  sample of records showed that the  majority of incumbents in the job group had  entered via promotion rather than new hire.    Where a fuller narrative description of findings (and/or resolution, column  (h) below) is needed, attach it to this page (labeled with the item number to  which it pertains).     oResolved? (g):  Enter ""Y"" for yes or ""N"" for no to  indicate whether the problem with the AAP or support data has been resolved.      ________    *AAP implementation issues covered elsewhere are those pertaining to:  (1)  good faith efforts on goals (SCRR p. 11); (2) the Sex Discrimination Guidelines  (SCRR p. 12); (3) Disabled/Veterans requirements (SCRR p. 13); and technical  requirements (if you use the SCRR optional worksheet on Technical Requirements).      oResolution (h):  If the problem has been resolved, describe the resolution.   For example, ""Contractor increased the weight of internal availability in  XYZ job group from 2% to 60% resulting in the following corrected final  availability figures:  Minorities - originally 10%, corrected to 20%; Women -  originally 5%, corrected to 30%.""  If the problem has not been resolved,  discuss the contractor's position on the matter and the actions you are  recommending.    oAAP or Other Reference Pages (i):  When a resolution has been reached,  indicate here the pages of the AAP, support data or other document in which the  resolution is incorporated.     oClose-Out Document (j-k):  If you plan to include the problem in a  close-out document, check ""Include?.""  Leave the ""Para. #""  column blank until the end of the review.     PAGE 10:  ANALYSIS OF AFFIRMATIVE ACTION PROGRESS    Prior Year AAP/Current Year AAP    This page is divided horizontally into two parts:  (I) Goals,    and (II) Workforce Change.  Part I is mandatory; Part II is optional.  Enter  data on job groups for which goals were established.     Prior year goals must always be addressed (unless the contractor was not  previously covered by 41 CFR Part 60-2).  Both prior and current year must be  addressed if the contractor was six months or more into its current AAP year at  the time it received the Scheduling Letter.     At the top of the page, check the appropriate box to indicate whether the  data are for the prior year or the current year. Enter the starting and ending  dates of the period involved and then complete this page as follows:     Part I - Goals:     oEEO Category (a):  Enter the initials or number of the EEO-1 or EEO-6  category in which the job group falls.  Goals should normally be analyzed by job  group within EEO category order, i.e. job groups within Officials and Managers first, then job  groups within Professionals, etc.     oJob Group (b):  Enter the name of the job group being analyzed.     oGoal (c):  Enter the minority/female percentage placement goal.*    oTotal Placements (d):  Enter the total number of placements into the job  group during the AAP year.     oExpected (Placements) (e):  Enter the number of minorities or women who  would have been placed under the percentage placement goal.  To find this  expected number of placements,    multiply the total placements (d) by the goal (c).  Round down to the  nearest whole number (i.e. 0.1 = 0, 11.7 = 11, 0.4 = 0, etc.).     EXAMPLE:  For the Crafts I job group, ABC Company set a goal of 10% for  minorities and 5% for women.  During the AAP year, there were 50 placements into  the job group.  For minorities, you would have expected 5 place-    ments (.10 X 50); for women you would have    expected 2 (.05 X 50 = 2.5 = 2).     oActual (Placements) (f):  Enter the actual number of placements into the job group during the AAP year who were minor-ity/female.     oDifference (g):  Subtract the actual number of placements of  minorities/women (f) from the expected number of placements (e) to find the  difference--preceded by a plus (+) or minus (-) sign.     EXAMPLE:        Expected     Actual     Diff.     Minorities         5           6         +1        Women              2           1         -1     Part II - Workforce Change:  As noted above, this portion is  optional.  It  can be useful in focusing attention on job groups where, although there has been  progress in placements, there has been little or no improvement in minority or  female representa-    tion.  This normally is caused by disproportionate minority or    _________    *If the AAP specifies a goal for a particular minority group or for men or  women of a particular minority group, either change the line heading here from ""Min.""  to an abbreviation for the identified group or use another copy of this page to  evaluate goals progress for the identified group.    female movement out of the job group, whether for positive (pro-motions out)  or negative (terminations) reasons, and alerts the EOS to look at Impact Ratio  Analysis (IRA) results for the job group.     Complete this portion of the page as follows:     oBeginning Workforce (h-i):  In column (h) enter the total number of  employees and in column (i), the total number of minorities and the total number  of women in each job group at the beginning of the AAP year.     oEnding Workforce (j-k):  In column (j) enter the total number of employees  and in column (k), the total number of minorities and the total number of women  in each job group at the end of the AAP year.     oNet Change (l-m):  In column (l) enter the difference be-    tween the beginning and ending total workforce in the job group.  ln column  (m), enter the difference between the minority and female beginning and ending  workforce in the job group, preceded by a plus (+) or minus (-) sign.     PAGE 11:  EVALUATION OF GOOD FAITH EFFORT     Evaluate the contractor's overall affirmative action performance.  Was there  progress in most areas where goals were established?  for minorities?  for  women?  for both?  In areas with little progress, are there any balancing  factors such as strong perform-ance in similar or higher level jobs within the  category or generally?  Do performance problems fall in categories with poor  long-term trends (compare SCRR p. 6)?     In evaluating fulfillment of AAP commitments, consider the  quality of those  commitments in terms of their probable long-    range as well as short-range contribution to improving the contractor's  affirmative action posture.  Also consider whether the contractor has used  positive problem solving to help remove any impediments to minority/female  utilization, vs. continued adherence to strategies that are not working.     As a result of this evaluation, identify any goal areas needing further  evaluation for good faith effort.  Complete the remainder of this page as  follows:     o# (a):  Assign an item number to the goal area which needs further  evaluation for good faith effort.     oGOAL AREA (b):  Enter the name of the goal area.  A goal area may be a job  group or a cluster of job groups with similar AAP commitments to be evaluated  for good faith effort.  For example, if the contractor committed to recruit  minority technicians from XYZ organization, and showed little progress in  several technician jobs groups, the goal area may be ""Technician (Elec.,  Mech., Test).""     oMIN./FEM. (c):  Indicate whether the goal(s) involved was for minorities,  for women or for both.  If it was for members of a particular minority group,  enter an abbrevia-    tion for the group.    oPR/CURR YR (d):  Indicate whether the goal(s) needing further evaluation  for good faith effort was for the prior year, the current year or both.     oPOSSIBLE CAUSES/PERTINENT AAP COMMITMENTS (e):  Review any contractor  description of good faith effort pertinent to the goal area.  Also review data  on employment activity in the area, and any relevant AAP information on  personnel prac-    tices/workforce structure.     What appear to be the reasons for the lack of progress?  What AAP  commitments would have helped?  For example:     -If jobs in the area were filled predominantly by hire,  does it appear that  insufficient applicant flow was the problem?  If so, does the contractor's  explanation ad-    dress recruitment efforts?  Were any commitments made in the prior AAP  concerning recruitment?  Were they  fulfilled?     -If most openings were via promotion, was there an adequate supply of  minorities/women in feeder jobs?  If so, did the contractor make any AAP  commitments con-    cerning the promotion process relevant to the area,  such as a commitment  to:  identify promotable minor-    ities/women (skills inventory); increase promotability (training, job  rotation); encourage upward mobility (counseling, encouraging bidding), etc.?   Were any such commitments fulfilled?     NOTE:  Where the problem is the candidate pool (low appli- cant flow, few  minorities/women in feeder jobs), the issue is normally affirmative action  (recruitment, goals at the feeder group level).     However, where the candidate pool is adequate, either affirmative action or  discrimination may be the issue, so pay close attention to the area involved  when conducting IRA analyses.  If you find an adverse IRA in the goal area    involved, pursue the matter first as a potential discrimin-ation issue, and  note that you are doing so here.  Only if you do not find discrimination, return  to complete this evaluation of good faith effort for the goal area.     oADDITIONAL INFORMATION NEEDED (f):  Describe the additional information you  will need to evaluate the contractor's good faith effort.  For example, records  of recruitment efforts, contact with community organizations to confirm  appropriate job listings, etc.  If you have obtained sufficient addi-    tional information at desk audit to conclude there was good faith effort, so  indicate here.     oONS (g):  Check here those items that will require onsite follow-up.  These  checked items will be your onsite plan for evaluation of good faith effort.       ONSITE    o# (h):  Enter the same number assigned to this item in column (a).     oFINDINGS (i):  Discuss your onsite findings on whether the contractor made  a good faith effort in the goal area.  For example, ""Contractor placed  timely and accurate job listings with the major community organizations  specified in its AAP, but received no referrals for this job group.  This was  con-firmed by contact with XYZ referral sources who cited a scarcity of  candidates with the skill specialty involved.""     Where a fuller description of findings (and/or the discus-    sion in column (k) below) is needed, attach it to this page (labeled with  the item number to which it pertains).    oGFE? (Good Faith Effort) (j):  Indicate by entering ""Y"" for yes  or ""N"" for no whether you conclude the contractor made a good faith  effort in this goal area.  If you conclude the contractor made a good faith  effort, no further entries are needed on this sheet, unless you have reached an  agreement with the contractor to take supplementary actions to help improve the  chances of progress during the next AAP year (if so, describe in the next  column).     oIF NO, SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION, CONTRACTOR POSITION, EVALUATION (k):  If  you conclude the contractor did not make a good faith effort, supply any  background information that may provide perspective on the lack of good faith  effort.     For example, ""This job group is seriously underutilized for minorities  (10% incumbency, 20% availability), and has been for at least the last three  years.  The contractor had adequate openings to make progress, but has  consistently failed to take steps to increase minority applicant flow for the  jobs involved, etc.""     Also discuss and evaluate the contractor's position on the matter.     oClose-Out Document (l-m):  If you plan to include the problem in a close  out document, check ""Include?.""  Leave the ""Para. #"" column  blank until the end of the review.    PAGE 12:  IMPLEMENTATION OF GUIDELINES ON RELIGION    AND NATIONAL ORIGIN AND SEX DISCRIMINATION     Verify the contractor's implementation of the Guidelines on Religion and  National Origin and the Sex Discrimination Guide-    lines.  In both cases it is only necessary here to address those policies  and practices that are not covered elsewhere in your evaluation of the  contractor's compliance with the Executive Order--for example, maternity leave  policy, leave for religious purposes, etc.  Since the contractor is not required  to address 41 CFR Part 60-50 in its AAP, and may or may not include a copy of  leave policies, evaluation of these items and their implemen-    tation is normally done onsite.    If, while verifying this implementation, you identify a potential  discrimination issue, check [  ] ""Pot. Disc."" and include the problem  on page 17, ""Summary of Potential Discrimination Problems.""     PAGE 13:  IMPLEMENTATION OF DISABLED/VETERANS    AFFIRMATIVE ACTION REQUIREMENTS      Determine if the contractor has fully implemented its obligations under the  individuals with disabilities and veterans programs.     Part I:     oDescribe Contractor Actions/How Verified:  For each listed  regulatory  item, indicate the actions the contractor has taken, and briefly state how you  made your determination.      For example, in item 4 concerning the Mandatory Job Listing requirement  under the veterans' program, a verification may    be:  ""9/7/88 conversation with J. Smith, Vets. Rep. at the Odgen County  State Employment Service office, confirms contractor's listing of suitable jobs.""      If you determine that the contractor has not taken adequate action, briefly  describe the problem and, if resolved, its resolution.     oProblem?  (D/V):  Enter an ""D"" for disabled, a ""V"" for  veterans, or ""D/V"" for both, to identify the program under which the  contractor has not taken adequate action on the item.     oResolved?:  Enter ""Y"" for yes or ""N"" for no to indicate  whether the problem has been resolved.     oClose-Out Document:  If you intend to include this item in  a close-out  document, check ""Include?.""  Leave the ""Para. #"" column  blank until the end of the review.       Part II:      The purpose of this part is to identify any contractor personnel  practices  or job requirements which may be screening out quali-    fied individuals with disabilities or special disabled veterans, including  those who could have performed the jobs involved given reasonable accommodation.      1.Determine if the contractor has any blanket medical stand-    ards, or medical standards applicable to particular jobs.     Such standards may be incorporated in a policy manual, a manual for medical  personnel or in position descriptions/    qualification standards.  They also may be identifiable through rejections  of persons with certain medical condi-    tions based on responses to application form medical ques-    tions and/or on results of physical examinations.     If you identify a medical standard, indicate the job(s) to which it applies,  and ask the contractor for the results of its review determining that the  standard is job related, consistent with business necessity and with the safe  per- formance of the job.     Evaluate the contractor's response.  If it does not adequately demonstrate  that the standard is job related, consistent with business necessity and with  the safe  performance of the job, include the matter on page 17, ""Summary  of Potential Discrimination Problems.""     Make sure the case file includes any available information relevant to  supporting your conclusions--such as any position description for the jobs  involved, notes on your worksite observations, copies of any physical tests used  and their instructions, etc.--along with standard information on discriminatee  qualifications.     Appendix A to Chapter 6 provides some guidance on the types of information  to obtain about the job and about rejectees who have disabilities or are special  disabled veterans.  Additional guidance will be issued in the future on  assessing job relatedness, business necessity and safety claims as they relate  to the Section 503/4212 programs.    2.In the course of your review above, also identify any qualified  individuals with disabilities or special disabled veterans who could have  performed the job(s) involved given reasonable accommodation to their  disability.  If you identify such persons, include the matter on page 17, ""Summary  of Potential Discrimination Problems.""     Appendix A to Chapter 6 also provides guidance on the types of information  to obtain in evaluating whether the con-    tractor has provided reasonable accommodation, and further guidance will be  issued in this area in the future.    This page, particularly Part II, is normally completed onsite.    PART C:  POTENTIAL DISCRIMINATION    PAGE 14:  RESULTS OF REVIEW OF WORKFORCE ANALYSIS     Review the contractor's workforce analysis to identify patterns of minority  and female employment.  Identify and discuss poten-    tial problem areas where minorities/women are underrepresented or  concentrated.     To focus this review, use the results of your earlier SCRR ana-    lyses such as:     1.EEO Trend Analysis Narrative (SCRR page 7).    (a)  Category Patterns.  Pay particular attention to areas with persistent  representation of minorities or women substantially above or below probable  availability.  Using an earlier example with many women in Operatives but few in  Crafts, what types of jobs are in Crafts?  At the Operative level, are men and  women in different types of jobs (which may have different progression  opportunities--see 2 below)?     (b)  Particular Minority Groups.  Pay specific attention to the distribution  of a particular minority group in areas where you identified a substantial  disparity in the repre-    sentation of that group.  Using an earlier example with Blacks concentrated  in Laborers, poorly represented in Operatives, and absent in Crafts,  specifically identify the blue collar jobs held by Blacks and look for any  structural (see 2 below)/potential placement problems that may be inhibiting  upward mobility.    Even when such disparities are not observed in the initial category screen,  if the labor area has a high representa-    tion of more than one minority group and/or the general employment patterns  in the industry involved have differed among minority groups, in reviewing the  workforce analysis the EOS should be alert for any indications of potential  problems in the distribution of a particular minority group.      2.Organization of the Contractor's Workforce and Review of Support Data on  Personnel Practices (SCRR page 8).  Focus on minority group and female  employment patterns in those work-force areas relevant for this particular  contractor.  Among the possibilities are:  departments/units; possible lines of  progression (LOP's); grade or salary levels; supervisory positions vs. those  supervised; etc.  For example:     (a)If the contractor has possible LOPs, are minorities and women fairly  evenly distributed among LOPs or are they concentrated in ones that offer less  favorable pay or  progression?  If there is no problem in distribution among  LOPs, are minorities/women within LOPs fairly  evenly distributed or are they  clustered toward the bottom?     (b)If departments or units are relevant in determining eligibility for  promotion (or other employment acti-    vity), how are minorities/women distributed among those departments or  units?  Where department/unit seniority is used for promotion, layoff or other  purposes, how are minorities/women distributed among the departments or units?      Please note that even where plant seniority is used for promotion, if it is  exercised first within the depart-    ment where the opening occurs it can limit access to more favorable  departments (since, in practice, all but entry-level and/or undesirable jobs may  be filled with-in the department).     (c)If the contractor announces job openings up to a certain salary level, is  there any marked drop in minority or female representation above that level?      The type of questions to ask and patterns to look for will be different in  each compliance review (as will the quality of desk  audit data) depending on  the organization and practices of the  particular contractor.  The important  thing is to focus on the factors pertinent to that contractor.     DISCUSSION OF RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN     REVIEW OF WORKFORCE ANALYSIS AND IRAS     The workforce analysis essentially reflects employment activity  over an  extended period of time, while IRAs reflect that activity during the most recent  period.  Therefore, pay particular atten-    tion to IRAs in those areas where review of the workforce analy-    sis showed marked underrepresentation or concentration of minor-    ities or women.     For example, in a seriously underrepresented job area, an adverse hiring  and/or promotion IRA suggests that any problem may be  longstanding and, if  discrimination is found, there are likely to be victims within the normal  liability period (with or without a showing of continuing violation).     Or, in a concentrated job area, an adverse promotion IRA may reflect  differing opportunities for minorities or women to move up and out of the area.   This may suggest a structural problem--    i.e. a present policy or practice inhibiting movement--that may constitute  discrimination as well as a continuing violation.    In any event, be aware of possible connections between what you observe in  the workforce analysis and the results of the IRA analysis below.    PAGE 15:  IMPACT RATIO ANALYSIS (IRA) WORKSHEET     GENERAL COMMENTS     The Impact Ratio Analysis (IRA) is a comparison of the selection rates of  different groups from an identified candidate pool.  If  the selection rate for  one group is less than 80% of that for another, the IRA is adverse.     The following mathematical procedure is used to calculate an     IRA:       Find the selection rate for minorities/women by dividing their number of  selectees by their number in the candidate pool.       Find the selection rate for others by dividing their number of selectees by  their number in the candidate pool.       Compare the selection rate for minorities/women to the rate for others.  As  a matter of administrative discre-tion in compliance reviews, OFCCP will focus  on situa-         tions in which the selection rate for minorities or women is less favorable  than the rate for others.*  For positive actions such as hires and promotions,  this will be where the minority or female rate is lower; for negative actions,  such as terminations, it will be where the minority or female rate is higher.      4.Consistent with #3 above, the IRA is calculated when the selection rate  for minorities/women is less favor- able.  Therefore, to find the IRA for  positive     personnel actions, divide the lower minority/female rate by the rate for  others; for negative personnel actions, divide the rate for others by the higher  minority/female rate.    5.If the result of #4 above is less than .8, the IRA is adverse for  minorities or women.     When, and ONLY when an IRA is adverse, this worksheet calls for  an  additional calculation of how many minorities or women poten-    tially were affected.  This, when considered in conjunction with other  review information, may assist in setting investigative priorities.     IRAs may be conducted for women vs. men, for minorities in the aggregate vs.  nonminorities, or for a particular minority  group.**  Where your earlier review  of EEO trends (SCRR page 7) identified a substantial disparity in the  representation of a     _________    *The EOS should be aware, however, that sometimes a more favor-    able rate for minorities or women may indicate a ""channeling"" into  different and perhaps less favorable jobs than others.    **While desk audit IRAs may be based on minorities in the aggre-    gate, an onsite finding of discrimination must identify the par-    ticular minority group(s) against whom discrimination is alleged (see  Appendix 3A instructions for Worksheet 17-1 on onsite refinement of IRAs).    particular minority group, IRAs should be conducted separately for that  group at least in the workforce area(s) where the disparity was observed and for  the type of activity most likely to have caused the disparity.  For example:      -If the disparity you observed was a historical absence of a particular  minority group, all hiring IRAs should be con-    ducted separately for that group.    -If the disparity was that Hispanics have historically been well represented  in Professional jobs but absent from Man-    agement, your IRAs for promotions and hires into Management job groups  should be conducted separately for Hispanics.    -If the disparity was that over the past year the represen-    tation of Black Technicians declined dramatically, termina-    tion IRAs (and probably promotion and hire IRAs also) in Technician job  groups should be conducted separately for Blacks.    Even where such a disparity was not observed in the initial category screen,  where the labor area has a high representation of more than one minority group  and/or the general employment patterns in the industry involved have differed  among minority     groups, in reviewing the contractor's activity data preparatory to  conducting IRA, the EOS should be alert for any indications of potential  problems in selections of a particular minority group.    IMPORTANT:  Remember that an adverse IRA is only a preliminary indicator of  a potential discrimination problem.  For example, a job group IRA may measure  selection for jobs with differing qual-ification standards and consequent  differing candidate pools.  These matters need to be explored further (normally  onsite) before any conclusions can be reached.     IRA INSTRUCTIONS      At the top of this sheet enter the names of the groups whose selection rates  you are comparing (minorities vs. nonminorities; women vs. men; Blacks vs.  Others, etc.) and, in the ""Rate for:"" headings for columns (b) and  (c), an abbreviation for those groups.  Also enter the dates covered by the  employment activity data and the date of the incumbency data you are using  (incum-    bency data should, to the extent possible, be from the beginning of the  activity period), then complete this sheet as follows.     Job Area (a):  Enter the name of the job area being analyzed. Assuming this  is a job group, also indicate the EEO-1/6 category  to which it belongs.     HIRES     The hiring rate of a group is the number of that group who were hired  divided by the number of that group who applied.     oRate for: (b):  Enter the hiring rate for minorities, members of a  particular minority group or women (include both numbers and percent).     oRate for: (c):  Enter the hiring rate for others (include both numbers and  percent).     If the minority/female hiring rate is lower than that for others, compute  the IRA [(d) below].  If the minority/female rate is higher, no further entries  are required.    oIRA (d):  Since this is a positive personnel action, divide the lower  minority/female rate by the rate for others.     If the IRA is .8 or more, STOP.  No further entries are needed for this IRA.   Complete the remaining columns ONLY if the IRA is less than .8.     oOverall Rate (e):  Find the overall hiring rate by dividing the total  number of hires by the total number of     applicants.     oExpected (f):  Enter the number of minorities/women who would have been  hired if all persons had been hired at the same rate.  To get this number,  multiply the overall rate (e) by the number of minority or female applicants  [the denominator in (b)].  Round the result down to the nearest whole number  (i.e. 4.3 = 4; 0.7 = 0, etc.).    oActual (g):  Enter the actual number of minorities or women hired.     oDifference (h):  Subtract the actual number from the expect-ed number and  enter the difference.  This is how many addi-    tional minorities or women you would expect to have been hired if all groups  had been hired at the same rate.     If the difference is zero, leave this column blank, and the IRA need not be  pursued further.     EXAMPLE:  1 of 10 women were hired (10%), 5 of 10 men  were hired (50%).   The IRA is .2 (.10/.50).     Since there were 6 total hires (1 woman + 5 men), and 20 total applicants  (10 women + 10 men)--the overall hiring rate was 6/20 or 30%.     If men and women had been hired at the same rate, you would have expected  30% of the 10 female applicants--or 3--to have been hired.  Since the actual  number hired was 1, the difference is 2--i.e. 2 women may not have been hired  because of potential discrimination.     Your IRA sheet for this example would look like this:    PROMOTIONS      Following the same procedure as for hires, enter the promotion rates for  minorities, members of a particular minority group or women and the promotion  rate for others, then, if the minority/    female rate is lower, divide it by the rate for others.  If the resulting  IRA is less than .8, use the same method as for hires to determine overall rate,  expected, actual and difference.     Please note, however, that to analyze promotion data sensibly, you must:   (1) know how the contractor has defined promotions, and (2) draw on the results  of your Review of Personnel Practices (SCRR page 8), to develop some idea of  what the probable candi-    date pool was for the promotions involved.     For example, if you have data on promotion to Crafts II (mid-    level), you may determine based on your earlier review of person-nel  practices that the prime candidate pool is probably Crafts I (lowest level).  In  that case your IRA would be as follows:      EXAMPLE:     Total  Min.  Nonmin.     Promotions to Crafts II   12     2  9     Persons in Craft I    50    10 40     The minority rate is the number of minority promotions to  Crafts lI,  divided by the number of minorities in Crafts I-- i.e. 2/10 or 20%.     The nonminority rate is the number of nonminority promotions to Crafts II  divided by the number of nonminorities in  Crafts I--i.e. 9/40 or 22.5%.     To find the IRA, divide the minority rate by the nonminority rate--here,  .20/.225 or .89.     Since the IRA is not adverse, no further entries are needed and your IRA  sheet would look like this:    Obviously, you can only conduct this analysis if you can make a fair guess  at what the appropriate feeder pool is for promotion, and you would need to  confirm the accuracy of that guess onsite.  If you cannot make any preliminary  determination of probable feeder groups for promotion, you should wait until you  are     onsite to conduct this portion of the IRA.     TERMINATIONS     Follow the same procedures as for hires and promotions, except that:        Since this is a negative personnel action, the IRA is conducted when the  rate for minorities, members of a particular minority group, or women is higher  than the rate for others.      To find the IRA, divide the termination rate for others by the higher  minority/female rate.       If the IRA is adverse, when you find the expected number, round the result  up* to the nearest whole number (i.e. 0.3 = 1; 6.8 = 7; etc.).       Since in an adverse termination situation, you would expect fewer  minorities/women to have terminated, subtract the expected number from the  actual.          EXAMPLE: 6 of 40 women terminated (15%); 1 of 10 men terminated (10%), for  an IRA of .10./.15 or .67.     Since the IRA is less than .8, find the overall termination rate by dividing  the 7 total terminations (6 women + 1 man) by the 50 total incumbents (40 women  + 10 men)--i.e. 7/50 or 14%.    Multiply the overall rate by the number of female incumbents to find the  number of women you would have expected to ter-    minate--i.e. .14 x 40 or 5.6 = 6.     Since the expected number is 6 and 6 women actually terminated, the  difference is zero, and the IRA need not be pursued further.     _______    *The reason for rounding up here (vs. down on hires and promo-    tions) is to eliminate ""fractional persons.""  For example, in a  positive action, with 3.7 expected hires and 3 actual, the dif-    ference would be .7 ""more"" of a person hired; similarly, in neg-      ative actions, with 4.4 expected terminations and 5 actual, the difference  would be .6 ""less"" of a person terminated.  However, see later  comments on interpreting IRA results.     For this example, your IRA sheet would look like this:     OTHER ACTIVITY ELEMENTS     You may wish to attach additional IRA worksheets (with headings  appropriately modified) for other relevant employment activity information the  contractor may provide, such as training data.  In determining what information  to enter, simply remember that the rate for the groups you are comparing will  always be the number of persons selected (for training, for transfer, etc.)  divided by the number of persons in the pool eligible for selec-    tion.  How you define eligible for selection will depend on the situation  and the quality of your data.     INTERPRETING IRA RESULTS     IRAs do not stand alone.  They must be interpreted in light of surrounding  review factors.  For example,"

Introduction The soccer ball industry of Pakistan, principally concentrated in the city of Sialkot, has been under scrutiny in recent years for employing child workers. Manyreports describe children stitching soccer balls in small rural workshops or in homes.  1  The widespread coverage of children stitching soccer balls galvanized consumers,labor and religious groups and government officials to call for a stop to this practice.In June 1996, the U. S. Secretary of Labor and members of Congress helped launch the  FoulBall  campaign to ensure that soccer balls used by American children arestitched by adults and not children.  2 The public attention led U. S. importers to enter into an agreement with Paki-stani manufacturers, the ILO and UNICEF to stop using child labor.  3  More recently, public attention has focused on the use of child labor in India's soccer ball industry, leading to negotiations between Indian soccer ball manufacturers, exporters, NGOsand international organizations to develop a code of conduct prohibiting child labor. In addition, individual companies have taken steps to assure consumers thattheir products are not made by children. They have done so by revising their production process or creating child labor labels. For instance, Reebok has centralized all its soccer ball production in a new factory.  4  Nike also changed its manufacturing process in Pakistan by creating new stitching centers in order to better ensure chil-dren are not stitching Nike soccer balls.  5  Some U. S. importers, including Reebok and Baden Sports, have begun to label their soccer balls as produced without child labor. These labeling programs are the primary focus of this chapter. Information about labeling programs has been obtained from the companies using labels, from surveys of U. S. importers and retailers, and from field visits to India, Pakistan and China by Department of Labor officials. Section B of this chapter presents an overview of the industry and the market for soccer balls in the United States. Section C examines the role children play in the production of soccer balls around the world. Section D describes various labelingprograms. Finally, Section E reports responses of U. S.- based soccer ball importers and retailers to the child labor issue, based on a voluntary survey.  B. Industry Profile Soccer, or ""football"" as it is known in most countries, is the world's mostpopular sport.  6  Although soccer gained popularity slowly in the United States, enthusiasm for the sport has grown in recent years.  7  In 1980, there were fewer than 1 million youths registered to play soccer; by 1996 this figure had tripled to over 3 million.  8 Growth in the volume of U. S. imports of soccer balls reflects this trend. AsTable IV- 1 illustrates, in 1989, U. S. soccer ball imports were valued at $15.7 million;by 1996, the comparable figure was $34.2 million, a growth of 118 percent.  9  FigureIV- 1 lists U. S. imports of soccer balls by country and value. Some 71 percent ofthose imports came from Pakistan, 19 percent from China, 5 percent from Indonesia,1 percent from India, and the remaining 4 percent from other countries.  10  Soccerballs are not produced in the United States.  11 Soccer balls generally consist of a number of synthetic leather panels stitchedtogether in geometric patterns on the outside with an inflatable bladder inside.  12   Panels in high quality balls are hand- stitched for durability.  13  Hand- stitching these panels together is a very labor- intensive process and is where children have been found working. Figure IV- 2 illustrates the chain of production within the international soccerball industry. This schematic also highlights relationships among the various entitiesresponsible for production. The key actors can be described as follows:  14     Retailers typically sell a wide range of sporting goods, including soccer balls. They are not normally direct soccer balls importers; instead, they order the balls from brand name merchandisers. Retail outlets selling soccer balls include nationwide sporting goods or soccer specialty stores, independent sporting goods stores, department stores, mass-merchandisers, and toy stores.   Importers/ Design and Marketing Firms/ Merchandisers develop ball specifications and marketing strategies to promote their particular brand. They do not own the factories producing the balls, but contract with foreign manufacturers who produce the made-to-order balls. Some merchandisers have their own retail outlets for the sale of soccer balls and other products.   Contractors are foreign manufacturers who produce soccer balls for U. S. importers/ design and marketing firms/ merchandisers. They may produce soccer balls for several different buyers. Contractors usually do some of the production in their factories (e. g., cutting and packing), and outsource stitching and other tasks to subcontractors.

As of 1996, Korea no longer produced soccer balls for the U.S. market.   Source: Official Statistics of the U.S. Department of Commerce          Subcontractors are individuals who function as middlemen between the  contractor and village   stitchers.  15  Subcontractors typically deliver soccer ball kits to workers in surrounding villages. After the stitching is completed, the subcontractor pays the stitchers and returns the completed kits to the contractor.   Stitchers sew together the panels of a soccer ball and glue in the inflatable bladder. They are employed by subcontractors, typically on a piece rate basis, and may work in a stitching center, small village workshop, or in homes.      C. Child Labor in the Soccer Ball Industry The use of child labor in the production of soccer balls has been documentedprimarily in Pakistan and India.  16  Soccer balls are also made in China and Indonesia, but there are no known allegations of child labor in the soccer ball industries of these countries. The manufacture of soccer balls is controlled from the city but decentralized to homes and small workshops in surrounding villages. At the city factories or warehouses, the designs are printed and the pieces are cut. These are then packed into sacks and handed over to middlemen or subcontractors who distribute them in villages to families and workshops, where stitching traditionally is done both by adults and children. Subcontractors provide soccer ball kits to village workshops and/or households, where workers hand-stitch individual pieces together, glue the bladder to the material, and sew in the final piece. Some of the larger subcontractors in Pakistan have up to 300 stitchers working for them.  17  In some instances, there may be two or more tiers of subcontractors, with the balls passing through many hands on the way from the stitcher to the manufacturer. Once completed, the stitched soccer balls are then brought back by the middlemen to the factories for packing andshipment.  Pakistan Nearly all soccer balls are made in and around Sialkot, Pakistan  a regionfamous as a soccer ball producing hub for at least 80 years.  18  Seventy-five percent of the world's soccer balls were produced in Sialkot in 1996.  19  It is estimated that there are about 10,000 urban workers and 30,000 rural workers in the 1,450 surrounding villages of Sialkot involved in the production of soccer balls.  20 As recently as 1995, Pakistani soccer ball manufacturers denied that children were stitching soccer balls. The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan noted that when they visited Sialkot in 1995, manufacturers seemed to have instructed their contractors not to talk about child labor, and taken the contractors to task, ""not so much for employing child labor as for letting it become visible.""  21  At the time, theCommission reported that they found many children working in the soccer ball industry, despite the local industry's best efforts to conceal the children from view.  22 In 1996, an ILO study in the Sialkot region estimated that more than 7,000 Pakistani children between the ages of 5 and 14 stitched balls on a regular, full- time basis.  23  In addition, large numbers of children worked part-time outside of school hours. The great majority of these children were boys. More than 90 percent of the children stitching soccer balls are between theages of 10 and 14.  24  Most work in small shops or at home.  25  Seventy percent of the children work 8 to 9 hours a day; others work 10 to 11 hours per day.  26  It is estimated that 19 percent of the boys and 36 percent of the girls have never attended school.  27  Twenty-two percent of the boys and 25 percent of the girls attend school and work.  28  Although most of the child workers can read and write, many havedropped out of school because of uninteresting curricula, unsympathetic teachers and an uncomfortable school environment.  29 A recent study conducted for the Soccer Industry Council of America (SICA)found that stitchers make between 20 to 30 Pakistani rupees, or approximately $0.50 to $0.75, per ball.  30  On average, children are paid 20 to 22 Pakistani rupees per ball, or about $0.50 to $0.55. Payment tends to vary according to ball quality.  31  Most high quality balls are stitched by adults at stitching centers. The ILO reports that children are not likely to stitch high quality balls because they are not strong enough to make the required stitches. The wages for high quality balls are almost double than thosefor lower quality balls.  32  Depending upon skill and experience, a person is reportedly able to stitch between 1 and 5 balls a day.  33 There have been allegations of debt servitude in the soccer ball industry in Pakistan,  34  charges denied by Pakistani manufacturers  35  and a recent Save the Children-UK report.  36  However, the study commissioned by the Soccer Industry Council of America (SICA), the Save the Children report and a study conducted jointly by the ILO and the Punjab Department of Labor acknowledge that many families in thesoccer ball industry take loans or advances from subcontractors.  37  The advances are generally repaid through a deduction in the amount paid to the stitchers.  38  Most reports, however, are careful to note that intergenerational debt-bondage is not prevalent in the soccer ball industry. India India's sporting goods industry has its roots in Sialkot, Pakistan. When India was partitioned at independence in 1947, many of Sialkot's skilled Hindi craftsmen migrated across the border into the Punjab, settling in Jalandhar, where the Indian sporting goods industry is now based.  39  The Indian sporting goods industry has expanded to include the areas of Meerut, Uttar Pradesh, and Gurgaon, Haryana. Most of India's sporting goods, including soccer balls, are exported to the United Kingdom. Allegations of child labor in India's soccer ball industry have appeared since 1994.  40  Although these allegations were initially repudiated by some members of the Indian Sports Goods Export Promotion Council, recent public statements by members of the industry are more qualified, denying that child labor is used inmembers' factories, but acknowledging that the practice may occur through the process of contracting out to homeworkers.  41  About 300,000 persons work in the sporting goods industry producing over 200 different products.  42  It is estimated that about 10 percent of this work force, or 25,000 to 30,000 workers, are children.  43 Soccer ball production in India is similar to that in Pakistan: middlemen distribute soccer ball kits provided by large factories to small workshops and homes in surrounding villages, where soccer balls are stitched and returned. A 1997 study by Christian Aid, a British NGO, found children as young as seven stitching soccerballs in their homes.  44  The report described children working in small workshops orat home in urban slum areas and remote villages.  45  They work for many hours stitching the soccer balls while sitting in a hunched, squatting position. Some of thechildren go to school as well as work.  46  The report quotes the director of a Jalandhar soccer ball company as saying, ""the football industry uses children at the age of 10or 12. The quantity of footballs exported is too much to employ all the people we need in factories. Women and children do it in their houses whenever they get freetime.""  47 As in Pakistan, stitchers are paid per completed ball. One major exporter stated that stitchers average 13 to 14 Indian rupees per ball ($ 0.37 - $0.39) for the low quality soccer balls, and between 20 and 22 Indian rupees per ball ($ 0.56-$0.62cents) for the most commonly produced medium quality balls. Some Indian children reportedly earn as little as 7 Indian rupees per ball, or about $0.20.  48   D. Consumer Labeling Programs in the Soccer Ball Industry 1.  Introduction Adverse publicity in the United States and Europe about children stitchingsoccer balls prompted some importers to adopt labels informing consumers that their products have been produced in a child labor-free environment. In some cases, these programs are accompanied by changes in production processes to prevent theemployment of children. Although some individual companies have developed labels for their soccer balls, the majority of the soccer ball industry has opted instead to implement avariety of different codes of conduct to prohibit and prevent child labor. At a November 1996 meeting of the World Federation of the Sporting Goods Industry (WFSGI), companies rejected the possibility of labeling products, concluding that ""our ownindustrial brand names were statements of quality and ethics in their own rights and any disclaimer put on a separate label would only weaken that statement and the perception of the brand.""  49  They emphasized that by labeling only some balls, unlabeled balls might unfairly be thought to be made by children.  50  On the other hand, the President of the WFSGI commented that over time, it might be conceivable that products would carry a stamp indicating membership in WFSGI. Since the WFSGI isan endorser of the Pakistan Partners' Agreement, such a stamp would imply that aball made in Pakistan fulfilled the no child labor requirements of this agreement.  51  In making this proposal, the President noted that for such a stamp to be credible, it must be backed up by a strong and transparent monitoring system in addition to an enforcement mechanism capable of denying the use of the stamp or expelling members found violating the agreement.  52 Notwithstanding the WFSGI policy, recent evidence shows that child labor labeling is becoming more common in the soccer ball industry. For example, both Reebok and Baden Sports recently began selling soccer balls with a label stating that the balls are not made by children. The Reebok balls are made in Pakistan, while the Baden balls are made in China. The retail chain Dunkin' Donuts sold promotional soccer balls with a no child labor label during the 1997 summer months. Additionally, in response to a Department of Labor survey, the Kmart Corporation provided letters from their suppliers indicating that their balls are, or will be, labeled child labor-free. These labeling programs are described in the next few pages.  2.  Reebok a. Program Overview Reebok International Ltd. (Reebok) is a leading designer, marketer and worldwide distributor of sports, fitness and casual footwear, apparel, and sporting equipment. Total sales for 1996 were approximately $3.5 billion.  53  Reebok, a publicly held corporation, issued a code of conduct known as the Reebok Human Rights Production Standards in 1992. Among other things, the code of conduct bars the use of child labor in making Reebok products.  Recognizing the high incidence of child workers in the Pakistani soccer ball industry, in June 1996 Reebok officials said they were planning to buy Pakistani-made soccer balls that they ""knew with certainty"" were not made with child labor.  54  Reebok contracted with Moltex Sporting Goods (Pvt.) Ltd., a Pakistani soccer and rugby ball manufacturer, and Reed and Associates, a French company specializing inresearch and development, sourcing and manufacturing of high quality soccer and rugby balls, to build a soccer ball manufacturing plant. The new facility, located in Sialkot, has been making Reebok balls since March 1997. Soccer balls produced for Reebok by Moltex bear the following label on one of the panels: "" Guarantee: Manufactured without child labor. "" According to company officials, the use of the label allows Reebok to communicate their policy to consumers and stakeholders interested in ending exploitative child labor. Reebok's decision to label soccer balls was based on two factors: (1) increasing concern by consumers about children stitching soccer balls;  55  and (2) Reebok's desire to distinguish itself from other brands by centralizing stitching and all other production processes in a single factory and requiring rigorous external monitoring of the facility. Reebok officials state they will be able to place their label on Reebok balls ""with absolute confidence. Our consumers will know that Reebok balls are, without any doubt, child labor-free.""  56 b. Program Structure The three major elements of Reebok's program include:  57     containment of all production inside a new facility in which all work on Reebok balls is performed, including stitching. All workers must be age 15 or older;   external monitoring to ensure that: a) children are not entering the workplace, and b) soccer ball panels are not leaving the factory where the risk exists that they may be stitched by children in stitching centers or in homes; and   support of education and/ or vocational education training for children in the  soccer ball manufacturing region or Pakistan.     Reebok officials acknowledge that there are additional costs associated with creating a new facility that will house all production processes. According to Peter Moore, Senior Vice President of the Global Soccer/ Rugby Division, this shift in manufacturing processes will cost Reebok approximately 15 percent more.  58  Reebok saysthese additional costs  associated with pensions, health insurance and transportation for workers at the new factory  will be absorbed by the company; the salesprice of Reebok soccer balls will remain the same.  59 c. Program Implementation According to Reebok, the Sialkot facility began making soccer balls in March1997. Reebok hired three independent monitors to check the effectiveness of the program. Two of the monitors are associated with human rights organizations,  60  and the third is a Lahore-based affiliate of a major U. S. accounting firm.  61  The two human rights monitors were asked to monitor the factory, interview workers, maintain ties to the local community, and visit surrounding villages to be sure no Reebok panels are stitched outside the factory. Each monitor has the right to inspect the facility on an announced or unannounced basis.  62  The third monitor was hired to audit factory records in order to correlate the number of balls produced with the number of stitchers in the factory.  63  Reebok intends to make monitoring reports publicly available upon request.  64 Reebok says the auditing firm conducted a test audit in March 1997.  65  A representative of the auditing firm acknowledged they visited the plant and recommended that a number of accounting measures be implemented so that the firm could begin auditing records by August 1997.  66  Reebok notes that because other soccer balls are also being made by Moltex, the auditing process is very difficult.Reebok plans to reassess the value of engaging the outside auditing firm in addition to the human rights monitors.  67 Reebok issued the human rights monitors' first report on August 14, 1997, summarizing their findings from March through July 1997.  68  During the first five months of the project, the monitors visited the Moltex facility nine times to determine if children were present; three of the visits were unannounced. As of June 4, the monitors had found 236 workers in the factory, including 176 stitchers; 179 artisans working on a contract basis were also present. No children were found at the Moltex facility. During an April 29 visit, the human rights monitors observed balls being made at Moltex for another major buyer.  69  The factory management said these balls were being sent out of the factory for stitching, but were not Reebok balls. In August, Reebok stated it had given Moltex a large enough order to fill up the company's manufacturing capacity, and non-Reebok balls would be out of the factory by September 30.  70 The monitors recommended that a plan be devised to clearly assure them that Reebok balls were not being stitched outside the factory. In May, Reebok authorized the human rights monitors to hire a guard to stand at the factory gate tomake sure no Reebok ball panels are commingled with panels for other buyers as they leave the factory to be stitched elsewhere. The guard, who reports directly to the human rights monitors, was hired in June. He has been instructed to make sure that no Reebok panels leave the factory, and that no completed Reebok balls are coming in from the villages or outside stitching centers where children might bepresent. As of the end of July, the monitors informed Reebok that the guard has not observed any problems with Reebok balls entering or leaving the factory. Reebok has commented on the monitors' report, stating that a number of health and safety concerns in the factory had been communicated to Moltex.  71  In response, large posters with Reebok's human rights production standards translated into Urdu are being sent to Pakistan. Finally, Reebok acknowledges that a number of record keeping procedures are not yet complete, such as establishing personnel records with historical data and creating worker identification cards. In addition to its new ball factory and monitoring project, Reebok is planning an educational project.  72  The company has a three-year plan to improve educational opportunities for children in villages in the Sialkot area, specifically targeting displaced child workers. Reebok is working with the Society for Advancement of Education in Sialkot to implement the plan.  3.  Baden Sports a. Program Overview Baden Sports, Inc. is a family- owned athletic ball manufacturer. Founded eighteen years ago, Baden sells baseballs, basketballs, broom balls, footballs, soccer balls,volleyballs and water polo balls. Baden now imports soccer balls directly from one manufacturer in China. Baden recently shifted suppliers from Pakistan to China due to ""complications facing the industry in solving this [the child labor] problem,""  73  and because they ""never found the manufacturers in Pakistan to be reliable or trustworthy, and our experience is that you cannot inspect with confidence or expect that the Pakistani companies will adhere to any monitoring programs.""  74  Recent consumer inquiries, combined with market research indicating great consumer interest in the elimination ofchild labor, are Baden's primary reasons for changing its supplier and production practices. Baden claims that by switching suppliers to China, it has ensured elimination of child labor in its production of soccer balls: ""With our newly automated manufacturing process for patent-pending stitched balls, we can now guarantee, and certifyon the ball itself, that no child or slave labor has been used in the production of oursoccer balls.""  75  A Baden representative also stated that the shift to China coincided with a corporate decision to produce machine-sewn balls.  76 Soccer balls imported by Baden bear the label: ""Certified: No Child or Slave Labor Used on this Ball."" Baden also intends to produce packaging and advertisements stating that no child labor is used in the production of their soccer balls. Baden began marketing soccer balls bearing the child labor-free label in 1997.  77  In a press release announcing the availability of the product, Baden CEO E. C.Schindler stated ""it is our goal to ensure that soccer is played by children, not made by children. We are so sure of the integrity and quality of our products, we certify it.""  78 b. Program Structure Baden soccer balls are stitched in China using sewing machines, leaving only the last patch to be hand-stitched after the ball is turned right side out and the bladder inserted.  79  This process is done entirely at a factory run by Kuan Ho Sporting Goods Company Ltd., a manufacturing facility located in Dongguan, Guangdong Province, China.  80  Baden believes that through machine stitching it can obtain better quality and greater production volume using fewer workers. Baden claims that it can produce soccer balls 50 percent faster using sewing machines than stitching the balls by hand.  81 Kuan Ho's manager explained the plant's recruitment policy to visiting Department of Labor officials. Under China's labor laws, no one under 16 years of age is permitted to work. About 400 of the 2,400 workers at the factory produce soccer balls.  82  According to Kuan Ho's manager, most of the workers are female, earning about 60 to 70 percent above the local minimum wage of 500 yuan ($ 60) a month, or up to 900 yuan ($ 108).  83  The work force is made up almost entirely of migrants from other provinces within China; according to the Kuan Ho manager, they have a stable workforce due to fairly liberal benefits, which include vacations and the possibility of returning home once a year.  84 Baden requires written certification from the manufacturer that child labor is not used in the manufacture of Baden products. According to Baden's Asia representative, the company also requires Kuan Ho to allow access to personnel records. c. Program Implementation Baden management states that the company's factory representative monitors the Kuan Ho facility weekly. The factory representative explained that he visits the plant to check for quality, design and child labor but did not indicate the frequency of his visits.  85  A form verifying the absence of child labor in the production of soccer balls is to be filled out during each visit and signed by Baden's factory representative and an officer of Kuan Ho.  86 Baden management states that, in addition to the procedures noted above, it requires its representatives to verify the no child labor statements and representations made by Kuan Ho officials. The factory representative told U. S. Department of Labor officials that during his factory visits, he accepts the word of the plant manager that they are not employing child labor.  87  In addition, Baden management stated that a representative from Baden's headquarters occasionally accompanies the factory representative on site visits to verify company policies are being carried out correctly. The Department of Labor team received a copy of Baden's inspection report of Kuan Ho that certifies no child labor (i.e., no workers under sixteen) was being used in the production of soccer balls.  88  The copy of the inspection report itself had been prepared but not yet signed by the Baden representative or the Kuan Homanager.  89 Baden has no set policy to deal with the discovery of a child worker.  90  KuanHo's plant manager was aware of Baden's child labor concerns even though Baden does not have a written corporate policy on human rights or a special training program that covers this topic.  91  Workers at Kuan Ho were not aware of the purpose of Baden's labeling program.  92  The firm's management believes that workers do not need to know about such a program, although human resource managers  who are responsible for the hiring  do.  93 Baden states that the price of its soccer balls will likely increase slightly as a result of the new manufacturing and monitoring process.  4.  Other Child Labor Consumer Labels More and more soccer ball companies are promoting child labor labels particularly since the February 14, 1997 signing of the Partners' Agreement to Eliminate Child Labor in the Soccer Ball Industry in Pakistan ( see Section E. 1). The Department of Labor has received information on seven such labels. All the labelspromise that the soccer balls are not made by children. Only one of the labeling programs, sponsored by Dunkin' Donuts, has a monitoring and certification component. Four of these labels are associated with brand-name soccer balls that are soldin retail outlets. The other two labels are produced both for retail outlets and youth soccer leagues/clubs in the United States. a. Dunkin' Donuts Promotion The spread of child labor-free labels for soccer ballsis illustrated by a soccer ball promotion conducted by Dunkin'Donuts franchise outlets in New England during the 1997summer season.  94  With any purchase, a customer could buy for $9.99 a hand-stitched soccer ball bearing three logos: the Dunkin' Donuts logo; that of the New England Revolution, the region's professional soccer team; and the statement ""Produced Without Child Labor."" Posters with a photo of Alexi Lalas, one of the star players of the New England Revolution, were placed in participating Dunkin' Donut stores; many of the posters stated ""Ball Produced Without Child Labor"" in their right bottom corner.  95  The promotion was originally intended to run during the months of June and July but was extended until all the balls in stock are sold. The idea to put child labor-free labels on the promotional soccer balls came from Dunkin' Donuts New England franchisees, who expressed concern about child labor being used in the production of soccer balls made in Pakistan.  96  In response, letters from the U. S. Sporting Goods Manufacturers Association (SGMA) and Talon Sports  97  (the Pakistani manufacturer) were sent to Dunkin' Donuts stating that the balls would not be made by children. A committee of Dunkin' Donuts franchisees was uncomfortable relying solely on the promises of the manufacturer and the trade association. They agreed to approve the campaign only if the balls were certified ""child labor-free"" by an independent organization. As a result of the franchisees' concern about the credibility of a ""no child labor"" guarantee, Dunkin' Donuts, working through a sports marketing consultant in charge of the campaign (Sports Team), requested that a Washington, DC- based NGO the International Labor Rights Fund (ILRF)  serve as an independent monitor. Consequently, ILRF designed a monitoring program to ensure that soccer balls produced by Talon in Pakistan for Dunkin' Donuts were child labor-free. A six- month agreement between Sports Team and ILRF granted ILRF monitors total access to all Talon facilities, including its factories and stitching centers. Talon provided the ILRF with a map of the 43 stitching centers, a list of the names of all workers, and all of its records. Talon also consented to unannounced visits by the monitors, granting them access to all facilities and the ability to talk to workers without the presence ofsupervisory personnel.  98  ILRF monitors reported that they did not find any instances of illegal child labor. At the end of the summer, Dunkin' Donuts representatives were to evaluatethe soccer ball promotion program and determine whether to launch a spring campaign and whether it should be expanded beyond New England.  99 b. Individual Company Labels Another example of new labels informing consumers that a soccer ball ismade without child labor is that of individual companies promising that their balls are made only by adults. In response to the Department of Labor's voluntary survey, the Kmart Corporation provided the Department with letters from Seneca Sports,Inc., Franklin Sports, Inc., Molten U. S. A. and Spalding Sports Worldwide stating thatthey have or are planning to have a labeling program for soccer balls sold in Kmart stores. All four of the companies have endorsed the Partners' Agreement to Eliminate Child Labour in the Soccer Ball Industry in Pakistan and seem to base some of their no child labor assurances solely on this agreement. The following is some brief information about the claims made by each company to Kmart.      In its letter to Kmart dated February 18, 1997, Seneca Sports,  Inc. certified that its manufacturing facility in Pakistan ""prohibits inhumane conditions, violations of human rights and the use of child labor."" The letter further states that ""our packaging will certify that no child labor was used in the manufacturing of Seneca Soccer Balls.""    100  The package containing the Seneca ball states, ""Seneca® balls are certified as free from child labor."" The box also states ""Seneca Sports® Certified."" A Seneca official informed the Department of Labor that in the past year it has been asking its Pakistani supplier, Awan Sports, for assurances that soccer balls produced for Seneca are child labor- free. The Seneca representative further stated that Awan Sports has consolidated all its soccer ball production into one facility, preventing the outsourcing of stitching operations, and thereby minimizing the chance of child labor. Both Seneca and Awan Sports endorse the Partners' Agreement.    101     Franklin Sports, Inc. informed Kmart on February 18, 1997 that  it is a member of the Partners' Agreement, noting that a monitoring system had been implemented to ensure compliance with the Agreement.    102  In addition, Franklin stated it will independently assure that: 1) factories manufacturing Franklin soccer balls will be monitored by an independent contractor on a quarterly basis, with reports available for review by Kmart management; 2) factories will use only factory managed labor in the production of soccer balls, eliminating any possibility that child labor could be used in a cottage industry environment; and 3) Franklin will include a visible mark/logo on packaging and/ or product stating clearly that no child labor has been used in the production of the product, no later than July 1, 1997.    103       The president of Franklin Sports explained that placing a child  labor-free label on the balls ""is a visible way to tell people that we are in compliance with the Partners' Agreement. Also, retailers want assurances that our balls were not made by children.""  104 In a follow-up interview with the Department of Labor, Franklin confirmed that effective July 1, 1997, a label reading ""Manufactured Without Child Labor"" is being printed on balls made in Pakistan and exported to the United States. Franklin believes that stitching centers are being set up to centralize production and better manage who stitches the soccer balls. Franklin notes that they are relying solely on the Partners'Agreement to monitor production. Franklin requires all its Pakistani manufacturers to be members of the Partners' Agreement.  105      Molten U. S. A., in a letter to Kmart dated February 21, 1997, stated that ""we can now guarantee that no child labor will be used in any phase of the production of soccer balls supplied to Kmart Corporation."" The letter further states that Molten U. S. A. ""will begin to include a sticker on the cosmetic package referencing the child labor issue as soon as the stickers are produced. This should be no later than March 15."" A representative of Molten explained that its soccer balls are made in Pakistan, India and China, although the labels described in their letter to Kmart refer only to balls made in Pakistan. The representative stated that both Molten and their Pakistani supplier, Sublime Sports, are members of the Partners' Agreement. As of mid-August, however, Molten had not put ""no child labor"" labels on its Pakistani-made soccer balls. The company maintains that it is in the process of investigating the issue of child labor in Pakistan, and wants to ensure that any child labor- free guarantee made by Molten is absolutely credible.    106     Spalding Sports Worldwide stated in a February 21, 1997 letter to Kmart that all Spalding soccer ball manufacturers comply with the industry criteria and Spalding's Worldwide Labor Policy. The letter further states that Spalding is a member of the Partners' Agreement. Finally, the letter states that Spalding has added the following logo to all its soccer packages: ""No Child Labor Used to Produce This Product."" A representative of Spalding explained that Spalding sources 75 percent of its soccer balls from Pakistan; the remaining balls are made in China, but are molded and not hand- stitched. Spalding's two Pakistani manufacturers, Recto Sports    107  and Taj Mahal, are members of the Partners' Agreement. Spalding requires its manufacturers to certify Spalding balls have been produced without the use of child labor. Additionally, Spalding says that its quality control personnel visit the Pakistani facilities frequently and ensure that no child labor is used.    108       c. Child Labor Labeled Soccer Balls Provided to Youth Soccer Leagues In addition to the five companies listed above, other companies selling ballsdirectly to youth soccer leagues are making no child labor"" claims. While there maybe a number of companies supplying labeled balls to youth soccer leagues, the following two have come to the attention of the Department of Labor.      The Department of Labor obtained a soccer ball used at ""The  1997 Virginian Tournament,"" held in Springfield, Virginia, which carries the label ""No Child Labor Involved: Adult Sewn Product."" According to the information printed on the ball, it was made in Pakistan and imported by American Challenge, a U. S. importer of soccer balls. American Challenge officials informed the Department of Labor that its Challenge soccer balls are manufactured exclusively by JSD Sports (Pvt.) Ltd. in   Sialkot, Pakistan.  109  American Challenge has provided the Department of Labor with a letter from the Assistant Director of Labour Welfare, Government of the Punjab, stating that the mentioned manufacturer ""is abiding by all the by-laws in relation with employment of 'child labor' and there is no worker in the factory below the age of fifteen years. It is further certified that all workers/employees are free to leave the job and no bonded labour is involved in the manufacturing of products of the said concern.""    110  American Challenge stated that the company has been producing soccer balls with a ""no child labor"" label since January 1997. The soccer balls are sold to various dealers and individuals.    111     The American Soccer Company supplies soccer balls to ADULT  youth soccer leagues, soccer clubs, and stores under thebrand name SCORE. In the past year, the American Soccer Company began to distribute SCORE soccer balls with a PRODUCT label stating, ""Adult Sewn Product."" A SCORE representative said that placing the labels on the balls coincided with the signing of the Partners' Agreement, of which they are a member. SCORE requires that its Pakistani manufacturers be members of the Partners' Agreement as well. One of SCORE's suppliers in Pakistan is Talon Sports. Talon has provided letters to SCORE assuring that they do not use child labor in the production of their soccer balls. SCORE hopes to send company representatives to Pakistan at the end of the year to visit Talon and verify the no child labor assurances are accurate.    112     The two major organizations that sponsor and regulate youth soccer leagues in the United States, the United States Youth Soccer Association, Inc. (USYSA), andthe American Youth Soccer Organization (AYSO), have both publicly condemned the use of child labor in the manufacturing of soccer balls.  113  The official equipmentsupplier of the USYSA, the larger of the two groups, is Adidas, which does not place labels on its balls. The official ball of the AYSO is Spalding, which is placing child labor-free labels on AYSO sanctioned balls (see above). The AYSO states that is has obtained a guarantee from Spalding that its manufacturers do not engage in violation of children's rights, and that no child labor is used in the manufacturing of any of its products. Prior to this year, the official ball of the AYSO was SCORE, which is now placing no child labor labels on some of its balls.  E. Codes of Conduct in the Soccer Ball Industry In addition to the increase in child labor labels in the soccer ball industry, voluntary codes of conduct prohibiting child labor are also becoming more common. Such codes have been adopted by soccer organizations, sporting goods manufacturers, importers and retailers of soccer balls. This section first describes codes adopted by national and international organizations. The section then discusses the implementation of codes of conduct by individual U. S. importers and retailers of soccer balls, based on responses to a U. S. Department of Labor survey, other information gathered during the research for this report, and field visits by U. S. Department of Labor officials. 1.  Partners' Agreement to Eliminate Child Labor in the Soccer Ball Industry in Pakistan On February 14, 1997, in Atlanta, Georgia, representatives of the Sialkot Cham-ber of Commerce and Industry (SCCI),  114  the International Labor Organization (ILO) and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) signed the Partners' Agreement toEliminate Child Labour in the Soccer Industry in Pakistan.  115  The goals of the Partners' Agreement are the elimination of child labor in soccer ball production and the eventual elimination of child labor in other industries in the Sialkot area. This will beaccomplished through the creation of new opportunities for children with an emphasis on education and training. The Partners' Agreement has two basic programelements: a prevention and monitoring program and a social protection program. A Coordinating Committee comprised of the Partners and NGOs will administer theproject.  116  Both segments of the Partnership Agreement are due to begin in late 1997. Companies endorsing the agreement ""agree to source balls made in Pakistanexclusively from manufacturers who indicate their commitment to act responsibly toensure that children are not utilized to make soccer balls by participating in the voluntary industry program.""  117  In all, 55 soccer ball companies have endorsed the Partners' Agreement.  118 a. Prevention and Monitoring Program The prevention and monitoring program will set up a registry and internaland external monitoring systems and replace home-based production with village-based stitching centers. The program will be managed by the ILO. The objective ofthe program is to have the factories and stitching units of at least 22 manufacturersand their subcontractors free of child labor within 18 months:  119     Internal monitoring:  In order to determine whether soccer ball manufacturers are complying with the Partners' Agreement, a registry of personnel and production sites will be established. This registry is the core of the internal monitoring system. Manufacturers participating in the program must provide the following information to the ILO by January 1, 1998. i) registration of the names and contact information of all subcontractors; ii) registration of the names, addresses and ages of all stitchers working for the subcontractors and identification of child workers under the age of 14 to be removed and placed in social protection programs; iii) a reasonable estimate of the annual target capacity of soccer balls to be produced by the manufacturer and a reasonable estimate of the number of stitchers to produce this amount; iv) registration of all stitching units no less than 25 percent of the annual target capacity; and v) registration of names and contact information of new subcontractors, and names, addresses and ages of new stitchers. The manufacturers are required to update the list of new subcontractors and stitchers every six months, and to have registered all the stitching units representing one-hundred percent of the annual target capacity by January 1999.     External monitoring:  The accuracy of the internal monitoring system will be checked by establishing an external monitoring system. The ILO will hire and train independent monitors to visit the stitching centers on an unannounced basis to verify the information provided by the internal monitoring system. The monitors will have free access to all stitching centers operated by manufacturers and subcontractors. Weekly and monthly monitoring reports will be made available to the   ILO; reports of violations of the Agreement will be given to the Coordinating Committee on a monthly basis or whenever requested.     b. Social Protection Program At the same time that a system is being put into place to phase children out of the soccer ball industry, a program will be established to provide the children with education and rehabilitation. The program includes a campaign to change community attitudes toward child labor in the soccer ball industry. Children and families identified by the internal monitoring program will receive non-formal education, counseling, health services, training in income generation for adults, provision of credit/savings facility for adults and pre-vocational training. Younger children will be mainstreamed to formal schools. A number of village education and action centers (VEA centers) will be set up to provide these services. The centers will be run by the Bunyad Literacy Community Council, a Pakistani NGO focusing on basic education, and the Pakistan Bait-ul-Mal, a social welfare agency set up by the Prime Minister'soffice. 2.  Sportsgoods Manufacturers and Exporters Association (India) As programs to eliminate child labor in the Pakistani soccer ball industrygained momentum and attention this year, representatives of the sporting goods industry in India also have begun deliberations about combating child labor. In April1997, members of the Indian Sportsgoods Manufacturers and Exporters Associationjoined representatives of NGOs, government, trade unions and international organizations in the First National Consultation on Child Labor in the Sports Goods Industry, organized by the Indian human rights group South Asian Coalition on Child Servitude (SACCS). The purpose of the meeting was to discuss the problem of child labor in the industry and create a plan of action for the elimination of child labor. Among the coalition's recommendations was to establish an ethical code of conductand an independent, professional and credible monitoring system to ensure the absence of child labor.  120  The Joint Committee on Child Labor in the Sporting Goods Industry was created, consisting of 8 industry representatives, 3 NGO representatives, the Sports Goods Export Promotion Council (a governmental body), the ILO and UNICEF. At the same time that the Joint Committee was being established by SACCS,members of the Sportsgoods Manufacturers and Exporters Association of India  121  held a special meeting to discuss child labor in May 1997. The meeting, attended by 25 of the largest soccer ball manufacturers and exporters in India, the ILO and the World Federation of Sporting Goods Industry,  122  was called in response to a May 1997 Christian Aid report on child labor in the Indian sporting goods industry and recent negative media coverage in the United Kingdom.  123 In a declaration prior to the May meeting, the Indian Sportsgoods Manufac-turers and Exporters Association stated its opposition to child labor. Similar to the industry leaders in Pakistan, the Indian association explained that there are no children producing soccer balls in the factories themselves,  124  but that subcontractors could be distributing work to village shops and homes where child labor is more likely to be found.  125  To deal with this problem, the Association adopted a self-monitoring system consisting of the following elements:    the industry will: (1) identify stitchers and prepare lists of their names, address, ages, sex, address of workplace, etc.; (2) identify children working in homes or in factories; and (3) cross check the lists of stitchers with the number of stitched balls, and/ or other goods exported annually from India;      the first monitoring of the lists will be conducted by the Sportsgoods Manufacturers and Exporters Association,   Jalandhar;     a second monitoring will be conducted by the Sports Good Export Promotion Council; and     the third monitoring will be done by an outside agency such as the Indian Labor Department or the   ILO.  126     At a June 1997 meeting, the chairman of the Sportsgoods Manufacturers and Exporters Association asked that all members fill out forms ""to identify child labour""  127   employed directly or indirectly in the production of soccer balls. While the Association deems the monitoring system as self-certifying, it acknowledges that some form of independent monitoring is necessary for the system to be credible.  128  Whether an Indian government agency is considered to be independent for purposes of monitoring is open to question. The Sportsgoods Manufacturers and Exporters Associationhas also encouraged members to work with the Punjabi state government, which will reportedly provide assistance if members are interested in setting up centralizedstitching centers in lieu of using individual subcontractors.  129 On September 13, 1997, the Sportsgoods Manufacturers and Exporters Association reported that 27 exporting companies have provided information on their stitchers. Eighteen of these companies have obtained lists of stitchers from their contractors.  130 3.  FIFA The International Federation of Football Associations (FIFA)  131  authorizes the use of its logo on soccer balls that meet international matchball standards. On September 3, 1996, FIFA announced an agreement with three international unions  132  on a Code of Labor Practice for all goods bearing its logo.  133   Use of the FIFA logo bya licensee would signify that production was carried out in compliance with ILO Conventions banning child labor and forced labor, ensuring non-discrimination in employment, guaranteeing the right of workers to form and join trade unions and to bargain collectively, and ensuring payment of a minimum wage.  134  These commitments would be binding not only on the licensees, but also on each contractor and subcontractor in the production and distribution of FIFA- licensed products.  135  The FIFA Code of Labour Practice has not been embraced by soccer ball manufacturers or importers. In the year since the Code of Labor Practice was announced, FIFA has endorsed the Partners' Agreement but has not issued any information on the implementation of the FIFA code.  136 4.  Survey Results In addition to endorsing the Partners' Agreement, some U. S. importers of soccer balls have issued their own codes of conduct that prohibit the use of child labor. Some retailers have also adopted similar codes of conduct. In order to gather information on the extent and implementation of codes of conduct and labeling programs regarding child labor in the soccer ball industry, the U. S. Department of Labor conducted a voluntary survey of 7 importers and 3 retailersof soccer balls.  137  ( See Box IV- 1 for a list of the companies surveyed and Appendix B for the Company Questionnaire). Nine companies responded to the survey: Adidas, Baden Sports, Brine, Kmart, Nike, Pentland (Mitre), Reebok, Umbro, and Wal-Mart. The respondents indicated they import soccer balls either directly from foreign manufacturers in China, Indonesia or Pakistan, or through a U. S.- based purchasing agent.    Six of the seven importers source their soccer balls directly from a foreign manufacturer; one firm   (Pentland) also sources its balls through a purchasing agent. The seventh, Adidas, currently imports its soccer balls through a licensee, Molten, U. S. A. None of the seven importers own foreign manufacturing facilities. However, Reebok and Nike have invested in special facilities being built by their Pakistani producers in order to meet their child labor-free production policies.     The two retailers responding to the survey use U. S. licensees or purchasing agents to obtain soccer balls. Kmart, for example, purchases soccer balls from Seneca Sports, Franklin Sports, Molten U. S. A., and Spalding Sports ( see Section D. 4. b. above).     Seven of the companies responding to the survey indicated they have a written corporate policy prohibiting child labor. The written policies take the form of a code of conduct, vendor agreement, purchase order, or statement of principles.In cases where the company purchases and/or sells numerous products, the code applies to all the products, not just soccer balls. Copies of the policies are reproduced in Appendix C.    All seven importers (Adidas, Baden Sports, Brine, Nike, Pentland (Mitre), Reebok and Umbro) have endorsed the Partners' Agreement in addition to their individual corporate policies against child labor.    Brine stated that it has no written policy prohibiting child labor, although it is a member of the Partners' Agreement and has always made it clear to suppliers that child labor is unacceptable. However, this policy is not included in their purchase orders or vendor agreements.     Adidas' licensing agreement requires its licensees and manufacturers to comply with all applicable laws, including those prohibiting child labor. Manufacturers are also required to ensure that subcontractors comply with these standards. Failure to comply may be a basis for terminating the agreement.     Although Baden has no written code of conduct prohibiting child labor, they  require their factory representatives to verify that no children are engaged in making their products.     Nike's code of conduct prohibits the use of child labor. Child labor is defined as a person under the age of 15, unless national law states that the minimum age for work is fourteen  or  the age at which compulsory schooling has ended, whichever is greater.     TABLE IV-2 Type of Policy Prohibiting Child Labor (Based on Responses to Department of Labor Questionnaire)     * Company participates in the Partners' Agreement to Eliminate Child Labour in the Soccer Ball industry in Pakistan a  Company has its own labeling program b  Company has a formal code of conduct, statement of principals or compliance certificate c  Company has a purchase order, letter of credit, or buying agent agreement, which contains a specific prohibition on child labor in overseas production.        Pentland's letter of credit requires suppliers to certify that items were not mined, produced, manufactured, assembled or packed by the use of child labor as defined by national law.     Kmart's Workplace Code of Conduct is applicable to all suppliers and the suppliers' subcontractors in the United States and abroad. Kmart's code requires suppliers and their contractors to comply with local child labor laws and regulations. Children under the local legal age should not be employed by the supplier.     Reebok's code of conduct states that it will not work with business partners that use child labor. Reebok defines child labor as work performed by a person under 14, or younger than the age for compulsory schooling, whichever is higher.     Umbro requires its suppliers to sign a pledge every year certifying that they are observing national child labor laws.     Wal-Mart's Standards for Vendor Partners declares that Wal- Mart will not tolerate the use of child labor in the manufacture of products it sells. The standard applies to vendor partners as well as to their contractors, subcontractors or any other entity with whom they have a relationship for the manufacture of products sold by Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart defines child labor as work by a person younger than 15 (or 14 if so designated by national law) or younger than the age for completing compulsory education if that age is higher than 15.     Only three respondents  all importers  indicated that they communicatetheir no child labor policy directly to consumers. The remaining importers and retailers report either that they have no method to inform consumers that no childlabor is used in the foreign production of soccer balls, or that their suppliers label the balls.    Reebok and Baden have adopted labels to inform consumers that their soccer balls are made without child labor ( see Section D above). Reebok's code of conduct is reproduced on its internet website.     Nike said that consumers can learn about their no child labor policy on its internet website or by calling a toll- free number set up by the Soccer Industry Council of America that lists the names of companies participating in the Partner's Agreement.     Kmart noted that their four suppliers (Seneca Sports, Franklin Sports, Molten U. S. A., and Spalding Sports) have submitted letters indicating that they would label the balls child labor- free. Three of the four suppliers (Seneca Sports, Franklin Sports, and Spalding Sports) are now selling labeled balls to Kmart ( see Section D. 4. b. above for a more detailed discussion).     Brine noted that they do not have a separate mechanism for informing consumers that a soccer ball is not made by children, as their brand name alone should stand for not using child labor. Brine raised the concern that creating a special ""not made with child labor"" designation will lead to exploitation of the situation, and that smaller manufacturers that are financially unable to mount a large no child labor public relations campaign are bound to suffer even if they do have a no child labor commitment.     The companies surveyed indicated that they utilize a variety of means to monitor that their codes of conduct or policies on child labor are respected by their suppliers. Details of Reebok, Baden, and Kmart's monitoring procedures are found in Section D above. Table IV- 3 illustrates the type of monitoring the respondents employ. Seven of the nine respondents (Adidas, Baden, Brine, Kmart, Nike, Reebokand Wal- Mart) stated that they use contractual monitoring, i. e., they require their suppliers, through contractual agreements, to certify that their soccer balls are not made by children. The two retailers (Kmart and Wal- Mart) use only contractual monitoring to ensure their policy is being properly implemented. Seven of the nine respondents (Adidas, Baden, Brine, Nike, Pentland, Reebok and Umbro) send company staff, buyer agents or other parties to inspect facilities to verify that suppliers are actually implementing their code of conduct. Nike andReebok indicated that, in addition to contractual and internal monitoring, they use external accounting, auditing, testing or consulting firms, and/ or NGOs to monitor labor practices. In response to the Department's survey, some respondents submit-ted letters from the local Pakistani Labor Department certifying that a factory manufacturing soccer balls is free of child labor. Adidas, Brine, Nike, Pentland, Reebok and Umbro explained that they relyon the system established by the Partners' Agreement to monitor their child labor policy  in addition to any monitoring they might conduct on their own. Companies that support the Partners' Agreement pledge only to do business with Pakistani manufacturers who participate in the Agreement and consent to internal and external monitoring. As indicated above, however, the internal and external monitoring programs established by the Agreement have not yet been fully implemented.  TABLE IV-3 Monitoring Strategies for Compliance with International Child Labor Policies (Based on Responses to Department of Labor Questionnaire)     a  Company relies on guarantees made by suppliers through contractual documents or certificates that they are adhering to the company's policies. b  Company uses site visits and inspections by company staff, buyer agents, or other parties to verify that suppliers are actually implementing the codes of conduct. c  Company uses external accounting, auditing, testing or consulting firms, NGOs, or international organizations to monitor labor practices.        Local and quality control personnel employed by Adidas regularly visit manufacturers facilities. Adidas submitted a letter from the Punjabi Directorate of Labour Welfare attesting that children have never been found in the factory of their supplier, Sublime Sports.     Kmart's code of conduct requires suppliers and their subcontractors to allow full access to their facilities at all times for inspections by Kmart representatives or independent firms retained by Kmart. Kmart states that it has never found any child labor in the production of soccer balls.    138 It is not clear whether Kmart's monitoring system specifically applies to the soccer balls sold in their stores. However, in February 1997, Kmart received letters from four soccer ball suppliers assuring the retailer that the balls were not made by children. The suppliers' letters informed Kmart that each company is participating in the Partners' Agreement.     Nike imports soccer balls from SAGA Sports in Sialkot. Nike and SAGA  determined jointly that the best way to eliminate child labor was to create village stitching centers where it would be easier to monitor the ages of the   stitchers. By mid-1997, three stitching centers were operating with two additional centers scheduled to be completed by September 1997.    139  One of the centers is exclusively for women. Nike states that it monitors its code of conduct in Pakistan through its own internal procedures, and by using a Pakistani affiliate of Grant Thornton as an external monitor.     Pentland's soccer ball product managers visit their production facilities about three times a year to monitor compliance with their child labor policy. Pentland noted, however, that it is difficult to monitor for child labor since children are seldom found in the factories, but stitch soccer balls in homes and small workshops in the rural areas.   Over the next two years, Pentland plans to implement a China- specific monitoring plan in response to their concern about the use of child labor in China's soccer ball industry. The policy will have three components: 1) better factory control of home working situations; 2) documenting the age of young factory workers; and 3) protecting older working children (14, 15, 16 and 17 year olds) by restricting overtime and identifying areas of potential hazard where they should not be working.   Umbro personnel make spot- checks at suppliers' factories in 4- 8 week cycles. Umbro stated that although they conduct spot checks on ""external stitching facilities,"" they can never be completely certain that no child labor is being used.    F. Conclusion There has been significant public attention focused on the use of child laborin the soccer ball industry.  140  Most reports describe Pakistani children sitting forhours a day in small workshops stitching soccer balls. Other more recent reportsdescribe a similar situation in India's soccer ball industry. Soccer balls are also madein China and Indonesia, but the Department is not aware of any child labor allegations in the soccer ball industries of these countries. One company surveyed for this report, however, plans to implement an internal monitoring system in China due to concerns of child labor. Children stitch soccer balls in small workshops or homes, many times inremote rural areas. It is rare for a child to be found working in a large soccer ball factory. In Pakistan and India, child labor laws prohibit children from working in factories, but not in the type of subcontracting or homework arrangements common to the soccer ball industry. Some of the children work full-time. Others work during non-school hours. Many work for up to nine or ten hours a day. The international soccer ball industry has responded to the child labor accusations by creating codes of conduct and monitoring systems. In February 1997,Pakistani manufacturers signed an agreement (Partners'Agreement) with the ILO andUNICEF to phase children out of the industry, to provide education and other services to them, and to participate in internal and external monitoring programs. Over 50 U. S. and Pakistani companies pledged to support the agreement. By the time this report was written, the Partners' Agreement was not yet fully operational. In India,the industry is moving toward an agreement to stop the use of child labor. Discussions are underway between representatives of the industry, ILO, UNICEF, NGOs,trade unions and government to determine how best to accomplish this goal. Some individual companies are responding to public pressure by placingchild labor-free labels on their balls. The Department of Labor has identified eight companies that are using such labels. Reebok and Baden are both changing their production processes and implementing monitoring systems to support the use ofthe label. Reebok has hired independent human rights monitors to verify that no children stitch Reebok balls. Dunkin' Donuts sold promotional soccer balls duringthe 1997 summer months bearing a child labor-free label. Dunkin's Donuts asked a U.S.-based NGO to monitor the production of these balls and certify that they were not made by children. The other companies are making their no child labor claimsbased upon their participation in the Partners' Agreement. It is premature, however,to make such a claim because the monitoring components of the Partners' Agreement have not yet been fully implemented. Other companies are changing their production processes to prevent the use of child labor. For instance, Reebok has centralized all soccer production in one factory. Nike has created stitching centers in order to better monitor where production takes place. Baden has changed from Pakistani to Chinese suppliers and mecha-nized the stitching process. Although some individual companies have developed labels for their soccer balls, the majority of the soccer ball industry has opted instead to implement a variety of different codes of conduct to prohibit and prevent child labor. All companies responding to a Department of Labor survey on codes of conduct and labeling programs indicated that they have some type of corporate policy prohibiting child labor. Not all these policies are in writing, and very few are enforced through a rigorous monitoring system.    This report was produced by the staff of the International Child Labor Program and is published by the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of International Labor Affairs.

Introduction The soccer ball industry of Pakistan, principally concentrated in the city of Sialkot, has been under scrutiny in recent years for employing child workers. Manyreports describe children stitching soccer balls in small rural workshops or in homes.  1  The widespread coverage of children stitching soccer balls galvanized consumers,labor and religious groups and government officials to call for a stop to this practice.In June 1996, the U. S. Secretary of Labor and members of Congress helped launch the  FoulBall  campaign to ensure that soccer balls used by American children arestitched by adults and not children.  2 The public attention led U. S. importers to enter into an agreement with Paki-stani manufacturers, the ILO and UNICEF to stop using child labor.  3  More recently, public attention has focused on the use of child labor in India's soccer ball industry, leading to negotiations between Indian soccer ball manufacturers, exporters, NGOsand international organizations to develop a code of conduct prohibiting child labor. In addition, individual companies have taken steps to assure consumers thattheir products are not made by children. They have done so by revising their production process or creating child labor labels. For instance, Reebok has centralized all its soccer ball production in a new factory.  4  Nike also changed its manufacturing process in Pakistan by creating new stitching centers in order to better ensure chil-dren are not stitching Nike soccer balls.  5  Some U. S. importers, including Reebok and Baden Sports, have begun to label their soccer balls as produced without child labor. These labeling programs are the primary focus of this chapter. Information about labeling programs has been obtained from the companies using labels, from surveys of U. S. importers and retailers, and from field visits to India, Pakistan and China by Department of Labor officials. Section B of this chapter presents an overview of the industry and the market for soccer balls in the United States. Section C examines the role children play in the production of soccer balls around the world. Section D describes various labelingprograms. Finally, Section E reports responses of U. S.- based soccer ball importers and retailers to the child labor issue, based on a voluntary survey.  B. Industry Profile Soccer, or ""football"" as it is known in most countries, is the world's mostpopular sport.  6  Although soccer gained popularity slowly in the United States, enthusiasm for the sport has grown in recent years.  7  In 1980, there were fewer than 1 million youths registered to play soccer; by 1996 this figure had tripled to over 3 million.  8 Growth in the volume of U. S. imports of soccer balls reflects this trend. AsTable IV- 1 illustrates, in 1989, U. S. soccer ball imports were valued at $15.7 million;by 1996, the comparable figure was $34.2 million, a growth of 118 percent.  9  FigureIV- 1 lists U. S. imports of soccer balls by country and value. Some 71 percent ofthose imports came from Pakistan, 19 percent from China, 5 percent from Indonesia,1 percent from India, and the remaining 4 percent from other countries.  10  Soccerballs are not produced in the United States.  11 Soccer balls generally consist of a number of synthetic leather panels stitchedtogether in geometric patterns on the outside with an inflatable bladder inside.  12   Panels in high quality balls are hand- stitched for durability.  13  Hand- stitching these panels together is a very labor- intensive process and is where children have been found working. Figure IV- 2 illustrates the chain of production within the international soccerball industry. This schematic also highlights relationships among the various entitiesresponsible for production. The key actors can be described as follows:  14     Retailers typically sell a wide range of sporting goods, including soccer balls. They are not normally direct soccer balls importers; instead, they order the balls from brand name merchandisers. Retail outlets selling soccer balls include nationwide sporting goods or soccer specialty stores, independent sporting goods stores, department stores, mass-merchandisers, and toy stores.   Importers/ Design and Marketing Firms/ Merchandisers develop ball specifications and marketing strategies to promote their particular brand. They do not own the factories producing the balls, but contract with foreign manufacturers who produce the made-to-order balls. Some merchandisers have their own retail outlets for the sale of soccer balls and other products.   Contractors are foreign manufacturers who produce soccer balls for U. S. importers/ design and marketing firms/ merchandisers. They may produce soccer balls for several different buyers. Contractors usually do some of the production in their factories (e. g., cutting and packing), and outsource stitching and other tasks to subcontractors.

As of 1996, Korea no longer produced soccer balls for the U.S. market.   Source: Official Statistics of the U.S. Department of Commerce          Subcontractors are individuals who function as middlemen between the  contractor and village   stitchers.  15  Subcontractors typically deliver soccer ball kits to workers in surrounding villages. After the stitching is completed, the subcontractor pays the stitchers and returns the completed kits to the contractor.   Stitchers sew together the panels of a soccer ball and glue in the inflatable bladder. They are employed by subcontractors, typically on a piece rate basis, and may work in a stitching center, small village workshop, or in homes.      C. Child Labor in the Soccer Ball Industry The use of child labor in the production of soccer balls has been documentedprimarily in Pakistan and India.  16  Soccer balls are also made in China and Indonesia, but there are no known allegations of child labor in the soccer ball industries of these countries. The manufacture of soccer balls is controlled from the city but decentralized to homes and small workshops in surrounding villages. At the city factories or warehouses, the designs are printed and the pieces are cut. These are then packed into sacks and handed over to middlemen or subcontractors who distribute them in villages to families and workshops, where stitching traditionally is done both by adults and children. Subcontractors provide soccer ball kits to village workshops and/or households, where workers hand-stitch individual pieces together, glue the bladder to the material, and sew in the final piece. Some of the larger subcontractors in Pakistan have up to 300 stitchers working for them.  17  In some instances, there may be two or more tiers of subcontractors, with the balls passing through many hands on the way from the stitcher to the manufacturer. Once completed, the stitched soccer balls are then brought back by the middlemen to the factories for packing andshipment.  Pakistan Nearly all soccer balls are made in and around Sialkot, Pakistan  a regionfamous as a soccer ball producing hub for at least 80 years.  18  Seventy-five percent of the world's soccer balls were produced in Sialkot in 1996.  19  It is estimated that there are about 10,000 urban workers and 30,000 rural workers in the 1,450 surrounding villages of Sialkot involved in the production of soccer balls.  20 As recently as 1995, Pakistani soccer ball manufacturers denied that children were stitching soccer balls. The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan noted that when they visited Sialkot in 1995, manufacturers seemed to have instructed their contractors not to talk about child labor, and taken the contractors to task, ""not so much for employing child labor as for letting it become visible.""  21  At the time, theCommission reported that they found many children working in the soccer ball industry, despite the local industry's best efforts to conceal the children from view.  22 In 1996, an ILO study in the Sialkot region estimated that more than 7,000 Pakistani children between the ages of 5 and 14 stitched balls on a regular, full- time basis.  23  In addition, large numbers of children worked part-time outside of school hours. The great majority of these children were boys. More than 90 percent of the children stitching soccer balls are between theages of 10 and 14.  24  Most work in small shops or at home.  25  Seventy percent of the children work 8 to 9 hours a day; others work 10 to 11 hours per day.  26  It is estimated that 19 percent of the boys and 36 percent of the girls have never attended school.  27  Twenty-two percent of the boys and 25 percent of the girls attend school and work.  28  Although most of the child workers can read and write, many havedropped out of school because of uninteresting curricula, unsympathetic teachers and an uncomfortable school environment.  29 A recent study conducted for the Soccer Industry Council of America (SICA)found that stitchers make between 20 to 30 Pakistani rupees, or approximately $0.50 to $0.75, per ball.  30  On average, children are paid 20 to 22 Pakistani rupees per ball, or about $0.50 to $0.55. Payment tends to vary according to ball quality.  31  Most high quality balls are stitched by adults at stitching centers. The ILO reports that children are not likely to stitch high quality balls because they are not strong enough to make the required stitches. The wages for high quality balls are almost double than thosefor lower quality balls.  32  Depending upon skill and experience, a person is reportedly able to stitch between 1 and 5 balls a day.  33 There have been allegations of debt servitude in the soccer ball industry in Pakistan,  34  charges denied by Pakistani manufacturers  35  and a recent Save the Children-UK report.  36  However, the study commissioned by the Soccer Industry Council of America (SICA), the Save the Children report and a study conducted jointly by the ILO and the Punjab Department of Labor acknowledge that many families in thesoccer ball industry take loans or advances from subcontractors.  37  The advances are generally repaid through a deduction in the amount paid to the stitchers.  38  Most reports, however, are careful to note that intergenerational debt-bondage is not prevalent in the soccer ball industry. India India's sporting goods industry has its roots in Sialkot, Pakistan. When India was partitioned at independence in 1947, many of Sialkot's skilled Hindi craftsmen migrated across the border into the Punjab, settling in Jalandhar, where the Indian sporting goods industry is now based.  39  The Indian sporting goods industry has expanded to include the areas of Meerut, Uttar Pradesh, and Gurgaon, Haryana. Most of India's sporting goods, including soccer balls, are exported to the United Kingdom. Allegations of child labor in India's soccer ball industry have appeared since 1994.  40  Although these allegations were initially repudiated by some members of the Indian Sports Goods Export Promotion Council, recent public statements by members of the industry are more qualified, denying that child labor is used inmembers' factories, but acknowledging that the practice may occur through the process of contracting out to homeworkers.  41  About 300,000 persons work in the sporting goods industry producing over 200 different products.  42  It is estimated that about 10 percent of this work force, or 25,000 to 30,000 workers, are children.  43 Soccer ball production in India is similar to that in Pakistan: middlemen distribute soccer ball kits provided by large factories to small workshops and homes in surrounding villages, where soccer balls are stitched and returned. A 1997 study by Christian Aid, a British NGO, found children as young as seven stitching soccerballs in their homes.  44  The report described children working in small workshops orat home in urban slum areas and remote villages.  45  They work for many hours stitching the soccer balls while sitting in a hunched, squatting position. Some of thechildren go to school as well as work.  46  The report quotes the director of a Jalandhar soccer ball company as saying, ""the football industry uses children at the age of 10or 12. The quantity of footballs exported is too much to employ all the people we need in factories. Women and children do it in their houses whenever they get freetime.""  47 As in Pakistan, stitchers are paid per completed ball. One major exporter stated that stitchers average 13 to 14 Indian rupees per ball ($ 0.37 - $0.39) for the low quality soccer balls, and between 20 and 22 Indian rupees per ball ($ 0.56-$0.62cents) for the most commonly produced medium quality balls. Some Indian children reportedly earn as little as 7 Indian rupees per ball, or about $0.20.  48   D. Consumer Labeling Programs in the Soccer Ball Industry 1.  Introduction Adverse publicity in the United States and Europe about children stitchingsoccer balls prompted some importers to adopt labels informing consumers that their products have been produced in a child labor-free environment. In some cases, these programs are accompanied by changes in production processes to prevent theemployment of children. Although some individual companies have developed labels for their soccer balls, the majority of the soccer ball industry has opted instead to implement avariety of different codes of conduct to prohibit and prevent child labor. At a November 1996 meeting of the World Federation of the Sporting Goods Industry (WFSGI), companies rejected the possibility of labeling products, concluding that ""our ownindustrial brand names were statements of quality and ethics in their own rights and any disclaimer put on a separate label would only weaken that statement and the perception of the brand.""  49  They emphasized that by labeling only some balls, unlabeled balls might unfairly be thought to be made by children.  50  On the other hand, the President of the WFSGI commented that over time, it might be conceivable that products would carry a stamp indicating membership in WFSGI. Since the WFSGI isan endorser of the Pakistan Partners' Agreement, such a stamp would imply that aball made in Pakistan fulfilled the no child labor requirements of this agreement.  51  In making this proposal, the President noted that for such a stamp to be credible, it must be backed up by a strong and transparent monitoring system in addition to an enforcement mechanism capable of denying the use of the stamp or expelling members found violating the agreement.  52 Notwithstanding the WFSGI policy, recent evidence shows that child labor labeling is becoming more common in the soccer ball industry. For example, both Reebok and Baden Sports recently began selling soccer balls with a label stating that the balls are not made by children. The Reebok balls are made in Pakistan, while the Baden balls are made in China. The retail chain Dunkin' Donuts sold promotional soccer balls with a no child labor label during the 1997 summer months. Additionally, in response to a Department of Labor survey, the Kmart Corporation provided letters from their suppliers indicating that their balls are, or will be, labeled child labor-free. These labeling programs are described in the next few pages.  2.  Reebok a. Program Overview Reebok International Ltd. (Reebok) is a leading designer, marketer and worldwide distributor of sports, fitness and casual footwear, apparel, and sporting equipment. Total sales for 1996 were approximately $3.5 billion.  53  Reebok, a publicly held corporation, issued a code of conduct known as the Reebok Human Rights Production Standards in 1992. Among other things, the code of conduct bars the use of child labor in making Reebok products.  Recognizing the high incidence of child workers in the Pakistani soccer ball industry, in June 1996 Reebok officials said they were planning to buy Pakistani-made soccer balls that they ""knew with certainty"" were not made with child labor.  54  Reebok contracted with Moltex Sporting Goods (Pvt.) Ltd., a Pakistani soccer and rugby ball manufacturer, and Reed and Associates, a French company specializing inresearch and development, sourcing and manufacturing of high quality soccer and rugby balls, to build a soccer ball manufacturing plant. The new facility, located in Sialkot, has been making Reebok balls since March 1997. Soccer balls produced for Reebok by Moltex bear the following label on one of the panels: "" Guarantee: Manufactured without child labor. "" According to company officials, the use of the label allows Reebok to communicate their policy to consumers and stakeholders interested in ending exploitative child labor. Reebok's decision to label soccer balls was based on two factors: (1) increasing concern by consumers about children stitching soccer balls;  55  and (2) Reebok's desire to distinguish itself from other brands by centralizing stitching and all other production processes in a single factory and requiring rigorous external monitoring of the facility. Reebok officials state they will be able to place their label on Reebok balls ""with absolute confidence. Our consumers will know that Reebok balls are, without any doubt, child labor-free.""  56 b. Program Structure The three major elements of Reebok's program include:  57     containment of all production inside a new facility in which all work on Reebok balls is performed, including stitching. All workers must be age 15 or older;   external monitoring to ensure that: a) children are not entering the workplace, and b) soccer ball panels are not leaving the factory where the risk exists that they may be stitched by children in stitching centers or in homes; and   support of education and/ or vocational education training for children in the  soccer ball manufacturing region or Pakistan.     Reebok officials acknowledge that there are additional costs associated with creating a new facility that will house all production processes. According to Peter Moore, Senior Vice President of the Global Soccer/ Rugby Division, this shift in manufacturing processes will cost Reebok approximately 15 percent more.  58  Reebok saysthese additional costs  associated with pensions, health insurance and transportation for workers at the new factory  will be absorbed by the company; the salesprice of Reebok soccer balls will remain the same.  59 c. Program Implementation According to Reebok, the Sialkot facility began making soccer balls in March1997. Reebok hired three independent monitors to check the effectiveness of the program. Two of the monitors are associated with human rights organizations,  60  and the third is a Lahore-based affiliate of a major U. S. accounting firm.  61  The two human rights monitors were asked to monitor the factory, interview workers, maintain ties to the local community, and visit surrounding villages to be sure no Reebok panels are stitched outside the factory. Each monitor has the right to inspect the facility on an announced or unannounced basis.  62  The third monitor was hired to audit factory records in order to correlate the number of balls produced with the number of stitchers in the factory.  63  Reebok intends to make monitoring reports publicly available upon request.  64 Reebok says the auditing firm conducted a test audit in March 1997.  65  A representative of the auditing firm acknowledged they visited the plant and recommended that a number of accounting measures be implemented so that the firm could begin auditing records by August 1997.  66  Reebok notes that because other soccer balls are also being made by Moltex, the auditing process is very difficult.Reebok plans to reassess the value of engaging the outside auditing firm in addition to the human rights monitors.  67 Reebok issued the human rights monitors' first report on August 14, 1997, summarizing their findings from March through July 1997.  68  During the first five months of the project, the monitors visited the Moltex facility nine times to determine if children were present; three of the visits were unannounced. As of June 4, the monitors had found 236 workers in the factory, including 176 stitchers; 179 artisans working on a contract basis were also present. No children were found at the Moltex facility. During an April 29 visit, the human rights monitors observed balls being made at Moltex for another major buyer.  69  The factory management said these balls were being sent out of the factory for stitching, but were not Reebok balls. In August, Reebok stated it had given Moltex a large enough order to fill up the company's manufacturing capacity, and non-Reebok balls would be out of the factory by September 30.  70 The monitors recommended that a plan be devised to clearly assure them that Reebok balls were not being stitched outside the factory. In May, Reebok authorized the human rights monitors to hire a guard to stand at the factory gate tomake sure no Reebok ball panels are commingled with panels for other buyers as they leave the factory to be stitched elsewhere. The guard, who reports directly to the human rights monitors, was hired in June. He has been instructed to make sure that no Reebok panels leave the factory, and that no completed Reebok balls are coming in from the villages or outside stitching centers where children might bepresent. As of the end of July, the monitors informed Reebok that the guard has not observed any problems with Reebok balls entering or leaving the factory. Reebok has commented on the monitors' report, stating that a number of health and safety concerns in the factory had been communicated to Moltex.  71  In response, large posters with Reebok's human rights production standards translated into Urdu are being sent to Pakistan. Finally, Reebok acknowledges that a number of record keeping procedures are not yet complete, such as establishing personnel records with historical data and creating worker identification cards. In addition to its new ball factory and monitoring project, Reebok is planning an educational project.  72  The company has a three-year plan to improve educational opportunities for children in villages in the Sialkot area, specifically targeting displaced child workers. Reebok is working with the Society for Advancement of Education in Sialkot to implement the plan.  3.  Baden Sports a. Program Overview Baden Sports, Inc. is a family- owned athletic ball manufacturer. Founded eighteen years ago, Baden sells baseballs, basketballs, broom balls, footballs, soccer balls,volleyballs and water polo balls. Baden now imports soccer balls directly from one manufacturer in China. Baden recently shifted suppliers from Pakistan to China due to ""complications facing the industry in solving this [the child labor] problem,""  73  and because they ""never found the manufacturers in Pakistan to be reliable or trustworthy, and our experience is that you cannot inspect with confidence or expect that the Pakistani companies will adhere to any monitoring programs.""  74  Recent consumer inquiries, combined with market research indicating great consumer interest in the elimination ofchild labor, are Baden's primary reasons for changing its supplier and production practices. Baden claims that by switching suppliers to China, it has ensured elimination of child labor in its production of soccer balls: ""With our newly automated manufacturing process for patent-pending stitched balls, we can now guarantee, and certifyon the ball itself, that no child or slave labor has been used in the production of oursoccer balls.""  75  A Baden representative also stated that the shift to China coincided with a corporate decision to produce machine-sewn balls.  76 Soccer balls imported by Baden bear the label: ""Certified: No Child or Slave Labor Used on this Ball."" Baden also intends to produce packaging and advertisements stating that no child labor is used in the production of their soccer balls. Baden began marketing soccer balls bearing the child labor-free label in 1997.  77  In a press release announcing the availability of the product, Baden CEO E. C.Schindler stated ""it is our goal to ensure that soccer is played by children, not made by children. We are so sure of the integrity and quality of our products, we certify it.""  78 b. Program Structure Baden soccer balls are stitched in China using sewing machines, leaving only the last patch to be hand-stitched after the ball is turned right side out and the bladder inserted.  79  This process is done entirely at a factory run by Kuan Ho Sporting Goods Company Ltd., a manufacturing facility located in Dongguan, Guangdong Province, China.  80  Baden believes that through machine stitching it can obtain better quality and greater production volume using fewer workers. Baden claims that it can produce soccer balls 50 percent faster using sewing machines than stitching the balls by hand.  81 Kuan Ho's manager explained the plant's recruitment policy to visiting Department of Labor officials. Under China's labor laws, no one under 16 years of age is permitted to work. About 400 of the 2,400 workers at the factory produce soccer balls.  82  According to Kuan Ho's manager, most of the workers are female, earning about 60 to 70 percent above the local minimum wage of 500 yuan ($ 60) a month, or up to 900 yuan ($ 108).  83  The work force is made up almost entirely of migrants from other provinces within China; according to the Kuan Ho manager, they have a stable workforce due to fairly liberal benefits, which include vacations and the possibility of returning home once a year.  84 Baden requires written certification from the manufacturer that child labor is not used in the manufacture of Baden products. According to Baden's Asia representative, the company also requires Kuan Ho to allow access to personnel records. c. Program Implementation Baden management states that the company's factory representative monitors the Kuan Ho facility weekly. The factory representative explained that he visits the plant to check for quality, design and child labor but did not indicate the frequency of his visits.  85  A form verifying the absence of child labor in the production of soccer balls is to be filled out during each visit and signed by Baden's factory representative and an officer of Kuan Ho.  86 Baden management states that, in addition to the procedures noted above, it requires its representatives to verify the no child labor statements and representations made by Kuan Ho officials. The factory representative told U. S. Department of Labor officials that during his factory visits, he accepts the word of the plant manager that they are not employing child labor.  87  In addition, Baden management stated that a representative from Baden's headquarters occasionally accompanies the factory representative on site visits to verify company policies are being carried out correctly. The Department of Labor team received a copy of Baden's inspection report of Kuan Ho that certifies no child labor (i.e., no workers under sixteen) was being used in the production of soccer balls.  88  The copy of the inspection report itself had been prepared but not yet signed by the Baden representative or the Kuan Homanager.  89 Baden has no set policy to deal with the discovery of a child worker.  90  KuanHo's plant manager was aware of Baden's child labor concerns even though Baden does not have a written corporate policy on human rights or a special training program that covers this topic.  91  Workers at Kuan Ho were not aware of the purpose of Baden's labeling program.  92  The firm's management believes that workers do not need to know about such a program, although human resource managers  who are responsible for the hiring  do.  93 Baden states that the price of its soccer balls will likely increase slightly as a result of the new manufacturing and monitoring process.  4.  Other Child Labor Consumer Labels More and more soccer ball companies are promoting child labor labels particularly since the February 14, 1997 signing of the Partners' Agreement to Eliminate Child Labor in the Soccer Ball Industry in Pakistan ( see Section E. 1). The Department of Labor has received information on seven such labels. All the labelspromise that the soccer balls are not made by children. Only one of the labeling programs, sponsored by Dunkin' Donuts, has a monitoring and certification component. Four of these labels are associated with brand-name soccer balls that are soldin retail outlets. The other two labels are produced both for retail outlets and youth soccer leagues/clubs in the United States. a. Dunkin' Donuts Promotion The spread of child labor-free labels for soccer ballsis illustrated by a soccer ball promotion conducted by Dunkin'Donuts franchise outlets in New England during the 1997summer season.  94  With any purchase, a customer could buy for $9.99 a hand-stitched soccer ball bearing three logos: the Dunkin' Donuts logo; that of the New England Revolution, the region's professional soccer team; and the statement ""Produced Without Child Labor."" Posters with a photo of Alexi Lalas, one of the star players of the New England Revolution, were placed in participating Dunkin' Donut stores; many of the posters stated ""Ball Produced Without Child Labor"" in their right bottom corner.  95  The promotion was originally intended to run during the months of June and July but was extended until all the balls in stock are sold. The idea to put child labor-free labels on the promotional soccer balls came from Dunkin' Donuts New England franchisees, who expressed concern about child labor being used in the production of soccer balls made in Pakistan.  96  In response, letters from the U. S. Sporting Goods Manufacturers Association (SGMA) and Talon Sports  97  (the Pakistani manufacturer) were sent to Dunkin' Donuts stating that the balls would not be made by children. A committee of Dunkin' Donuts franchisees was uncomfortable relying solely on the promises of the manufacturer and the trade association. They agreed to approve the campaign only if the balls were certified ""child labor-free"" by an independent organization. As a result of the franchisees' concern about the credibility of a ""no child labor"" guarantee, Dunkin' Donuts, working through a sports marketing consultant in charge of the campaign (Sports Team), requested that a Washington, DC- based NGO the International Labor Rights Fund (ILRF)  serve as an independent monitor. Consequently, ILRF designed a monitoring program to ensure that soccer balls produced by Talon in Pakistan for Dunkin' Donuts were child labor-free. A six- month agreement between Sports Team and ILRF granted ILRF monitors total access to all Talon facilities, including its factories and stitching centers. Talon provided the ILRF with a map of the 43 stitching centers, a list of the names of all workers, and all of its records. Talon also consented to unannounced visits by the monitors, granting them access to all facilities and the ability to talk to workers without the presence ofsupervisory personnel.  98  ILRF monitors reported that they did not find any instances of illegal child labor. At the end of the summer, Dunkin' Donuts representatives were to evaluatethe soccer ball promotion program and determine whether to launch a spring campaign and whether it should be expanded beyond New England.  99 b. Individual Company Labels Another example of new labels informing consumers that a soccer ball ismade without child labor is that of individual companies promising that their balls are made only by adults. In response to the Department of Labor's voluntary survey, the Kmart Corporation provided the Department with letters from Seneca Sports,Inc., Franklin Sports, Inc., Molten U. S. A. and Spalding Sports Worldwide stating thatthey have or are planning to have a labeling program for soccer balls sold in Kmart stores. All four of the companies have endorsed the Partners' Agreement to Eliminate Child Labour in the Soccer Ball Industry in Pakistan and seem to base some of their no child labor assurances solely on this agreement. The following is some brief information about the claims made by each company to Kmart.      In its letter to Kmart dated February 18, 1997, Seneca Sports,  Inc. certified that its manufacturing facility in Pakistan ""prohibits inhumane conditions, violations of human rights and the use of child labor."" The letter further states that ""our packaging will certify that no child labor was used in the manufacturing of Seneca Soccer Balls.""    100  The package containing the Seneca ball states, ""Seneca® balls are certified as free from child labor."" The box also states ""Seneca Sports® Certified."" A Seneca official informed the Department of Labor that in the past year it has been asking its Pakistani supplier, Awan Sports, for assurances that soccer balls produced for Seneca are child labor- free. The Seneca representative further stated that Awan Sports has consolidated all its soccer ball production into one facility, preventing the outsourcing of stitching operations, and thereby minimizing the chance of child labor. Both Seneca and Awan Sports endorse the Partners' Agreement.    101     Franklin Sports, Inc. informed Kmart on February 18, 1997 that  it is a member of the Partners' Agreement, noting that a monitoring system had been implemented to ensure compliance with the Agreement.    102  In addition, Franklin stated it will independently assure that: 1) factories manufacturing Franklin soccer balls will be monitored by an independent contractor on a quarterly basis, with reports available for review by Kmart management; 2) factories will use only factory managed labor in the production of soccer balls, eliminating any possibility that child labor could be used in a cottage industry environment; and 3) Franklin will include a visible mark/logo on packaging and/ or product stating clearly that no child labor has been used in the production of the product, no later than July 1, 1997.    103       The president of Franklin Sports explained that placing a child  labor-free label on the balls ""is a visible way to tell people that we are in compliance with the Partners' Agreement. Also, retailers want assurances that our balls were not made by children.""  104 In a follow-up interview with the Department of Labor, Franklin confirmed that effective July 1, 1997, a label reading ""Manufactured Without Child Labor"" is being printed on balls made in Pakistan and exported to the United States. Franklin believes that stitching centers are being set up to centralize production and better manage who stitches the soccer balls. Franklin notes that they are relying solely on the Partners'Agreement to monitor production. Franklin requires all its Pakistani manufacturers to be members of the Partners' Agreement.  105      Molten U. S. A., in a letter to Kmart dated February 21, 1997, stated that ""we can now guarantee that no child labor will be used in any phase of the production of soccer balls supplied to Kmart Corporation."" The letter further states that Molten U. S. A. ""will begin to include a sticker on the cosmetic package referencing the child labor issue as soon as the stickers are produced. This should be no later than March 15."" A representative of Molten explained that its soccer balls are made in Pakistan, India and China, although the labels described in their letter to Kmart refer only to balls made in Pakistan. The representative stated that both Molten and their Pakistani supplier, Sublime Sports, are members of the Partners' Agreement. As of mid-August, however, Molten had not put ""no child labor"" labels on its Pakistani-made soccer balls. The company maintains that it is in the process of investigating the issue of child labor in Pakistan, and wants to ensure that any child labor- free guarantee made by Molten is absolutely credible.    106     Spalding Sports Worldwide stated in a February 21, 1997 letter to Kmart that all Spalding soccer ball manufacturers comply with the industry criteria and Spalding's Worldwide Labor Policy. The letter further states that Spalding is a member of the Partners' Agreement. Finally, the letter states that Spalding has added the following logo to all its soccer packages: ""No Child Labor Used to Produce This Product."" A representative of Spalding explained that Spalding sources 75 percent of its soccer balls from Pakistan; the remaining balls are made in China, but are molded and not hand- stitched. Spalding's two Pakistani manufacturers, Recto Sports    107  and Taj Mahal, are members of the Partners' Agreement. Spalding requires its manufacturers to certify Spalding balls have been produced without the use of child labor. Additionally, Spalding says that its quality control personnel visit the Pakistani facilities frequently and ensure that no child labor is used.    108       c. Child Labor Labeled Soccer Balls Provided to Youth Soccer Leagues In addition to the five companies listed above, other companies selling ballsdirectly to youth soccer leagues are making no child labor"" claims. While there maybe a number of companies supplying labeled balls to youth soccer leagues, the following two have come to the attention of the Department of Labor.      The Department of Labor obtained a soccer ball used at ""The  1997 Virginian Tournament,"" held in Springfield, Virginia, which carries the label ""No Child Labor Involved: Adult Sewn Product."" According to the information printed on the ball, it was made in Pakistan and imported by American Challenge, a U. S. importer of soccer balls. American Challenge officials informed the Department of Labor that its Challenge soccer balls are manufactured exclusively by JSD Sports (Pvt.) Ltd. in   Sialkot, Pakistan.  109  American Challenge has provided the Department of Labor with a letter from the Assistant Director of Labour Welfare, Government of the Punjab, stating that the mentioned manufacturer ""is abiding by all the by-laws in relation with employment of 'child labor' and there is no worker in the factory below the age of fifteen years. It is further certified that all workers/employees are free to leave the job and no bonded labour is involved in the manufacturing of products of the said concern.""    110  American Challenge stated that the company has been producing soccer balls with a ""no child labor"" label since January 1997. The soccer balls are sold to various dealers and individuals.    111     The American Soccer Company supplies soccer balls to ADULT  youth soccer leagues, soccer clubs, and stores under thebrand name SCORE. In the past year, the American Soccer Company began to distribute SCORE soccer balls with a PRODUCT label stating, ""Adult Sewn Product."" A SCORE representative said that placing the labels on the balls coincided with the signing of the Partners' Agreement, of which they are a member. SCORE requires that its Pakistani manufacturers be members of the Partners' Agreement as well. One of SCORE's suppliers in Pakistan is Talon Sports. Talon has provided letters to SCORE assuring that they do not use child labor in the production of their soccer balls. SCORE hopes to send company representatives to Pakistan at the end of the year to visit Talon and verify the no child labor assurances are accurate.    112     The two major organizations that sponsor and regulate youth soccer leagues in the United States, the United States Youth Soccer Association, Inc. (USYSA), andthe American Youth Soccer Organization (AYSO), have both publicly condemned the use of child labor in the manufacturing of soccer balls.  113  The official equipmentsupplier of the USYSA, the larger of the two groups, is Adidas, which does not place labels on its balls. The official ball of the AYSO is Spalding, which is placing child labor-free labels on AYSO sanctioned balls (see above). The AYSO states that is has obtained a guarantee from Spalding that its manufacturers do not engage in violation of children's rights, and that no child labor is used in the manufacturing of any of its products. Prior to this year, the official ball of the AYSO was SCORE, which is now placing no child labor labels on some of its balls.  E. Codes of Conduct in the Soccer Ball Industry In addition to the increase in child labor labels in the soccer ball industry, voluntary codes of conduct prohibiting child labor are also becoming more common. Such codes have been adopted by soccer organizations, sporting goods manufacturers, importers and retailers of soccer balls. This section first describes codes adopted by national and international organizations. The section then discusses the implementation of codes of conduct by individual U. S. importers and retailers of soccer balls, based on responses to a U. S. Department of Labor survey, other information gathered during the research for this report, and field visits by U. S. Department of Labor officials. 1.  Partners' Agreement to Eliminate Child Labor in the Soccer Ball Industry in Pakistan On February 14, 1997, in Atlanta, Georgia, representatives of the Sialkot Cham-ber of Commerce and Industry (SCCI),  114  the International Labor Organization (ILO) and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) signed the Partners' Agreement toEliminate Child Labour in the Soccer Industry in Pakistan.  115  The goals of the Partners' Agreement are the elimination of child labor in soccer ball production and the eventual elimination of child labor in other industries in the Sialkot area. This will beaccomplished through the creation of new opportunities for children with an emphasis on education and training. The Partners' Agreement has two basic programelements: a prevention and monitoring program and a social protection program. A Coordinating Committee comprised of the Partners and NGOs will administer theproject.  116  Both segments of the Partnership Agreement are due to begin in late 1997. Companies endorsing the agreement ""agree to source balls made in Pakistanexclusively from manufacturers who indicate their commitment to act responsibly toensure that children are not utilized to make soccer balls by participating in the voluntary industry program.""  117  In all, 55 soccer ball companies have endorsed the Partners' Agreement.  118 a. Prevention and Monitoring Program The prevention and monitoring program will set up a registry and internaland external monitoring systems and replace home-based production with village-based stitching centers. The program will be managed by the ILO. The objective ofthe program is to have the factories and stitching units of at least 22 manufacturersand their subcontractors free of child labor within 18 months:  119     Internal monitoring:  In order to determine whether soccer ball manufacturers are complying with the Partners' Agreement, a registry of personnel and production sites will be established. This registry is the core of the internal monitoring system. Manufacturers participating in the program must provide the following information to the ILO by January 1, 1998. i) registration of the names and contact information of all subcontractors; ii) registration of the names, addresses and ages of all stitchers working for the subcontractors and identification of child workers under the age of 14 to be removed and placed in social protection programs; iii) a reasonable estimate of the annual target capacity of soccer balls to be produced by the manufacturer and a reasonable estimate of the number of stitchers to produce this amount; iv) registration of all stitching units no less than 25 percent of the annual target capacity; and v) registration of names and contact information of new subcontractors, and names, addresses and ages of new stitchers. The manufacturers are required to update the list of new subcontractors and stitchers every six months, and to have registered all the stitching units representing one-hundred percent of the annual target capacity by January 1999.     External monitoring:  The accuracy of the internal monitoring system will be checked by establishing an external monitoring system. The ILO will hire and train independent monitors to visit the stitching centers on an unannounced basis to verify the information provided by the internal monitoring system. The monitors will have free access to all stitching centers operated by manufacturers and subcontractors. Weekly and monthly monitoring reports will be made available to the   ILO; reports of violations of the Agreement will be given to the Coordinating Committee on a monthly basis or whenever requested.     b. Social Protection Program At the same time that a system is being put into place to phase children out of the soccer ball industry, a program will be established to provide the children with education and rehabilitation. The program includes a campaign to change community attitudes toward child labor in the soccer ball industry. Children and families identified by the internal monitoring program will receive non-formal education, counseling, health services, training in income generation for adults, provision of credit/savings facility for adults and pre-vocational training. Younger children will be mainstreamed to formal schools. A number of village education and action centers (VEA centers) will be set up to provide these services. The centers will be run by the Bunyad Literacy Community Council, a Pakistani NGO focusing on basic education, and the Pakistan Bait-ul-Mal, a social welfare agency set up by the Prime Minister'soffice. 2.  Sportsgoods Manufacturers and Exporters Association (India) As programs to eliminate child labor in the Pakistani soccer ball industrygained momentum and attention this year, representatives of the sporting goods industry in India also have begun deliberations about combating child labor. In April1997, members of the Indian Sportsgoods Manufacturers and Exporters Associationjoined representatives of NGOs, government, trade unions and international organizations in the First National Consultation on Child Labor in the Sports Goods Industry, organized by the Indian human rights group South Asian Coalition on Child Servitude (SACCS). The purpose of the meeting was to discuss the problem of child labor in the industry and create a plan of action for the elimination of child labor. Among the coalition's recommendations was to establish an ethical code of conductand an independent, professional and credible monitoring system to ensure the absence of child labor.  120  The Joint Committee on Child Labor in the Sporting Goods Industry was created, consisting of 8 industry representatives, 3 NGO representatives, the Sports Goods Export Promotion Council (a governmental body), the ILO and UNICEF. At the same time that the Joint Committee was being established by SACCS,members of the Sportsgoods Manufacturers and Exporters Association of India  121  held a special meeting to discuss child labor in May 1997. The meeting, attended by 25 of the largest soccer ball manufacturers and exporters in India, the ILO and the World Federation of Sporting Goods Industry,  122  was called in response to a May 1997 Christian Aid report on child labor in the Indian sporting goods industry and recent negative media coverage in the United Kingdom.  123 In a declaration prior to the May meeting, the Indian Sportsgoods Manufac-turers and Exporters Association stated its opposition to child labor. Similar to the industry leaders in Pakistan, the Indian association explained that there are no children producing soccer balls in the factories themselves,  124  but that subcontractors could be distributing work to village shops and homes where child labor is more likely to be found.  125  To deal with this problem, the Association adopted a self-monitoring system consisting of the following elements:    the industry will: (1) identify stitchers and prepare lists of their names, address, ages, sex, address of workplace, etc.; (2) identify children working in homes or in factories; and (3) cross check the lists of stitchers with the number of stitched balls, and/ or other goods exported annually from India;      the first monitoring of the lists will be conducted by the Sportsgoods Manufacturers and Exporters Association,   Jalandhar;     a second monitoring will be conducted by the Sports Good Export Promotion Council; and     the third monitoring will be done by an outside agency such as the Indian Labor Department or the   ILO.  126     At a June 1997 meeting, the chairman of the Sportsgoods Manufacturers and Exporters Association asked that all members fill out forms ""to identify child labour""  127   employed directly or indirectly in the production of soccer balls. While the Association deems the monitoring system as self-certifying, it acknowledges that some form of independent monitoring is necessary for the system to be credible.  128  Whether an Indian government agency is considered to be independent for purposes of monitoring is open to question. The Sportsgoods Manufacturers and Exporters Associationhas also encouraged members to work with the Punjabi state government, which will reportedly provide assistance if members are interested in setting up centralizedstitching centers in lieu of using individual subcontractors.  129 On September 13, 1997, the Sportsgoods Manufacturers and Exporters Association reported that 27 exporting companies have provided information on their stitchers. Eighteen of these companies have obtained lists of stitchers from their contractors.  130 3.  FIFA The International Federation of Football Associations (FIFA)  131  authorizes the use of its logo on soccer balls that meet international matchball standards. On September 3, 1996, FIFA announced an agreement with three international unions  132  on a Code of Labor Practice for all goods bearing its logo.  133   Use of the FIFA logo bya licensee would signify that production was carried out in compliance with ILO Conventions banning child labor and forced labor, ensuring non-discrimination in employment, guaranteeing the right of workers to form and join trade unions and to bargain collectively, and ensuring payment of a minimum wage.  134  These commitments would be binding not only on the licensees, but also on each contractor and subcontractor in the production and distribution of FIFA- licensed products.  135  The FIFA Code of Labour Practice has not been embraced by soccer ball manufacturers or importers. In the year since the Code of Labor Practice was announced, FIFA has endorsed the Partners' Agreement but has not issued any information on the implementation of the FIFA code.  136 4.  Survey Results In addition to endorsing the Partners' Agreement, some U. S. importers of soccer balls have issued their own codes of conduct that prohibit the use of child labor. Some retailers have also adopted similar codes of conduct. In order to gather information on the extent and implementation of codes of conduct and labeling programs regarding child labor in the soccer ball industry, the U. S. Department of Labor conducted a voluntary survey of 7 importers and 3 retailersof soccer balls.  137  ( See Box IV- 1 for a list of the companies surveyed and Appendix B for the Company Questionnaire). Nine companies responded to the survey: Adidas, Baden Sports, Brine, Kmart, Nike, Pentland (Mitre), Reebok, Umbro, and Wal-Mart. The respondents indicated they import soccer balls either directly from foreign manufacturers in China, Indonesia or Pakistan, or through a U. S.- based purchasing agent.    Six of the seven importers source their soccer balls directly from a foreign manufacturer; one firm   (Pentland) also sources its balls through a purchasing agent. The seventh, Adidas, currently imports its soccer balls through a licensee, Molten, U. S. A. None of the seven importers own foreign manufacturing facilities. However, Reebok and Nike have invested in special facilities being built by their Pakistani producers in order to meet their child labor-free production policies.     The two retailers responding to the survey use U. S. licensees or purchasing agents to obtain soccer balls. Kmart, for example, purchases soccer balls from Seneca Sports, Franklin Sports, Molten U. S. A., and Spalding Sports ( see Section D. 4. b. above).     Seven of the companies responding to the survey indicated they have a written corporate policy prohibiting child labor. The written policies take the form of a code of conduct, vendor agreement, purchase order, or statement of principles.In cases where the company purchases and/or sells numerous products, the code applies to all the products, not just soccer balls. Copies of the policies are reproduced in Appendix C.    All seven importers (Adidas, Baden Sports, Brine, Nike, Pentland (Mitre), Reebok and Umbro) have endorsed the Partners' Agreement in addition to their individual corporate policies against child labor.    Brine stated that it has no written policy prohibiting child labor, although it is a member of the Partners' Agreement and has always made it clear to suppliers that child labor is unacceptable. However, this policy is not included in their purchase orders or vendor agreements.     Adidas' licensing agreement requires its licensees and manufacturers to comply with all applicable laws, including those prohibiting child labor. Manufacturers are also required to ensure that subcontractors comply with these standards. Failure to comply may be a basis for terminating the agreement.     Although Baden has no written code of conduct prohibiting child labor, they  require their factory representatives to verify that no children are engaged in making their products.     Nike's code of conduct prohibits the use of child labor. Child labor is defined as a person under the age of 15, unless national law states that the minimum age for work is fourteen  or  the age at which compulsory schooling has ended, whichever is greater.     TABLE IV-2 Type of Policy Prohibiting Child Labor (Based on Responses to Department of Labor Questionnaire)     * Company participates in the Partners' Agreement to Eliminate Child Labour in the Soccer Ball industry in Pakistan a  Company has its own labeling program b  Company has a formal code of conduct, statement of principals or compliance certificate c  Company has a purchase order, letter of credit, or buying agent agreement, which contains a specific prohibition on child labor in overseas production.        Pentland's letter of credit requires suppliers to certify that items were not mined, produced, manufactured, assembled or packed by the use of child labor as defined by national law.     Kmart's Workplace Code of Conduct is applicable to all suppliers and the suppliers' subcontractors in the United States and abroad. Kmart's code requires suppliers and their contractors to comply with local child labor laws and regulations. Children under the local legal age should not be employed by the supplier.     Reebok's code of conduct states that it will not work with business partners that use child labor. Reebok defines child labor as work performed by a person under 14, or younger than the age for compulsory schooling, whichever is higher.     Umbro requires its suppliers to sign a pledge every year certifying that they are observing national child labor laws.     Wal-Mart's Standards for Vendor Partners declares that Wal- Mart will not tolerate the use of child labor in the manufacture of products it sells. The standard applies to vendor partners as well as to their contractors, subcontractors or any other entity with whom they have a relationship for the manufacture of products sold by Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart defines child labor as work by a person younger than 15 (or 14 if so designated by national law) or younger than the age for completing compulsory education if that age is higher than 15.     Only three respondents  all importers  indicated that they communicatetheir no child labor policy directly to consumers. The remaining importers and retailers report either that they have no method to inform consumers that no childlabor is used in the foreign production of soccer balls, or that their suppliers label the balls.    Reebok and Baden have adopted labels to inform consumers that their soccer balls are made without child labor ( see Section D above). Reebok's code of conduct is reproduced on its internet website.     Nike said that consumers can learn about their no child labor policy on its internet website or by calling a toll- free number set up by the Soccer Industry Council of America that lists the names of companies participating in the Partner's Agreement.     Kmart noted that their four suppliers (Seneca Sports, Franklin Sports, Molten U. S. A., and Spalding Sports) have submitted letters indicating that they would label the balls child labor- free. Three of the four suppliers (Seneca Sports, Franklin Sports, and Spalding Sports) are now selling labeled balls to Kmart ( see Section D. 4. b. above for a more detailed discussion).     Brine noted that they do not have a separate mechanism for informing consumers that a soccer ball is not made by children, as their brand name alone should stand for not using child labor. Brine raised the concern that creating a special ""not made with child labor"" designation will lead to exploitation of the situation, and that smaller manufacturers that are financially unable to mount a large no child labor public relations campaign are bound to suffer even if they do have a no child labor commitment.     The companies surveyed indicated that they utilize a variety of means to monitor that their codes of conduct or policies on child labor are respected by their suppliers. Details of Reebok, Baden, and Kmart's monitoring procedures are found in Section D above. Table IV- 3 illustrates the type of monitoring the respondents employ. Seven of the nine respondents (Adidas, Baden, Brine, Kmart, Nike, Reebokand Wal- Mart) stated that they use contractual monitoring, i. e., they require their suppliers, through contractual agreements, to certify that their soccer balls are not made by children. The two retailers (Kmart and Wal- Mart) use only contractual monitoring to ensure their policy is being properly implemented. Seven of the nine respondents (Adidas, Baden, Brine, Nike, Pentland, Reebok and Umbro) send company staff, buyer agents or other parties to inspect facilities to verify that suppliers are actually implementing their code of conduct. Nike andReebok indicated that, in addition to contractual and internal monitoring, they use external accounting, auditing, testing or consulting firms, and/ or NGOs to monitor labor practices. In response to the Department's survey, some respondents submit-ted letters from the local Pakistani Labor Department certifying that a factory manufacturing soccer balls is free of child labor. Adidas, Brine, Nike, Pentland, Reebok and Umbro explained that they relyon the system established by the Partners' Agreement to monitor their child labor policy  in addition to any monitoring they might conduct on their own. Companies that support the Partners' Agreement pledge only to do business with Pakistani manufacturers who participate in the Agreement and consent to internal and external monitoring. As indicated above, however, the internal and external monitoring programs established by the Agreement have not yet been fully implemented.  TABLE IV-3 Monitoring Strategies for Compliance with International Child Labor Policies (Based on Responses to Department of Labor Questionnaire)     a  Company relies on guarantees made by suppliers through contractual documents or certificates that they are adhering to the company's policies. b  Company uses site visits and inspections by company staff, buyer agents, or other parties to verify that suppliers are actually implementing the codes of conduct. c  Company uses external accounting, auditing, testing or consulting firms, NGOs, or international organizations to monitor labor practices.        Local and quality control personnel employed by Adidas regularly visit manufacturers facilities. Adidas submitted a letter from the Punjabi Directorate of Labour Welfare attesting that children have never been found in the factory of their supplier, Sublime Sports.     Kmart's code of conduct requires suppliers and their subcontractors to allow full access to their facilities at all times for inspections by Kmart representatives or independent firms retained by Kmart. Kmart states that it has never found any child labor in the production of soccer balls.    138 It is not clear whether Kmart's monitoring system specifically applies to the soccer balls sold in their stores. However, in February 1997, Kmart received letters from four soccer ball suppliers assuring the retailer that the balls were not made by children. The suppliers' letters informed Kmart that each company is participating in the Partners' Agreement.     Nike imports soccer balls from SAGA Sports in Sialkot. Nike and SAGA  determined jointly that the best way to eliminate child labor was to create village stitching centers where it would be easier to monitor the ages of the   stitchers. By mid-1997, three stitching centers were operating with two additional centers scheduled to be completed by September 1997.    139  One of the centers is exclusively for women. Nike states that it monitors its code of conduct in Pakistan through its own internal procedures, and by using a Pakistani affiliate of Grant Thornton as an external monitor.     Pentland's soccer ball product managers visit their production facilities about three times a year to monitor compliance with their child labor policy. Pentland noted, however, that it is difficult to monitor for child labor since children are seldom found in the factories, but stitch soccer balls in homes and small workshops in the rural areas.   Over the next two years, Pentland plans to implement a China- specific monitoring plan in response to their concern about the use of child labor in China's soccer ball industry. The policy will have three components: 1) better factory control of home working situations; 2) documenting the age of young factory workers; and 3) protecting older working children (14, 15, 16 and 17 year olds) by restricting overtime and identifying areas of potential hazard where they should not be working.   Umbro personnel make spot- checks at suppliers' factories in 4- 8 week cycles. Umbro stated that although they conduct spot checks on ""external stitching facilities,"" they can never be completely certain that no child labor is being used.    F. Conclusion There has been significant public attention focused on the use of child laborin the soccer ball industry.  140  Most reports describe Pakistani children sitting forhours a day in small workshops stitching soccer balls. Other more recent reportsdescribe a similar situation in India's soccer ball industry. Soccer balls are also madein China and Indonesia, but the Department is not aware of any child labor allegations in the soccer ball industries of these countries. One company surveyed for this report, however, plans to implement an internal monitoring system in China due to concerns of child labor. Children stitch soccer balls in small workshops or homes, many times inremote rural areas. It is rare for a child to be found working in a large soccer ball factory. In Pakistan and India, child labor laws prohibit children from working in factories, but not in the type of subcontracting or homework arrangements common to the soccer ball industry. Some of the children work full-time. Others work during non-school hours. Many work for up to nine or ten hours a day. The international soccer ball industry has responded to the child labor accusations by creating codes of conduct and monitoring systems. In February 1997,Pakistani manufacturers signed an agreement (Partners'Agreement) with the ILO andUNICEF to phase children out of the industry, to provide education and other services to them, and to participate in internal and external monitoring programs. Over 50 U. S. and Pakistani companies pledged to support the agreement. By the time this report was written, the Partners' Agreement was not yet fully operational. In India,the industry is moving toward an agreement to stop the use of child labor. Discussions are underway between representatives of the industry, ILO, UNICEF, NGOs,trade unions and government to determine how best to accomplish this goal. Some individual companies are responding to public pressure by placingchild labor-free labels on their balls. The Department of Labor has identified eight companies that are using such labels. Reebok and Baden are both changing their production processes and implementing monitoring systems to support the use ofthe label. Reebok has hired independent human rights monitors to verify that no children stitch Reebok balls. Dunkin' Donuts sold promotional soccer balls duringthe 1997 summer months bearing a child labor-free label. Dunkin's Donuts asked a U.S.-based NGO to monitor the production of these balls and certify that they were not made by children. The other companies are making their no child labor claimsbased upon their participation in the Partners' Agreement. It is premature, however,to make such a claim because the monitoring components of the Partners' Agreement have not yet been fully implemented. Other companies are changing their production processes to prevent the use of child labor. For instance, Reebok has centralized all soccer production in one factory. Nike has created stitching centers in order to better monitor where production takes place. Baden has changed from Pakistani to Chinese suppliers and mecha-nized the stitching process. Although some individual companies have developed labels for their soccer balls, the majority of the soccer ball industry has opted instead to implement a variety of different codes of conduct to prohibit and prevent child labor. All companies responding to a Department of Labor survey on codes of conduct and labeling programs indicated that they have some type of corporate policy prohibiting child labor. Not all these policies are in writing, and very few are enforced through a rigorous monitoring system.

The new web site is maintained by the Department's Office of   Labor-Management Standards (OLMS). Individuals may now view, via the Web, union   annual financial reports and conduct data searches, displaying the results in a   number of preformatted listings, free of charge.       The Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959, as amended   (LMRDA), and the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA) require certain union   reports to be filed with the U.S. Department of Labor. All information and data   obtained from reports filed under the reporting provisions of the LMRDA or CSRA   are public information.              Until today the public was able to examine union financial and   informational reports and related documents, including union constitutions and   bylaws, free of charge (and purchase copies for a nominal fee), only at the   OLMS public disclosure room in Washington, D.C., or at the OLMS field offices   for reporting organizations and individuals within each office’s   geographic jurisdiction.       The new OLMS web site now provides interested individuals and   organizations with a choice. Individuals can view and print copies of actual   union annual financial reports (for year 2000 and later) in pdf format. These   reports are searchable by a variety of criteria, including union name, file   number, affiliation, designation name and number, and location.      The OLMS web site also features a powerful union data search system.   Step-by-step instructions guide users through selecting the unions to be   included in the search, the time period covered by the search, which data will   appear on the resulting listings, and how the data will be sorted. Users may   also conduct searches on union officers and employees, either by union or by   the name of the officer or employee. Enabling users to define the scope of   searches and to determine how the results are presented results in customized   listings tailored to users’ specific needs.      Users may also order copies of union information reports; union annual   financial reports (regardless of the year filed); and union   constitutions/bylaws from the Internet Public Disclosure Room for a nominal   fee. The Office of Labor-Management Standards (OLMS) is part of Department's   Employment Standards Administration.        # # #       _________________________________________________________________        U.S. Labor Department news releases are accessible on the Internet at    www.dol.gov .

The Department’s Employment Standards Administration   will introduce a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to revise the LM-2, the   reporting form required for large unions under the Labor-Management Reporting   and Disclosure Act of 1959. The LM-2 form has not undergone significant change   since it was first promulgated more than 40 years ago.      The proposed LM-2 form will give union members more detailed information   about the financial activities of their unions, in an easily understood format   that will be available on the Department’s website. The new forms will be   usefully organized according to the services and functions of the union,   enabling members to identify major receipts and disbursements for these various   activities. For the first time, union members will be able to examine financial   transactions of “joint trusts” and subsidiaries managed by their   unions, which currently have little or no accountability to rank-and-file   members.      Enhanced disclosure will help union members better exercise their   self-governance rights and detect financial mismanagement and misconduct by   union officials. U.S. Labor Department investigations of union financial fraud   result in an average of 11 criminal convictions a month, with a total of more   than 640 convictions during the past five years.      Only the largest and most financially sophisticated unions—about   20%—will be materially affected by these proposed transparency reforms.   The Department expects the burden of compliance to be substantially reduced by   new reporting software it is developing for unions to use, free of charge, in   preparing and filing their reports.      “Despite the increasing complexity and activity of labor unions   over the years, the form used to disclose their financial information to   members has remained virtually unchanged in the last 40 years,” said   Victoria Lipnic, Assistant Secretary for the Employment Standards   Administration. “These reforms will give union members better, more   understandable information for them to judge the financial health and integrity   of their unions.”      The LM-2 form was created under the Labor-Management Reporting   Disclosure Act, passed by Democrats and Republicans in 1959.      As part of the proposed rulemaking, comments are invited for 60 days   after publication in the Federal Register.

Story Continued      Vital Voices Global Partnership, through its Income   Generation and Skills Training for Afghan Women program, seeks to provide jobs   for women by training and employing women to produce school uniforms for girls   in Afghanistan. By the end of the project, Vital Voices expects to employ over   550 women to produce 75,000 school uniforms.       The program addresses the fact that many Afghan women do   not have the skills necessary to generate income for themselves and their   families, and those that do have the skills have few or no job opportunities.   Afghan girls have been denied schooling for years. As they return to school,   they need school uniforms, which their families cannot afford to provide. The   former Afghan Minister for Women's Affairs, Dr. Sima Samar, asked Vital Voices   Global Partnership (VVGP) for help in getting uniforms, shoes and socks for   Afghan schoolgirls.       The target audience is widows and returning Afghan   refugees, including women of all ethnicities and women with disabilities (women   with disabilities who are homebound will be able to sew at home). Only women   who are unemployed will be eligible to participate in the training.       Their partner is the Ministry for Women Affairs, who helps   Vital Voices supervise coordination with the Afghan government, set-up training   and employment sites, and select women to work in the program. Vital Voices   then trains the seamstresses, cutters, quality control personnel, and sewing   supervisors before distributing and monitoring wages and material (fabric,   sewing machines, thread, etc.).

Innovation on the Ground: New Approaches to Union Organizing    In addition to discussing strategies for renewing the labor movement across its various tiers, the Symposium also sought to highlight the innovation and experimentation occurring around organizing—not only in craft-based and traditionally union-dense sectors but also in the service sector and industries in which organizing has been difficult or even nonexistent.   From Decline to Expansion: Increasing Union Capacity in the Building Trades    According to Jeff Grabelsky, a researcher at Cornell University and a member of the IBEW for over 20 years, the transformation occurring in union representation within the building trades is not being driven by an intrinsic desire on the part of union leadership and membership to change. Instead, it is being prompted by new demands in the industry: the introduction of new technology, which has deskilled construction; the emergence of the construction manager and the decline of the general contractor; the intervention of corporate construction users in the collective bargaining process; and the emergence of regional and national contractors that have forced unions to restructure according to the new shape of the industry.   However, the most significant shift in the sector has been the decline in the union share of workers and the rise of open-shop alternatives, which in Grabelsky’s estimation have had the most dramatic impact on how the labor movement in the building trades has shifted strategies to recover lost ground. “The rise of the open shop has occurred alongside of and contributed to dramatically expanding employment, declining union membership, falling union density, shrinking union market share, declining wages across the industry, and the erosion of union bargaining strength and political influence,” Grabelsky said.   How have unions in the building trades retooled their approach? The initial response was to directly challenge open shops by developing competitiveness strategies that included lowering the cost of union construction if it made union contractors more appealing, and to market union shops more effectively to construction users. Later, a more sophisticated job-targeting strategy emerged; the union would create a fund so that concessionary wages would be shared by an entire membership and not just the workers employed in the targeted projects. “In the end,” said Grabelsky, “these efforts were a way to avoid the real, fundamental challenge of organizing 4 or 5 million unrepresented workers who had been kept out of the unions. It was the only way for the building trades to reestablish themselves as a dominant force in the industry.”   To embrace and deploy a strategy built around organizing—particularly organizing workers who had been historically excluded from membership—was exceedingly difficult, given an entrenched philosophy among the membership of “keeping certain people out.” What the building trades ultimately developed was the COMET program, for “Construction Organizing Membership Education Training,” which was designed to reach out to rank-and-file members and explain why organizing was important. “That program, among other efforts,” said Grabelsky, “helped the membership understand the relationship between union density and bargaining strength, which really became the handle to mobilize membership support.”   The measure of success for the building trades focused organizing efforts supported by membership education is that it represents the only sector of the labor movement to experience an increase in union density for two consecutive years. Still, Grabelsky believes that further innovations are necessary in order to reorganize the industry. Specifically, he calls for multi-trade organizing that includes the 15 affiliates of the building trades, market-wide organizing that does not target individual contractors but all significant competitors in any market segment, and infusing organizing activity with greater strategic focus.   Building on Legacies and Linked Agendas: The Communications Workers of America   While deregulation has made the telecommunications industry one of the fastest-growing sectors of the economy, it has also led to rising income inequality and variations in workplace practices that have challenged the Communications Workers of America (CWA) to redefine their approach to representation. “The CWA is pursuing an aggressive and very innovative triangular strategy focusing not just on organizing but also on collective bargaining and politics,” said Harry Katz of Cornell University, who has been studying the renewed tactics of the CWA with his colleague Rose Batt. “What is even more innovative is their linking of activities across these dimensions: efforts in organizing are connected with and complimented by efforts in collective bargaining or political lobbying,” he explained.     For example, through collective bargaining, the CWA was able to win important card check and neutrality clauses that support their organizing agendas. Similarly, through political activity—whether represented by filings with the FCC at the federal level or informal lobbying around a political regulatory agenda—the CWA has been pushing issues that overlap directly with its collective bargaining and organizing agendas. “Essentially, they have developed a way to regain power in the face of disadvantages, counterbalancing the ability of companies in their industries to operate more easily during strikes, to ship resources abroad, or to outsource,” said Katz.   In part, the CWA’s current efforts have been successful because they are built squarely on institutional legacies. As Katz explained, “They don’t innovate in an area that is completely foreign, but extend things done in the past. For example, one of the CWA’s important strategies regarding organizing, what they call mobilization, builds on their historic representation of employees in the public sector who were unable to strike.”    Batt related several examples of how the CWA is both engaging in linked activity and building on a rich institutional legacy in order to address the technical and professional identity of its workforce and to organize the sector’s growing number of independent contractors, freelancers, and temporary workers:       Organizing Customer Service Professionals . In 1997, the CWA organized 10,000 USAirways service agents and is awaiting a rerun election for 15,000 service agents at American Airlines. “The union first developed a model of the customer service professional which links quality jobs to quality service, as well as builds on the historic sense of public service among the telephone operator membership,” said Batt. Creative internal organizing has constructed a strong network of customer service and sales representatives across the country. The network, in turn, was critical to winning the USAirways election, which relied heavily on member-to-member organizing by thousands of geographically dispersed CWA members.      Associational Unionism . WashTech, an association representing software professionals in the state of Washington, has affiliated with the CWA and protested attempts by software companies to exempt some temporary workers from receiving overtime, as well as Microsoft’s unequal treatment of “permatemps” who were ineligible to receive full-time employee benefits. CWA affiliation has provided resources, staffing, and technical support, and WashTech has pursued legal, political, and legislative remedies for contingent workers in the state. On May 13, 1999, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco found in favor of the plaintiffs in the Vizcaino v. Microsoft law suit, ruling that at least 10,000 former temporary workers since 1986 should have been able to participate in Microsoft’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan. “In this case,” said Batt, “the union could not rely on traditional collective bargaining tools, but on legal, political, and legislative efforts.”      Employment Centers and Hiring Halls . CWA has a long history of developing employment centers to match union workers or retirees with employers for short-term contracts, serving as a supplier of labor and negotiating work terms and conditions. The most promising effort to date is its current project with Cisco Systems, a nonunion company, in which the union is licensed as a “regional academy” to train and certify technicians on Cisco’s equipment. This joint effort builds on Cisco’s well-developed training program and the CWA’s ‘Military-to-Work’ program. It will use a jointly-developed online skills assessment for testing, training, and job placement. “The effort draws on the CWA’s historic root of embracing technological change and using the training of its technical workforce to find new ways of organizing,” said Batt.      Determining the Employer: The SEIU and Home Care Workers in California   After a ten-year struggle, an unprecedented 75,000 home care workers in Los Angeles voted to join the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) in early 1999. The win was big on many fronts—not since 1941 had such a large number of workers been unionized at once, and the campaign organized predominantly minority, immigrant, and low-wage women in the traditionally nonunionized social services sector. “The story is one of persistence, political strategy, and coalition building,” said Rachael Cobb of MIT’s Department of Political Science. “It was a struggle against a model of homecare in the state of California that blurred the lines of who was the employer of record.”    A strong disability movement in California had lobbied for the delivery of services that could be controlled by the client—including in-home personal attendants hired by the consumer—instead of services provided in institutional settings. In response, the state apportioned dollars for homecare services and devolved the administration of the program to counties, which established In-Home Supportive Service systems (IHSS) through its social service agencies. Rather than contracting with an agency to provide in-home services, IHHS placed the responsibility on the consumer to locate and hire a homecare worker. “Who was the employer?” asked Cobb. “The IHHS system received funding from a combination of state and federal funds. County social workers assessed the eligibility of consumers for homecare assistance. The state cut the homeworkers’ paychecks, while the consumer was the one who located, hired, and fired them.”   While public dollars were being expended to help homecare consumers remain independent and productive, L.A.’s homecare workers were making minimum wage and receiving no benefits, including health care and paid vacations. A group of organizers who had successfully unionized homecare workers in other parts of the country began exploring the potential for such a campaign in California—and quickly met a series of complications. Cobb explained the first challenge: actually reaching the workers. “Because there was no single place of employment, because the registry system did not function, because clients were responsible for finding and hiring workers, these homecare workers acted as independent contractors with no associations or systems to bring them together,” said Cobb.    The key obstacle, however, was that no agency would accept responsibility as the employer of record. The SEIU brought suits against the State of California and the County of Los Angeles—but to no avail. Finally, the SEIU turned to the state legislature, which passed a law in 1992 mandating that each county should establish a public authority to serve as the employer. Counties were given the option to contract with a nonprofit consortium, establish by ordinance a public authority separate from the county, or establish by ordinance a public authority governed by the board of supervisors.   In addition to pursuing a ground-breaking decision about the employer of record, the SEIU engaged in other innovative activities that stretched the traditional role of union organizers:       Lobbying the L.A. County Board of Supervisors . The SEIU needed to convince the Board that a centralized, public authority system under its governance was the best option for the County, since it would streamline a referral system, provide training, and maintain some level of quality control. The Board was opposed to the proposal, so the SEIU engaged in a lobbying campaign to change its position. “What organizers soon realized, however,” said Cobb, “was that it required the collective political clout of its members and the support of consumers to sway the Board’s opinion.”      Grassroots Political Organizing . “While it was organizing Los Angeles workers, the SEIU local had not bothered to ask whether the workers were registered to vote,” Cobb said. “It realized that grassroots political organizing was necessary to gain County support.” Organizers began mobilizing workers to engage in the political process, focusing on state-level and local elections.      Building Coalitions with Consumers . According to Cobb, the union also encountered the resistance of homecare consumers, who feared the union might impose limits on the type and amount of services they received. To combat consumer concerns—as well as the worry of homecare workers that becoming unionized would threaten their relationships with clients—the SEIU actively built a coalition with consumers, the disability movement, and the senior movement. It was able to educate this constituency about the benefits of unionization, including the provision of training, reduced turnover, and improved consumer-caregiver relationships.      From Associations to Collective Bargaining: The Committee of Interns and Residents   In 1997, the Committee of Interns and Residents (CIR), which represents 9,000 interns and residents in six states, affiliated with the SEIU; recently, it joined with other doctor unions to form the National Doctors’ Alliance, which bargains collectively for 15,000 doctors. “Obviously, doctors are not the first group of workers to come to mind when discussing unions,” said Sandra Shea of CIR, “but they represent a unique example of how organizing can evolve from professional associations to collective bargaining.”    Physician unions have grown in appeal, as doctors have felt increasingly powerless in the face of pressure from managed care and insurance companies. The organizing of interns and residents seems less unusual, when one considers the limited control they have over their work and working conditions. “Many of their concerns are basic, trade union issues,” said Shea, “like making a living wage to put food on the table and to pay back enormous student loans, dealing with unusually long working hours, and poor working conditions. They walk a fine line between the really hard work it takes to learn this profession and outright exploitation and misuse of their time and concern for humanity.”    Most unionized interns and residents are found in the public sector, where public labor boards tend to grant them the status of employee. In the private sector, which holds the majority of the nation’s interns and residents, a ruling by the NLRB 20 years ago has denied these young doctors that same status, labeling them as “students” instead. However, as part of a larger organizing strategy, CIR has recently engaged in an effort to overturn that decision by bringing a case against the Boston Medical Center. “If we can win on this decision,” Shea said, “it will open up our union to engage in collective bargaining for a significantly larger number of people.”   Meanwhile, the CIR has been kept busy handling physicians’ growing interest in unions. Shea explained: “The phone is ringing off the hook at the National Doctors’ Alliance in response to our post-residency physician organizing campaign. Many have an interest in unionizing because they’ve lost control of their professions. They’re angry with the American Medical Association for looking the other way.” In fact, the Association’s membership has been decreasing annually, while a contentious internal debate rages regarding whether or not it should establish a collective bargaining arm, similar to that of the American Nursing Association. Regardless of the umbrella under which physicians organize, this previously untapped segment of the labor market may prove to infuse new energy into the American labor movement. There are approximately 600,000 post-residency doctors across the country, and the estimate is that almost 40 percent already fall into what would be considered an “employee” category and could potentially unionize.

GX012-93-16422025	"[ v30 p1229 ]    30:1229(136)RO   The decision of the Authority follows:                30 FLRA NO. 136   30 FLRA 1229    29 JAN 1988   UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF LABOR, PENSION AND WELFARE BENEFITS ADMINISTRATION                      Activity        and  NATIONAL UNION OF COMPLIANCE OFFICERS, INDEPENDENT                       Labor Organization/Petitioner  Case No. 3-RO-70003  DECISION AND ORDER       I. Statement of the Case       This matter is before the Authority as a result of our order granting the application for review of the Regional Director's Decision and Director of Election filed by the United States Department of Labor (the Agency) on behalf of the Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration (PWBA or the Activity).       The Regional Director concluded that the Labor Organization/Petitioner, National Union of Compliance Officers, Independent (the Union) was not precluded by sections 7112(b)(4) and 7112(c) of the Federal Service Labor - Management Relations Statute (the Statute) from representing a unit of PWBA employees. The Regional Director otherwise found the unit appropriate for the purpose of exclusive recognition under the Statute and directed that an election be held among the employees in the unit sought.       We granted the Agency's application for review because substantial questions of law or policy were raised over whether section 7112(c) of the Statute prohibits the Union from representing a unit of PWBA employees while it continues to represent the unit of Office of Labor - Management Standards (OLMS) employees. No supplementary briefs were filed.       We conclude that the petitioned-for unit of PWBA employees is not appropriate under the Statute. We also conclude that section 7135(a)(1) of the Statute does not permit the continuation of the Union's prior representation of PWBA employees and that no successor relationship exists.       II. Background       A. Relevant Provisions of the Statute       Three sections of the Statute are relevant to the issues in this case. The first, section 7112, is entitled ""Determination of appropriate units for labororganization representation."" It provides, in relevant part:       (a)(1) The Authority shall determine the appropriateness of any unit. The Authority shall determine in each case whether, . . . , the appropriate unit should be established on an agency, plant, installation, functional, or other basis and shall determine any unit to be appropriate only if the determination will ensure a clear and identifiable community of interest among the employees in the unit and will promote effective dealings with, and efficiency of the operations of, the agency involved.       (b) A unit shall not be determined to be appropriate under this section solely on the basis of the extent to which employees in the proposed unit have organized, nor shall a unit be determined to be appropriate if it includes--       (4) an employee engaged in administering the provisions of this chapter.       (c) Any employee who is engaged in administering any provision of law relating to labor-management relations may not be represented by a labor organization--       (1) which represents other individuals to whom such provision applies; or       (2) which is affiliated directly or indirectly with an organization which represents other individuals to whom such provision applies.        The second relevant provision is section 7120, entitled ""Standards of conduct for labor organizations."" As is discussed in more detail in part III of this decision, section 7120 contains requirements which must be met by unions in order to obtain and retain exclusive recognition status.       The third provision is section 7135, entitled ""Continuation of existing laws, recognitions, agreements, and procedures."" Section 7135(a) provides:       (a) Nothing contained in this chapter shall preclude--       (1) the renewal or continuation of an exclusive recognition, certification of an exclusive representative, or a lawful agreement between an agency and an exclusive representative of its employees, which is entered into before the effective date of this chapter; or       (2) the renewal, continuation, or initial according of recognition for units of management officials or supervisors represented by labor organizations which historically or traditionally represent management officials or supervisors in private industry and which hold exclusive recognition for units of such officials or supervisors in any agency on the effective date of this chapter.       B. Authority's Decision in 23 FLRA  464       A major reorganization within the Agency in 1984 resulted in the dissolution of the Labor - Management Services Administration (LMSA). LMSA's field employees were represented by the Union. The reorganization established OLMS and PWBA. OLMS assumed responsibility for enforcement of standards of conduct matters under section 7120 of the Statute. PWBA was created to deal with pension matters primarily under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA).       In Department of Labor, 23 FLRA  464 (1986), the Authority clarified the unit represented by the Union. The Authority found that as a result of the reorganization, the PWBA (or pension) employees were severed from and no longer shared a community of interest with the other employees in the Union's unit. Accordingly, the Authority excluded the pension employees from the unit. The Authority further found that under section 7135(a)(1) of the Statute, the Union continued to be the exclusive representative of OLMS (or labor standards) employees.       C. The Union's Petition for the PWBA Employees       The Union seeks to represent in a separate unit the pension employees whom the Authority excluded from its unit in Department of Labor. The Union contended in its petition that the pension employees constitute an appropriate unit for the purpose of exclusive recognition. Additionally, the Union argued that based on its previous representation of the pension employees, its status as exclusive representative of these employees continues under section 7135(a)(1).       The Activity contended that the claimed unit was inappropriate for representation by the Union because sections 7112(b)(4) and 7112(c) of the Statute preclude representation of both the labor standards and the pension employees by the same labor organization. The Activity noted that the Union currently represents OLMS employees, who administer section 7120 of the Statute. Therefore, according to PWBA, its employees cannot be represented by the Union because the provisions of section 7120 apply to PWBA employees.       D. Regional Director's Decision       The Regional Director found that section 7112(b)(4) of the Statute does not preclude a separate unit of the pension employees because (1) the OLMS unit continued under section 7135(a)(1), and (2) PWBA employees do not administer provisions of the Statute. The Regional Director also found that section 7112(c) does not preclude the Union's representation of both OLMS and PWBA employees because the pension employees administer provisions of law pertaining to private sector pension plans only, and (2) these provisions have no application to the labor standards employees. On the basis of the Authority's decision in Department of Labor, he rejected the Union's contention that section 7135(a)(1) permitted it to continue prior representation of the pension employees.       III. Positions of the Parties       The Agency contends that the Regional Director's decision is inconsistent with section 7112(c) of the Statute. The Agency maintains that the Regional Director failed to properly consider the full effect of finding the PWBA unit appropriate for representation by the Union. The Agency argues that allowing the PWBA unit to be represented by the Union would cause the Union's representation of the OLMS unit to violate section 7112(c) because the OLMS employees administer section 7120, which applies to the pension employees. The Agency agrees with the Regional Director that section 7135(a)(1) does not entitle the Union to continue its prior representation of the pension employees.       The Union contends that the Regional Director properly determined that section 7112(c) does not disqualify it from representing the pension employees. The Union argues that representing the PWBA unit would not cause its representation of the OLMS unit to violate section 7112(c). The Union maintains that section 7120 is not a ""provision of law relating to labor-management relations"" within the meaning of section 7112(c) because it relates to internal union affairs. Alternatively, the Union argues that even if section 7120 is such a provision relating to labor-management relations, section 7135(a) permits it to continue to represent the PWBA employees. The Union maintains that section 7135(a)(1) and the successor relationship which exists in this case allow it to convert its prior status as the exclusive representative of the pension employees into a certification.       IV. Analysis and Conclusions       We conclude that a unit of the pension employees is not appropriate for representation by the Union. We also conclude that the Union is not entitled to represent the pension employees under section 7135(a)(1) and that no successor relationship exists. Accordingly, we will dismiss the Union's petition.       The Regional Director considered section 7112(c) solely in terms of the provisions of law administered by the pension employees. Because the provisions administered by the. PWBA employees do not apply to the OLMS employees, the Regional Director concluded that there was no bar to the Union's representation of both units of employees. In our view, the Regional Director erred by considering section 7112(c) only, in relation to the employees in the petitioned-for unit. We find that the Regional Director also should have considered the effect of section 7112 (c) on the unit of OLMS employees already represented by the Union.       Section 7112(c) of the Statute was enacted to prevent conflicts of interest and appearances of conflicts of interest which would result from represented employees administering labor laws that apply to other employees represented by their union. See Legistlative History of the Federal Service Labor - Management Relations Statute, at 925. Section 7122(c) prevents such conflicts such conflicts by prohibiting employees who administer provisions of labor relations law from being represented by any union who represents other employees to whom such provisions apply.       The Union currently represents OLMS employees. These employees administer the provisions of section 7120 of the Statute. Section 7120 sets forth the standards of conduct for labor organizations in the Federal Government. The section provides, among other things, that unions must be free from ""corrupt influences and influences opposed to basic democratic principles."" Section 7120 also contains requirements concerning a union's preparation and filing of financial reports, bonding of union officials, and compliance with trusteeship and election standards. Section 7120 applies to the Union's representation of OLMS employees and would apply to the Union's representation of the PWBA employees.       We find that section 7120 constitutes a ""provision of law relating to labor-management relations"" within the meaning of section 7112(c). We reject the Union's claim that section 7120 is not a provision concerning ""labor-management relations"" because it relates solely to internal union affairs. The Union is correct in noting that section 7120 regulates the conduct of union affairs. The section also provides that exclusive recognition may be accorded only to a union which satisfies the requirements of the section. Further, section 7120(f) provides for the Authority to revoke exclusive recognition status if certain violations occur. Therefore, a union must satisfy the requirements of section 7120 to gain and retain exclusive recognition. Exclusive recognition is the basis for labor-management relations.       We find that if the Union were certified as the exclusive representative of the pension employees, section 7112(c) would prohibit the Union's continued representation of the labor standards employees. Furthermore, this prohibition is not precluded by section 7135(a)(1) of the Statute or by the Authority's decision in Department of Labor. In Department of Labor, 23 FLRA  at 472-73 & n.8, the Authority decided that the reorganization did not substantially change the scope and character of the Union's representation of the labor standards employees and that, consequently, continued representation of the OLMS employees remained viable by operation of section 7135(a)(1). In contrast, we find that the character of the Union's representation would be substantially changed if the Union were certified as the representative of pension employees. As a result of the conflicts of interest created by such a certification, the Union's continued representation of the labor standards employees would be prohibited. Consequently, we find that the continued representation by the Union of the labor standards employees would not remain viable under section 7135(a)(1).       In view of this prohibition of section 7112 (c), which is intended to prevent conflicts of interest, and in view of the Union's current status as the exclusive representative of OLMS employees, we conclude that section 7112(c) applies in this case to make the petitioned-for unit of PWBA employees inappropriate for representation by the Union so long as the union (1) continues to represent a unit of OLMS employees, and (2) OLMS employees continue to administer section 7120 of the Statute. In addition, contrary to the Union's claims, we find that section 7135(a)(1) of the Statute does not permit the continuation of the Union's prior representation of PWBA employees and that no successor relationship exists. We agree with the Regional Director that the decision in Department of Labor severed any continued representational relationship between the Union and those employees.       V.

GX142-25-11010970	"Statement of John Kotch  Acting Deputy Assistant Secretary  for Labor-Management Standards  Employment Standards Administration  Department of Labor  Before the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations  Committee on Education and the Workforce  U.S. House of Representatives   June 17, 1998       Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee:   Thank you for inviting me to testify today. The Office of Labor-Management Standards (OLMS) has primary responsibility for administering the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959, as amended (LMRDA). OLMS is part of the Employment Standards Administration in the Department of Labor. With me today is Mr. Howard Campbell, Acting Chief of the Section of Reports and Disclosure.   The LMRDA includes civil and criminal provisions that provide standards for union democracy and protect the financial integrity of labor organizations that represent private sector employees. Responsibility for investigation and prosecution of crimes and civil enforcement actions under the LMRDA is shared by the Department of Justice and the Department of Labor under a 1960 Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the two Departments. Any evidence of criminal conduct uncovered by OLMS is referred to the Department of Justice for prosecution. In addition, criminal enforcement activity relating to organized crime in the context of labor organizations is handled by the Department of Labor’s Office of the Inspector General and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. OLMS cooperates with the Office of the Inspector General and the Department of Justice in particular cases, as appropriate.    OLMS has a total staff of approximately 300, including 175 investigators in our 21 district offices. Over the years we have developed and implemented an enforcement strategy based on the Department of Labor's specific responsibilities contained in the LMRDA and the effective use of available resources to promote union democracy and fiscal integrity in the approximately 33,000 local, intermediate and national and international unions covered by the LMRDA. Our most recent enforcement strategy is articulated in the OLMS five-year strategic plan, developed in accordance with the Government Performance and Results Act. OLMS enforcement programs involve both civil and criminal provisions of the LMRDA. About half of OLMS' investigative time is spent on civil programs and half on criminal programs.   Section 201(b) of the LMRDA requires that unions file with the Department of Labor annual financial reports that are available for public disclosure. Section 201(b) requires that the annual financial reports disclose the union’s assets, liabilities, receipts and disbursements, including payments to officers and employees and loans made by the union. As noted in the July 30, 1959 report of the House Committee on Education and Labor, the primary purpose of the union reporting requirement is to provide the information necessary for union members to participate in their unions and to prevent and/or correct abuses. The labor organization annual financial reports are also used by the Department of Labor and other government agencies for law enforcement purposes and by members of the public.   Labor organizations are required to file their annual financial report on one of three reporting forms prescribed by OLMS, depending on the total annual receipts of the union. The Form LM-2 is the most detailed form. It is six pages long with 77 items and 15 supporting schedules. It is required to be filed by unions with total annual receipts of $200,000 or more and by unions which are under a trusteeship imposed by a parent body. Approximately 6,000 unions file Form LM-2. The two-page Form LM-3 is less detailed than Form LM-2 and may be used by unions with total annual receipts of less than $200,000. The one-page Form LM-4, the shortest form, may be used by unions with less than $10,000 in total annual receipts.   While Form LM-2 has been refined over the years as various revisions have been made to the forms through the regulatory process, its basic elements have remained essentially the same since 1962. The three labor organization reporting forms reflect a number of factors including the statutory language, the Congressional goals in enacting the LMRDA, and a consideration of the balance of costs and benefits as reflected in the Paperwork Reduction Act's requirement that reporting burdens imposed on the public by the government not be unduly burdensome and the LMRDA requirement that simplified reports be prescribed for smaller unions.   OLMS conducts periodic desk audits to determine if union annual financial reports are completed in accordance with the instructions to the forms. Desk audits are conducted solely on the filed reports, without reference to the underlying records. We are currently in the process of desk auditing the 1996 and 1997 LM-2 reports filed by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters.    In addition to the reports from unions, the LMRDA also requires reports under certain circumstances from employers, labor relations consultants, union officers and employees, and surety companies.   All of these reports are available for public disclosure from the OLMS national office and OLMS district offices maintain copies of reports for the unions in their geographic jurisdictions. In FY 1997, OLMS responded to almost 8,000 disclosure requests by providing copies of over 28,000 LM reports totaling approximately 370,000 pages. On January 1, 1998, OLMS initiated a Customer Service Survey of persons requesting disclosure of LM reports. Of 240 responses received for the period January 1 through March 31, 1998, 97.9% of respondents rated OLMS disclosure service as good or excellent.   Congress appropriated $500,000 in FY 1998 for the development of a system to provide for electronic filing, Internet disclosure of reports required to be filed under the LMRDA, and an indexed computer database of information from the reports that is searchable through the Internet. The implementation plan for modernizing LMRDA reporting and public disclosure was recently submitted to the House Appropriations Committee.    In addition to describing our reporting program, I would like to briefly summarize OLMS' other major programs and responsibilities under the LMRDA. The first is our Compliance Audit Program, or CAP, for local unions. OLMS field office managers are delegated authority to conduct CAPs and select local unions for a CAP based on an analysis/review of LM reports; delinquent LM report listings; complaints; and other information. A CAP generally takes about seven staff days to complete. During a CAP, OLMS interviews union officials and conducts a specialized, streamlined review of the union's records to ensure compliance with the LMRDA reporting and recordkeeping requirements and with other provisions of the LMRDA. OLMS investigators also review LM reports, identify deficiencies, and obtain amended reports as necessary. OLMS has completed over 3,000 CAPs in the last five fiscal years.   OLMS has a companion program for international unions, called ""I-CAP."" Each year, as part of the OLMS planning process, the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Labor-Management Standards determines the total number of I-CAP cases to be completed by OLMS field offices based on program priorities, workload considerations, and other factors such as available travel funds and staff resources. Unlike CAP, unions are selected for I-CAP on a systematic method based on each international union’s reported annual receipts. Beginning in 1984, international unions were categorized by receipt size as very large (over $100,000,000 in annual receipts), large ($10,000,000 to $100,000,000), medium ($100,000 to $9,999,999) or small (less than $100,000) and have been generally selected for audit on an ascending order within each category. I-CAPs use more detailed and extensive procedures than a CAP and require an average of about 176 field staff days. However, while 176 field staff days    is the average, I-CAPs of some of the larger unions have required in excess of 600 staff days. Since the I-CAP program was initiated in the early 1980s, OLMS has completed I-CAPS on 138 unions while 15 unions currently on our list of national and international unions remain to be audited under I-CAP. One of these fifteen unions is the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. OLMS has completed 24 I-CAPs in the last five fiscal years.    During both CAPs and I-CAPs, OLMS investigators provide compliance assistance to union officials to help them detect and correct problems to avoid future violations of the LMRDA. Our ability to perform audits under the CAP and I-CAP program depends on the time we must devote to non-discretionary enforcement programs over which we have no control, primarily officer election complaints, and on other enforcement priorities, including criminal investigations involving complaints of union financial irregularities.   The enforcement of the union officer election provisions of the LMRDA is another major OLMS program. The LMRDA requires that union officer elections be conducted regularly at least every three years for locals, every four years for intermediate bodies, and every five years for national and international unions. The LMRDA also provides a number of other safeguards to ensure democratic officer elections.   OLMS is required by Section 402 of the LMRDA to investigate every officer election complaint that is properly and timely filed with us. Furthermore, the law requires that OLMS investigate and bring enforcement action, if necessary, within 60 days from the day a member files a complaint with the Department of Labor. If it is determined that a violation occurred that may have affected the outcome of the election, OLMS attempts to reach a settlement with the union to supervise a new election or, if necessary, pursues litigation in U.S. District Court seeking a court order for a new election under OLMS supervision. In the last five years OLMS has conducted 717 election investigations and supervised 210 re-run elections.    Finally, OLMS has responsibility for investigating certain criminal provisions of the LMRDA, primarily involving the embezzlement of union assets and related criminal reporting violations. Investigations are initiated based on various sources such as member complaints, review of LM-2/3/4 reports, leads from compliance audits, and information from other government agencies. OLMS works with the Department of Justice in these investigations and in any subsequent prosecutions. OLMS has conducted approximately 1600 criminal investigations in the last five fiscal years. During that time, 728 indictments and 707 convictions were obtained. It is also important to note that these convictions resulted in barring the convicted individuals from holding union office and employment for a period of up to 13 years from the date of sentencing or the end of imprisonment, whichever is later, in accordance with Section 504 of the LMRDA.

LMRDA also covers unions representing U.S. Postal Service employees by virtue of the Postal Reorganization Act of 1970. Section 7120 of the Civil Service Reform Act, and its implementing regulations, apply many LMRDA standards to unions representing employees in most agencies of the executive     branch of the Federal Government. LMRDA does not cover unions composed solely of state and local government employees.      Basic Provisions/Requirements      The LMRDA consists of seven titles:             Title I , the ""Bill of Rights"", sets forth certain basic rights that Congress believed federal law should guarantee to union members. Members may enforce these rights through private suit in federal district court. Section 104 of the LMRDA, which establishes the right to receive or       examine collective bargaining agreements, applies not only to union members but also to all nonunion employees whose rights are directly affected by a collective bargaining agreement.  The Secretary of Labor also has enforcement responsibilities with regard to Section 104. The Office of       Labor-Management Standards (OLMS) of the Employment Standards Administration handles these responsibilities.                  Title II  requires unions to file an information report (Form LM-1), copies of their constitution and bylaws, and annual financial reports (Form LM-2, LM-3, or LM-4) with OLMS. The reports and documents filed with OLMS are public information, and any person may examine them or obtain       copies at OLMS offices.  Officers and employees of unions must file a Form LM-30 with OLMS if they have any loans or benefits from, or certain financial interests in, employers whose employees their union represents and businesses that deal with their union.  Labor relations       consultants who enter into an agreement with an employer to persuade employees about their union activities, or to supply certain information to the employer, must file a Form LM-20, Agreement and Activities Report, and a Form LM-21, Receipts and Disbursements Report.  Employers who enter       into such an agreement or engage in certain specified financial dealings with their employees, unions, union officers, or labor relations consultants must file a Form LM-10.  Finally, surety companies that issue bonds required by the LMRDA or the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of       1974 (ERISA) must file a Form S-1 to report data such as premiums received, total claims paid, and amounts recovered. The Secretary of Labor has authority to enforce the reporting requirements of the Act.                  Title III  concerns the imposition of trusteeships over subordinate unions. A parent union may impose a trusteeship only for a purpose specified in the LMRDA, and it must establish and administer the trusteeship in accordance with its own constitution and bylaws. A parent union that       places a subordinate union in trusteeship must file initial, semiannual, and terminal trusteeship reports (Forms LM-15, LM-15A, and LM-16).  Under the LMRDA, the parent union may not engage in certain specified acts involving the funds and delegate votes from a union under trusteeship. The       Secretary of Labor has the authority to investigate and enforce alleged violations of Title III, and a union member or subordinate union may also enforce the provisions of this title, except for the reporting requirements, through private suit in federal district court.                  Title IV  establishes standards for elections of union officers. Local unions must elect their officers by secret ballot; national and international unions and intermediate bodies must elect their officers either by secret ballot of the members or by delegates chosen by secret ballot.       Title IV requires elections to be held by national and international unions at least every five years, intermediate bodies at least every four years, and local unions at least every three years.  Unions and employers may not use their funds to promote the candidacy of any candidate, although       union funds may be used to conduct an election. A union member in good standing has the right to nominate candidates, be a candidate subject to reasonable qualifications uniformly imposed, hold office, and support and vote for the candidates of the member's choice. Unions must mail a notice of       election to every member at the member's last-known home address at least 15 days before the election.  A union member who has exhausted internal election remedies, or invoked such remedies without obtaining a final decision within three calendar months, may file a complaint with the       Secretary within one calendar month thereafter, alleging a violation of Title IV of the LMRDA. The Secretary of Labor has authority to file suit in a federal district court to set aside an invalid union election and to request a new election under the supervision of the Secretary.                  Title V  provides a number of safeguards for unions. Union officers have a duty to manage the funds and property of the union solely for the benefit of the union in accordance with its constitution and bylaws. A union may not have outstanding loans to any one officer or employee that       exceed $2,000. Union officials who handle union funds or property must be bonded to provide protection against losses.  A union officer or employee who embezzles or otherwise misappropriates union funds or other assets commits a federal crime punishable by a fine and/or imprisonment. Persons       convicted of certain crimes, including a violation of Title II or III of the LMRDA, may not hold union office or employment for up to 13 years after conviction or the end of imprisonment.                  Title VI  includes the authority to investigate (see ""Authority to Investigate and Penalties"" below); a prohibition on a union fining, suspending, expelling, or otherwise disciplining members for exercising their rights under the LMRDA; and a prohibition on the use or threat of force       or violence to interfere with a union member in the exercise of LMRDA rights.                   Title VII  amends the Labor Management Relations Act (LMRA), otherwise known as the Taft-Hartley Act, concerning strikes, boycotts, and picketing. The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), an independent federal agency, administers the LMRA.           Employee Rights      Title I of the LMRDA guarantees certain rights to all union members. These include the right to nominate candidates, to vote in elections or referendums, to attend membership meetings and to participate in the deliberations and vote upon the business of such meetings, subject to reasonable     rules and regulations in the organization's constitution and bylaws.      They also include the right to meet and assemble freely with other members, to express any views, arguments, or opinions, and to express views at meetings about candidates in an election of the labor organization or about any business properly before the meeting, subject to the organization's     established and reasonable rules pertaining to the conduct of meetings. Additional rights outlined in Title I address dues, initiation fees and assessments, protection of the right to sue, and safeguards against improper disciplinary action.      Compliance Assistance Available      Additional compliance assistance materials appear on the  OLMS Home Page . OLMS field office staff members are available to answer questions about the LMRDA and to help individuals and organizations affected by the law.      The OLMS National Office Public Disclosure Room has copies of all reports and documents filed with OLMS, and OLMS field offices have copies of reports filed by organizations and individuals located within their jurisdictions. Copies of Form LM-1, LM-2, LM-3, and LM-4 reports filed by unions     may be ordered on  OLMS's Web site .       In addition, all OLMS field offices as well as the OLMS National Office have blank reporting forms and instructions as well as explanatory pamphlets about the law.        Penalties/Sanctions      The LMRDA authorizes the Secretary of Labor to investigate ""in order to determine whether any person has violated or is about to violate"" any provisions of the Act (except the Bill of Rights of Union Members and amendments made by the LMRDA to other laws), and to ""enter such places and inspect     such records and accounts and question such persons"" as may be necessary to determine whether a violation has occurred. The Secretary may issue subpoenas to compel testimony or to obtain records and other materials needed to complete an investigation.      The Secretary may file civil actions in federal district court to restrain or correct violations and to bring about compliance with the LMRDA. The embezzlement of union funds is subject to a fine of up to $250,000 and/or imprisonment up to five years. Criminal penalties also apply to other     Title V provisions as well as to certain reporting violations under Titles II and III.      Relation to State, Local and Other Federal Laws      Federal laws related to the LMRDA include the National Labor Relations Act of 1935; the Taft-Hartley Act of 1947; the Racketeer-Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act; the Service Contract Act; and the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978.

GX238-77-1724609	"September 9, 2003  Updated Form Will Protect Union Members from Financial Abuse  Needed: Real Financial Transparency for Labor Unions Executive Summary  Union members are the victims of financial mismanagement, fraud, and embezzlement when those in control of a union's funds take advantage of their positions for personal gain. Over the past five years, an average of 11 union officials per month have been convicted for financial mismanagement, fraud, and embezzlement of union funds. The purpose of the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959 (LMRDA) is to protect union members from such abuses by requiring all labor unions to file annual financial statements with the Department of Labor (DOL). Unfortunately, the law's financial disclosure form has remained substantially unchanged for 44 years and now reflects an outdated financial environment. The result is that the reporting by many unions is insufficient to allow DOL to protect union members. DOL is proposing to correct this problem through the rulemaking process by updating the financial statement form required of the largest labor unions, known as the LM-2 form, so that it provides more detailed financial information. Democrats oppose the proposed rule to update the LM-2 form and have threatened to offer an amendment to the Senate's FY 2004 Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education appropriations bill to prevent the rule from going forward. This paper will demonstrate why Senate Republicans should support DOL's proposed rule change and defeat any Democrat efforts to stop it.             Introduction In response to labor union financial mismanagement, fraud, and embezzlement, Congress passed the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act (LMRDA) 44 years ago. This law required unions to publicly disclose certain financial information.1 The LMRDA is no longer as effective as it should be in preventing these abuses; and the Department of Labor (DOL) has identified some reasons for this. The primary reason is the annual financial disclosure statements required by the law have not been updated to reflect the modern financial circumstances and methodology of labor unions. Therefore, it is very easy for unions to hide evidence of financial mismanagement, fraud, and embezzlement. Additionally, DOL does not have the resources it needs to adequately enforce the law, nor does it have the authority to punish those who fail to file reporting forms on a timely basis. DOL has proposed a rule to update the annual financial disclosure statement, known as the LM-2 form, and is seeking legislative action to address the resource and penalty issues. However, Democrats and organized labor leaders are opposing DOL's proposed rule and have threatened to block it through an amendment to the Senate's Labor, Health and Human Services and Education Appropriations bill for fiscal year 2004. Their claims that changes to the LM-2 form would be burdensome and costly are overstated, and the position that current-law protections are sufficient is disproved by the facts. The campaign against the proposed rule to update the LM-2 contradicts the very purpose of a labor union  to benefit its members.  Federal and State Law Benefits Unions . . . So Unions Must Be Held Accountable to Their Members Organized labor unions are given preferential status under federal and state law because of the public policy assumption that they exist for the sole purpose of helping their members: unions do not pay taxes and are exempt from anti-trust laws and federal whistle-blower laws. Additionally, unions are allowed to compel dues from non-union employees in the 29 states which have not passed right-to-work laws. Right-to-work laws bar the practice of making union membership or dues mandatory in unionized workplaces. Unions are funded by dues from members (and in the 29 states mentioned above, by the dues of non-union-member employees). Average union members' dues are no small investment, and members expect their unions to be good stewards of those funds. Though DOL does not tally union assets, others have calculated, based on current reporting, that union receipts in 2000 totaled $15 billion.2 The same report estimated that $6.75 billion of the 2000 receipts came out of union  Congress passed the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act (LMRDA) in 1959.

The other income would be from return on investments made with union dues. The average dues collected per employee in 2000 was $675.3 This amount is equivalent to one-third of the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) tax withheld from workers whose annual earnings are $30,000.  Abuse of Union Funds Violates Union Members Trust Although all unions benefit from their advantageous status under federal and state law, not all unions live up to the purpose of protecting union members. Over the last five fiscal years, an average of 11 union leaders a month have been convicted of financial fraud  a total of 639 convictions.4 Union officials have stolen from their members' hard-earned paychecks,5 misused union-member dues for personal gain,6 and abused their power over workers' earnings and work schedule to silence union members who question a union's use of funds.7 Convicted parties have been ordered to pay over $15 million in restitution to the union members they robbed  but even that sum does not cover the full extent of lost funds.8 When union leaders put their own interests first, they do more than steal from members' paychecks  they abuse both their members' and the public's trust. With the record recited above, union members cannot be sure they are being represented effectively. Evidence of such disregard for the interests of union members themselves was delivered at a Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) hearing reviewing the recently exposed scandal within the United Teachers of Dade, Florida (UTD). One witness testified that union officials raised their own pay and benefits while failing to obtain raises or improved benefit packages for teachers, and waived the right to counsel for every member of the union.9 In another recent example, officials of the Washington Teachers Union have been charged with embezzling directly 3 4  National Institute for Labor Relations Research.

The Department of Labor has determined that it lacks the information and resources it needs to more effectively prevent and detect cases of financial mismanagement, fraud, and embezzlement. A major source of the problem is the outdated LM-2 form, which does not reflect the complex financial world in which today's unions operate. The proposed update of the LM-2 form would better protect union members from financial mismanagement, fraud, and embezzlement.  Current-Law Disclosure Requirements on Unions The LMRDA applies to all unions representing any non-governmental employees, including those that are mostly government workers, but have a mere handful of non-government workers. These unions are required to submit an annual report to the Department of Labor, known as LM-2, LM-3 or LM-4, depending on the size of the union.12 The LM-2  the only form significantly affected by DOL's proposed rule  is required of the largest labor unions, those that collect annual receipts of $200,000 or more; this is the form required of about 20 percent of all unions. To encourage good financial stewardship of union members' resources, the LMRDA requires unions to annually detail income, assets, and liabilities. The form requires a variety of information, such as rate of dues, number of members, losses or shortages of funds, loans payable, and payment to employees. LM-2 forms are intended to detail the union's financial picture both so that members may identify any financial mismanagement, fraud or embezzlement of union members' dues, and to deter such abuses in the first place.  Two WTU employees were charged and pleaded guilty to stealing more than $1.5 million. The WTU President, Treasurer and other officials have not yet been charged, but have resigned their positions and the investigation is ongoing. WTU's own audit indicated that $5 million had been stolen. See, Washington Post, ""Another Guilty Plea In D.C. Union Probe,"" April 12, 2003. 11  10  Baltimore Sun, March 1, 2003. The proposed rule only significantly affects LM-2 forms.  12  4   Outdated Form and Reporting Requirements As previously noted, the LM-2 form has remained substantially unchanged for 44 years,13 and now reflects an outdated financial environment. As a demonstration of the problem of expenditures being reported in lump sums within vague categories  which the form now permits  the following listings from actual LM-2 filings show what a union member who wanted to review how his union was representing him would be able to learn:       $7.8 million for ""civic organizations"" $3.9 million for ""sundry expenses"" $7.8 million for ""political education"" $68.7 million for ""grants to joint projects with state and local affiliates"" $23 million for ""financial assistance to state and local lodges"" $19.3 million for ""organizing and servicing.""14  DOL has proposed to restructure the LM-2 form to require that significantly past due or forgiven loans and obligations be listed, allowing union members to determine if the union is collecting its debs and paying its obligations. Additionally, each expenditure over $2,00015 would be itemized and designated within one of eight categories: ""contract negotiation and administration,"" ""organizing,"" ""political activities,"" ""lobbying,"" ""contributions, gifts and grants,"" ""benefits,"" ""general overhead,"" and ""other disbursements."" The LM-2 form also fails to require reporting of joint ventures or any assets not owned wholly by the individual union. In a time when joint ventures are extremely common, such a broad loophole invites abuse. A union that shelters assets in joint ventures may be able to hide financial mismanagement, fraud, and embezzlement even if the current LM-2 forms are closely examined by members or the Department of Labor. The proposed rule would create a new form, T-1, on which unions would be required to disclose joint ventures, trusts, and subsidiaries, so that union members may have a more complete understanding of how union officials are spending their dues and union assets. Until recently, union members could not easily gain access to LM2 form filings. This significantly hindered their ability to see how their dues were being spent. This information is now provided on the Internet by DOL for filings after 2000. In many cases, obtaining copies of these filings through DOL may be the only way union members can learn how their union is  13  Labor Organization Annual Financial Reports, Federal Register, Vol. 67, No. 249, December Labor Organization Annual Financial Reports, Federal Register, Vol. 67, No. 249, December  27, 2002. 14  27, 2002. The proposed rule suggests that the threshold for itemization of expenses on the revised LM-2 form would be from $2000 to $5,000, and invited comments on what number would be the most reasonable threshold. 15  5   spending their dues money. The proposed rule would require that LM-2 forms be filed electronically. DOL is developing software to facilitate this, and it will be provided free to all labor unions required to file.  Lack of Investigative Resources Within DOL, the Office of Labor Management Standards (OLMS) is the agency that monitors basic standards of financial integrity of labor organizations, and administers the LaborManagement Reporting and Disclosure Act (LMRDA). Throughout the 1990s, the ability of OLMS to perform its mission was greatly handicapped by diminished resources. From 1990 to 2002, the budget for OLMS declined by 40 percent in relation to other government spending. The impact of this dearth of resources was severe. Audits of all unions have declined  dropping from 800 in 1992 to only 269 in 2002.16 Many large unions have never been audited.17 As part of the overall effort to protect the resources of union members from financial mismanagement, fraud and embezzlement, President Bush has requested a 15-percent increase in the OLMS budget for FY04  an increase from $34 million in FY03 to $40.6 million for FY04. The House-passed bill exceeded that request, while the Senate appropriations bill as reported (S. 1356) would meet half of the request. Reasonable increases in resources for this enforcement agency are a crucial component in achieving the strong financial accountability the President seeks.  Insufficient Civil Penalties The law does provide penalties for violation,18 but does not impose a penalty for filing an LM-2 late; so it is no wonder over 40 percent of unions file their LM-2s late.19 DOL cannot impose such a penalty without Congressional action. Therefore, DOL has requested that Congress enact civil financial penalties for late filing of LM-2 forms. President Bush recommended legislative action to correct this deficiency in his FY04 budget, and a bill has been introduced in the House of Representatives to allow the Secretary of Labor to establish and implement fines for late filing.20 Related legislation in the House would require unions to notify members of their 16 17 18  Office of Labor Management Standards. Larry Yud, June 19, 2003.  Criminal penalties exist for filing a false report or failing to file, for which the LMRDA authorizes a fine of more than $100,000, imprisonment for not more than one year, or both. Larry Yud. The penalty for complete failure to file or knowingly filing false information is a $100,000 fine or imprisonment for up to one year, or both. The Union Members Right to Know Act (H.R. 992), the Labor Management Accountability Act (H.R. 993), and the Union Member Information Enforcement Act (H.R. 994) were introduced by Congressman Sam Johnson (R-TX) and have been the subject of hearings within the Education and Workforce Subcommittee to which they were referred. 20 19  6   rights under LMRDA, and provide for strong enforcement of that right. Similar legislation is expected to be introduced in the Senate during this Congress.  DOL's Proposed Rule Would Create Effective LM-2 Form On December 27, 2002, after holding nine ""stakeholder meetings"" with representatives of over 40 unions who file LM-2 forms, DOL issued the proposed rule to rewrite the LM-2 form and invited public comment.21 The public comment period ended on March 27, 2003. Although the final rule was scheduled to be issued this month, DOL has indicated that in light of the thousands of public comments received, it likely will postpone the final rule date so that all comments may be considered. Specifically, the proposed rule would:  restructure the LM-2 form by requiring that expenditures over $2,000 be itemized and designated within eight prescribed categories;  require general estimation of how much time individuals on the union payroll spend on each of the eight categories referenced above;  require listing of loans which are 90 days past due or have been written off;  require listing of debts which are 90 days past due or have been written off;  close a major loophole in the current LM-2 form by requiring unions to report joint ventures and trusts;  report the number of union members and status (i.e., retired, active, or apprentice); and  require that LM-2 forms be filed electronically, which will make it easier to assure union members and the public access to the information via the Internet. In July, Democrats in the House of Representatives threatened to offer an amendment designed to prevent the Department from moving forward with its proposed rule to update the LM-2 as that chamber prepared to consider its FY 2004 Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education appropriations bill, but no amendment was offered. As the Senate considers its version of the FY 2004 funding bill for the Department of Labor, efforts to thwart the rule may be renewed. The Office of Management and Budget issued a statement on September 2 that the President's senior advisors would recommend he veto the bill if DOL is prevented from moving forward with the rule.  A Response to Union Officials' Objections to the Proposed Rule The labor unions' opposition to the proposed rule to update the LM-2 form is based on assertions of their leaders that the new LM-2 form would take significantly more resources to complete, and that the current LMRDA, along with the unions' own internal oversight, is sufficient to prevent financial mismanagement, fraud, and embezzlement.  21  Labor Organization Annual Financial Reports, Federal Register, Vol. 67, No. 249, December  27, 2002.  7   Argument That Compliance Will Be Burdensome is Overstated The primary objection raised by unions is that compliance will be time-consuming and costly. As stated above, the additional activities that would be required by the proposed rule include record-keeping of major disbursements and receipts over $2,000, designation of the disbursements within eight designated categories, and a similar accounting for the major disbursements and receipts of any trust in which the union is interested. Reporting would continue to be made on a annual basis, as it is currently, but would be submitted through the Internet. Again, the proposed changes to the LM-2 form only affect the largest labor unions, which already deal with large balance sheets with at least $200,000 in annual receipts. The AFL-CIO and DOL disagree on the costs of implementing the proposed rule. The AFL-CIO has estimated that it would cost unions who are obligated to file LM-2 forms a total of $1.2 billion annually.22 Their analysis rests on an estimated average cost of $1.2 million per national union and $217,509 per local union. The AFL-CIO did not specify if it determined whether annual compliance costs would decline in future years. In contrast, DOL has estimated the same costs at $14 million overall in the first year, $3.3 million in the second year, and $454,000 in the third.23 The AFL-CIO attributes the $1.19 billion discrepancy to the following costs: obtaining computer, legal, and accounting expertise; training employees; and adapting existing software and ""hardware."" However, 40 percent of unions already are preparing and filing LM-2 forms electronically.24 Furthermore, DOL is providing the necessary software to complete and file LM-2s online free of charge.  Argument that Internal Oversight is Adequate is Faulted by the Facts Some unions tout their own internal auditing systems as adequate for oversight.25 This is analogous to the fox guarding the henhouse. The track record of 639 convictions over five years indicates that internal oversight simply cannot be counted on to protect the assets of union members. The Washington Teachers Union, a local of the American Federation of Teachers (AFT), whose former leaders have been charged with embezzling as much as $5 million from its own members, was subject to so-called internal oversight. Although the local union was supposed to file financial statements with the national union annually, it had not actually filed one since 1997  not surprisingly, the national parent union did not uncover the embezzlement.

Hiatt, AFL-CIO, before the Labor, HHS Appropriations Subcommittee hearing, July 30, 2003. 23  22  Labor Organization Annual Financial Reports, Federal Register, Vol. 67 No. 249, December Labor Organization Annual Financial Reports, Federal Register, Vol. 67 No. 249, December Thomas Donahue, AFL-CIO, before HELP Committee, June 18, 2003.  27, 2002. 24  27, 2002. 25  8   another case, a union had its own auditor, but over $350,000 of embezzlement went undetected until OLMS conducted an audit.26  Conclusion The OLMS statistics on convictions show that too many union members are not being well served. Like shareholders, pensioners, and the voting public, union members deserve to be able to monitor use of their hard-earned dues. Taxpayers, too, should have access to such information since they effectively subsidize union activities. The updating of the LM-2 form proposed by DOL will help ensure financial integrity within labor unions and deter financial mismanagement, fraud, and embezzlement. Any effort to thwart DOL efforts through the appropriations process must be defeated in the Senate. Further, DOL needs the ability to enforce the LMRDA through increased resources for investigation by the overseeing agency (OLMS). Finally, Congress should update the law itself by giving the Secretary authority to impose penalties for unions which do not file by the law's deadline.  26  Larry Yud, June 19, 2003.  9"
GX240-01-14702252	"M. BENEFITS PROVIDED BY LABOR ORGANIZATIONS 1. Introduction Without further elaboration, IRC 501(c)(5) provides for the exemption from federal income tax of labor, agricultural, or horticultural organizations. While IRC 501(c)(5) does not mention any individual benefits that an organization exempt thereunder may provide to its members, for the reasons explained below a labor organization may provide various benefits to its members either directly or indirectly through a separate entity that may itself qualify for IRC 501(c)(5) exemption. One purpose of this topic is to discuss the various types of benefits an exempt IRC 501(c)(5) labor organization may provide. As explained later, an IRC 501(c)(5) labor organization may pay many of the same types of benefits that are allowed a voluntary employees' beneficiary association exempt under IRC 501(c)(9) (VEBA). (See Appendix for a list of permissible and impermissible benefits under IRC 501(c)(9).) Another purpose of this topic is to discuss the circumstances under which an organization may qualify for exemption under IRC 501(c)(5) when it could not qualify under IRC 501(c)(9). Further, because VEBAs are subject to the nondiscrimination rules under IRC 505 and/or IRC 501(c)(9), and a more encompassing unrelated business income tax definition under IRC 512(a)(3), it is to an applicant's advantage to qualify for exemption under IRC 501(c)(5) instead of IRC 501(c)(9) in cases where it could qualify under both sections. No nondiscrimination rules as to benefits have been promulgated under IRC 501(c)(5), and the normal UBI definition applies to organizations exempt under IRC 501(c)(5). 2. Benefits - In General Reg. 1.501(c)(5)-1 provides that organizations contemplated by IRC 501(c)(5) are those that have no net earnings inuring to the benefit of any member, and have as their objects the betterment of the conditions of those engaged in labor, agriculture, or horticulture, the improvement of the grade of their products, and the development of a higher degree of efficiency in their respective occupations. As stated in Rev. Rul. 67-7, 1967-1 C.B. 137, an exempt labor organization is one that has as its primary purpose the representation of its members in such matters as wages, hours of labor, working conditions and economic benefits. Thus,   the threshold question in determining whether an organization that is providing a particular type of benefit is exempt as a labor organization under IRC 501(c)(5) is whether the organization meets this definitional requirement. If the organization providing benefits is not a ""labor organization,"" it will not qualify under IRC 501(c)(5) regardless of the type of benefits provided. The benefit provided may fundamentally further the purposes of a labor organization but that fact alone may not be sufficient to meet the definitional standard. Since being a labor organization is not one of the requirements for exemption under IRC 501(c)(9), this requirement is important when considering whether a VEBA or an organization providing VEBA-type benefits might qualify instead under IRC 501(c)(5). The source of funding with respect to such an organization may be an important element in determining whether it is a labor organization. The various IRC 501(c)(5) authorities discussed below state how the particular benefits are funded. Although there is no general rule on funding under IRC 501(c)(5), labor organizations have normally and traditionally been funded directly or indirectly by the membership. As Rev. Rul. 62-17, 1962-1 C.B. 87, puts it "". . . the legislative history of the provisions exempting labor organizations from income taxation indicates that labor organizations were exempted for the very reason that they operated, in part, as mutual benefit organizations. . . ."" The exempt organization described therein was funded by the members, which is normally the essence of mutuality. Contrast this with the method of funding VEBAs. Although, with respect to most benefits, VEBAs may be funded by employee-members, employers, or both, the vast majority are in fact funded by employers. Because many employer-funded VEBAs would have difficulty showing that they are labor organizations, it is doubtful that they could qualify under IRC 501(c)(5) even though they might be paying benefits permitted by that section. On the other hand, employee-funded organizations providing the VEBA-type benefits discussed below might be able to qualify under either IRC 501(c)(9) or (c)(5). 3. Specific Benefits For purposes of discussion, specific benefits are broken down between benefits that, in general, would not be permitted under IRC 501(c)(9), regardless of the circumstances, and those that could conceivably qualify under that section. A. Benefits Permissible Under IRC 501(c)(5) But Not Under IRC 501(c)(9) In general, the benefits in this part would not qualify under IRC 501(c)(9) whether funded by employees, employers, or both.   G.C.M. 35862 (June 20, 1974) in concluding that the conduct of an employee-funded pension plan is a permissible function of the exempt labor organization described therein, provides a good overview of the legislative history of IRC 501(c)(5) labor organizations. It states that while the legislative history of the Revenue Act of 1909, the original law providing for the exemption of labor organizations, does not refer to pension plans or specifically indicate whether Congress had such plans in mind in exempting labor organizations, at the time of enactment of the statute some unions had employee-funded pension plans and were paying pension benefits. In view of the legislative history of IRC 501(c)(5) and the historical practices and practical significance of pension programs, it is clear that an employee-funded pension plan is germane to the purpose of a labor organization, even though a pension plan, unlike death, sick, accident and similar benefits, is not an intermittent, contingent benefit based on the interruption of the member's earning power, but is, in part, an investment program enabling participants to set aside their own funds to be invested for retirement. Pension benefits are not proper benefits of an IRC 501(c)(9) organization because they are deferred compensation, which is an impermissible benefit. Reg. 1.501(c)(9)-3(f). If the pensions are employer-funded they would not be a permissible benefit under IRC 501(c)(5) as well. In order for an employer-funded pension plan to qualify for exemption, it must meet the tests of IRC 401. While an IRC 501(c)(9) organization can provide severance benefits if they are no more than twice annual compensation and are payable within the two years of termination of service, the benefits are not permissible if they may be payable at retirement. In such a case, the severance benefits are in actuality a form of deferred compensation similar to a pension. However, a labor organization, unlike a VEBA, is not precluded from paying a benefit that ambiguously straddles the line between a pension and a severance benefit. For example, G.C.M. 35790 (April 23, 1974) states that although there is no direct precedent for allowing a labor organization to provide a lump sum retirement or similar benefit for workers who ""resign from work,"" the payment of such funds is proper in the case under consideration because of the following unique facts: (1) The benefits were interrelated with the training benefits being provided to the union's younger members, and senior members could not take advantage of the training benefits although they contributed more financially to the union. For this reason the union was providing equivalent benefits to eligible   unemployed members or eligible members who retire or resign from work. (2) The benefits would be paid as a single, lump-sum payment from a previously existing unemployment fund; and (3) the fund from which the benefits were to be paid was accumulated exclusively from union dues or from other contributions from the union members, and not from outside sources. The benefits do not constitute a form of private inurement because the noninurement test under IRC 501(c)(5) does not proscribe all expenditures of union funds that result in monetary benefit to individual members, but only those benefits not recognized as being a proper activity of a labor organization. Rev. Rul. 75-473, 1975-2 C.B. 213, describes a labor organization established pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement between a labor union and an association of employers. The organization's primary purpose is to allocate work assignments among eligible union members by operating a dispatch hall. The dispatch hall is operated by union members, but it is under the supervision of a joint committee composed of an equal number of employer and union representatives. Its funding is likewise supplied on an equal basis by the parent labor union and the parent employer association. In addition to maintaining and operating the dispatch hall, the organization decides questions regarding rotation of work crews and extra men, and investigates and adjudicates grievances and disputes that arise in connection with the working conditions, the job performance of union members, and the operations of the dispatch hall. In holding that the organization qualifies for exemption, the revenue ruling states that an organization that is engaged in activities appropriate to a labor union, even though technically not a labor union itself, may qualify for IRC 501(c)(5) exemption if its activities are appropriate union activities and are conducted as a part of the proper activities of the parent labor organization, so that it is not merely an independent undertaking. According to the revenue ruling, the operation of a dispatch hall betters the conditions of those engaged in labor pursuits by providing them with a continuity of work assignments and orderly transfers from one work assignment to the next. The revenue ruling also states that providing facilities to investigate and adjudicate grievances also helps promote improved working conditions and more harmonious union and employer relations.   In contrast to the above revenue ruling, Rev. Rul. 77-46, 1977-1 C.B. 147, holds that a nonprofit organization established under a collective bargaining agreement between a union and an employers' association to enable members of the union to save money does not qualify for IRC 501(c)(5) exemption. The revenue ruling states that providing a savings plan is not a benefit for which labor organizations have traditionally been exempted from federal income taxation. B. Benefits Permissible Under Both IRC 501(c)(5) and IRC 501(c)(9) The benefits described in this part are of the types that are permissible under both IRC 501(c)(5) and IRC 501(c)(9). Rev. Rul. 62-17, 1962-1 C.B. 87, holds that exempt labor organizations may provide for employee-funded sick, death, accident, and other benefits for members because ""the legislative history of the provisions exempting labor organizations from income taxation indicates that labor organizations were exempted for the very reason that they operated, in fact, as mutual benefit organizations providing death, sick, accident, and similar benefits to their members."" These are essentially the same benefits that an IRC 501(c)(9) organization can provide. See Appendix for a list of permissible benefits that may be provided by an IRC 501(c)(9) organization. One type of benefit provided directly to individual members that is deemed to fundamentally further a labor organization's exempt purpose was addressed in G.C.M. 34634 (October 8, 1971). That G.C.M. concludes that employee-funded vacation benefits are benefits that may be paid by an exempt labor organization and that the separate organization established by an exempt labor organization to provide such benefits for its members could itself qualify for IRC 501(c)(5) exemption. It states that providing such benefits is an integral part of the overall health and welfare program of the exempt parent and that an activity carried on by such a subsidiary organization need not be the kind of activity that would allow a subsidiary organization to qualify independently for exemption but need only be the kind of activity necessary to the carrying out of the parent's exempt purposes. The same benefit would also be permissible for a VEBA under Reg. 1.501(c)(9)3(e). Under Reg. 1.501(c)(9)-3(e), a VEBA may provide employees with prepaid personal legal services only in two cases. Such benefits may be provided if paid to an IRC 501(c)(20) organization or trust as part of a qualified group services plan under IRC 120 or, alternatively, if provided by a collectively-bargained plan.   G.C.M. 38981 (January 26, 1983), citing Rev. Rul. 75-288, 1975-2 C.B. 212, and Rev. Rul. 74-596, 1974-2 C.B. 167, concludes that an organization providing prepaid legal services to members of a local tax exempt labor organization may qualify for IRC 501(c)(5) exemption. The organization was a group legal services plan established by the local and created by a vote of the membership. The organization was funded solely through membership dues, was not supported by employers, and was not connected with a qualified group services plan described in IRC 120, and, therefore, did not qualify for IRC 501(c)(9) exemption. Reg. 1.501(c)(9)-3(e) clearly allows a VEBA to provide employees with payments in the event of economic dislocation. G.C.M. 37424 (February 22, 1978) concludes that the operation of a hardship fund to pay benefits to members of an exempt labor organization who encounter financial or economic hardship is an appropriate labor organization activity within the scope of IRC 501(c)(5). According to the G.C.M., such a payment is made to a member who, because of financial emergency, is unable to support himself and his family and the provision of such benefits cannot properly be distinguished from the provision of death, sick, and accident benefits to members of a labor organization. Unlike the payments in Rev. Rul. 62-17 for death, sick, accident and similar benefits, the hardship fund was not financed solely by members' dues but was also funded from royalty and interest income. The G.C.M. concludes that funding may be provided from outside sources (investment income) because the advancement of the economic selfinterest of its members is basic to the purposes and activities of a labor organization and the noninurement test does not proscribe the general use of funds by a labor organization to advance the economic self-interest of its members in traditionally recognized manners. The G.C.M. states that making the unrelated business income tax applicable to labor organizations strongly suggests that Congress approved of labor organizations earning significant amounts of unrelated income without endangering their exempt status. It states further that allowing income from outside sources in the context of a labor organization implies that union members are permitted to obtain pecuniary benefits from their membership beyond their individual contributions. Reg. 1.501(c)(9)-3(e) provides that education or training benefits or courses (such as apprentice training programs) for members are permissible VEBA benefits. Such benefits are acceptable under IRC 501(c)(5) as well. G.C.M. 35790 (April 23, 1974) concludes that retraining and educational benefits are permissible labor organization activities because they enable union members to obtain new skills to change occupations because of technological innovation. Such educational benefits contribute to the betterment of the working conditions of union members   within the meaning of Reg. 1.501(c)(5)-1(a). It also concludes that the payment of unemployment benefits for laid-off workers is a common and proper activity of a labor organization. Rev. Rul. 67-7, 1967-1 C.B. 137, holds that an organization established by a labor union to provide strike and lockout benefits to its members qualifies for IRC 501(c)(5) exemption. The organization is funded by members. The revenue ruling states that strike benefits are directed to furthering a labor union's primary purpose of representing its members in matters of wages, hours of labor, working conditions, and economic benefits. Thus, certain types of benefits, such as strike benefits that are provided directly to individual members, are deemed to further fundamentally a labor organization's exempt purpose. However, see Rev. Rul. 76420, 1976-2 C.B. 153, which holds that an organization providing weekly income to its members in the event of a strike by the members' labor unions does not qualify for IRC 501(c)(5) exemption. The organization was controlled by private individuals and not by an exempt labor organization, and it had no authority to represent or speak for its members in matters relating to their employment, such as wages, etc. Although we have not seen any VEBAs offering strike and lockout benefits, it would appear to be a contingency that interrupts earning power within the meaning of Reg. 1.501(c)(9)-3(d)(2). C. Employer-Funding As the above discussion indicates, many VEBA-type benefits provided by a labor organization for its members are deemed to be in furtherance of an exempt IRC 501(c)(5) purpose when the benefits are employee-funded, that is, from such sources as membership dues, fees, and assessments. However, there is little published precedent regarding the extent to which employer funds can be used to finance employee benefits provided by an organization that would otherwise qualify for IRC 501(c)(5) exemption, especially if the organization would qualify for IRC 501(c)(9) exemption. It is apparent that some benefits may be financed in part by employers. Rev. Rul. 78-42, 1978-1 C.B. 158, holds that a nonprofit apprenticeship and training committee, a trust formed by a union and an employers' association of a particular industry in connection with a collective bargaining agreement, qualifies for IRC 501(c)(5) exemption. The committee conducted educational courses in various aspects of the trade for members. While the revenue ruling does not state how the program was funded, apparently both the union and the association financed the program.   There is also a lack of precedent with respect to employer-funding for nonVEBA type benefits, but it is clear from Rev. Rul. 75-474 that the operation of a dispatch hall may be financed by employers and the union. See also Rev. Rul. 775, 1977-1 C.B. 145, which holds that a trust formed pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement, funded and administered by employers in an industry to compensate a multi-employer steward under the union's direct control to settle disputes, investigate complaints, etc., qualifies for exemption as a labor organization. Because of the lack of published precedent with respect to employerfunded benefits, IRM 7664.1 is applicable, and cases not described in the above revenue rulings should be referred to the National Office. 4. Other Considerations A. Separate Entity While an exempt IRC 501(c)(5) labor organization may provide the permissible benefits described above directly to its members, it may also choose to establish a separate entity to provide such benefits and the separate entity may qualify for IRC 501(c)(5) exemption. As previously indicated, the provision of vacation benefits by a subsidiary of an exempt labor organization to the members of the union is an integral part of the overall health and welfare program of the exempt parent. An activity carried on by such a subsidiary organization need not be the kind of activity that would allow a subsidiary organization to qualify independently for exemption (if the activity were not conducted for the parent) but need only be the kind of activity necessary to the carrying out of the parent's exempt purposes (i.e., an ""integral part"" of the parent's exempt activities). In Portland Cooperative Labor Temple Association, 39 B.T.A. 450 (1939), acq. 19391 (Part I) C.B. 28, the Board of Tax Appeals held that an organization that was owned and controlled by labor unions to operate a ""labor temple"" for the unions qualified for IRC 501(c)(5) exemption because the organization's activities were appropriate union activities and were conducted as a part of the parent labor organization's own activities. The Board held that the term ""labor organization"" must be broadly construed, and that what one labor organization could do for itself several should be allowed to do collectively through a corporate entity they create. (This rationale should be applied with caution, however, particularly outside the IRC 501(c)(5) area. See, for example, the line of cases dealing with hospital laundries under IRC 501(c)(3).) In addition, with respect to welfare benefits, section 403 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) requires that a separate trust be   established to administer employee welfare benefit plans defined by section 3(1) of the Act. Therefore, labor organizations wishing to comply with ERISA will establish separate trusts through which member welfare benefits will be paid to members. B. Investment Income As previously indicated, the funding for hardship benefits to members can be provided from outside sources, such as royalty and interest income. As explained above, most labor organization benefits are funded by members and, therefore, normally financing such benefits from investment income is proper if it is derived from members' dues and assessments. C. Agricultural Organizations It must be emphasized, however, that while the legislative history indicates that labor organizations have historically operated in fact as mutual benefit organizations, this is not the case with exempt IRC 501(c)(5) agricultural organizations. The Service has consistently taken the position that ""bettering the conditions of those engaged in such pursuits,"" means bettering the conditions of agriculture in general rather than benefiting the individual members specifically. Thus, the provision of individual benefits by an IRC 501(c)(5) agricultural organization to its members violates the prohibition against inurement. Therefore, the holding of Rev. Rul. 67-251, 1967-2 C.B. 196, i.e., that the provision of welfare aid and financial assistance to the members of an IRC 501(a)(6) organization constitutes prohibited inurement, would also apply to IRC 501(c)(5) agricultural and horticultural organizations.   APPENDIX Reg. 1.501(c)(9)-3 describes in considerable detail the kinds of permissible benefits that an IRC 501(c)(9) organization may provide to its members. According to this regulation, ""other benefits"" include only those benefits that are similar to life, sick, or accident benefits. It states that a benefit is similar to these benefits if (1) it is intended to safeguard or improve the health of a member or a member's dependents, or (2) it protects against a contingency that interrupts or impairs a member's earning power. There have been few developments in the last several years concerning what benefits may be provided by an organization described in IRC 501(c)(9). Generally, the discussions in the 1983, 1984, and 1986 CPE Topics are still applicable. The following chart provides a summary of benefits that are permissible under Reg. 1.501(c)(9)-3: PERMISSIBLE BENEFITS (ALL VEBAs) Term Life Insurance Group Whole Life Insurance (as defined in IRC 79) Accidental Death and Dismemberment (AD&D) Medical Dental Disability (both long and short-term) Vacation Pay Vacation Facilities Recreational Expenses Child-care Job Readjustment Allowances Income Maintenance Payments in Times of Economic Dislocation Temporary Living Expense Loans and Grants in Times of Disaster Supplemental Unemployment Compensation (SUB) Benefits Severance Pay (if provided in accordance with 29 CFR Section 2510.3-2(b) Education or Training Benefits or Courses for Members Personal Legal Service Payments (through IRC 501(c)(20) organizations only)   Any other benefit meeting the criteria of Reg. 1.501(c)(9)-3(b), (c), (d), or (e) ADDITIONAL PERMISSIBLE BENEFITS FOR COLLECTIVELY BARGAINED VEBAs ONLY Benefits provided, in the manner permitted by paragraphs (5) et. seq. of section 302(c) of the Labor Management Relations Act.

GX251-78-5355064	"M. BENEFITS PROVIDED BY LABOR ORGANIZATIONS 1. Introduction Without further elaboration, IRC 501(c)(5) provides for the exemption from federal income tax of labor, agricultural, or horticultural organizations. While IRC 501(c)(5) does not mention any individual benefits that an organization exempt thereunder may provide to its members, for the reasons explained below a labor organization may provide various benefits to its members either directly or indirectly through a separate entity that may itself qualify for IRC 501(c)(5) exemption. One purpose of this topic is to discuss the various types of benefits an exempt IRC 501(c)(5) labor organization may provide. As explained later, an IRC 501(c)(5) labor organization may pay many of the same types of benefits that are allowed a voluntary employees' beneficiary association exempt under IRC 501(c)(9) (VEBA). (See Appendix for a list of permissible and impermissible benefits under IRC 501(c)(9).) Another purpose of this topic is to discuss the circumstances under which an organization may qualify for exemption under IRC 501(c)(5) when it could not qualify under IRC 501(c)(9). Further, because VEBAs are subject to the nondiscrimination rules under IRC 505 and/or IRC 501(c)(9), and a more encompassing unrelated business income tax definition under IRC 512(a)(3), it is to an applicant's advantage to qualify for exemption under IRC 501(c)(5) instead of IRC 501(c)(9) in cases where it could qualify under both sections. No nondiscrimination rules as to benefits have been promulgated under IRC 501(c)(5), and the normal UBI definition applies to organizations exempt under IRC 501(c)(5). 2. Benefits - In General Reg. 1.501(c)(5)-1 provides that organizations contemplated by IRC 501(c)(5) are those that have no net earnings inuring to the benefit of any member, and have as their objects the betterment of the conditions of those engaged in labor, agriculture, or horticulture, the improvement of the grade of their products, and the development of a higher degree of efficiency in their respective occupations. As stated in Rev. Rul. 67-7, 1967-1 C.B. 137, an exempt labor organization is one that has as its primary purpose the representation of its members in such matters as wages, hours of labor, working conditions and economic benefits. Thus,   the threshold question in determining whether an organization that is providing a particular type of benefit is exempt as a labor organization under IRC 501(c)(5) is whether the organization meets this definitional requirement. If the organization providing benefits is not a ""labor organization,"" it will not qualify under IRC 501(c)(5) regardless of the type of benefits provided. The benefit provided may fundamentally further the purposes of a labor organization but that fact alone may not be sufficient to meet the definitional standard. Since being a labor organization is not one of the requirements for exemption under IRC 501(c)(9), this requirement is important when considering whether a VEBA or an organization providing VEBA-type benefits might qualify instead under IRC 501(c)(5). The source of funding with respect to such an organization may be an important element in determining whether it is a labor organization. The various IRC 501(c)(5) authorities discussed below state how the particular benefits are funded. Although there is no general rule on funding under IRC 501(c)(5), labor organizations have normally and traditionally been funded directly or indirectly by the membership. As Rev. Rul. 62-17, 1962-1 C.B. 87, puts it "". . . the legislative history of the provisions exempting labor organizations from income taxation indicates that labor organizations were exempted for the very reason that they operated, in part, as mutual benefit organizations. . . ."" The exempt organization described therein was funded by the members, which is normally the essence of mutuality. Contrast this with the method of funding VEBAs. Although, with respect to most benefits, VEBAs may be funded by employee-members, employers, or both, the vast majority are in fact funded by employers. Because many employer-funded VEBAs would have difficulty showing that they are labor organizations, it is doubtful that they could qualify under IRC 501(c)(5) even though they might be paying benefits permitted by that section. On the other hand, employee-funded organizations providing the VEBA-type benefits discussed below might be able to qualify under either IRC 501(c)(9) or (c)(5). 3. Specific Benefits For purposes of discussion, specific benefits are broken down between benefits that, in general, would not be permitted under IRC 501(c)(9), regardless of the circumstances, and those that could conceivably qualify under that section. A. Benefits Permissible Under IRC 501(c)(5) But Not Under IRC 501(c)(9) In general, the benefits in this part would not qualify under IRC 501(c)(9) whether funded by employees, employers, or both.   G.C.M. 35862 (June 20, 1974) in concluding that the conduct of an employee-funded pension plan is a permissible function of the exempt labor organization described therein, provides a good overview of the legislative history of IRC 501(c)(5) labor organizations. It states that while the legislative history of the Revenue Act of 1909, the original law providing for the exemption of labor organizations, does not refer to pension plans or specifically indicate whether Congress had such plans in mind in exempting labor organizations, at the time of enactment of the statute some unions had employee-funded pension plans and were paying pension benefits. In view of the legislative history of IRC 501(c)(5) and the historical practices and practical significance of pension programs, it is clear that an employee-funded pension plan is germane to the purpose of a labor organization, even though a pension plan, unlike death, sick, accident and similar benefits, is not an intermittent, contingent benefit based on the interruption of the member's earning power, but is, in part, an investment program enabling participants to set aside their own funds to be invested for retirement. Pension benefits are not proper benefits of an IRC 501(c)(9) organization because they are deferred compensation, which is an impermissible benefit. Reg. 1.501(c)(9)-3(f). If the pensions are employer-funded they would not be a permissible benefit under IRC 501(c)(5) as well. In order for an employer-funded pension plan to qualify for exemption, it must meet the tests of IRC 401. While an IRC 501(c)(9) organization can provide severance benefits if they are no more than twice annual compensation and are payable within the two years of termination of service, the benefits are not permissible if they may be payable at retirement. In such a case, the severance benefits are in actuality a form of deferred compensation similar to a pension. However, a labor organization, unlike a VEBA, is not precluded from paying a benefit that ambiguously straddles the line between a pension and a severance benefit. For example, G.C.M. 35790 (April 23, 1974) states that although there is no direct precedent for allowing a labor organization to provide a lump sum retirement or similar benefit for workers who ""resign from work,"" the payment of such funds is proper in the case under consideration because of the following unique facts: (1) The benefits were interrelated with the training benefits being provided to the union's younger members, and senior members could not take advantage of the training benefits although they contributed more financially to the union. For this reason the union was providing equivalent benefits to eligible   unemployed members or eligible members who retire or resign from work. (2) The benefits would be paid as a single, lump-sum payment from a previously existing unemployment fund; and (3) the fund from which the benefits were to be paid was accumulated exclusively from union dues or from other contributions from the union members, and not from outside sources. The benefits do not constitute a form of private inurement because the noninurement test under IRC 501(c)(5) does not proscribe all expenditures of union funds that result in monetary benefit to individual members, but only those benefits not recognized as being a proper activity of a labor organization. Rev. Rul. 75-473, 1975-2 C.B. 213, describes a labor organization established pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement between a labor union and an association of employers. The organization's primary purpose is to allocate work assignments among eligible union members by operating a dispatch hall. The dispatch hall is operated by union members, but it is under the supervision of a joint committee composed of an equal number of employer and union representatives. Its funding is likewise supplied on an equal basis by the parent labor union and the parent employer association. In addition to maintaining and operating the dispatch hall, the organization decides questions regarding rotation of work crews and extra men, and investigates and adjudicates grievances and disputes that arise in connection with the working conditions, the job performance of union members, and the operations of the dispatch hall. In holding that the organization qualifies for exemption, the revenue ruling states that an organization that is engaged in activities appropriate to a labor union, even though technically not a labor union itself, may qualify for IRC 501(c)(5) exemption if its activities are appropriate union activities and are conducted as a part of the proper activities of the parent labor organization, so that it is not merely an independent undertaking. According to the revenue ruling, the operation of a dispatch hall betters the conditions of those engaged in labor pursuits by providing them with a continuity of work assignments and orderly transfers from one work assignment to the next. The revenue ruling also states that providing facilities to investigate and adjudicate grievances also helps promote improved working conditions and more harmonious union and employer relations.   In contrast to the above revenue ruling, Rev. Rul. 77-46, 1977-1 C.B. 147, holds that a nonprofit organization established under a collective bargaining agreement between a union and an employers' association to enable members of the union to save money does not qualify for IRC 501(c)(5) exemption. The revenue ruling states that providing a savings plan is not a benefit for which labor organizations have traditionally been exempted from federal income taxation. B. Benefits Permissible Under Both IRC 501(c)(5) and IRC 501(c)(9) The benefits described in this part are of the types that are permissible under both IRC 501(c)(5) and IRC 501(c)(9). Rev. Rul. 62-17, 1962-1 C.B. 87, holds that exempt labor organizations may provide for employee-funded sick, death, accident, and other benefits for members because ""the legislative history of the provisions exempting labor organizations from income taxation indicates that labor organizations were exempted for the very reason that they operated, in fact, as mutual benefit organizations providing death, sick, accident, and similar benefits to their members."" These are essentially the same benefits that an IRC 501(c)(9) organization can provide. See Appendix for a list of permissible benefits that may be provided by an IRC 501(c)(9) organization. One type of benefit provided directly to individual members that is deemed to fundamentally further a labor organization's exempt purpose was addressed in G.C.M. 34634 (October 8, 1971). That G.C.M. concludes that employee-funded vacation benefits are benefits that may be paid by an exempt labor organization and that the separate organization established by an exempt labor organization to provide such benefits for its members could itself qualify for IRC 501(c)(5) exemption. It states that providing such benefits is an integral part of the overall health and welfare program of the exempt parent and that an activity carried on by such a subsidiary organization need not be the kind of activity that would allow a subsidiary organization to qualify independently for exemption but need only be the kind of activity necessary to the carrying out of the parent's exempt purposes. The same benefit would also be permissible for a VEBA under Reg. 1.501(c)(9)3(e). Under Reg. 1.501(c)(9)-3(e), a VEBA may provide employees with prepaid personal legal services only in two cases. Such benefits may be provided if paid to an IRC 501(c)(20) organization or trust as part of a qualified group services plan under IRC 120 or, alternatively, if provided by a collectively-bargained plan.   G.C.M. 38981 (January 26, 1983), citing Rev. Rul. 75-288, 1975-2 C.B. 212, and Rev. Rul. 74-596, 1974-2 C.B. 167, concludes that an organization providing prepaid legal services to members of a local tax exempt labor organization may qualify for IRC 501(c)(5) exemption. The organization was a group legal services plan established by the local and created by a vote of the membership. The organization was funded solely through membership dues, was not supported by employers, and was not connected with a qualified group services plan described in IRC 120, and, therefore, did not qualify for IRC 501(c)(9) exemption. Reg. 1.501(c)(9)-3(e) clearly allows a VEBA to provide employees with payments in the event of economic dislocation. G.C.M. 37424 (February 22, 1978) concludes that the operation of a hardship fund to pay benefits to members of an exempt labor organization who encounter financial or economic hardship is an appropriate labor organization activity within the scope of IRC 501(c)(5). According to the G.C.M., such a payment is made to a member who, because of financial emergency, is unable to support himself and his family and the provision of such benefits cannot properly be distinguished from the provision of death, sick, and accident benefits to members of a labor organization. Unlike the payments in Rev. Rul. 62-17 for death, sick, accident and similar benefits, the hardship fund was not financed solely by members' dues but was also funded from royalty and interest income. The G.C.M. concludes that funding may be provided from outside sources (investment income) because the advancement of the economic selfinterest of its members is basic to the purposes and activities of a labor organization and the noninurement test does not proscribe the general use of funds by a labor organization to advance the economic self-interest of its members in traditionally recognized manners. The G.C.M. states that making the unrelated business income tax applicable to labor organizations strongly suggests that Congress approved of labor organizations earning significant amounts of unrelated income without endangering their exempt status. It states further that allowing income from outside sources in the context of a labor organization implies that union members are permitted to obtain pecuniary benefits from their membership beyond their individual contributions. Reg. 1.501(c)(9)-3(e) provides that education or training benefits or courses (such as apprentice training programs) for members are permissible VEBA benefits. Such benefits are acceptable under IRC 501(c)(5) as well. G.C.M. 35790 (April 23, 1974) concludes that retraining and educational benefits are permissible labor organization activities because they enable union members to obtain new skills to change occupations because of technological innovation. Such educational benefits contribute to the betterment of the working conditions of union members   within the meaning of Reg. 1.501(c)(5)-1(a). It also concludes that the payment of unemployment benefits for laid-off workers is a common and proper activity of a labor organization. Rev. Rul. 67-7, 1967-1 C.B. 137, holds that an organization established by a labor union to provide strike and lockout benefits to its members qualifies for IRC 501(c)(5) exemption. The organization is funded by members. The revenue ruling states that strike benefits are directed to furthering a labor union's primary purpose of representing its members in matters of wages, hours of labor, working conditions, and economic benefits. Thus, certain types of benefits, such as strike benefits that are provided directly to individual members, are deemed to further fundamentally a labor organization's exempt purpose. However, see Rev. Rul. 76420, 1976-2 C.B. 153, which holds that an organization providing weekly income to its members in the event of a strike by the members' labor unions does not qualify for IRC 501(c)(5) exemption. The organization was controlled by private individuals and not by an exempt labor organization, and it had no authority to represent or speak for its members in matters relating to their employment, such as wages, etc. Although we have not seen any VEBAs offering strike and lockout benefits, it would appear to be a contingency that interrupts earning power within the meaning of Reg. 1.501(c)(9)-3(d)(2). C. Employer-Funding As the above discussion indicates, many VEBA-type benefits provided by a labor organization for its members are deemed to be in furtherance of an exempt IRC 501(c)(5) purpose when the benefits are employee-funded, that is, from such sources as membership dues, fees, and assessments. However, there is little published precedent regarding the extent to which employer funds can be used to finance employee benefits provided by an organization that would otherwise qualify for IRC 501(c)(5) exemption, especially if the organization would qualify for IRC 501(c)(9) exemption. It is apparent that some benefits may be financed in part by employers. Rev. Rul. 78-42, 1978-1 C.B. 158, holds that a nonprofit apprenticeship and training committee, a trust formed by a union and an employers' association of a particular industry in connection with a collective bargaining agreement, qualifies for IRC 501(c)(5) exemption. The committee conducted educational courses in various aspects of the trade for members. While the revenue ruling does not state how the program was funded, apparently both the union and the association financed the program.   There is also a lack of precedent with respect to employer-funding for nonVEBA type benefits, but it is clear from Rev. Rul. 75-474 that the operation of a dispatch hall may be financed by employers and the union. See also Rev. Rul. 775, 1977-1 C.B. 145, which holds that a trust formed pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement, funded and administered by employers in an industry to compensate a multi-employer steward under the union's direct control to settle disputes, investigate complaints, etc., qualifies for exemption as a labor organization. Because of the lack of published precedent with respect to employerfunded benefits, IRM 7664.1 is applicable, and cases not described in the above revenue rulings should be referred to the National Office. 4. Other Considerations A. Separate Entity While an exempt IRC 501(c)(5) labor organization may provide the permissible benefits described above directly to its members, it may also choose to establish a separate entity to provide such benefits and the separate entity may qualify for IRC 501(c)(5) exemption. As previously indicated, the provision of vacation benefits by a subsidiary of an exempt labor organization to the members of the union is an integral part of the overall health and welfare program of the exempt parent. An activity carried on by such a subsidiary organization need not be the kind of activity that would allow a subsidiary organization to qualify independently for exemption (if the activity were not conducted for the parent) but need only be the kind of activity necessary to the carrying out of the parent's exempt purposes (i.e., an ""integral part"" of the parent's exempt activities). In Portland Cooperative Labor Temple Association, 39 B.T.A. 450 (1939), acq. 19391 (Part I) C.B. 28, the Board of Tax Appeals held that an organization that was owned and controlled by labor unions to operate a ""labor temple"" for the unions qualified for IRC 501(c)(5) exemption because the organization's activities were appropriate union activities and were conducted as a part of the parent labor organization's own activities. The Board held that the term ""labor organization"" must be broadly construed, and that what one labor organization could do for itself several should be allowed to do collectively through a corporate entity they create. (This rationale should be applied with caution, however, particularly outside the IRC 501(c)(5) area. See, for example, the line of cases dealing with hospital laundries under IRC 501(c)(3).) In addition, with respect to welfare benefits, section 403 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) requires that a separate trust be   established to administer employee welfare benefit plans defined by section 3(1) of the Act. Therefore, labor organizations wishing to comply with ERISA will establish separate trusts through which member welfare benefits will be paid to members. B. Investment Income As previously indicated, the funding for hardship benefits to members can be provided from outside sources, such as royalty and interest income. As explained above, most labor organization benefits are funded by members and, therefore, normally financing such benefits from investment income is proper if it is derived from members' dues and assessments. C. Agricultural Organizations It must be emphasized, however, that while the legislative history indicates that labor organizations have historically operated in fact as mutual benefit organizations, this is not the case with exempt IRC 501(c)(5) agricultural organizations. The Service has consistently taken the position that ""bettering the conditions of those engaged in such pursuits,"" means bettering the conditions of agriculture in general rather than benefiting the individual members specifically. Thus, the provision of individual benefits by an IRC 501(c)(5) agricultural organization to its members violates the prohibition against inurement. Therefore, the holding of Rev. Rul. 67-251, 1967-2 C.B. 196, i.e., that the provision of welfare aid and financial assistance to the members of an IRC 501(a)(6) organization constitutes prohibited inurement, would also apply to IRC 501(c)(5) agricultural and horticultural organizations.   APPENDIX Reg. 1.501(c)(9)-3 describes in considerable detail the kinds of permissible benefits that an IRC 501(c)(9) organization may provide to its members. According to this regulation, ""other benefits"" include only those benefits that are similar to life, sick, or accident benefits. It states that a benefit is similar to these benefits if (1) it is intended to safeguard or improve the health of a member or a member's dependents, or (2) it protects against a contingency that interrupts or impairs a member's earning power. There have been few developments in the last several years concerning what benefits may be provided by an organization described in IRC 501(c)(9). Generally, the discussions in the 1983, 1984, and 1986 CPE Topics are still applicable.

Statement of the Case On September 23, 1988, the Employer, David Howard of California, submitted an ETA-750 for the Alien, Carlos Humberto Cristales, to fill the position of Garment Sample Cutter (AF 35). The job duties are as follows: Cuts material to company standards, works with materials and must have full knowledge of polyester knits and/or synthetic knits to name a few. Works with approximately 15 different materials each season of the year. Places marker (sample) on top of selected material, traces sample and cuts around marker achieving the garment sample by using hand scissors. Cuts samples for dresses, jackets, skirts and pants for various fit sizes. Bundles all cut pieces and transfers them to the sewing department to be completed. Must work very carefully with materials. (AF 35). The job requires forty hours per week 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. at $7.90 per hour with time and a half for overtime. In addition, two years of experience in the job offered is required (AF 35). The job also includes special requirements that the applicant ""[m]ust work Monday thru Friday. Willing to work Saturdays, if requested by employer. Must show legal right to work in U.S."" (AF 35). On November 16, 1988, the Certifying Officer (CO) issued a Notice of Findings proposing to deny labor certification. Specifically, the CO requested that the Employer attempt to recruit U.S. workers from the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union (ILGWU or Union) pursuant to 20 C.F.R.  656.21(b)(4), which ""has asked for the opportunity to refer U.S. workers to current job openings"" (AF 29-32). On December 21, 1988, the Employer submitted its rebuttal letter stating that it had fully complied with the recruitment regulations but:  Labor certification for aliens is governed by section 212(a)(14) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C.  1182(a)(14), and Title 20, Part 656 of the Code of Federal Regulations, 20 C.F.R. Part 656. Unless otherwise noted, all regulations cited in this Decision and Order are contained in Title 20, Part 656. USDOL/OALJ REPORTER PAGE 2  2   We are being asked to find applicants through the Union. We cannot now understand this decision since our company does not have a Union and we have never contacted them to recruit workers in the past. (AF 27). The CO issued a Final Determination on December 30, 1988 denying labor certification (AF 25-26). The CO concluded that labor certification could not be issued as the Employer refused to take the ""opportunity to find U.S. workers for the job"" through the ILGWU (AF 26). By letter dated January 30, 1989, the Employer requested review of the Final Determination (AF 22). In its request, the Employer states: Our appeal is based on the fact that Mr. Nelson has imposed an unfair condition upon our company. Our company is non-union and we hope to keep it that way. To require the David Howard Company to work with a union in filling this job opening is, of course, an invitation to the union to become involved with all of our hiring practices. (AF 22). On September 28, 1989, the CO withdrew his denial of labor certification and issued a Supplemental NOF stating that ""it is evident that the Employer either did not understand our previous Notice of Findings, or the Notice was not clear"" (AF 19). The CO requested that the Employer reconsider its decision not to recruit through the ILGWU and noted the following: At the time the ILGWU asked for the opportunity to refer workers to labor certification applications, Steven Nutter, ILGWU Regional Director, was asked whether referrals would be made to non-union firms. He stated that he would rather see his members working for non-union firms than be unemployed. There is no expectation that the member, if available, and if hired by the employer, would engage in any union organizing activity at the non-union employer's place of business. (AF 19). The Employer submitted its letter of rebuttal on October 26, 1989 (AF 16-17), stating: Please be advised that I understood your Notice of Findings completely, but be aware that our company has never contacted any union for hiring personnel. This company wants to keep this policy in effect. *** USDOL/OALJ REPORTER PAGE 3   Again, please be aware that the David Howard Company has never used any union to recruit employees. *** Moreover, we do not want to take the risk of employing someone from the ILGWU because he might dive into our affairs, exciting our workers to engage in the union activities. (AF 16-17). The CO issued his second Final Determination on November 14, 1989, wherein labor certification was denied because the Employer failed to attempt to seek referrals through the ILGWU as directed by the CO pursuant to 20 C.F.R.  656.24(b)(2)(i) (AF 11-13). The Employer filed a Request for Review by letter dated November 29, 1989 (AF 6), and the matter was docketed before the Board on April 10, 1990. On May 8, 1990, the Employer filed his Statement of Position arguing that the CO's request that it contact the Union was ""not only unreasonable, but unjust"" as it ""is a dissembled way of opening the door of our business to the Union."" Due to the novelty of the issue presented, the Board decided to consider the case en banc without a prior panel decision. By Notice and Order dated February 11, 1992, the Board requested that the Employer file a Statement of Intent to Proceed and invited the filing of supplemental and amicus briefs from interested parties. By letter dated February 20, 1992, the Employer filed a written Statement of Intent to Proceed with the Board. A supplemental brief was subsequently filed by the Solicitor on behalf of the CO, and the International Ladies' Garmet Workers' Union, AFL-CIO filed an amicus curiae brief.3 Discussion and Conclusions The issue presented for consideration by the Board in its February 11, 1992 Notice and Order is as follows: Whether 20 C.F.R.  656.21(b)(5) limits a Certifying Officer's discretion to require an employer to recruit for an opening through a local union. In other words, if an employer documents that union recruitment is not normal and customary in the area or industry, may the Certifying Officer, nevertheless, require union recruitment pursuant to 20 C.F.R.  656.24(b)(2)(i).  Evidence in correspondence which was considered on appeal. 20 Co., 88-INA-49 (Mar. 13, 1992). USDOL/OALJ REPORTER  3  the form of an affidavit from Steven Nutter of the ILGWU and not in the record upon which the CO's denial was based cannot be C.F.R.  656.26(b)(4) and 656.27(c). See O'Malley Glass & Millwork 1989). See also, e.g., Cappricio's Restaurant , 90-INA-480 (Jan. 7, PAGE 4   The regulation at 20 C.F.R.  656.21(b)(5) provides that ""[i]f unions are customarily used as a recruitment source in the area or industry, the employer shall document that they were unable to refer U.S. workers."" 20 C.F.R.  656.21(b)(5). The regulation at 20 C.F.R.  656.24(b)(2)(i) requires that ""[t]he Certifying Officer shall determine if there are other appropriate sources of workers where the employer should have recruited or might be able to recruit U.S. workers."" 20 C.F.R.  656.24(b)(2)(i). The Employer argues that it does not customarily recruit through the Union and further maintains that any worker from the ILGWU would engage in unionizing activity at the Employer's place of business. Consequently, the Employer asserts that recruitment through the Union is improper in this case. The CO argues that 20 C.F.R.  656.21(b)(5) does not limit recruitment through the union to those cases in which it is customary; rather, it is reasonable to request such recruitment where, as here, the Union provides an additional source of U.S. workers and has indicated a willingness to refer workers to non-union jobs. Indeed, the CO argues that 20 C.F.R.  656.24(b)(2) imposes a duty ""to insure that there are no U.S. workers available for the job."" CO's Brief (CB) at 6. Citing Intel Corp., 87-INA-570 (Dec. 11, 1987) (en banc), the CO argued that his request was not arbitrary as he has ""knowledge of an additional source of U.S. workers who are familiar with the industry and qualified for the job opportunity."" CB at 10. The ILGWU likewise argues that the CO's request that the Employer seek referrals through the Union was proper. It asserts that 20 C.F.R.  656.21(b)(5) requires that the Employer attempt to recruit through the Union if it is a customary source of workers in the area or industry and states the following: [20 C.F.R.  656.21(b)(5) ] appears in the section of the regulations governing an employer's obligation to document industry recruitment efforts (and) has nothing to do with the separate and independent authority of the Certifying Officer under 20 C.F.R.  656.24(b)(2)(i) to require additional recruitment efforts if the employer's initial voluntary efforts are unsuccessful. ILGWU Brief (IB) at 14. In addition, although the ILGWU concedes that the Act's 1990 amendments requiring union participation are not retroactive, it nevertheless urges that ""they express anew a strong policy in favor of the broadest possible input from any and all sources concerning worker availability and other labor market issues."" IB at 15. The rulemaking history of Part 656 provides that ""[t]he regulations at 20 C.F.R. Part 656 set forth the factfinding process designed to develop information sufficient to support the granting or denial of labor certification."" 45 Fed. Reg. 83,926 (1980). The purpose of the regulations ""is to assure an adequate test of the availability of U.S. workers to perform the work"" 45 Fed. Reg. 83,926. The provisions at 20 C.F.R.  656.21 form the core of the ""factfinding process"" and guide the employer as to the required, minimum documentation to support a finding that the labor market was adequately tested. Thus, the plain language of section 656.21(b)(5) requires that, if unions serve as a customary USDOL/OALJ REPORTER PAGE 5   source of recruitment in the area or industry, then the employer must document that the union was ""unable to refer U.S. workers."" In its rebuttal, the Employer asserts that it does not customarily seek referrals from the Union.4 Assuming that union recruitment is not customary in the Employer's ""area or industry,"" then the provisions at 20 C.F.R.  656.21(b)(5) are inapplicable and the Employer would normally not be required to attempt recruitment through the Union. Section 656.21(b)(5), however, does not limit a CO's authority to consider whether an attempt at union recruitment is nevertheless necessary pursuant to 20 C.F.R.  656.24(b)(2)(i). Indeed, Intel Corp., 87-INA-570 (Dec. 11, 1987) (en banc) indicates that the CO has the authority to require additional recruitment efforts under 20 C.F.R.  656.24(b)(2)(i). In that decision, the Board held that the CO may ""require additional advertising or recruiting (upon) offering a reasonable explanation of why the employer's advertisements and/or recruitment were inadequate and how the additional recruitment efforts recommended by the Certifying Officer would be appropriate."" Under the facts of this case, the CO has documented that the ILGWU is a source of U.S. workers in the Employer's industry which has requested to refer workers to the non-union Employer. To effectuate the Act's purpose of assuring an adequate test of U.S. worker availability, it is reasonable for the CO to require recruitment through the union pursuant to the provisions of 20 C.F.R.  656.24(b)(2)(i). Indeed, the plain language of section 656.24(b)(2)(i) temporally follows the Employer's required recuitment efforts under section 656.21, as it states that the CO ""shall look at the documented results of the Employer's and the job service office's recruitment efforts, and shall determine if there are other appropriate sources of workers."" 20 C.F.R.  656.24(b)(2)(i). It is determined, therefore, that the CO reasonably requested that the Employer attempt to recruit U.S. workers through the union. The Employer's assertions that recruitment through the ILGWU in this instance would be tantamount to ""an invitation to the union to become involved with all of our hiring practices"" or that an ILGWU referral may ""delve into our affairs, exciting our workers to engage in union activities"" is misplaced. Requiring the Employer to attempt to recruit through the Union for purposes of obtaining permanent labor certification for Carlos Cristales does not translate into a requirement that the Employer recruit through the Union or that the Union participate in its hiring practices outside the labor certification process. Disfavor of unions or union workers does not relieve an employer of regulatory requirements to conduct a fair test of the labor market.  The fact that this particular Employer does not customarily recruit through the Union is scant evidence for purposes of section 656.21(b)(5) which addresses union recruitment in the ""area or industry."" However, as the CO cites a violation of 20 C.F.R.  656.24(b)(2)(i) and does not allege that union recruitment is customary, the Board declines to decide this issue here. See also C.F.R.  656.21(b)(4). USDOL/OALJ REPORTER PAGE 6  4   Since the Employer has failed to inquire through the Union for referrals at the request of the CO, labor certification was properly denied. ORDER IT IS ORDERED that the Certifying Officer's denial of labor certification is AFFIRMED . Washington, D.C. For the Board:  LAWRENCE BRENNER Administrative Law Judge  Joel R. Williams, Administrative Law Judge, dissenting: The rules of construction generally applicable to statutes are applied also in construing regulations. KCMC, Inc. v. Federal Commerce Commission, 600 F.2d 546, 549 (5th Cir.1979). It is a principle of statutory construction that individual sections of a single statute should be construed together. Erlenbaugh v. United States, 409 U.S. 239, 243, 93 S.CT. 477, 480 (1972) And, as held in Clifford F. MacEvoy Co. v. United States, 322 U.S. 102, 107, 64 S.Ct. 890, 894 (1944): ""However, inclusive may be the general language of a statute, it 'will not be held to apply to a matter specifically dealt with in another part of the same enactment. * * * Specific terms prevail over the general in the same or another statute which otherwise might be controlling.' "" (citation omitted) In light of these principles, I maintain that 656.24(b)(2)(i) does not operate as a separate standard by which to judge the effectiveness of an employer's recruitment efforts. Rather, it must be construed in conjunction with the recruitment efforts that an employer is required to make under  56.21(b). Furthermore, all parts of 656.21(b) must be construed together with its specific terms taking precedence over its general terms. Sections 656.21(b)(4) & (5) both deal with recruitment through unions. However, clearly 656.21(b)(4) is the more general of the two as it deals with various sources of recruitment. Section 656.21(b)(5) on the other hand deals only with recruitment through labor unions and only requires that an employer use this recruitment source if it is customary to do so in the area or industry. Consequently, it is my view that the Employer in the instant case was only obligated to recruit through a labor union if it is customary to do so in the Los Angeles area for its industry. If the Employer had rejected a qualified job applicant because of his or her union membership, I would agree to deny certification on the basis of an unlawful rejection of a U.S. worker. That is not the issue here, however. The CO never addressed 656.21(b)(5) in his NOF and, consequently, the Employer was never given the opportunity to rebut by showing that union recruitment was not USDOL/OALJ REPORTER PAGE 7   customary for his industry in the area. Nevertheless, as the CO conceded in his brief that union recruitment was not customary, I would grant certification in this case.  USDOL/OALJ REPORTER  PAGE 8"

GX261-67-10025488	"105th Congress Addresses Working Conditions  The rapid pace of technological change has created a workplace that looks little like that of our ancestors early this century. Moreover, the workplace of tomorrow will be tied less to a single physical location; the remote electronic workplace will be commonplace. The wide range of labor legislation being debated in the 105th Congress reflects the expansion of labor issues beyond the narrow bounds of the factory floor.  BY WILLIAM J. WIATROWSKI  William J. Wiatrowski is an economist in the Division of Compensation Data Analysis and Planning, Bureau of Labor Statistics. Telephone (202) 606-6255.  roadly defined, compensation and working conditions are two aspects of the employment relationship about which employers and employees may negotiate or debate. These items are typically the subject of collective bargaining and are also topics for legislative action. This article explores working conditions: What is meant by this broad category and what actions are being considered in the 105th Congress? In U.S. labor law, working conditions are recognized as an appropriate subject for collective bargaining. Under the titles NorrisLa Guardia, Wagner, and TaftHartley, named after those who championed these laws in the 1930s and 1940s, these labor laws established the principle of collective bargaining for wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment. (See box for details of these laws.) Perhaps not envisioned by such leaders as New York's Senator Robert Wagner in the 1930s,  B  ""other terms and conditions of employment"" now extend to such topics as ergonomic equipment designed to limit the risk of carpaltunnel syndrome, drug testing, and use of polygraph tests. Proposed legislation in the 105th Congress addresses a wide variety of working conditions.  Union-management activities The National Labor Relations Act, the Labor-Management Relations Act, and subsequent labor law establish the right of employees to elect representation and to bargain collectively. These rights are frequently the subjects of legislation, often designed to modify or clarify existing procedures. The protections provided in these laws are available to nearly all workers, not just members of labor unions who now make up about 15 percent of the labor force, down from a post-World War II high of about 25 percent. (See table 1.) 28  Compensation and Working Conditions Winter 1997   Table 1.

NOTE: Beginning with 1970 data, union member data include individuals in public employee associations and professional organizations, such as the National Education Association. Prior to 1970 data, such individuals were not included. Beginning with 1985 data, the labor force includes all employed wage and salary workers.  Several proposals before Congress would require more disclosure by unions of their activities and finances. The Union Members' Right to Know Act would require greater financial disclosure of spending for political purposes. Proponents of this measure argue that union members are often unaware of the use of their dues. They further argue that use of union funds for ""education"" and ""issue advocacy"" may in fact be for political purposes.1 The measure would require the disclosure of funds used for political activities, political candidates and organizations, and affiliated political action committees and the candidates these committees assist. Another means of getting at similar issues is the Membership Dues Disclosure and Deductibility Act, which would require unions to abide by the same disclosure rules as other tax-exempt organizations. Unions would generally have to disclose to their members how much of their collected dues are directed to political and lobbying activities. In addition, the bill would allow union  members to deduct the non-political portion of their dues from their income for tax purposes. Under current law, union dues must be combined with other ""miscellaneous expenses"" in determining deductibility, and only total amounts of miscellaneous expenses above 2 percent of adjusted gross income may be deducted.2 An alternative legislative proposal would prohibit the use of automatic paycheck deductions to collect any funds used for activities other than collective bargaining, contract administration, and/or grievance procedures on behalf of employees. Union dues ""check-off""3 is the system of allowing union members to pay union dues through payroll deductions that are withheld by employers and paid to the union. Concern arises when labor unions use dues to finance political activities without the notification or consent of those from whom the money is collected. A 1988 Supreme Court ruling prohibits unions from assessing fees ""beyond those necessary to finance collective bargaining activities."" The ruling stems from Taft-Hartley language that authorizes the deduction of only those fees and dues necessary to ""perform the duties of an exclusive representative of the employees in dealing with the employer on labormanagement issues.""4 Employee rights stemming from this case, known as Beck rights after the name of the party in the case, allow employees to request that dues to be used for political purposes not be deducted from their pay. However, proponents of this legislation have cited anecdotal evidence of abuse, such as the story of a North Carolina man.5 A worker was harassed when he objected to the use of his union dues for political purposes. The union posted notices discouraging workers from objecting to the political use of their union dues and also posted the name of the worker. He was subject to threats and intimidation by fellow union  members. The proposed legislation would require unions to notify workers of how dues are being spent and of their Beck rights. Another proposal in the 105th Congress regarding union activities is a bill to limit the use of official time by Federal employee unions. Official time is paid time during which union officials are allowed to perform union functions, such as explaining contract provisions or working with an employee on a grievance. There has been concern raised about the use of official time by Federal employees for lobbying purposes, including lobbying Congress. Such a practice results in Federal employees being paid Federal funds to lobby Congress. The bill would outlaw this practice. Among other legislation, the Public Safety Employer-Employee Cooperation Act would grant firefighters and law enforcement officers fundamental collective bargaining rights. At present, certain collective bargaining rights are not available to these workers due to the nature of their work. This Act would provide only certain collective bargaining rights, and would preserve the restriction against strikes.  TEAM Act The Teamwork for Employees and Managers (TEAM) Act would allow companies to use employeemanagement teams to address a broad range of workplace issues, such as productivity, flexible work schedules, worker safety, employee benefits, and more. The National Labor Relations Board has ruled that such teams, under current law, may be considered an unfair labor practice.6 Such teams have been construed by the NLRB as employer support for organizations that represent workers regarding wages, benefits, and working conditions, an activity that is the exclusive purview of labor organizations. The TEAM Act would amend the National Labor Relations Act to permit employers  29 Compensation and Working Conditions Winter 1997   Table 2.

It is calculated by multiplying the number of injuries and illnesses (or lost workdays) times the total hours worked by all employees during the calendar year. That product is divided by 200,000 (the base for 100 full-time equivalent workers working 40 hours per week, 50 weeks per year). - Data not available.  encourage employers to interfere with an employee's right to choose their own representation. The contention is that employers would be able to create and disband committees at will, hand-pick members, dictate the agenda, and pre-determine the outcome. Because the teams would be determining working conditions, a legitimate subject of collective bargaining by the elected representatives of the employees, in essence the workers' right to choose their own representative would be ignored.7 The proposed legislation is generally applicable to nonunion employers. In a unionized environment, establishing workplace teams is not an unfair labor practice, as long as participation on the teams is determined in conjunction with the union. In such a case, the union is the sole and duly elected representative of the employees, and as such is the only organization that can determine employee representation on a team. In the case of a nonunion company, or a unionized company where team members are not chosen in conjunction with the union, teams violate the workers' rights to choose their representatives. The legislation would legalize these teams.  ""to establish, assist, maintain or participate in"" organizations for employees. An identical bill was passed by the 104th Congress, but was vetoed by President Clinton. Proponents, typically employer groups, argue that the change in the law is necessary to promote employee participation in the workplace, which can go a long way toward fostering cooperation and improving productivity. They also argue that labor-management partnerships have been known to work well. There are muchpublicized examples of employeemanagement teams that have reassessed the work process and instituted improvements. Opponents, including organized labor, claim that the bill would  Safety and health Safety and health issues are an important part of working conditions. In 1970, Congress passed and President Nixon signed into law the Occupational Safety and Health Act. This act established standards for safe working environments, compliance requirements, penalties for noncompliance, and reporting requirements to track the extent of occupational illness and injury. The Act promises every American worker the right to a safe job. Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics on the prevalence of workplace injuries, illnesses, and deaths have been collected since the mid-1970s, in part to comply with reporting requirements in the law. These data indicate an overall reduction in the  prevalence of workplace injuries and illnesses in the past 2 decades. (See table 2.) Among the current issues regarding workplace safety and health is the amount of regulation to impose on small businesses. For example, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the agency of the Department of Labor established to perform the regulatory functions of the law, recently proposed a rule restricting the use of methylene chloride (used to strip paint and clean metal parts, among other things). This action is said to cut the risk of cancer among construction workers, but it is controversial. In the view of opponents of the rule, studies have yielded inconsistent results. OSHA has recommended use of a less-toxic substitute, although industry officials indicate such substitution will be costly and may result in worker exposure to other hazards.8 The proposed rule largely affects construction and related industries, which are dominated by small employers. (In 1995, two-thirds of all construction firms employed fewer than 5 workers, and 92 percent employed fewer than 20.9 ) This has led to concern in Congress about the amount of regulation imposed upon small employers. In 1996, Congress enacted the Small Business Regulatory Fairness Act, requiring Congress to review certain new regulations affecting small businesses prior to adoption.10 OSHA must comply with this requirement before it can issue a final rule. Furthermore, legislation has been introduced in Congress to prevent final implementation of the rule.  Conditions for awarding Federal contracts The Clinton Administration has proposed changes to contracting procedures to encourage Federal agencies to select contractors based on prior labor relations and employment practices. The changes would: 30  Compensation and Working Conditions Winter 1997    Require that contractors have a satisfactory record in labor relations and employment practices before they can bid on Government contracts;   Prohibit the Federal Government, as part of any contract, from paying expenses associated with violations of labor laws; and   Require that all Federal agencies consider ""project labor agreements"" for Federal construction projects. A project labor agreement (PLA) is a required set of labor standards imposed on contractors for the life of a project. PLA's generally cover wages and working conditions, mandate that all employees join a union and pay dues, designate the union as the sole representative of the employees, and require payment into union benefit funds. Included in the agreement is the guarantee that projects will be built without strikes, lockouts, or similar disruptions. Many Federal, State, and local construction projects have used PLA's. Several States have executive orders authorizing the use of PLA's for State-funded projects when they promote the efficient, timely, and safe completion of a project. PLA's do not exclude any contractor from bidding on a project, even if they have never been a signatory to a collective bargaining agreement. Also, every qualified worker is eligible to be employed on a PLA project, regardless of whether he or she has ever been a union member. However, according to PLA opponents, in nonunion settings PLA's require firms ""to organize work around the rigid and ... archaic lines that define each union's jurisdiction,""11 such as specific trades or specialties. This often requires such employers to hire more workers than they might otherwise hire for a project of  similar size. Consequently, nonunion firms do not often bid on such work.12 Even in unionized situations, opponents argue that the requirements of the PLA may make it necessary to hire additional workers and to alter wages, benefits, or other working conditions. Such agreements can also lead to the situation where an employee works under one set of compensation and working conditions while doing work under the PLA and under different rules while employed on other jobs.13 Recently, the administration agreed not to issue an executive order. Instead, a ""presidential memorandum,"" encouraging Federal agencies to follow these rules in establishing contracts, is expected. This will have the same effect as the executive order, except that the memorandum will lapse when President Clinton leaves office, while an executive order would have remained in effect unless specifically rescinded by a future President. At the same time, there is also legislation pending in Congress to overturn the actions of the President.   Disadvantaged Youth Employment and Training Opportunities--for at-risk, low-income teens and young adults;   Adult Employment and Training Opportunities--for disadvantaged adults and dislocated workers; and   Adult Education and Literacy--for low-income people to obtain job skills, geared especially for transition from welfare to work. In general, the training provided through these programs is offered outside the work setting. Often, this training is part of a job-search process, such as that provided through State employment security agencies. Employers also provide training to their employees, although the availability and type of this training can vary widely. A 1993 Bureau of Labor Statistics survey of employer-provided training among private sector employers indicated that 71 percent of establishments offered training to their employees.14 Larger establishments almost universally provided training while it was less prevalent among smaller establishments. The most frequently offered type of training was job-skills training, to provide skills needed to perform a particular task. Other prevalent types of training covered orientation, safety, and health. Fewer than half of all employers provided job skills training, however, suggesting the need for additional training outside the work setting. (See table 3.)  Job training In May 1997, the House of Representatives passed the Education, Training and Literacy Enhancement Act. This bill consolidates 50 Federal employment, job training, and literacy programs into 3 block grants to the States. The bill is similar to a bill in the 104th Congress that got sidetracked over concerns that the Federal Government might take too large a role in vocational education. This year's bill does not include the disputed vocational education provisions. The intent of the bill is to coordinate existing independent training programs. It creates a onestop career center, centralizes many local job training and employment search services in one location, and allows States to target funds based on their local needs. The bill establishes 3 block grant programs:  Sweatshops In April 1997, President Clinton announced the formation of an Apparel Industry Partnership intended to reassure consumers that exploited workers do not make clothes and shoes. Included in the partnership are garment manufacturers, unions, human rights organiza-  31 Compensation and Working Conditions Winter 1997   Table 3.

Manufacturers who participate in the partnership are allowed to place ""no sweatshop"" labels in their products, place signs in stores, or otherwise advertise their compliance. At the same time, a Child Labor Free Consumer Information Act has been introduced in Congress. This bill would establish a ""seal of approval"" or logo that manufacturers could display if they meet child labor standards. Members of President Clinton's Partnership are prohibited from using prison or other forced labor, prohibited from employing children under age 15, required to pay minimum or prevailing wages, required to limit hours worked in a week to 60, and required to provide at least 1 day off per week. Companies that join the Partnership must also ensure that their contractors and suppliers comply with these requirements. The agreement calls for  internal monitoring by manufacturers plus independent external monitoring. Some manufacturing groups argue that the Partnership advocates standards that already exist; human rights groups argue that the standards do not go far enough to help exploited workers. Other concerns are that counterfeit ""no sweatshop"" labels will begin to appear and that employers will find ways to circumvent the prohibitions.  Other labor issues Other labor-related topics in the 105th Congress include the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, which prohibits employers from making decisions about hiring, firing, promoting, or compensating an employee based on sexual orientation; the Workplace Fairness Act, which prohibits employment discrimination on any basis (an  individual must be judged solely on their merit); and the Volunteer Firefighter and Rescue Squad Worker Protection Act and other related proposals, which allow such workers to volunteer their services without running afoul of wage and hour laws. The rapid pace of technological change has created a workplace that looks little like the workplace of the 1930s and the 1940s, when many of our labor laws were first established. Moreover, the workplace of tomorrow will be tied less to a single physical location; the remote electronic workplace may be commonplace. The wide range of labor legislation being debated in the 105th Congress reflects the expansion of labor issues beyond the narrow bounds of the factory floor. Changes in working conditions in the future will necessitate the constant review of these laws.  Compensation and Working Conditions Winter 1997  32   Details of Labor Law in the United States The foundations of American labor law were largely established in the 1930s and 1940s, beginning with the Norris-La Guardia Act in 1932. (Prior to that date, certain anti-trust laws had some effect on labor-management relations in this country and a few industry-specific labor laws, most notably the Railway Labor Act of 1926, were in place.) Norris-La Guardia came about during a period of high unemployment at the height of the Great Depression. The main purpose of the Act was to limit the authority of courts to issue injunctions against certain labor activities. The Act limited the power of the courts to stop workers and labor organizations from engaging in several activities, including peaceful picketing, peaceable assembly, organizational picketing, and payment of strike benefits. In essence, the Act recognized the rights of workers to associate, organize, and choose representation. However, there were no restrictions placed on employer efforts to stop labor activities. Such restrictions were put into place in 1935 by the National Labor Relations Act, or the Wagner Act. This Act specifically banned a set of management actions that constituted unfair labor practices. These now-prohibited unfair practices included:  Restraining, coercing, or interfering with employees in their right to organize;  Dominating or interfering with the formation or administration of labor unions;  Discriminating in hiring, tenure, or working conditions to encourage or discourage union membership or activities;  Discriminating against employees who had filed unfair labor practices, as designated by the Act; and  Refusing to bargain collectively with the duly chosen representatives of the employees. The Wagner Act was modified in 1947 by the Labor-Management Relations Act, commonly referred to as the Taft-Hartley Act. This law largely left unchanged the unfair employer practices of the Wagner Act, but introduced additional unfair labor practices applicable to employers and unions. The prohibited union practices included restraining or coercing employees regarding certain collective bargaining rights; causing an employer to discriminate against an employee to encourage or discourage union membership; refusing to bargain in good faith; and related activities. Taft-Hartley also specifically included language recognizing employees as individuals, including an individual's right to present grievances directly to the employer, without the intervention of a union. More recent labor law is largely concerned with reporting and disclosure requirements for both employers and labor unions. Today, the rights of employers and employees are still largely governed by the provisions of the Wagner and Taft-Hartley Acts.  33 Compensation and Working Conditions Winter 1997   --ENDNOTES-- 1 ""Christensen Bill Seeks More Union Spending Disclosure,"" Congress Daily, The National Journal, April 14, 1996, pp. 2-3. 2 Under current Federal tax law, individuals who itemize deductions may include union dues as part of their miscellaneous deductions. Other such deductions include unreimbursed job-related expenses (such as unreimbursed job-related travel), tax preparation fees, and certain investment expenses. Only expenses in this category in excess of 2 percent of adjusted gross income (total income minus certain items such as contributions to individual retirement accounts and alimony payments) may be included in an individual's total itemized deductions. 3 Check-off is the procedure of employers withholding union dues from employee pay and remitting those dues to the union. This practice was specifically addressed in the Taft-Hartley Act of 1947. At that time, ""automatic"" check-off, without the consent of employees, was prohibited. The law required unions to obtain the written consent of employees to have union dues withheld from their pay. 4 The Supreme Court ruling considers several  reasons why fees for non-collective-bargaining activities violate worker rights. It also makes distinctions between union members and non-members who nonetheless must pay dues. See Communications Workers v Beck, 487 US 735 (1988). 5 Congressman Harris W. Fawell, 13th District of Illinois described this story, in a letter to colleagues on April 23, 1997. 6 Since 1992, the National Labor Relations Board has ruled in approximately 20 cases that worker-management teams were in violation of the National Labor Relations Act prohibition against company-dominated unions. Many worker-management teams do exist, although only a few have been challenged. Typically, teams are challenged when they are considered an interference to worker attempts to organize and vote for union representation. 7 Under current labor law, employees have the sole right to choose their representatives to bargain for ""terms and conditions of employment."" Because the duly elected representatives of all employees do not select team members, the teams violate the employee's right to choose their own representatives.  8 NAM Briefing, National Association of Manufacturers, April 21, 1997, p. 6. 9 Employment and Wages Annual Averages, 1995, Bureau of Labor Statistics, Bulletin 2483, December 1996. 10 The Small Business Regulatory Fairness Act of 1996 requires Federal agencies to consider the special needs and concerns of small entities, such as small businesses, small local governments, and farmers, when regulations are drafted.

Introduction The soccer ball industry of Pakistan, principally concentrated in the city of Sialkot, has been under scrutiny in recent years for employing child workers. Manyreports describe children stitching soccer balls in small rural workshops or in homes.  1  The widespread coverage of children stitching soccer balls galvanized consumers,labor and religious groups and government officials to call for a stop to this practice.In June 1996, the U. S. Secretary of Labor and members of Congress helped launch the  FoulBall  campaign to ensure that soccer balls used by American children arestitched by adults and not children.  2 The public attention led U. S. importers to enter into an agreement with Paki-stani manufacturers, the ILO and UNICEF to stop using child labor.  3  More recently, public attention has focused on the use of child labor in India's soccer ball industry, leading to negotiations between Indian soccer ball manufacturers, exporters, NGOsand international organizations to develop a code of conduct prohibiting child labor. In addition, individual companies have taken steps to assure consumers thattheir products are not made by children. They have done so by revising their production process or creating child labor labels. For instance, Reebok has centralized all its soccer ball production in a new factory.  4  Nike also changed its manufacturing process in Pakistan by creating new stitching centers in order to better ensure chil-dren are not stitching Nike soccer balls.  5  Some U. S. importers, including Reebok and Baden Sports, have begun to label their soccer balls as produced without child labor. These labeling programs are the primary focus of this chapter. Information about labeling programs has been obtained from the companies using labels, from surveys of U. S. importers and retailers, and from field visits to India, Pakistan and China by Department of Labor officials. Section B of this chapter presents an overview of the industry and the market for soccer balls in the United States. Section C examines the role children play in the production of soccer balls around the world. Section D describes various labelingprograms. Finally, Section E reports responses of U. S.- based soccer ball importers and retailers to the child labor issue, based on a voluntary survey.  B. Industry Profile Soccer, or ""football"" as it is known in most countries, is the world's mostpopular sport.  6  Although soccer gained popularity slowly in the United States, enthusiasm for the sport has grown in recent years.  7  In 1980, there were fewer than 1 million youths registered to play soccer; by 1996 this figure had tripled to over 3 million.  8 Growth in the volume of U. S. imports of soccer balls reflects this trend. AsTable IV- 1 illustrates, in 1989, U. S. soccer ball imports were valued at $15.7 million;by 1996, the comparable figure was $34.2 million, a growth of 118 percent.  9  FigureIV- 1 lists U. S. imports of soccer balls by country and value. Some 71 percent ofthose imports came from Pakistan, 19 percent from China, 5 percent from Indonesia,1 percent from India, and the remaining 4 percent from other countries.  10  Soccerballs are not produced in the United States.  11 Soccer balls generally consist of a number of synthetic leather panels stitchedtogether in geometric patterns on the outside with an inflatable bladder inside.  12   Panels in high quality balls are hand- stitched for durability.  13  Hand- stitching these panels together is a very labor- intensive process and is where children have been found working. Figure IV- 2 illustrates the chain of production within the international soccerball industry. This schematic also highlights relationships among the various entitiesresponsible for production. The key actors can be described as follows:  14     Retailers typically sell a wide range of sporting goods, including soccer balls. They are not normally direct soccer balls importers; instead, they order the balls from brand name merchandisers. Retail outlets selling soccer balls include nationwide sporting goods or soccer specialty stores, independent sporting goods stores, department stores, mass-merchandisers, and toy stores.   Importers/ Design and Marketing Firms/ Merchandisers develop ball specifications and marketing strategies to promote their particular brand. They do not own the factories producing the balls, but contract with foreign manufacturers who produce the made-to-order balls. Some merchandisers have their own retail outlets for the sale of soccer balls and other products.   Contractors are foreign manufacturers who produce soccer balls for U. S. importers/ design and marketing firms/ merchandisers. They may produce soccer balls for several different buyers. Contractors usually do some of the production in their factories (e. g., cutting and packing), and outsource stitching and other tasks to subcontractors.

As of 1996, Korea no longer produced soccer balls for the U.S. market.   Source: Official Statistics of the U.S. Department of Commerce          Subcontractors are individuals who function as middlemen between the  contractor and village   stitchers.  15  Subcontractors typically deliver soccer ball kits to workers in surrounding villages. After the stitching is completed, the subcontractor pays the stitchers and returns the completed kits to the contractor.   Stitchers sew together the panels of a soccer ball and glue in the inflatable bladder. They are employed by subcontractors, typically on a piece rate basis, and may work in a stitching center, small village workshop, or in homes.      C. Child Labor in the Soccer Ball Industry The use of child labor in the production of soccer balls has been documentedprimarily in Pakistan and India.  16  Soccer balls are also made in China and Indonesia, but there are no known allegations of child labor in the soccer ball industries of these countries. The manufacture of soccer balls is controlled from the city but decentralized to homes and small workshops in surrounding villages. At the city factories or warehouses, the designs are printed and the pieces are cut. These are then packed into sacks and handed over to middlemen or subcontractors who distribute them in villages to families and workshops, where stitching traditionally is done both by adults and children. Subcontractors provide soccer ball kits to village workshops and/or households, where workers hand-stitch individual pieces together, glue the bladder to the material, and sew in the final piece. Some of the larger subcontractors in Pakistan have up to 300 stitchers working for them.  17  In some instances, there may be two or more tiers of subcontractors, with the balls passing through many hands on the way from the stitcher to the manufacturer. Once completed, the stitched soccer balls are then brought back by the middlemen to the factories for packing andshipment.  Pakistan Nearly all soccer balls are made in and around Sialkot, Pakistan  a regionfamous as a soccer ball producing hub for at least 80 years.  18  Seventy-five percent of the world's soccer balls were produced in Sialkot in 1996.  19  It is estimated that there are about 10,000 urban workers and 30,000 rural workers in the 1,450 surrounding villages of Sialkot involved in the production of soccer balls.  20 As recently as 1995, Pakistani soccer ball manufacturers denied that children were stitching soccer balls. The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan noted that when they visited Sialkot in 1995, manufacturers seemed to have instructed their contractors not to talk about child labor, and taken the contractors to task, ""not so much for employing child labor as for letting it become visible.""  21  At the time, theCommission reported that they found many children working in the soccer ball industry, despite the local industry's best efforts to conceal the children from view.  22 In 1996, an ILO study in the Sialkot region estimated that more than 7,000 Pakistani children between the ages of 5 and 14 stitched balls on a regular, full- time basis.  23  In addition, large numbers of children worked part-time outside of school hours. The great majority of these children were boys. More than 90 percent of the children stitching soccer balls are between theages of 10 and 14.  24  Most work in small shops or at home.  25  Seventy percent of the children work 8 to 9 hours a day; others work 10 to 11 hours per day.  26  It is estimated that 19 percent of the boys and 36 percent of the girls have never attended school.  27  Twenty-two percent of the boys and 25 percent of the girls attend school and work.  28  Although most of the child workers can read and write, many havedropped out of school because of uninteresting curricula, unsympathetic teachers and an uncomfortable school environment.  29 A recent study conducted for the Soccer Industry Council of America (SICA)found that stitchers make between 20 to 30 Pakistani rupees, or approximately $0.50 to $0.75, per ball.  30  On average, children are paid 20 to 22 Pakistani rupees per ball, or about $0.50 to $0.55. Payment tends to vary according to ball quality.  31  Most high quality balls are stitched by adults at stitching centers. The ILO reports that children are not likely to stitch high quality balls because they are not strong enough to make the required stitches. The wages for high quality balls are almost double than thosefor lower quality balls.  32  Depending upon skill and experience, a person is reportedly able to stitch between 1 and 5 balls a day.  33 There have been allegations of debt servitude in the soccer ball industry in Pakistan,  34  charges denied by Pakistani manufacturers  35  and a recent Save the Children-UK report.  36  However, the study commissioned by the Soccer Industry Council of America (SICA), the Save the Children report and a study conducted jointly by the ILO and the Punjab Department of Labor acknowledge that many families in thesoccer ball industry take loans or advances from subcontractors.  37  The advances are generally repaid through a deduction in the amount paid to the stitchers.  38  Most reports, however, are careful to note that intergenerational debt-bondage is not prevalent in the soccer ball industry. India India's sporting goods industry has its roots in Sialkot, Pakistan. When India was partitioned at independence in 1947, many of Sialkot's skilled Hindi craftsmen migrated across the border into the Punjab, settling in Jalandhar, where the Indian sporting goods industry is now based.  39  The Indian sporting goods industry has expanded to include the areas of Meerut, Uttar Pradesh, and Gurgaon, Haryana. Most of India's sporting goods, including soccer balls, are exported to the United Kingdom. Allegations of child labor in India's soccer ball industry have appeared since 1994.  40  Although these allegations were initially repudiated by some members of the Indian Sports Goods Export Promotion Council, recent public statements by members of the industry are more qualified, denying that child labor is used inmembers' factories, but acknowledging that the practice may occur through the process of contracting out to homeworkers.  41  About 300,000 persons work in the sporting goods industry producing over 200 different products.  42  It is estimated that about 10 percent of this work force, or 25,000 to 30,000 workers, are children.  43 Soccer ball production in India is similar to that in Pakistan: middlemen distribute soccer ball kits provided by large factories to small workshops and homes in surrounding villages, where soccer balls are stitched and returned. A 1997 study by Christian Aid, a British NGO, found children as young as seven stitching soccerballs in their homes.  44  The report described children working in small workshops orat home in urban slum areas and remote villages.  45  They work for many hours stitching the soccer balls while sitting in a hunched, squatting position. Some of thechildren go to school as well as work.  46  The report quotes the director of a Jalandhar soccer ball company as saying, ""the football industry uses children at the age of 10or 12. The quantity of footballs exported is too much to employ all the people we need in factories. Women and children do it in their houses whenever they get freetime.""  47 As in Pakistan, stitchers are paid per completed ball. One major exporter stated that stitchers average 13 to 14 Indian rupees per ball ($ 0.37 - $0.39) for the low quality soccer balls, and between 20 and 22 Indian rupees per ball ($ 0.56-$0.62cents) for the most commonly produced medium quality balls. Some Indian children reportedly earn as little as 7 Indian rupees per ball, or about $0.20.  48   D. Consumer Labeling Programs in the Soccer Ball Industry 1.  Introduction Adverse publicity in the United States and Europe about children stitchingsoccer balls prompted some importers to adopt labels informing consumers that their products have been produced in a child labor-free environment. In some cases, these programs are accompanied by changes in production processes to prevent theemployment of children. Although some individual companies have developed labels for their soccer balls, the majority of the soccer ball industry has opted instead to implement avariety of different codes of conduct to prohibit and prevent child labor. At a November 1996 meeting of the World Federation of the Sporting Goods Industry (WFSGI), companies rejected the possibility of labeling products, concluding that ""our ownindustrial brand names were statements of quality and ethics in their own rights and any disclaimer put on a separate label would only weaken that statement and the perception of the brand.""  49  They emphasized that by labeling only some balls, unlabeled balls might unfairly be thought to be made by children.  50  On the other hand, the President of the WFSGI commented that over time, it might be conceivable that products would carry a stamp indicating membership in WFSGI. Since the WFSGI isan endorser of the Pakistan Partners' Agreement, such a stamp would imply that aball made in Pakistan fulfilled the no child labor requirements of this agreement.  51  In making this proposal, the President noted that for such a stamp to be credible, it must be backed up by a strong and transparent monitoring system in addition to an enforcement mechanism capable of denying the use of the stamp or expelling members found violating the agreement.  52 Notwithstanding the WFSGI policy, recent evidence shows that child labor labeling is becoming more common in the soccer ball industry. For example, both Reebok and Baden Sports recently began selling soccer balls with a label stating that the balls are not made by children. The Reebok balls are made in Pakistan, while the Baden balls are made in China. The retail chain Dunkin' Donuts sold promotional soccer balls with a no child labor label during the 1997 summer months. Additionally, in response to a Department of Labor survey, the Kmart Corporation provided letters from their suppliers indicating that their balls are, or will be, labeled child labor-free. These labeling programs are described in the next few pages.  2.  Reebok a. Program Overview Reebok International Ltd. (Reebok) is a leading designer, marketer and worldwide distributor of sports, fitness and casual footwear, apparel, and sporting equipment. Total sales for 1996 were approximately $3.5 billion.  53  Reebok, a publicly held corporation, issued a code of conduct known as the Reebok Human Rights Production Standards in 1992. Among other things, the code of conduct bars the use of child labor in making Reebok products.  Recognizing the high incidence of child workers in the Pakistani soccer ball industry, in June 1996 Reebok officials said they were planning to buy Pakistani-made soccer balls that they ""knew with certainty"" were not made with child labor.  54  Reebok contracted with Moltex Sporting Goods (Pvt.) Ltd., a Pakistani soccer and rugby ball manufacturer, and Reed and Associates, a French company specializing inresearch and development, sourcing and manufacturing of high quality soccer and rugby balls, to build a soccer ball manufacturing plant. The new facility, located in Sialkot, has been making Reebok balls since March 1997. Soccer balls produced for Reebok by Moltex bear the following label on one of the panels: "" Guarantee: Manufactured without child labor. "" According to company officials, the use of the label allows Reebok to communicate their policy to consumers and stakeholders interested in ending exploitative child labor. Reebok's decision to label soccer balls was based on two factors: (1) increasing concern by consumers about children stitching soccer balls;  55  and (2) Reebok's desire to distinguish itself from other brands by centralizing stitching and all other production processes in a single factory and requiring rigorous external monitoring of the facility. Reebok officials state they will be able to place their label on Reebok balls ""with absolute confidence. Our consumers will know that Reebok balls are, without any doubt, child labor-free.""  56 b. Program Structure The three major elements of Reebok's program include:  57     containment of all production inside a new facility in which all work on Reebok balls is performed, including stitching. All workers must be age 15 or older;   external monitoring to ensure that: a) children are not entering the workplace, and b) soccer ball panels are not leaving the factory where the risk exists that they may be stitched by children in stitching centers or in homes; and   support of education and/ or vocational education training for children in the  soccer ball manufacturing region or Pakistan.     Reebok officials acknowledge that there are additional costs associated with creating a new facility that will house all production processes. According to Peter Moore, Senior Vice President of the Global Soccer/ Rugby Division, this shift in manufacturing processes will cost Reebok approximately 15 percent more.  58  Reebok saysthese additional costs  associated with pensions, health insurance and transportation for workers at the new factory  will be absorbed by the company; the salesprice of Reebok soccer balls will remain the same.  59 c. Program Implementation According to Reebok, the Sialkot facility began making soccer balls in March1997. Reebok hired three independent monitors to check the effectiveness of the program. Two of the monitors are associated with human rights organizations,  60  and the third is a Lahore-based affiliate of a major U. S. accounting firm.  61  The two human rights monitors were asked to monitor the factory, interview workers, maintain ties to the local community, and visit surrounding villages to be sure no Reebok panels are stitched outside the factory. Each monitor has the right to inspect the facility on an announced or unannounced basis.  62  The third monitor was hired to audit factory records in order to correlate the number of balls produced with the number of stitchers in the factory.  63  Reebok intends to make monitoring reports publicly available upon request.  64 Reebok says the auditing firm conducted a test audit in March 1997.  65  A representative of the auditing firm acknowledged they visited the plant and recommended that a number of accounting measures be implemented so that the firm could begin auditing records by August 1997.  66  Reebok notes that because other soccer balls are also being made by Moltex, the auditing process is very difficult.Reebok plans to reassess the value of engaging the outside auditing firm in addition to the human rights monitors.  67 Reebok issued the human rights monitors' first report on August 14, 1997, summarizing their findings from March through July 1997.  68  During the first five months of the project, the monitors visited the Moltex facility nine times to determine if children were present; three of the visits were unannounced. As of June 4, the monitors had found 236 workers in the factory, including 176 stitchers; 179 artisans working on a contract basis were also present. No children were found at the Moltex facility. During an April 29 visit, the human rights monitors observed balls being made at Moltex for another major buyer.  69  The factory management said these balls were being sent out of the factory for stitching, but were not Reebok balls. In August, Reebok stated it had given Moltex a large enough order to fill up the company's manufacturing capacity, and non-Reebok balls would be out of the factory by September 30.  70 The monitors recommended that a plan be devised to clearly assure them that Reebok balls were not being stitched outside the factory. In May, Reebok authorized the human rights monitors to hire a guard to stand at the factory gate tomake sure no Reebok ball panels are commingled with panels for other buyers as they leave the factory to be stitched elsewhere. The guard, who reports directly to the human rights monitors, was hired in June. He has been instructed to make sure that no Reebok panels leave the factory, and that no completed Reebok balls are coming in from the villages or outside stitching centers where children might bepresent. As of the end of July, the monitors informed Reebok that the guard has not observed any problems with Reebok balls entering or leaving the factory. Reebok has commented on the monitors' report, stating that a number of health and safety concerns in the factory had been communicated to Moltex.  71  In response, large posters with Reebok's human rights production standards translated into Urdu are being sent to Pakistan. Finally, Reebok acknowledges that a number of record keeping procedures are not yet complete, such as establishing personnel records with historical data and creating worker identification cards. In addition to its new ball factory and monitoring project, Reebok is planning an educational project.  72  The company has a three-year plan to improve educational opportunities for children in villages in the Sialkot area, specifically targeting displaced child workers. Reebok is working with the Society for Advancement of Education in Sialkot to implement the plan.  3.  Baden Sports a. Program Overview Baden Sports, Inc. is a family- owned athletic ball manufacturer. Founded eighteen years ago, Baden sells baseballs, basketballs, broom balls, footballs, soccer balls,volleyballs and water polo balls. Baden now imports soccer balls directly from one manufacturer in China. Baden recently shifted suppliers from Pakistan to China due to ""complications facing the industry in solving this [the child labor] problem,""  73  and because they ""never found the manufacturers in Pakistan to be reliable or trustworthy, and our experience is that you cannot inspect with confidence or expect that the Pakistani companies will adhere to any monitoring programs.""  74  Recent consumer inquiries, combined with market research indicating great consumer interest in the elimination ofchild labor, are Baden's primary reasons for changing its supplier and production practices. Baden claims that by switching suppliers to China, it has ensured elimination of child labor in its production of soccer balls: ""With our newly automated manufacturing process for patent-pending stitched balls, we can now guarantee, and certifyon the ball itself, that no child or slave labor has been used in the production of oursoccer balls.""  75  A Baden representative also stated that the shift to China coincided with a corporate decision to produce machine-sewn balls.  76 Soccer balls imported by Baden bear the label: ""Certified: No Child or Slave Labor Used on this Ball."" Baden also intends to produce packaging and advertisements stating that no child labor is used in the production of their soccer balls. Baden began marketing soccer balls bearing the child labor-free label in 1997.  77  In a press release announcing the availability of the product, Baden CEO E. C.Schindler stated ""it is our goal to ensure that soccer is played by children, not made by children. We are so sure of the integrity and quality of our products, we certify it.""  78 b. Program Structure Baden soccer balls are stitched in China using sewing machines, leaving only the last patch to be hand-stitched after the ball is turned right side out and the bladder inserted.  79  This process is done entirely at a factory run by Kuan Ho Sporting Goods Company Ltd., a manufacturing facility located in Dongguan, Guangdong Province, China.  80  Baden believes that through machine stitching it can obtain better quality and greater production volume using fewer workers. Baden claims that it can produce soccer balls 50 percent faster using sewing machines than stitching the balls by hand.  81 Kuan Ho's manager explained the plant's recruitment policy to visiting Department of Labor officials. Under China's labor laws, no one under 16 years of age is permitted to work. About 400 of the 2,400 workers at the factory produce soccer balls.  82  According to Kuan Ho's manager, most of the workers are female, earning about 60 to 70 percent above the local minimum wage of 500 yuan ($ 60) a month, or up to 900 yuan ($ 108).  83  The work force is made up almost entirely of migrants from other provinces within China; according to the Kuan Ho manager, they have a stable workforce due to fairly liberal benefits, which include vacations and the possibility of returning home once a year.  84 Baden requires written certification from the manufacturer that child labor is not used in the manufacture of Baden products. According to Baden's Asia representative, the company also requires Kuan Ho to allow access to personnel records. c. Program Implementation Baden management states that the company's factory representative monitors the Kuan Ho facility weekly. The factory representative explained that he visits the plant to check for quality, design and child labor but did not indicate the frequency of his visits.  85  A form verifying the absence of child labor in the production of soccer balls is to be filled out during each visit and signed by Baden's factory representative and an officer of Kuan Ho.  86 Baden management states that, in addition to the procedures noted above, it requires its representatives to verify the no child labor statements and representations made by Kuan Ho officials. The factory representative told U. S. Department of Labor officials that during his factory visits, he accepts the word of the plant manager that they are not employing child labor.  87  In addition, Baden management stated that a representative from Baden's headquarters occasionally accompanies the factory representative on site visits to verify company policies are being carried out correctly. The Department of Labor team received a copy of Baden's inspection report of Kuan Ho that certifies no child labor (i.e., no workers under sixteen) was being used in the production of soccer balls.  88  The copy of the inspection report itself had been prepared but not yet signed by the Baden representative or the Kuan Homanager.  89 Baden has no set policy to deal with the discovery of a child worker.  90  KuanHo's plant manager was aware of Baden's child labor concerns even though Baden does not have a written corporate policy on human rights or a special training program that covers this topic.  91  Workers at Kuan Ho were not aware of the purpose of Baden's labeling program.  92  The firm's management believes that workers do not need to know about such a program, although human resource managers  who are responsible for the hiring  do.  93 Baden states that the price of its soccer balls will likely increase slightly as a result of the new manufacturing and monitoring process.  4.  Other Child Labor Consumer Labels More and more soccer ball companies are promoting child labor labels particularly since the February 14, 1997 signing of the Partners' Agreement to Eliminate Child Labor in the Soccer Ball Industry in Pakistan ( see Section E. 1). The Department of Labor has received information on seven such labels. All the labelspromise that the soccer balls are not made by children. Only one of the labeling programs, sponsored by Dunkin' Donuts, has a monitoring and certification component. Four of these labels are associated with brand-name soccer balls that are soldin retail outlets. The other two labels are produced both for retail outlets and youth soccer leagues/clubs in the United States. a. Dunkin' Donuts Promotion The spread of child labor-free labels for soccer ballsis illustrated by a soccer ball promotion conducted by Dunkin'Donuts franchise outlets in New England during the 1997summer season.  94  With any purchase, a customer could buy for $9.99 a hand-stitched soccer ball bearing three logos: the Dunkin' Donuts logo; that of the New England Revolution, the region's professional soccer team; and the statement ""Produced Without Child Labor."" Posters with a photo of Alexi Lalas, one of the star players of the New England Revolution, were placed in participating Dunkin' Donut stores; many of the posters stated ""Ball Produced Without Child Labor"" in their right bottom corner.  95  The promotion was originally intended to run during the months of June and July but was extended until all the balls in stock are sold. The idea to put child labor-free labels on the promotional soccer balls came from Dunkin' Donuts New England franchisees, who expressed concern about child labor being used in the production of soccer balls made in Pakistan.  96  In response, letters from the U. S. Sporting Goods Manufacturers Association (SGMA) and Talon Sports  97  (the Pakistani manufacturer) were sent to Dunkin' Donuts stating that the balls would not be made by children. A committee of Dunkin' Donuts franchisees was uncomfortable relying solely on the promises of the manufacturer and the trade association. They agreed to approve the campaign only if the balls were certified ""child labor-free"" by an independent organization. As a result of the franchisees' concern about the credibility of a ""no child labor"" guarantee, Dunkin' Donuts, working through a sports marketing consultant in charge of the campaign (Sports Team), requested that a Washington, DC- based NGO the International Labor Rights Fund (ILRF)  serve as an independent monitor. Consequently, ILRF designed a monitoring program to ensure that soccer balls produced by Talon in Pakistan for Dunkin' Donuts were child labor-free. A six- month agreement between Sports Team and ILRF granted ILRF monitors total access to all Talon facilities, including its factories and stitching centers. Talon provided the ILRF with a map of the 43 stitching centers, a list of the names of all workers, and all of its records. Talon also consented to unannounced visits by the monitors, granting them access to all facilities and the ability to talk to workers without the presence ofsupervisory personnel.  98  ILRF monitors reported that they did not find any instances of illegal child labor. At the end of the summer, Dunkin' Donuts representatives were to evaluatethe soccer ball promotion program and determine whether to launch a spring campaign and whether it should be expanded beyond New England.  99 b. Individual Company Labels Another example of new labels informing consumers that a soccer ball ismade without child labor is that of individual companies promising that their balls are made only by adults. In response to the Department of Labor's voluntary survey, the Kmart Corporation provided the Department with letters from Seneca Sports,Inc., Franklin Sports, Inc., Molten U. S. A. and Spalding Sports Worldwide stating thatthey have or are planning to have a labeling program for soccer balls sold in Kmart stores. All four of the companies have endorsed the Partners' Agreement to Eliminate Child Labour in the Soccer Ball Industry in Pakistan and seem to base some of their no child labor assurances solely on this agreement. The following is some brief information about the claims made by each company to Kmart.      In its letter to Kmart dated February 18, 1997, Seneca Sports,  Inc. certified that its manufacturing facility in Pakistan ""prohibits inhumane conditions, violations of human rights and the use of child labor."" The letter further states that ""our packaging will certify that no child labor was used in the manufacturing of Seneca Soccer Balls.""    100  The package containing the Seneca ball states, ""Seneca® balls are certified as free from child labor."" The box also states ""Seneca Sports® Certified."" A Seneca official informed the Department of Labor that in the past year it has been asking its Pakistani supplier, Awan Sports, for assurances that soccer balls produced for Seneca are child labor- free. The Seneca representative further stated that Awan Sports has consolidated all its soccer ball production into one facility, preventing the outsourcing of stitching operations, and thereby minimizing the chance of child labor. Both Seneca and Awan Sports endorse the Partners' Agreement.    101     Franklin Sports, Inc. informed Kmart on February 18, 1997 that  it is a member of the Partners' Agreement, noting that a monitoring system had been implemented to ensure compliance with the Agreement.    102  In addition, Franklin stated it will independently assure that: 1) factories manufacturing Franklin soccer balls will be monitored by an independent contractor on a quarterly basis, with reports available for review by Kmart management; 2) factories will use only factory managed labor in the production of soccer balls, eliminating any possibility that child labor could be used in a cottage industry environment; and 3) Franklin will include a visible mark/logo on packaging and/ or product stating clearly that no child labor has been used in the production of the product, no later than July 1, 1997.    103       The president of Franklin Sports explained that placing a child  labor-free label on the balls ""is a visible way to tell people that we are in compliance with the Partners' Agreement. Also, retailers want assurances that our balls were not made by children.""  104 In a follow-up interview with the Department of Labor, Franklin confirmed that effective July 1, 1997, a label reading ""Manufactured Without Child Labor"" is being printed on balls made in Pakistan and exported to the United States. Franklin believes that stitching centers are being set up to centralize production and better manage who stitches the soccer balls. Franklin notes that they are relying solely on the Partners'Agreement to monitor production. Franklin requires all its Pakistani manufacturers to be members of the Partners' Agreement.  105      Molten U. S. A., in a letter to Kmart dated February 21, 1997, stated that ""we can now guarantee that no child labor will be used in any phase of the production of soccer balls supplied to Kmart Corporation."" The letter further states that Molten U. S. A. ""will begin to include a sticker on the cosmetic package referencing the child labor issue as soon as the stickers are produced. This should be no later than March 15."" A representative of Molten explained that its soccer balls are made in Pakistan, India and China, although the labels described in their letter to Kmart refer only to balls made in Pakistan. The representative stated that both Molten and their Pakistani supplier, Sublime Sports, are members of the Partners' Agreement. As of mid-August, however, Molten had not put ""no child labor"" labels on its Pakistani-made soccer balls. The company maintains that it is in the process of investigating the issue of child labor in Pakistan, and wants to ensure that any child labor- free guarantee made by Molten is absolutely credible.    106     Spalding Sports Worldwide stated in a February 21, 1997 letter to Kmart that all Spalding soccer ball manufacturers comply with the industry criteria and Spalding's Worldwide Labor Policy. The letter further states that Spalding is a member of the Partners' Agreement. Finally, the letter states that Spalding has added the following logo to all its soccer packages: ""No Child Labor Used to Produce This Product."" A representative of Spalding explained that Spalding sources 75 percent of its soccer balls from Pakistan; the remaining balls are made in China, but are molded and not hand- stitched. Spalding's two Pakistani manufacturers, Recto Sports    107  and Taj Mahal, are members of the Partners' Agreement. Spalding requires its manufacturers to certify Spalding balls have been produced without the use of child labor. Additionally, Spalding says that its quality control personnel visit the Pakistani facilities frequently and ensure that no child labor is used.    108       c. Child Labor Labeled Soccer Balls Provided to Youth Soccer Leagues In addition to the five companies listed above, other companies selling ballsdirectly to youth soccer leagues are making no child labor"" claims. While there maybe a number of companies supplying labeled balls to youth soccer leagues, the following two have come to the attention of the Department of Labor.      The Department of Labor obtained a soccer ball used at ""The  1997 Virginian Tournament,"" held in Springfield, Virginia, which carries the label ""No Child Labor Involved: Adult Sewn Product."" According to the information printed on the ball, it was made in Pakistan and imported by American Challenge, a U. S. importer of soccer balls. American Challenge officials informed the Department of Labor that its Challenge soccer balls are manufactured exclusively by JSD Sports (Pvt.) Ltd. in   Sialkot, Pakistan.  109  American Challenge has provided the Department of Labor with a letter from the Assistant Director of Labour Welfare, Government of the Punjab, stating that the mentioned manufacturer ""is abiding by all the by-laws in relation with employment of 'child labor' and there is no worker in the factory below the age of fifteen years. It is further certified that all workers/employees are free to leave the job and no bonded labour is involved in the manufacturing of products of the said concern.""    110  American Challenge stated that the company has been producing soccer balls with a ""no child labor"" label since January 1997. The soccer balls are sold to various dealers and individuals.    111     The American Soccer Company supplies soccer balls to ADULT  youth soccer leagues, soccer clubs, and stores under thebrand name SCORE. In the past year, the American Soccer Company began to distribute SCORE soccer balls with a PRODUCT label stating, ""Adult Sewn Product."" A SCORE representative said that placing the labels on the balls coincided with the signing of the Partners' Agreement, of which they are a member. SCORE requires that its Pakistani manufacturers be members of the Partners' Agreement as well. One of SCORE's suppliers in Pakistan is Talon Sports. Talon has provided letters to SCORE assuring that they do not use child labor in the production of their soccer balls. SCORE hopes to send company representatives to Pakistan at the end of the year to visit Talon and verify the no child labor assurances are accurate.    112     The two major organizations that sponsor and regulate youth soccer leagues in the United States, the United States Youth Soccer Association, Inc. (USYSA), andthe American Youth Soccer Organization (AYSO), have both publicly condemned the use of child labor in the manufacturing of soccer balls.  113  The official equipmentsupplier of the USYSA, the larger of the two groups, is Adidas, which does not place labels on its balls. The official ball of the AYSO is Spalding, which is placing child labor-free labels on AYSO sanctioned balls (see above). The AYSO states that is has obtained a guarantee from Spalding that its manufacturers do not engage in violation of children's rights, and that no child labor is used in the manufacturing of any of its products. Prior to this year, the official ball of the AYSO was SCORE, which is now placing no child labor labels on some of its balls.  E. Codes of Conduct in the Soccer Ball Industry In addition to the increase in child labor labels in the soccer ball industry, voluntary codes of conduct prohibiting child labor are also becoming more common. Such codes have been adopted by soccer organizations, sporting goods manufacturers, importers and retailers of soccer balls. This section first describes codes adopted by national and international organizations. The section then discusses the implementation of codes of conduct by individual U. S. importers and retailers of soccer balls, based on responses to a U. S. Department of Labor survey, other information gathered during the research for this report, and field visits by U. S. Department of Labor officials. 1.  Partners' Agreement to Eliminate Child Labor in the Soccer Ball Industry in Pakistan On February 14, 1997, in Atlanta, Georgia, representatives of the Sialkot Cham-ber of Commerce and Industry (SCCI),  114  the International Labor Organization (ILO) and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) signed the Partners' Agreement toEliminate Child Labour in the Soccer Industry in Pakistan.  115  The goals of the Partners' Agreement are the elimination of child labor in soccer ball production and the eventual elimination of child labor in other industries in the Sialkot area. This will beaccomplished through the creation of new opportunities for children with an emphasis on education and training. The Partners' Agreement has two basic programelements: a prevention and monitoring program and a social protection program. A Coordinating Committee comprised of the Partners and NGOs will administer theproject.  116  Both segments of the Partnership Agreement are due to begin in late 1997. Companies endorsing the agreement ""agree to source balls made in Pakistanexclusively from manufacturers who indicate their commitment to act responsibly toensure that children are not utilized to make soccer balls by participating in the voluntary industry program.""  117  In all, 55 soccer ball companies have endorsed the Partners' Agreement.  118 a. Prevention and Monitoring Program The prevention and monitoring program will set up a registry and internaland external monitoring systems and replace home-based production with village-based stitching centers. The program will be managed by the ILO. The objective ofthe program is to have the factories and stitching units of at least 22 manufacturersand their subcontractors free of child labor within 18 months:  119     Internal monitoring:  In order to determine whether soccer ball manufacturers are complying with the Partners' Agreement, a registry of personnel and production sites will be established. This registry is the core of the internal monitoring system. Manufacturers participating in the program must provide the following information to the ILO by January 1, 1998. i) registration of the names and contact information of all subcontractors; ii) registration of the names, addresses and ages of all stitchers working for the subcontractors and identification of child workers under the age of 14 to be removed and placed in social protection programs; iii) a reasonable estimate of the annual target capacity of soccer balls to be produced by the manufacturer and a reasonable estimate of the number of stitchers to produce this amount; iv) registration of all stitching units no less than 25 percent of the annual target capacity; and v) registration of names and contact information of new subcontractors, and names, addresses and ages of new stitchers. The manufacturers are required to update the list of new subcontractors and stitchers every six months, and to have registered all the stitching units representing one-hundred percent of the annual target capacity by January 1999.     External monitoring:  The accuracy of the internal monitoring system will be checked by establishing an external monitoring system. The ILO will hire and train independent monitors to visit the stitching centers on an unannounced basis to verify the information provided by the internal monitoring system. The monitors will have free access to all stitching centers operated by manufacturers and subcontractors. Weekly and monthly monitoring reports will be made available to the   ILO; reports of violations of the Agreement will be given to the Coordinating Committee on a monthly basis or whenever requested.     b. Social Protection Program At the same time that a system is being put into place to phase children out of the soccer ball industry, a program will be established to provide the children with education and rehabilitation. The program includes a campaign to change community attitudes toward child labor in the soccer ball industry. Children and families identified by the internal monitoring program will receive non-formal education, counseling, health services, training in income generation for adults, provision of credit/savings facility for adults and pre-vocational training. Younger children will be mainstreamed to formal schools. A number of village education and action centers (VEA centers) will be set up to provide these services. The centers will be run by the Bunyad Literacy Community Council, a Pakistani NGO focusing on basic education, and the Pakistan Bait-ul-Mal, a social welfare agency set up by the Prime Minister'soffice. 2.  Sportsgoods Manufacturers and Exporters Association (India) As programs to eliminate child labor in the Pakistani soccer ball industrygained momentum and attention this year, representatives of the sporting goods industry in India also have begun deliberations about combating child labor. In April1997, members of the Indian Sportsgoods Manufacturers and Exporters Associationjoined representatives of NGOs, government, trade unions and international organizations in the First National Consultation on Child Labor in the Sports Goods Industry, organized by the Indian human rights group South Asian Coalition on Child Servitude (SACCS). The purpose of the meeting was to discuss the problem of child labor in the industry and create a plan of action for the elimination of child labor. Among the coalition's recommendations was to establish an ethical code of conductand an independent, professional and credible monitoring system to ensure the absence of child labor.  120  The Joint Committee on Child Labor in the Sporting Goods Industry was created, consisting of 8 industry representatives, 3 NGO representatives, the Sports Goods Export Promotion Council (a governmental body), the ILO and UNICEF. At the same time that the Joint Committee was being established by SACCS,members of the Sportsgoods Manufacturers and Exporters Association of India  121  held a special meeting to discuss child labor in May 1997. The meeting, attended by 25 of the largest soccer ball manufacturers and exporters in India, the ILO and the World Federation of Sporting Goods Industry,  122  was called in response to a May 1997 Christian Aid report on child labor in the Indian sporting goods industry and recent negative media coverage in the United Kingdom.  123 In a declaration prior to the May meeting, the Indian Sportsgoods Manufac-turers and Exporters Association stated its opposition to child labor. Similar to the industry leaders in Pakistan, the Indian association explained that there are no children producing soccer balls in the factories themselves,  124  but that subcontractors could be distributing work to village shops and homes where child labor is more likely to be found.  125  To deal with this problem, the Association adopted a self-monitoring system consisting of the following elements:    the industry will: (1) identify stitchers and prepare lists of their names, address, ages, sex, address of workplace, etc.; (2) identify children working in homes or in factories; and (3) cross check the lists of stitchers with the number of stitched balls, and/ or other goods exported annually from India;      the first monitoring of the lists will be conducted by the Sportsgoods Manufacturers and Exporters Association,   Jalandhar;     a second monitoring will be conducted by the Sports Good Export Promotion Council; and     the third monitoring will be done by an outside agency such as the Indian Labor Department or the   ILO.  126     At a June 1997 meeting, the chairman of the Sportsgoods Manufacturers and Exporters Association asked that all members fill out forms ""to identify child labour""  127   employed directly or indirectly in the production of soccer balls. While the Association deems the monitoring system as self-certifying, it acknowledges that some form of independent monitoring is necessary for the system to be credible.  128  Whether an Indian government agency is considered to be independent for purposes of monitoring is open to question. The Sportsgoods Manufacturers and Exporters Associationhas also encouraged members to work with the Punjabi state government, which will reportedly provide assistance if members are interested in setting up centralizedstitching centers in lieu of using individual subcontractors.  129 On September 13, 1997, the Sportsgoods Manufacturers and Exporters Association reported that 27 exporting companies have provided information on their stitchers. Eighteen of these companies have obtained lists of stitchers from their contractors.  130 3.  FIFA The International Federation of Football Associations (FIFA)  131  authorizes the use of its logo on soccer balls that meet international matchball standards. On September 3, 1996, FIFA announced an agreement with three international unions  132  on a Code of Labor Practice for all goods bearing its logo.  133   Use of the FIFA logo bya licensee would signify that production was carried out in compliance with ILO Conventions banning child labor and forced labor, ensuring non-discrimination in employment, guaranteeing the right of workers to form and join trade unions and to bargain collectively, and ensuring payment of a minimum wage.  134  These commitments would be binding not only on the licensees, but also on each contractor and subcontractor in the production and distribution of FIFA- licensed products.  135  The FIFA Code of Labour Practice has not been embraced by soccer ball manufacturers or importers. In the year since the Code of Labor Practice was announced, FIFA has endorsed the Partners' Agreement but has not issued any information on the implementation of the FIFA code.  136 4.  Survey Results In addition to endorsing the Partners' Agreement, some U. S. importers of soccer balls have issued their own codes of conduct that prohibit the use of child labor. Some retailers have also adopted similar codes of conduct. In order to gather information on the extent and implementation of codes of conduct and labeling programs regarding child labor in the soccer ball industry, the U. S. Department of Labor conducted a voluntary survey of 7 importers and 3 retailersof soccer balls.  137  ( See Box IV- 1 for a list of the companies surveyed and Appendix B for the Company Questionnaire). Nine companies responded to the survey: Adidas, Baden Sports, Brine, Kmart, Nike, Pentland (Mitre), Reebok, Umbro, and Wal-Mart. The respondents indicated they import soccer balls either directly from foreign manufacturers in China, Indonesia or Pakistan, or through a U. S.- based purchasing agent.    Six of the seven importers source their soccer balls directly from a foreign manufacturer; one firm   (Pentland) also sources its balls through a purchasing agent. The seventh, Adidas, currently imports its soccer balls through a licensee, Molten, U. S. A. None of the seven importers own foreign manufacturing facilities. However, Reebok and Nike have invested in special facilities being built by their Pakistani producers in order to meet their child labor-free production policies.     The two retailers responding to the survey use U. S. licensees or purchasing agents to obtain soccer balls. Kmart, for example, purchases soccer balls from Seneca Sports, Franklin Sports, Molten U. S. A., and Spalding Sports ( see Section D. 4. b. above).     Seven of the companies responding to the survey indicated they have a written corporate policy prohibiting child labor. The written policies take the form of a code of conduct, vendor agreement, purchase order, or statement of principles.In cases where the company purchases and/or sells numerous products, the code applies to all the products, not just soccer balls. Copies of the policies are reproduced in Appendix C.    All seven importers (Adidas, Baden Sports, Brine, Nike, Pentland (Mitre), Reebok and Umbro) have endorsed the Partners' Agreement in addition to their individual corporate policies against child labor.    Brine stated that it has no written policy prohibiting child labor, although it is a member of the Partners' Agreement and has always made it clear to suppliers that child labor is unacceptable. However, this policy is not included in their purchase orders or vendor agreements.     Adidas' licensing agreement requires its licensees and manufacturers to comply with all applicable laws, including those prohibiting child labor. Manufacturers are also required to ensure that subcontractors comply with these standards. Failure to comply may be a basis for terminating the agreement.     Although Baden has no written code of conduct prohibiting child labor, they  require their factory representatives to verify that no children are engaged in making their products.     Nike's code of conduct prohibits the use of child labor. Child labor is defined as a person under the age of 15, unless national law states that the minimum age for work is fourteen  or  the age at which compulsory schooling has ended, whichever is greater.     TABLE IV-2 Type of Policy Prohibiting Child Labor (Based on Responses to Department of Labor Questionnaire)     * Company participates in the Partners' Agreement to Eliminate Child Labour in the Soccer Ball industry in Pakistan a  Company has its own labeling program b  Company has a formal code of conduct, statement of principals or compliance certificate c  Company has a purchase order, letter of credit, or buying agent agreement, which contains a specific prohibition on child labor in overseas production.        Pentland's letter of credit requires suppliers to certify that items were not mined, produced, manufactured, assembled or packed by the use of child labor as defined by national law.     Kmart's Workplace Code of Conduct is applicable to all suppliers and the suppliers' subcontractors in the United States and abroad. Kmart's code requires suppliers and their contractors to comply with local child labor laws and regulations. Children under the local legal age should not be employed by the supplier.     Reebok's code of conduct states that it will not work with business partners that use child labor. Reebok defines child labor as work performed by a person under 14, or younger than the age for compulsory schooling, whichever is higher.     Umbro requires its suppliers to sign a pledge every year certifying that they are observing national child labor laws.     Wal-Mart's Standards for Vendor Partners declares that Wal- Mart will not tolerate the use of child labor in the manufacture of products it sells. The standard applies to vendor partners as well as to their contractors, subcontractors or any other entity with whom they have a relationship for the manufacture of products sold by Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart defines child labor as work by a person younger than 15 (or 14 if so designated by national law) or younger than the age for completing compulsory education if that age is higher than 15.     Only three respondents  all importers  indicated that they communicatetheir no child labor policy directly to consumers. The remaining importers and retailers report either that they have no method to inform consumers that no childlabor is used in the foreign production of soccer balls, or that their suppliers label the balls.    Reebok and Baden have adopted labels to inform consumers that their soccer balls are made without child labor ( see Section D above). Reebok's code of conduct is reproduced on its internet website.     Nike said that consumers can learn about their no child labor policy on its internet website or by calling a toll- free number set up by the Soccer Industry Council of America that lists the names of companies participating in the Partner's Agreement.     Kmart noted that their four suppliers (Seneca Sports, Franklin Sports, Molten U. S. A., and Spalding Sports) have submitted letters indicating that they would label the balls child labor- free. Three of the four suppliers (Seneca Sports, Franklin Sports, and Spalding Sports) are now selling labeled balls to Kmart ( see Section D. 4. b. above for a more detailed discussion).     Brine noted that they do not have a separate mechanism for informing consumers that a soccer ball is not made by children, as their brand name alone should stand for not using child labor. Brine raised the concern that creating a special ""not made with child labor"" designation will lead to exploitation of the situation, and that smaller manufacturers that are financially unable to mount a large no child labor public relations campaign are bound to suffer even if they do have a no child labor commitment.     The companies surveyed indicated that they utilize a variety of means to monitor that their codes of conduct or policies on child labor are respected by their suppliers. Details of Reebok, Baden, and Kmart's monitoring procedures are found in Section D above. Table IV- 3 illustrates the type of monitoring the respondents employ. Seven of the nine respondents (Adidas, Baden, Brine, Kmart, Nike, Reebokand Wal- Mart) stated that they use contractual monitoring, i. e., they require their suppliers, through contractual agreements, to certify that their soccer balls are not made by children. The two retailers (Kmart and Wal- Mart) use only contractual monitoring to ensure their policy is being properly implemented. Seven of the nine respondents (Adidas, Baden, Brine, Nike, Pentland, Reebok and Umbro) send company staff, buyer agents or other parties to inspect facilities to verify that suppliers are actually implementing their code of conduct. Nike andReebok indicated that, in addition to contractual and internal monitoring, they use external accounting, auditing, testing or consulting firms, and/ or NGOs to monitor labor practices. In response to the Department's survey, some respondents submit-ted letters from the local Pakistani Labor Department certifying that a factory manufacturing soccer balls is free of child labor. Adidas, Brine, Nike, Pentland, Reebok and Umbro explained that they relyon the system established by the Partners' Agreement to monitor their child labor policy  in addition to any monitoring they might conduct on their own. Companies that support the Partners' Agreement pledge only to do business with Pakistani manufacturers who participate in the Agreement and consent to internal and external monitoring. As indicated above, however, the internal and external monitoring programs established by the Agreement have not yet been fully implemented.  TABLE IV-3 Monitoring Strategies for Compliance with International Child Labor Policies (Based on Responses to Department of Labor Questionnaire)     a  Company relies on guarantees made by suppliers through contractual documents or certificates that they are adhering to the company's policies. b  Company uses site visits and inspections by company staff, buyer agents, or other parties to verify that suppliers are actually implementing the codes of conduct. c  Company uses external accounting, auditing, testing or consulting firms, NGOs, or international organizations to monitor labor practices.        Local and quality control personnel employed by Adidas regularly visit manufacturers facilities. Adidas submitted a letter from the Punjabi Directorate of Labour Welfare attesting that children have never been found in the factory of their supplier, Sublime Sports.     Kmart's code of conduct requires suppliers and their subcontractors to allow full access to their facilities at all times for inspections by Kmart representatives or independent firms retained by Kmart. Kmart states that it has never found any child labor in the production of soccer balls.    138 It is not clear whether Kmart's monitoring system specifically applies to the soccer balls sold in their stores. However, in February 1997, Kmart received letters from four soccer ball suppliers assuring the retailer that the balls were not made by children. The suppliers' letters informed Kmart that each company is participating in the Partners' Agreement.     Nike imports soccer balls from SAGA Sports in Sialkot. Nike and SAGA  determined jointly that the best way to eliminate child labor was to create village stitching centers where it would be easier to monitor the ages of the   stitchers. By mid-1997, three stitching centers were operating with two additional centers scheduled to be completed by September 1997.    139  One of the centers is exclusively for women. Nike states that it monitors its code of conduct in Pakistan through its own internal procedures, and by using a Pakistani affiliate of Grant Thornton as an external monitor.     Pentland's soccer ball product managers visit their production facilities about three times a year to monitor compliance with their child labor policy. Pentland noted, however, that it is difficult to monitor for child labor since children are seldom found in the factories, but stitch soccer balls in homes and small workshops in the rural areas.   Over the next two years, Pentland plans to implement a China- specific monitoring plan in response to their concern about the use of child labor in China's soccer ball industry. The policy will have three components: 1) better factory control of home working situations; 2) documenting the age of young factory workers; and 3) protecting older working children (14, 15, 16 and 17 year olds) by restricting overtime and identifying areas of potential hazard where they should not be working.   Umbro personnel make spot- checks at suppliers' factories in 4- 8 week cycles. Umbro stated that although they conduct spot checks on ""external stitching facilities,"" they can never be completely certain that no child labor is being used.    F. Conclusion There has been significant public attention focused on the use of child laborin the soccer ball industry.  140  Most reports describe Pakistani children sitting forhours a day in small workshops stitching soccer balls. Other more recent reportsdescribe a similar situation in India's soccer ball industry. Soccer balls are also madein China and Indonesia, but the Department is not aware of any child labor allegations in the soccer ball industries of these countries. One company surveyed for this report, however, plans to implement an internal monitoring system in China due to concerns of child labor. Children stitch soccer balls in small workshops or homes, many times inremote rural areas. It is rare for a child to be found working in a large soccer ball factory. In Pakistan and India, child labor laws prohibit children from working in factories, but not in the type of subcontracting or homework arrangements common to the soccer ball industry. Some of the children work full-time. Others work during non-school hours. Many work for up to nine or ten hours a day. The international soccer ball industry has responded to the child labor accusations by creating codes of conduct and monitoring systems. In February 1997,Pakistani manufacturers signed an agreement (Partners'Agreement) with the ILO andUNICEF to phase children out of the industry, to provide education and other services to them, and to participate in internal and external monitoring programs. Over 50 U. S. and Pakistani companies pledged to support the agreement. By the time this report was written, the Partners' Agreement was not yet fully operational. In India,the industry is moving toward an agreement to stop the use of child labor. Discussions are underway between representatives of the industry, ILO, UNICEF, NGOs,trade unions and government to determine how best to accomplish this goal. Some individual companies are responding to public pressure by placingchild labor-free labels on their balls. The Department of Labor has identified eight companies that are using such labels. Reebok and Baden are both changing their production processes and implementing monitoring systems to support the use ofthe label. Reebok has hired independent human rights monitors to verify that no children stitch Reebok balls. Dunkin' Donuts sold promotional soccer balls duringthe 1997 summer months bearing a child labor-free label. Dunkin's Donuts asked a U.S.-based NGO to monitor the production of these balls and certify that they were not made by children. The other companies are making their no child labor claimsbased upon their participation in the Partners' Agreement. It is premature, however,to make such a claim because the monitoring components of the Partners' Agreement have not yet been fully implemented. Other companies are changing their production processes to prevent the use of child labor. For instance, Reebok has centralized all soccer production in one factory. Nike has created stitching centers in order to better monitor where production takes place. Baden has changed from Pakistani to Chinese suppliers and mecha-nized the stitching process. Although some individual companies have developed labels for their soccer balls, the majority of the soccer ball industry has opted instead to implement a variety of different codes of conduct to prohibit and prevent child labor. All companies responding to a Department of Labor survey on codes of conduct and labeling programs indicated that they have some type of corporate policy prohibiting child labor. Not all these policies are in writing, and very few are enforced through a rigorous monitoring system.    This report was produced by the staff of the International Child Labor Program and is published by the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of International Labor Affairs.

Introduction   There have been numerous recent reports of children working in the leather and footwear industries of various countries.  1  Public concern and consumer interest about such exploitative child labor practices appears to be growing, and consequently, pressure for change has increased.  2  Since 1994, an increasing number of importers and producers of leather footwear have taken steps to assure consumers that their products are not made by children.  This chapter focuses on several private sector initiatives to prevent the em- ployment of children in the leather footwear industry. Section B provides a brief overview of the structure of the industry and the U. S. market for leather footwear. Section C discusses evidence of the role child laborers play in this industry based on various published reports as well as information collected during U. S. Department of Labor site visits to Brazil, China, India, Mexico and Pakistan. Section D discusses consumer labeling initiatives, looking specifically at two currently in operation in Brazil: the Child-Friendly Company Program of the Abrinq Foundation and the labeling program of the Pro-Child Institute. Their goals, structure and implementation procedures are outlined based on information provided by the programs' administrators and observations of Department officials on their site visit to Brazil. Finally, Section E discusses the corporate codes of conduct of several large U. S. importers and retailers of leather footwear, based on information they provided in a voluntary survey. Where Department of Labor site visits provide additional perspective on the implementation of these codes, this information is also provided. (Appendix D contains country-specific lists of the individuals and organizations visited for this report.)  B. Industry Profile  The term leather footwear refers to any footwear with an upper portion (known simply as the ""upper"") constructed of leather. In 1995, an estimated 4.5 billion pairs of footwear, or about 43 percent of the world's footwear production, met this criterion.  3  Despite recent technological innovations in footwear manufacturing, production remains a highly labor- intensive activity. Hence, producers have continued to relocate across national boundaries in pursuit of lower wages and inexpensive raw materials.  4  Today 42 percent of the world's leather footwear originates in Asia and the Middle East (principally China, India, Thailand, Indonesia, Pakistan, Iran, and Turkey). Another 27 percent of production originates in Europe (particularly Italy), 18 percent in the Americas (particularly Brazil), and the remainder in other regions.  5  Production within the United States is now rather limited. Less than 10 percent of the nonrubber footwear purchased in this country in 1996 was produced domestically.  6   On average, every man, woman, and child in the United States purchases more than four pairs of shoes each year, a level of consumption that establishes this country as the world's largest importer of footwear.  7  In 1996, the United States imported 602 million pairs of leather footwear at a value of $8.2 billion.  8  Figure III- 1 shows the top 25 suppliers of leather footwear to the United States in 1996. As Figure III- 1 illustrates, two- thirds of U. S. leather footwear imports came from China and Brazil. China alone accounted for about 53 percent of all leather footwear imports by quantity (317 million pairs) and 42 percent by value ($ 3.4 billion). Brazil accounted for another 14 percent on both measures (86 million pairs of shoes at a value of $1.2 billion). Table III- 1 lists U. S. imports of leather footwear by country and value.  A wide variety of leather footwear is offered for sale in a myriad of U. S. retail establishments. In terms of dollar value, athletic shoes make up the largest component of U. S. sales, followed by dress shoes, casual shoes, work shoes, sandals, sport/ hiking boots, and western/ casual boots.  9  Family shoe stores are the retail outlets with the largest volume of sales, followed by shoe specialty stores, department stores, discount stores, national catalog chains, sporting goods stores/pro shops, mail order, factory outlets, and apparel specialty stores.  10   Figure III- 2 illustrates the chain of production within the international foot- wear industry. This schematic also highlights relationships among the various entities responsible for production. The key actors can be described as follows:         Retailers  typically sell products obtained from U. S. footwear manufacturers and design and marketing firms. Some, however, function as their own design and marketing firm, often with the assistance of overseas buying agents. A large share of the footwear sold in the United States is sourced directly from abroad through the retailer's overseas buying offices and/ or buying agents, for sale under the retailer's own brand name( s).   Design and Marketing Firms  design footwear, brands and trademarks for which they then develop marketing, promotion, and advertising programs. These firms do not generally own their own factories and include firms such as Nike, Reebok, and Brown Group. Instead, they contract out all production activities, mostly to foreign manufacturers. Design and marketing firms' communications with foreign producers occur via their own buying offices and/ or buying agents abroad. These firms typically sell their products wholesale (to retail distributors) or directly to consumers through their own chain of stores. U. S. manufacturers that source abroad, such as Nine West, Wolverine, and   Florsheim, follow similar practices.   Buying Agents  are often used by U. S. companies that do not have a large presence abroad; they can also be part of the U. S. company's own buying staff. Buying agents locate, inspect, qualify, and negotiate with foreign producers on behalf of the company in question. Their role may also include communication of quality standards and/ or corporate codes of conduct as well as monitoring for quality control and compliance with other standards. In the footwear industry, buying agents typically consult on design and fashion issues. Often, especially in children's footwear, they have trademark licenses which they sub-license to retail customers.

However, they work directly for U. S. retailers, manufacturers or design and marketing firms.   Contractors , also known as ""producers"" or ""manufacturers,"" are usually independently owned businesses that are responsible for the actual manufacturing of footwear for sale in the United States. These contractors typically own and operate their own factories, but many also delegate certain parts of the manufacturing process to subcontractors (smaller, more specialized factories or workshops).     Because of the number of actors involved in the footwear production chain, rarely is a single entity responsible for the design, production and sale of a pair of shoes. Moreover, this multi-layered system of production tends to isolate the final consumer from the manufacturer and often affects the dissemination of information among the relevant parties.  C. Child Labor in the Leather Footwear Industry   Leather, a natural material, has certain properties that makes automation difficult in some stages of footwear production.  11  Thus, certain aspects of production have traditionally been performed manually. For instance, to produce leather uppers, each hide must be inspected for imperfections and quality variation; some leather must also be cut one layer at a time.  12  Prefitting operations, e. g., stitch marking, seam rubbing and taping, cementing (or gluing), folding, and eyeletting, are also labor intensive.  13  An upper can involve as many as 60 separate stitching operations, depending on its design. Some can be done by machine; others are done by hand, particularly decorative moccasin seams.  14  Soles and heels are attached to the upper: by cementing, molding, or sewing, processes which can be labor-intensive.  Evidence suggests that in some countries many of these labor-intensive operations are often performed by children. Many reports indicate that child labor occurs most frequently in the informal sector of the industry, where government regulations either do not apply or are not enforced.  15  Children are found cutting, hammering, folding, gluing, marking, hand-sewing, hammering studs, and sanding the soles of shoes.  16  They often work in home- based or small workshops that frequently supply shoe parts for larger, exporting firms.  17  Working conditions are often unhealthy and dangerous. In many workshops, children are exposed to toxic fumes, solvents, and other dangerous chemicals,  18  which may cause skin and respiratory diseases.  19  Children are also exposed to work hazards such as knives and cutters or scrapers, and are rarely provided with protective clothing (e. g., gloves, masks or boots).  20  Child labor has also been observed in the leather tanning industry, which supplies raw materials to footwear producers.  21 The actual number of underage workers in the leather footwear industry is difficult to determine.  22  Data on child workers for the export-oriented portion of the industry are likewise difficult to isolate since subcontracting arrangements often involve small-scale factories, workshops, and home production.  23   Brazil Child labor has been documented in home-based and subcontracting operations in Brazil's two major footwear producing regions.  24  A recent ILO- sponsored study of child labor in two cities of the Vale dos Sinos, in the State of Rio Grande do Sul, documents the existence of child labor and describes some characteristics of 7-14 year old child workers.  25  In Franca, located in the State of Sao Paulo, local union representatives conducted a UNICEF and ILO- sponsored study of children who worked in the footwear industry while simultaneously attending school.  26   The Vale dos Sinos study reveals that children are employed primarily in small workshops and in household production of goods and services supplied to many medium and large-sized leather footwear firms. The children usually work between 4 and 7 hours daily; most give part or all of their salary to their parents.  27  In these workshops, children perform manual functions such as hand sewing, stitching, gluing, attaching buckles, poking holes in leather, pounding tacks in heels, and sanding and buffing footwear.  28  Because much of this work takes place in clandestine, informal workshops, conditions tend to be much worse than those in larger firms.  29  The greatest hazard in these workshops is exposure to glue and other solvents that have been demonstrated to cause respiratory ailments, nausea, lethargy, and sometimes irreversible damage to the functioning of the immune system, nervous system, and the liver.  30  Dangerous working instruments contribute to injuries such as cuts, bruises and punctures. Injuries sometimes result in amputations.  31   Brazil's half- day public educational system also may contribute to the em- ployment of children.  32  Because most parents in the informal workshops cannot afford child care, their children often spend the rest of the day helping them at work. The ILO Vale dos Sinos report indicates that 27 percent of children surveyed worked before or after school because they had ""no other place to go.""  33  Some municipal governments and NGOs have responded to this dilemma by establishing complementary activities for children during non-school hours.  34   A 1994 report on child labor in Franca found that 73 percent of 7-14 year olds who worked and studied were employed in the footwear industry; most of these children worked in home production.  35  Visits by U. S. Department of Labor officials to small workshops and production facilities in Franca confirm that child labor may still be a problem in footwear production.  36  However, it appears that the number of child laborers has decreased from just a few years ago when Franca was dubbed Brazil's ""capital of child labor.""  37  This reduction is reportedly the result of a variety of economic, social, and political developments. Among these are plant closings in the footwear industry, which have reduced labor demand and created a pool of skilled, unemployed adult workers.  38  To the extent that some firms are attempting to raise quality and productivity through increased investment in automation and in-plant production, this has also reduced the opportunities for child labor.  39  Finally, it appears that, especially in the city of Franca, partnerships between government, industry, union, and NGO representatives to combat child labor have been instrumental in increasing awareness of the problem and reducing its incidence.  40   However, the reports mentioned above and U. S. Department of Labor interviews with numerous representatives from NGOs, unions, government, and industry, confirm that children continue to work in Brazil's footwear industry. According to the Ministry of Labor, the multi-layered structure of production, the high mobility of small suppliers, and the existence of household producers has made it difficult for Ministry of Labor inspectors to locate children working in this sector.  41  These same factors have complicated efforts to determine the number of children working in footwear production and overall trends in child labor. Further study is required to assess the scale of the child labor problem and the impact of both public and private efforts to combat it.  42   China   The closed nature of the Chinese political system and a lack of statistical data make it very difficult to obtain reliable information about the incidence of child labor in China as a whole, or the leather footwear industry in particular. A recent report by the ILO International Program on the Elimination of Child Labor (IPEC) states that ""although child labour is certainly not yet that much entrenched in China as in many other countries in the region, it is a growing problem.""  43  According to IPEC, the problem seems to be more prevalent in the southern coastal cities, mainly because that region has been developing rapidly.  44  Because there are virtually no available data on child labor in China, most reports are based on anecdotal information.  45  In some cases, estimates of the incidence of child labor are based on other indicators such as school attendance.  46  Information received by Department of Labor officials visiting China indicates that child labor may not be very prevalent in the foreign-invested enterprises of the special economic zones (SEZs) where most of the production of exported footwear takes place.  47  The reportedly low incidence of child labor in the Chinese leather footwear industry may be attributed to a significant number of adult workers seeking these jobs, the one-child-per-family policy, and the societal importance placed on education and mandatory schooling. Child labor, however, may be more common in family enterprises in rural areas or in private enterprises or township and village enterprises.  48   Generally, child labor in the Chinese leather footwear industry has not been among the labor concerns raised by NGOs and international organizations, but there have been reports of forced overtime, minimum wage violations, corporal punishment, and safety and health hazards.  49  A recent study of the footwear industry in China by the Asia Monitoring Resource Centre and the Hong Kong Christian Industrial Committee, non-governmental monitoring groups, concludes that ""compared with our research on the shoe factories in 1995, conditions today are even worse... . All categories of [Nike and Reebok's] Code of Conduct health and safety, freedom of association, wages and benefits, hours of work, overtime compensation, nondis- crimination, harassment and child labor are being violated.""  50  While the report made no allegations of use of child labor in Reebok factories, Nike and Reebok have both challenged the veracity of this report and have each issued point by point rebuttals to several of its claims, including those regarding child labor.  India In recent years, a number of reports have noted the use of child labor in India's leather footwear and tanning industries. For instance, a 1995 study estimated that children under 15 make up a significant portion of the leather workforce in the towns of Agra, Kanpur, Durg and Tonk.  51  These children reportedly make up 40 percent of flayers, 34 percent of tanners, 39 percent of manufacturers and repairers, and 36 percent of wage earners.  52  Recent reports from Mumbai [Bombay] indicate that children can be found assembling shoe components in subcontracting shops  particularly in Dharavi, a slum area notorious for using children in its leather and shoe-making units.  53  Many of the persons visited by a U. S. Department of Labor official in June 1997 acknowledged that children can be found in the cottage workshops of India's leather footwear industry.  Human Rights Watch/ Asia (HRW) reported in 1996 that the use of child labor in India's footwear industry may be growing. HRW reports that between 2,000 and 20,000 bonded child laborers  some as young as 6 or 7 are currently working in footwear production in the slums of Mumbai [Bombay]; these children are trafficked from the rural villages of Rajasthan. The HRW report describes the employment of children in footwear production as follows:      The slum . . . was a place of appalling squalor. The amount of footwear garbage  leather, plastic, and rubber  indicated a sizeable amount of production. The children do not make complete shoes, but their components. We saw children tracing heels on wooden two by fours and cutting them out with motorized saws; cutting women's leather uppers out of leather sheets; stamping brand names on the insoles of shoes and sandals; making the straps and uppers together; sewing uppers to insoles on sewing machines; stamping insoles out of sheets; stamping out soles (leather, rubber, wood); and transporting finished products to wholesalers. Every process involved in the manufacture of this footwear was done by children. Their work days begin at 5: 00 or 6: 00 a. m. and continue until 10: 00 or 11: 00 p. m. The children receive no wages; instead, their parents receive a [small] payment at the time the child is taken away.  54     There are also reports of children working in India's leather tanning industry  particularly in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh,  55  Andhra Pradesh  56  and Tamil Nadu. Evidence suggests that thousands of children may be employed in leather tanneries in Tamil Nadu  some estimate that in the town of Dindigul alone, 30 percent of the tannery labor force is children, many of whom work with dangerous chemicals without any protective clothing.  57  The numbers may be greater in Andhra Pradesh.  58  One report of children working in tanneries that supply products for the export market describes children cleaning chemical drums and placing hides inside the drums. In one such case, a child fell asleep while cleaning a drum and was killed when the drum was subsequently reemployed and refilled with chemicals.  59 Mexico   Child labor in the Mexican footwear industry has been reported for a number of years. In 1994, a Wall Street Journal reporter found children as young as 10 working 8 hour days gluing soles to shoes in small factories in the state of Guanajuato.  60  A report by Defense for Children International also noted that the athletic and casual shoe industry of León, in the State of Guanajuato, employed numerous children who worked with hazardous materials without protective wear.  61   Statistics on the incidence of child labor in the Mexican leather footwear industry are not available. However, interviews with NGOs, industry representatives, and labor unions in June 1997 indicate that there is an extensive child labor problem in the household production of leather footwear.  62  In the states of Guanajuato and Jalisco, it is a practice of the footwear industry to subcontract the stitching of uppers (for moccasin style shoes) to household production.  63  Some factory managers indicated that the children usually help with the work only after school, but that there were no instructions or subcontract provisions on the use of child labor.  Pakistan   A number of allegations have been made about child and bonded labor in the Pakistani leather and footwear industries which are concentrated in the cities of Lahore and Karachi. In 1994, the International Textile, Garment & Leather Workers Federation reported that children 10 and 11 years old were sick and deformed from years of sniffing glue while working in a shoe factory.  64  A recent study of leather tanneries in Kasur found children as young as six working for 10 hours a day in filthy and dangerous conditions:     Children yanked out hair from salted hides and skins with bare hands; they loaded and unloaded raw and semi- finished hides into and from large rotating drums; some of them had to disappear into the drums to retrieve semi-finished hides which stuck to the walls of drums reeking of poisonous gases; some of them transported filthy hides within the tannery from one process to the other; elder children peeled off waste from raw hides; and mixed dangerous fuming chemicals into buckets, simply pouring them into drums and small ponds; on the roof tops many small children spray painted leather pieces, inhaling formaldehyde and depositing layers of spray in their hair; their clothes coated in several shiny layers of black and brown.  65     Employment of children in the leather and footwear industries is prevalent in small, family-owned workshops. About 1,500 children are estimated to be working in family owned leather tanneries in Kasur (near Lahore).  66  The use of protective clothing is not widespread among the children (or adults) working in these tanneries.  67 According to interviews with government, business, labor and NGO representatives, one of the major factors contributing to the incidence of child labor in Pakistan is the lack of compulsory education. Some of the major problems relate to access, quality, affordability and rigidity of the formal education system.  68  In a survey conducted in Kasur, children who work in tanneries had a school dropout rate of 63 percent, while the average time spent in school was one year.  69  These children gave a number of reasons for leaving school: physical abuse by teachers; teachers forcing students to do domestic chores at their homes; boring classes, and parents pulling children out of school for economic reasons.  Subcontracting (or outsourcing) seems to be prevalent in footwear production and leather tanning. A number of footwear manufacturers acknowledged that children may be found working in footwear production on a contract basis.  70  A 1995 report by the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan found that while most children worked in the smaller tanneries (usually in groups of 5 to 15), larger tanneries also employed children.  71  These children, who were almost entirely employed on a contract basis, earned $7.50 to $15 per month. As in India, it appears that in Pakistan subcontracting shoe production and leather processing services to small, family owned enterprises is used to avoid prosecution under child labor laws.  72  Currently, production of leather goods and footwear in Pakistan is mostly for domestic consumption although some of the production is exported. A number of exporters stated that they plan to expand exports to the United States, particularly of leather garments.  D. Consumer Labeling Programs in the Leather Footwear Industry   1.  Introduction   Although private-sector initiatives to reduce child labor in the leather foot- wear industry exist in many countries, partnerships to eliminate child labor are notable in Brazil and Italy. In Brazil, government, industry, labor union, and NGO efforts have helped to reduce the number of children working in the footwear industry. In particular, programs of the Abrinq Foundation for Children's Rights and the Pro-Child Institute have raised awareness among Brazilian footwear producers about child labor and encouraged the development of educational and rehabilitation programs to address child labor issues. The labeling programs of the Abrinq Foundation and Pro-Child Institute are described below.  In March 1997, the Italian Association of Leather Manufacturers and the textile and leather working unions of the three major labor confederations signed an agreement to develop a certification process to guarantee consumers that leather products were manufactured without the use of child labor. The agreement also includes provisions on establishing some type of ""mark"" to signify that a product was manufactured without any child labor.  73   The Italian agreement calls for the establishment of an independent auditing agent to certify the conditions under which products bearing the mark are made. Companies which are members of the Italian Association of Leather Manufacturers will be inspected and clauses will be inserted into any subcontracts that the companies have providing for the termination of services if child labor violations are found.  74  Strategies for promoting the mark in Italy and other parts of Europe are now being evaluated. In addition, a study is underway to determine whether the mark should be placed on the products themselves or used as a certification for products being distributed through authorized outlets. Sponsors of the agreement see it as a follow- up on their commitment under the Italian National Agreement Against Child Labor of 1996 to eradicate child labor and as a way of cutting down sales of counterfeit or competing products made in the underground economy, where labor standards are low.  75   2. Abrinq Foundation for Children's Rights   a. Program Overview  The Abrinq Foundation for Children's Rights (Abrinq) is a non- profit organization established in 1990 in São Paulo by members of Brazil's Association of Toy Manufacturers. Abrinq's mission is to ""move and mobilize society regarding childhood matters, promoting social and entrepreneurial engagement to address child welfare issues through political actions in defense of children's rights and through exemplary actions which may be disseminated and multiplied.""  76   The Abrinq Foundation is comprised primarily of Brazilian entrepreneurs, political and social scientists, academics, and other professionals who provide financial support and/ or technical advice to the Foundation. Abrinq receives funding and in kind contributions from a number of sources, including Brazilian companies, in- ternational organizations, and individuals.  77  Many of the contributions are project-specific and involve the participation of the contributing entity. Abrinq's strategies include: political action, publicity, project development, and fundraising for programs which benefit children. The Foundation focuses on a number of child welfare issues, including health and nutrition, education, child labor, family and community, and rights advocacy.  In April 1995, the Abrinq Foundation created the Child-Friendly Company Program ( Programa Empresa Amiga da Criança ) aimed at eradicating child labor and promoting child- friendly policies in a number of Brazilian industries. This program, which includes a labeling component, encourages companies to eliminate child labor and invest in projects which improve the quality of children's lives.  Some of the sectors participating in this program include services (restaurants, parking garages, photo developing establishments), finance (credit card companies and banks), and manufacturing (toys, shoes, automobiles). Companies that are certified as ""child-friendly"" are allowed to use the Child- Friendly Company label, which reads: "" Child-Friendly Company  An Initiative of the Abrinq Foundation for Children's Rights. "" The label signifies that no child labor was used in the production of the company's goods or services and that the company has developed or is contributing to a project that benefits children. Child-Friendly Companies use the label at their own discretion. For example, the label may be placed on products, packaging, or a company's advertisement and promotional materials. Although a number of companies in the program export goods to the United States, there are currently no products being exported to the United States with a Child- Friendly Company label.  78   b. Program Structure  The Abrinq Foundation is responsible for overseeing the implementation of the Child- Friendly Company certification and labeling program. The Foundation has very specific eligibility criteria that companies must meet prior to joining the labeling program. These include:  79     making a formal commitment not to use child labor, as defined by Brazilian law;   promoting this commitment to their network of suppliers and clients; and   creating or supporting programs to educate and train children.     The process by which companies are certified is as follows:  80     interested companies sign a commitment letter and provide the Abrinq Foundation with documentation demonstrating that they meet the eligibility criteria;   the Abrinq Foundation reviews this information and, in the case of companies in industries with a high incidence of child labor (e. g., sugar and footwear production), consults with its network of partners, which includes labor unions, employers associations, NGOs, and public officials;    81   the findings of the initial review undergo an internal review process conducted by Foundation representatives and business persons on the Foundation's Administrative Council; and   companies that successfully complete the review process are provided with a certification letter and a copy of the artwork for the label during a public ceremony certifying them as a Child-Friendly Company.    82     The certification and label are valid for one year. The company may be re-certified by reiterating its commitments and undergoing a new investigation by Abrinq along the lines of the above-mentioned review procedures. A decertification process has also been established through which reports of child labor violations are investigated by the Foundation. Companies are given 30 days to correct violations, and if unsuccessful, are removed from the program and denied use of the label.  Child-Friendly companies do not pay fees or dues to the Abrinq Foundation in order to participate in the labeling program. The Child-Friendly Company program is financed through a grant provided in 1995 by Yakult S. A., a Japanese company which produces dairy products in Brazil.  83  This grant allowed Abrinq to establish and finance the operation of the certification and labeling program. This unique funding structure gives the Child-Friendly Company program a significant amount of independence. However, because the funds provided by the initial grant are limited, Abrinq is currently searching for new sources of funding for the program.  c. Program Implementation  Currently, the Abrinq Foundation cooperates with about 1,700 firms on specific projects. The Child-Friendly Company program has about 380 participating companies. Approximately 40 of these companies are manufacturers of leather footwear, nearly all located in the city of Franca.  84   One of the main components of the Child-Friendly Company program is a label indicating that the participating company has not used child labor in the production of its goods or the provision of its services. In the case of Abrinq, the label is part of a certification program for the company and not for a specific product. Child-Friendly companies are also expected to promote the non-utilization of child labor to their network of suppliers. The certified companies, however, are not required to include a ""child labor-free"" clause in contracts with their suppliers or to verify that services that have been subcontracted were performed without illegal child labor.  Another aspect of the Child-Friendly Company program is the development or financing of educational and training programs for children. The Abrinq Foundation provides information to interested companies on the types of projects previously established by other companies. These social programs are not necessarily targeted to former child workers. Many Child-Friendly companies provide child care services and sports/ recreational facilities for after- school programs and fund professional and technical training projects.  85   The Abrinq Foundation raises awareness about child labor issues through newspaper advertisements, television and radio commercials, publications, and mass mailings. Companies are educated about the Child-Friendly program's requirements through training workshops conducted by the Abrinq Foundation staff as well as informational materials aimed at marketing the Child-Friendly Company label.  As discussed above, the Abrinq Foundation has an extensive pre- screening system to certify Child- Friendly companies. However, once the companies join the program, there are no formal monitoring procedures to ensure adherence to the certification and labeling program's requirements. The Child-Friendly Company program was designed to be ""self- monitoring"" and, in essence, relies on Abrinq's network of partners (e. g., labor unions, NGOs, workers, public attorneys, etc.) to notify the Foundation of possible child labor law violations. To date, Abrinq has not received any allegations of child labor law violations by a Child-Friendly company.  d. Findings from Site Visits  It is difficult to determine the level of public awareness about the certification and labeling program. Abrinq is currently developing an educational campaign to inform consumers about the Child- Friendly Company program and encourage consumers to buy products and use services that contain the label. The Foundation would like to have a larger number of participating companies prior to launching this campaign. Interviews with government, labor union, and NGO representatives indicate that those who were familiar with Abrinq's labeling program appear to have a positive perception of the Foundation's efforts to help children.  Although information about the program's goals and requirements is pro- vided to the companies, it appears that this information is not communicated to the workers of some of the participating companies. Interviews with workers and labor union representatives in June 1997 indicate that some of Abrinq's ""network of partners""  86  may not be aware of the certification and labeling program or the role they can play in monitoring the implementation of this program. For instance, some labor leaders in Franca were not familiar with Abrinq's labeling program or which footwear companies were participating in the program. Similarly, some workers for Calçados Samello did not know that this company was a Child-Friendly company. Overall public awareness seems essential to the labeling program since the effectiveness of Abrinq's self-monitoring policy depends on how well-informed all interested parties are about the Child-Friendly companies and the commitments they have made.  While Abrinq emphasizes the importance of examining the chain of production when addressing child labor issues, the agreement between Abrinq and its Child-Friendly companies only requires a commitment to work with suppliers and not an obligation to cease doing business with suppliers or subcontractors who use child labor. Abrinq officials acknowledge it is possible that suppliers of Child-Friendly companies may be using child labor. Some of the subcontracting arrangements U. S. Department of Labor officials observed in Franca and Novo Hamburgo could easily lead to this type of situation. For example, one government official in the city of Franca noted that child labor is not found in the larger firms which directly export to the United States, but children can still be found working in the small workshops that supply products and services to many of the large firms.  87  Nevertheless, Abrinq works with companies to maintain their commitment to promote the elimination of child labor throughout the production chain. For example, when Abrinq learned that a supplier for one of its Child-Friendly companies was to be sued by a local district attorney for child labor violations, the Foundation provided guidance to its member company and helped to get the supplier to agree to eliminate the use of child labor.  88   Because Abrinq's labeling program is relatively new, it is difficult to assess the impact of the program in reducing child labor in the footwear industry. However, the Abrinq Foundation has been instrumental in raising awareness among footwear producers and encouraging them to create educational and recreational projects which benefit children. Abrinq also has strived to encourage industry associations and other NGOs to develop similar programs aimed at eradicating child labor. Abrinq assisted the Pro Child Institute in the creation of a footwear labeling program in Franca and is currently providing technical assistance to the industry association of Novo Hamburgo in its effort to create a footwear industry code of conduct.  3.  Pro- Child Institute   a. Program Overview  The Pro-Child Institute ( Instituto Empresarial de Apoio a Formação da Criança e do Adolescente ""Pro- Criança"" ) is a non-profit organization founded in November 1995 by business persons in the city of Franca, Brazil. The Institute was founded by the Footwear Industry Association of Franca, the Trade and Industry Association of Franca, and the Regional Delegation of CIESP ( Centro das Indústrias do Estado de São Paulo ), a statewide industry association. In October 1996, the Pro-Child Institute launched the ""Program for the Prevention and Eradication of Child Labor in the Footwear Industry,"" which has as its main objectives the development of actions to: (1) prevent and eradicate child labor; (2) encourage and support children to stay in school, while raising awareness among the general public about the importance of formal education; and (3) encourage and support the professional and technical training of adolescents.  89   One of the components of this program was the development of a Pro-Child label which is placed on footwear products to indicate a company's adherence to the program's objectives. The label, which has been reproduced in Portuguese, English and Spanish, reads: "" Pro-Child Institute  No Child Labor was Used in the Manufacture of this Product."" Footwear manufacturers may place the label on the packaging, boxes, and tags of footwear products after obtaining authorization from the Pro-Child Institute. Companies participating in the program must:    make a formal commitment not to use child labor;   not subcontract services with suppliers who use child labor;   encourage a no- child labor policy throughout its chain of production;   be a contributing member of the Pro- Child Institute;   adhere to the Institute's regulations regarding the use of the label; and   place a no- child labor clause in contracts with other manufacturers and encourage them to also become members of the Pro-Child Institute.     In the context of the Pro-Child Institute labeling program, child labor is defined in accordance with Brazilian law, which prohibits the employment of children under the age of 14. Child labor is the only labor standard covered by the labeling program, and it applies to the production of both the finished product and chain of production inputs.  Currently, the Pro-Child Institute's labeling program is only operating in Brazil. Footwear manufacturers have initiated discussions with importers in the United States and other countries to start exporting footwear that contains the Pro-Child Institute label.  90   b. Program Structure  The Pro-Child Institute, which has seven staff members, oversees the implementation of the labeling program. The program operates as follows:     (1) Companies interested in joining the Institute sign a letter of commitment to participate in the Program to Prevent and Eradicate Child Labor in the Footwear Industry;    (2) The Pro-Child Institute provides each company with a certificate which outlines its commitment not to use child labor in the manufacture of its products, to develop programs which benefit children and adolescents, and to be a contributing member of the Institute; (3) The companies also sign a number of documents regarding the appropriate use of the label.     The Institute has established procedures for de- certification if a company is found to have violated any of the requirements listed above. The procedures involve a written warning and a notice to rectify the situation within 30 days. If the alleged violation is not resolved within the allowed period of time, the company is then de-certified and the use of the label is prohibited. To date, no company has been investigated or de-certified for an alleged violation of the program's requirements.  The operational cost of the Pro- Child Institute is approximately $30,000 monthly.  91  The Institute's operational costs, as well as the labeling program, are financed through private- sector contributions to the Pro-Child Institute.  92  Most of the contributions are made by members of the Institute who may also participate in the labeling program. The contributions are made monthly and range from $50-$200, depending on the size of the company. These funds also cover staff salaries and some children's projects sponsored by the Institute. There is no direct government involvement in the operation of the labeling program. However, the Institute receives technical assistance from a number of governmental organizations including: the Office of the Mayor of Franca, the Federal Department of Commerce and Industry, and the Federal Department of Education, Culture and Sports. International organizations such as the ILO and UNICEF also provide technical assistance.  c. Program Implementation  As of January 1997, the Pro-Child Institute had certified 67 companies, with 59 of these companies currently participating in the labeling program.  93  According to the Industry Association of Footwear Manufacturers of Franca, about 70 percent of its members are contributing members of the Institute, although not all of them participate in the labeling program.  94  The Institute and the manufacturers interviewed indicated that the cost of participating in the labeling program (including contributions to the Institute and the cost of placing the label in the packaging or boxes of footwear products) is so insignificant that producers absorb the expense without passing it along to consumers in the form of increased prices.  The implementation and monitoring of the labeling program is carried out by the Institute's staff which includes a six-member executive directorate and a managing director. As part of its pre-screening procedures, the Pro-Child Institute conducts site visits to companies that have applied for membership in the labeling program. The Institute's monitoring procedures include announced and unannounced visits to the certified companies, regular meetings with the companies, and periodic reports on the labeling program provided to the Municipal Councils for the Defense of Children and Adolescents Rights, ILO/ IPEC, UNICEF, the U. S. Consulate General in São Paulo, and the Abrinq Foundation.  95   The Institute conducts periodic workshops and meetings to educate partici- pating companies about the labeling program. During these meetings, manuals and other informational materials are distributed to certified companies. The manuals contain general information about the labeling program's requirements, suggestions on how to use the label, and updates on the educational/social projects being sponsored by the Institute on behalf of children and adolescents. The Pro-Child Institute has developed a series of educational and social projects for children and adolescents. These projects include: a health center for adolescents, resource centers for children between the ages of 7 to 12, vocational training centers, and recreational programs. Many of these projects serve as complementary activities to Brazil's four-hour school day.  d. Findings from Site Visits  Although it is difficult to assess the impact of the labeling program in reducing child labor, the Pro-Child Institute seems to have been effective in raising aware- ness among the larger footwear manufacturers in Franca.  96  In addition, the rehabilitation programs sponsored by the Institute are reaching some of the target population  children between the ages of 7 to 14. The Pro-Child Institute has also been very active in sharing its experiences with other footwear producing regions. The Institute is currently working with the Abrinq Foundation and the local footwear industry association in Novo Hamburgo to develop other initiatives that address child labor in footwear production.  According to the managing director of the Pro-Child Institute, the Institute uses a ""natural inspection"" process which is based on the concept of self-monitoring. The Institute may conduct unannounced visits to production facilities, but it primarily relies on various inspection and monitoring mechanisms already in existence, including ""denuncias"" or complaints of child labor made by labor inspectors and unions. Representatives of companies who visit suppliers on a regular basis are also asked to monitor the use of child labor.  Through interviews conducted in Franca, it appears that neither the Institute nor the participating companies have developed procedures to inform workers about the labeling program's guidelines and objectives. Of the three companies visited in Franca, only one, Samello, indicated that workers were informed about the company's code of conduct and membership in the Pro-Child Institute. Workers interviewed had seen a Pro- Child Institute poster at the Samello plant; however, they were not aware of the labeling program's details. Some of the workers confused a ""Made in Franca"" label with the Pro-Child Institute label. Even though Samello has been certified as a Child-Friendly company and is a member of the Pro-Child Institute, the company does not currently place either label on its footwear products.  The Pro- Child Institute requires that member companies encourage a no-child labor policy throughout the chain of production. Multiple layers of suppliers and the use of intermediaries ( gatos ) make dissemination of information and monitoring of companies' policies very difficult in the footwear industry. It appears that information about the labeling program may not be reaching the smaller firms and workshops (suppliers and subcontractors) that appear to be the main employers of children. To address this situation, the Pro- Child Institute is planning an initiative to increase awareness about child labor issues among footwear subcontractors in Franca.  97   E. Codes of Conduct in the Leather Footwear Industry   Voluntary codes of conduct have been in existence in the footwear industry for a number of years and are increasingly common among footwear manufacturers and retailers. In 1992, Reebok International was one of the first companies to initiate a formal, worldwide code of conduct concerning the treatment of workers who are employed by foreign suppliers. In August 1993, the Athletic Footwear Association (AFA) developed a statement of guidelines on practices of business partners.  98  The statement includes a number of voluntary guidelines  environmental, ethical, health and safety, legal and employment. One provision of these guidelines states that AFA members will not do business with contractors or suppliers who use child labor.  99  Similarly, in March 1995, a Charter on Child Labour for the footwear industry was adopted in Europe.  100  In April 1997, leaders from the U. S. footwear and apparel industries, labor unions, and consumer, human rights, and religious groups also agreed on a workplace code of conduct.  101   In the last few years, a number of footwear companies have included provisions in their corporate policies that govern the production of footwear imported into the United States. Some of these companies have publicly  available, well-defined codes of conduct describing the companies' policies regarding child labor and other labor standards. Other companies do not have formal codes but include child labor provisions on their purchase orders and other contractual documents. This section discusses the implementation of these policies by examining three basic elements: transparency, monitoring and enforcement.  102  Transparency refers to the awareness and understanding of the policies by foreign contractors, subcontractors, and workers. Monitoring refers to how companies oversee the implementation of their policies. Finally, enforcement refers to how companies deal with violations of their policies.  In order to gather information on the extent and implementation of codes of conduct and labeling programs regarding child labor in the U. S. footwear industry, the U. S. Department of Labor conducted a voluntary survey of 20 U. S. producers, design/marketing firms, and retailers of leather footwear products. ( See Box III-1 for a list of the companies surveyed and Appendix B for the Company Questionnaire). These companies were chosen using information from Kurt Salmon Associates.  103  The survey instrument was also discussed with the Footwear Industries of America and the Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America. The selection criteria included total sales, overseas production facilities or suppliers, and known codes of conduct. Information obtained from the survey and from Department of Labor site visits to production facilities in Brazil, China, India, Pakistan and Mexico is reported below. Sixteen companies responded to the survey: Adidas, Brown Group, Edison Brothers, Fila, Footstar, Genesco, JCPenney, May Department Stores, Nine West Group, Nike, Payless, Reebok, Stride Rite, Timberland, WalMart, and Wolverine.  1. Survey Results and Information from Site Visits  All of the respondents indicated that they import footwear directly from foreign footwear manufacturers. Twelve of these respondents stated that they also use buying agents or overseas buying offices to purchase footwear. Only one of the respondents, Timberland, indicated that it owns footwear manufacturing facilities abroad.  None of the survey respondents participate in a labeling program or import labeled footwear which claims to be child labor-free. Although codes of conduct have been in existence for a number of years in the footwear industry, labeling is a relatively new concept that has not been embraced by U. S. importers and retailers of leather footwear, and in fact, has been generally opposed. For example, the Foot- wear Distributors and Retailers of America recently stated that ""the use of labels may create a variety of problems which will greatly outweigh their utility, and that other means of communicating with customers about [child labor] and other issues are far preferable.""  104  However, many Brazilian companies whose principal U. S. importers include JCPenney, Cole Haan [Nike], Nine West, Fila, Brown Group, Edison Brothers, Sears, and Genesco  105  are already producing footwear for Brazilian consumption under one of the two child labor-free labeling programs discussed earlier in this chapter. Representatives of the Footwear Industry Association of Franca, who have been promoting one of the labeling initiatives in Brazil, noted that many U. S. importers have not wanted to import labeled footwear into the United States.  106     Nevertheless, all of the companies that responded to the survey have developed and implemented some type of corporate policy prohibiting the use of child labor in the manufacture of their products.  107  ( See Appendix C for copies of these policies). These policies are usually articulated in the form of codes of conduct, vendor standards, or statement of principles. Table III-2 illustrates the type of policies that are being used by respondents to prohibit child labor in the manufacturing of leather footwear.   TABLE III-2 Type of Policy Prohibiting Child Labor (Based on Responses to Department of Labor Questionnaire)     a  Company has a formal code of conduct, statement of principles or compliance certificate b  Company has a purchase order, letter of credit, or buying agent agreement, ehich contains a specific prohibition on child labor in overseas production.   Codes of conduct differ with respect to how child labor is defined. Respondents use a variety of methods to define child labor including ""national law"" and ""international standards."" Most of the respondents defined child labor as employment under the age of 14 or in accordance with domestic law. Only one of the respondents (Wolverine) defined it as employment under the age of 16.  a. Transparency  Foreign manufacturers' awareness of U. S. importers' corporate policies vary from country to country.    In Brazil, there was only limited awareness about U. S. importers' codes of conduct. Calçados Agabê officials stated that they had received a copy of  JCPenney's code but were not able to provide a copy.    108  The Nine West buyer in Brazil stated that the company does not currently have a code of conduct or written statement regarding child labor in the manufacture of its product.    109  Another Brazilian company, Calçados Paquetá, producing for JCPenney and Nine West, was not aware of any written policies from these companies regarding child labor or general working conditions.    110  Most of the large companies interviewed, however, were participating in one of the two child labor-free labeling programs currently operating in the footwear industry.   In China, Nority, Ltd., which produces for Reebok, Fila and Nortica, was very familiar with Reebok's Human Rights Production Standards but was not aware whether Fila or Nortica had a code of conduct.    111   In India, one of the companies visited, India Shoes, producing Nunn Bush brand footwear, indicated that it had received a code of conduct from its U. S. importer but was unable to provide a copy of the code.    112  FlorInd, an Indian subsidiary of   Florsheim, noted that it operates under a ""standing order"" from headquarters not to use child labor in the production of footwear.    113   Another company, Chevro Shoes producing for Wolverine, indicated that it was not aware of Wolverine's code of conduct but it had a ""gentlemen's agreement"" not to employ children.    114  According to Chevro representatives, the use of child labor was one of the first issues raised by Wolverine representatives before subcontracting with the company. K. H. Group, producing Hanover, Wolverine, and Cole Haan (Nike) shoes, did not appear to be aware of the codes of conduct of its U. S. footwear importers but had received a code from Sara Lee for the manufacture of Coach leather bags.    115  One of WalMart's subcontractors in India, Tej Shoe, was not aware of the WalMart code of conduct.    116   In Mexico, nearly all of the footwear producers interviewed were unfamiliar with the codes of conduct of their U. S. importers including   WalMart, Timberland, and H. H. Brown.  117  Only one company, Calzados   Celis, producing for Stride Rite, was able to provide a copy of a Stride Rite/ Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America Manufacturers Certificate    118  which included a statement on child labor.     A number of the respondents (Nike, Payless, Reebok and WalMart) indicated that their policies are required to be posted in the production facilities of their suppliers. In addition to requiring its vendors to post the code in a visible area for all employees, WalMart also provides a telephone number for reporting allegations of code violations.    In Brazil, only one of the companies interviewed by U. S. Department of Labor officials, Calçados   Samello, stated that its child labor policy is communicated through posted signs and during periodic meetings with workers.    119   Two other companies, Calçados Agabê (producing for   JCPenney) and Calçados Paquetá (producing for JCPenney and Nine West), do not post or inform their workers about U. S. importers' codes of conduct.    In China, U. S. Department of Labor officials observed that Nike's code of conduct was posted both in English and Chinese in the Pegasus factory that produced for Nike.   Nority, Ltd., which produces for Reebok and Fila, only had the Reebok code of conduct posted.    In India, K. H. Group, producing for Hanover, Wolverine and Cole Haan (Nike), was not aware of any of its U. S. footwear importers' codes and therefore did not post them. Similarly, Tej Shoe, a WalMart subcontractor, was not aware of and did not post WalMart's code of conduct.     A number of the respondents' policies address child labor in the chain of production (subcontracting operations), including Adidas, Edison Brothers, Fila, May Department Stores, Reebok, Stride Rite, WalMart, and Wolverine. For example, Wolverine prohibits use of child labor by its partners or sources and their sources or vendors. Edison Brothers and Stride Rite do not accept goods from partners that use child labor in any manner. Adidas also states it requires manufacturers to ensure that subcontractors comply with all applicable laws, including those prohibiting child labor.    The Adidas representative in Brazil, however, stated that Adidas' child labor policy is not communicated to its subcontractor because child labor is not a problem and adult labor is readily available.    120    In India, Chevro Shoes, producing for Wolverine, and K. H. Group, producing for Hanover, Wolverine and Cole Haan (Nike), sometimes subcontract the manufacture of footwear to household producers who are often company employees, and where children may help out in production.   In Mexico, Calzados Celis, producing for a number of companies including Stride Rite, subcontracts the stitching of uppers, moccasin style shoes to household production and acknowledges that child labor may be a problem in home production.    121   Firhaj Footwear, a Wolverine subcontractor in Pakistan, stated that the company had been asked to certify that child labor is not used in the production process; the certification was requested in letters of credit issued by the banks of European importers. Firhaj Footwear also provided a copy of a letter from its corporate headquarters stressing the importance of complying with child labor laws and ordering strict compliance.      b. Monitoring  Monitoring procedures used to oversee the implementation of the codes of conduct differ among the survey respondents. Some of the respondents (Nike, May Department Stores, Reebok, and WalMart) indicated that they conduct pre-screening inspections to ensure that foreign suppliers have the capacity to implement their codes of conduct. The monitoring strategies used by the companies surveyed include contractual monitoring (self-certification by foreign manufacturers), internal monitoring (e. g., in-country site visits and inspections by the company's employees or representatives), external monitoring (site visits and inspections by external par- ties, such as NGOs and auditing firms) or a combination of these strategies. Table III- 3 illustrates the different monitoring strategies used by U.S. importers and retailers of leather footwear surveyed.  All of the survey respondents indicated that they monitor overseas facilities for compliance with their corporate policies. The type and frequency of the monitor- ing differs among companies. The companies use their quality control personnel (in some cases buying agents or company representatives) to also oversee compliance with labor standards; this is a form of internal monitoring. In addition, three of the companies (Nike, Reebok and WalMart) use external monitors. Visits to overseas production facilities are conducted at least once a year and may be unannounced. One of the respondents, May Department Stores, indicated that visits by buying agents are conducted as often as six times per year; two of these visits are unannounced.    In Brazil, the Nine West buyer relies on the Ministry of Labor inspectors to oversee compliance with labor laws while JCPenney reportedly makes unannounced visits to Calçados Agabê at least once a year to verify code compliance.    122   In China, Pegasus International indicated that Nike regularly inspects its facility but that its other buyer, Dr. Scholl's (Brown), has clauses in its contracts but never checks for compliance with those conditions.    123   Chevro Shoes, the Wolverine subcontractor in India, indicated that Wolverine conducts regular inspections of the production facilities.    124  Similarly, Tej Shoe, producing for   WalMart, noted that it receives frequent visits from WalMart representatives.  125  K. H. Group, producing for Hanover, Wolverine, and Cole Haan (Nike), also indicated that it receives frequent inspections but did not specify by which of the U. S. importers.    126     TABLE III-3 Monitoring Strategies for Compliance with International Child Labor  Policies (Based on Responses to Department of Labor Questionnaire)     a  Company relies on guarantees made by suppliers through contractual documents or certificates that they are adhering to the company's policies. b  Company uses site visits and inspections by company staff, buyer agents, or other parties to verify that suppliers are actually implementing the codes of conduct. c  Company uses external accounting, auditing, testing or consulting firms, NGOs or international organizations to monitor labor practices   1  Company reported that an internal monitoring program is currently being developed. 2  Company reported that its plans to start using external monitors in the near future.   Contractual monitoring (manufacturer's certification or purchase order re- quirements not to use child labor), in conjunction with site visits and inspections, is used by 14 of the respondents.      In Brazil, the Nine West buyer stated that there are no written agreements with subcontractors, except for purchase orders, and that business arrangements are based on well- established personal relationships with manufacturers.    127   In Pakistan, Service Industries stated that their European wholesale purchasers have asked them to certify that Service's products do not include child labor in the production process.      c. Enforcement  Enforcement refers to how companies deal with violations of their corporate policies. Most of the survey respondents indicated that willful non-compliance with the companies' policies may result in canceled orders or termination of the business relationship.  128  Many of the survey respondents have included enforcement provisions in their codes of conduct. Edison Brothers' code of conduct, for example, states that if a violation of any provision of the code is discovered, an investigation into the alleged violation may be conducted and corrective measures imposed. Corrective measures could range from termination of the order, merchandise rejection or return, and/ or termination of the business relationship. Similarly, Stride Rite indicated that any partner which fails or refuses to comply with its standards is subject to immediate cancellation of all outstanding orders as well as refusal to continue to do business in any manner with that partner.  Only a few of the respondents (Brown Group, Nike and Reebok) acknowl- edged they had found violations of their codes of conduct. In some cases, violations included the use of child labor as well as violations of other labor standards, including minimum wage and safety and health provisions. The companies addressed these violations in different ways. Brown Group indicated that counterfeit or false age documentation may result in the employment of minors. In these cases, the aid of local government officials is immediately secured to verify the authenticity of the employee's identification card; employees with false documentation are dismissed. Nike and Reebok have handled some child labor problems by changing their method of production to reduce or completely eliminate outsourcing or subcontracting  F. Conclusion  There are still many reports of child labor in the leather footwear industry, although reliable data on the actual number of children working in this industry are difficult to obtain. Children reportedly work in small workshops and households that supply larger firms on a subcontracting basis. Many footwear manufacturing processes are manual and fairly simple, leading to the use of children for certain production tasks, such as gluing and stitching leather uppers to soles. Children usually work long hours in dangerous and unhealthy conditions and earn very little. Lack of access to quality education appears to contribute to the incidence of child labor in many of the countries visited by Department of Labor officials.   The incidence and attitudes towards child labor in the footwear industry differ among countries. For instance, child labor in household production of foot- wear seems to be widely acknowledged in Mexico. In India and Pakistan, where the footwear industry has experienced some growth and codes of conduct are not widely implemented, there are reports that the use of child labor may be increasing. In Brazil, where child labor in the footwear industry was reported to be rampant a few years ago, there appears to be a reduction in the incidence of child labor. The Brazilian government has established the eradication of child labor as a priority; there are a number of partnerships between industry, trade unions, government and NGO representatives aimed at eliminating child labor, and two industry- sponsored labeling programs on child labor are currently operational in the footwear industry.  Although it is too early to assess the impact of these labeling programs in reducing the incidence of child labor in Brazil, anecdotal information suggests that the programs have been effective in increasing awareness about child labor issues among footwear manufacturers and establishing educational and rehabilitation programs for children. However, the effectiveness of both of the labeling programs discussed in this chapter  the Abrinq Foundation's Child-Friendly Company and the Pro-Child Institute seal  depends on the establishment and implementation of monitoring strategies. In addition, increasing public awareness of the programs and labels appears to be essential to the success of these programs given their reliance on external parties to monitor compliance with program requirements.  There is significant use of codes of conduct or other policies prohibiting child labor among U. S. importers of leather footwear. All of the sixteen respondents to the Department of Labor survey indicated they have a corporate policy regarding the use of child labor in the manufacture of their products; fourteen of these companies have well-defined codes of conduct which are publicly available. These policies usually prohibit the use of child labor, and often establish guidelines for the monitoring of foreign manufacturers and disciplinary actions for violations. The actual implementation of these policies, however, varies from company to company and from country to country. Awareness of the policies among foreign manufacturers, workers, and trade unions seems to be limited at best. Similarly, monitoring by U. S. importers is not consistent, even within the same country.  Labeling programs and codes of conduct are more effective if they are implemented in a transparent manner in which all interested parties, including plant managers, workers and trade unions, are well- informed about these policies. Labeling programs and codes of conduct, in combination with efforts by government officials, trade unions and NGOs, can be important tools for reducing child labor in the leather footwear industry.

Introduction The soccer ball industry of Pakistan, principally concentrated in the city of Sialkot, has been under scrutiny in recent years for employing child workers. Manyreports describe children stitching soccer balls in small rural workshops or in homes.  1  The widespread coverage of children stitching soccer balls galvanized consumers,labor and religious groups and government officials to call for a stop to this practice.In June 1996, the U. S. Secretary of Labor and members of Congress helped launch the  FoulBall  campaign to ensure that soccer balls used by American children arestitched by adults and not children.  2 The public attention led U. S. importers to enter into an agreement with Paki-stani manufacturers, the ILO and UNICEF to stop using child labor.  3  More recently, public attention has focused on the use of child labor in India's soccer ball industry, leading to negotiations between Indian soccer ball manufacturers, exporters, NGOsand international organizations to develop a code of conduct prohibiting child labor. In addition, individual companies have taken steps to assure consumers thattheir products are not made by children. They have done so by revising their production process or creating child labor labels. For instance, Reebok has centralized all its soccer ball production in a new factory.  4  Nike also changed its manufacturing process in Pakistan by creating new stitching centers in order to better ensure chil-dren are not stitching Nike soccer balls.  5  Some U. S. importers, including Reebok and Baden Sports, have begun to label their soccer balls as produced without child labor. These labeling programs are the primary focus of this chapter. Information about labeling programs has been obtained from the companies using labels, from surveys of U. S. importers and retailers, and from field visits to India, Pakistan and China by Department of Labor officials. Section B of this chapter presents an overview of the industry and the market for soccer balls in the United States. Section C examines the role children play in the production of soccer balls around the world. Section D describes various labelingprograms. Finally, Section E reports responses of U. S.- based soccer ball importers and retailers to the child labor issue, based on a voluntary survey.  B. Industry Profile Soccer, or ""football"" as it is known in most countries, is the world's mostpopular sport.  6  Although soccer gained popularity slowly in the United States, enthusiasm for the sport has grown in recent years.  7  In 1980, there were fewer than 1 million youths registered to play soccer; by 1996 this figure had tripled to over 3 million.  8 Growth in the volume of U. S. imports of soccer balls reflects this trend. AsTable IV- 1 illustrates, in 1989, U. S. soccer ball imports were valued at $15.7 million;by 1996, the comparable figure was $34.2 million, a growth of 118 percent.  9  FigureIV- 1 lists U. S. imports of soccer balls by country and value. Some 71 percent ofthose imports came from Pakistan, 19 percent from China, 5 percent from Indonesia,1 percent from India, and the remaining 4 percent from other countries.  10  Soccerballs are not produced in the United States.  11 Soccer balls generally consist of a number of synthetic leather panels stitchedtogether in geometric patterns on the outside with an inflatable bladder inside.  12   Panels in high quality balls are hand- stitched for durability.  13  Hand- stitching these panels together is a very labor- intensive process and is where children have been found working. Figure IV- 2 illustrates the chain of production within the international soccerball industry. This schematic also highlights relationships among the various entitiesresponsible for production. The key actors can be described as follows:  14     Retailers typically sell a wide range of sporting goods, including soccer balls. They are not normally direct soccer balls importers; instead, they order the balls from brand name merchandisers. Retail outlets selling soccer balls include nationwide sporting goods or soccer specialty stores, independent sporting goods stores, department stores, mass-merchandisers, and toy stores.   Importers/ Design and Marketing Firms/ Merchandisers develop ball specifications and marketing strategies to promote their particular brand. They do not own the factories producing the balls, but contract with foreign manufacturers who produce the made-to-order balls. Some merchandisers have their own retail outlets for the sale of soccer balls and other products.   Contractors are foreign manufacturers who produce soccer balls for U. S. importers/ design and marketing firms/ merchandisers. They may produce soccer balls for several different buyers. Contractors usually do some of the production in their factories (e. g., cutting and packing), and outsource stitching and other tasks to subcontractors.

As of 1996, Korea no longer produced soccer balls for the U.S. market.   Source: Official Statistics of the U.S. Department of Commerce          Subcontractors are individuals who function as middlemen between the  contractor and village   stitchers.  15  Subcontractors typically deliver soccer ball kits to workers in surrounding villages. After the stitching is completed, the subcontractor pays the stitchers and returns the completed kits to the contractor.   Stitchers sew together the panels of a soccer ball and glue in the inflatable bladder. They are employed by subcontractors, typically on a piece rate basis, and may work in a stitching center, small village workshop, or in homes.      C. Child Labor in the Soccer Ball Industry The use of child labor in the production of soccer balls has been documentedprimarily in Pakistan and India.  16  Soccer balls are also made in China and Indonesia, but there are no known allegations of child labor in the soccer ball industries of these countries. The manufacture of soccer balls is controlled from the city but decentralized to homes and small workshops in surrounding villages. At the city factories or warehouses, the designs are printed and the pieces are cut. These are then packed into sacks and handed over to middlemen or subcontractors who distribute them in villages to families and workshops, where stitching traditionally is done both by adults and children. Subcontractors provide soccer ball kits to village workshops and/or households, where workers hand-stitch individual pieces together, glue the bladder to the material, and sew in the final piece. Some of the larger subcontractors in Pakistan have up to 300 stitchers working for them.  17  In some instances, there may be two or more tiers of subcontractors, with the balls passing through many hands on the way from the stitcher to the manufacturer. Once completed, the stitched soccer balls are then brought back by the middlemen to the factories for packing andshipment.  Pakistan Nearly all soccer balls are made in and around Sialkot, Pakistan  a regionfamous as a soccer ball producing hub for at least 80 years.  18  Seventy-five percent of the world's soccer balls were produced in Sialkot in 1996.  19  It is estimated that there are about 10,000 urban workers and 30,000 rural workers in the 1,450 surrounding villages of Sialkot involved in the production of soccer balls.  20 As recently as 1995, Pakistani soccer ball manufacturers denied that children were stitching soccer balls. The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan noted that when they visited Sialkot in 1995, manufacturers seemed to have instructed their contractors not to talk about child labor, and taken the contractors to task, ""not so much for employing child labor as for letting it become visible.""  21  At the time, theCommission reported that they found many children working in the soccer ball industry, despite the local industry's best efforts to conceal the children from view.  22 In 1996, an ILO study in the Sialkot region estimated that more than 7,000 Pakistani children between the ages of 5 and 14 stitched balls on a regular, full- time basis.  23  In addition, large numbers of children worked part-time outside of school hours. The great majority of these children were boys. More than 90 percent of the children stitching soccer balls are between theages of 10 and 14.  24  Most work in small shops or at home.  25  Seventy percent of the children work 8 to 9 hours a day; others work 10 to 11 hours per day.  26  It is estimated that 19 percent of the boys and 36 percent of the girls have never attended school.  27  Twenty-two percent of the boys and 25 percent of the girls attend school and work.  28  Although most of the child workers can read and write, many havedropped out of school because of uninteresting curricula, unsympathetic teachers and an uncomfortable school environment.  29 A recent study conducted for the Soccer Industry Council of America (SICA)found that stitchers make between 20 to 30 Pakistani rupees, or approximately $0.50 to $0.75, per ball.  30  On average, children are paid 20 to 22 Pakistani rupees per ball, or about $0.50 to $0.55. Payment tends to vary according to ball quality.  31  Most high quality balls are stitched by adults at stitching centers. The ILO reports that children are not likely to stitch high quality balls because they are not strong enough to make the required stitches. The wages for high quality balls are almost double than thosefor lower quality balls.  32  Depending upon skill and experience, a person is reportedly able to stitch between 1 and 5 balls a day.  33 There have been allegations of debt servitude in the soccer ball industry in Pakistan,  34  charges denied by Pakistani manufacturers  35  and a recent Save the Children-UK report.  36  However, the study commissioned by the Soccer Industry Council of America (SICA), the Save the Children report and a study conducted jointly by the ILO and the Punjab Department of Labor acknowledge that many families in thesoccer ball industry take loans or advances from subcontractors.  37  The advances are generally repaid through a deduction in the amount paid to the stitchers.  38  Most reports, however, are careful to note that intergenerational debt-bondage is not prevalent in the soccer ball industry. India India's sporting goods industry has its roots in Sialkot, Pakistan. When India was partitioned at independence in 1947, many of Sialkot's skilled Hindi craftsmen migrated across the border into the Punjab, settling in Jalandhar, where the Indian sporting goods industry is now based.  39  The Indian sporting goods industry has expanded to include the areas of Meerut, Uttar Pradesh, and Gurgaon, Haryana. Most of India's sporting goods, including soccer balls, are exported to the United Kingdom. Allegations of child labor in India's soccer ball industry have appeared since 1994.  40  Although these allegations were initially repudiated by some members of the Indian Sports Goods Export Promotion Council, recent public statements by members of the industry are more qualified, denying that child labor is used inmembers' factories, but acknowledging that the practice may occur through the process of contracting out to homeworkers.  41  About 300,000 persons work in the sporting goods industry producing over 200 different products.  42  It is estimated that about 10 percent of this work force, or 25,000 to 30,000 workers, are children.  43 Soccer ball production in India is similar to that in Pakistan: middlemen distribute soccer ball kits provided by large factories to small workshops and homes in surrounding villages, where soccer balls are stitched and returned. A 1997 study by Christian Aid, a British NGO, found children as young as seven stitching soccerballs in their homes.  44  The report described children working in small workshops orat home in urban slum areas and remote villages.  45  They work for many hours stitching the soccer balls while sitting in a hunched, squatting position. Some of thechildren go to school as well as work.  46  The report quotes the director of a Jalandhar soccer ball company as saying, ""the football industry uses children at the age of 10or 12. The quantity of footballs exported is too much to employ all the people we need in factories. Women and children do it in their houses whenever they get freetime.""  47 As in Pakistan, stitchers are paid per completed ball. One major exporter stated that stitchers average 13 to 14 Indian rupees per ball ($ 0.37 - $0.39) for the low quality soccer balls, and between 20 and 22 Indian rupees per ball ($ 0.56-$0.62cents) for the most commonly produced medium quality balls. Some Indian children reportedly earn as little as 7 Indian rupees per ball, or about $0.20.  48   D. Consumer Labeling Programs in the Soccer Ball Industry 1.  Introduction Adverse publicity in the United States and Europe about children stitchingsoccer balls prompted some importers to adopt labels informing consumers that their products have been produced in a child labor-free environment. In some cases, these programs are accompanied by changes in production processes to prevent theemployment of children. Although some individual companies have developed labels for their soccer balls, the majority of the soccer ball industry has opted instead to implement avariety of different codes of conduct to prohibit and prevent child labor. At a November 1996 meeting of the World Federation of the Sporting Goods Industry (WFSGI), companies rejected the possibility of labeling products, concluding that ""our ownindustrial brand names were statements of quality and ethics in their own rights and any disclaimer put on a separate label would only weaken that statement and the perception of the brand.""  49  They emphasized that by labeling only some balls, unlabeled balls might unfairly be thought to be made by children.  50  On the other hand, the President of the WFSGI commented that over time, it might be conceivable that products would carry a stamp indicating membership in WFSGI. Since the WFSGI isan endorser of the Pakistan Partners' Agreement, such a stamp would imply that aball made in Pakistan fulfilled the no child labor requirements of this agreement.  51  In making this proposal, the President noted that for such a stamp to be credible, it must be backed up by a strong and transparent monitoring system in addition to an enforcement mechanism capable of denying the use of the stamp or expelling members found violating the agreement.  52 Notwithstanding the WFSGI policy, recent evidence shows that child labor labeling is becoming more common in the soccer ball industry. For example, both Reebok and Baden Sports recently began selling soccer balls with a label stating that the balls are not made by children. The Reebok balls are made in Pakistan, while the Baden balls are made in China. The retail chain Dunkin' Donuts sold promotional soccer balls with a no child labor label during the 1997 summer months. Additionally, in response to a Department of Labor survey, the Kmart Corporation provided letters from their suppliers indicating that their balls are, or will be, labeled child labor-free. These labeling programs are described in the next few pages.  2.  Reebok a. Program Overview Reebok International Ltd. (Reebok) is a leading designer, marketer and worldwide distributor of sports, fitness and casual footwear, apparel, and sporting equipment. Total sales for 1996 were approximately $3.5 billion.  53  Reebok, a publicly held corporation, issued a code of conduct known as the Reebok Human Rights Production Standards in 1992. Among other things, the code of conduct bars the use of child labor in making Reebok products.  Recognizing the high incidence of child workers in the Pakistani soccer ball industry, in June 1996 Reebok officials said they were planning to buy Pakistani-made soccer balls that they ""knew with certainty"" were not made with child labor.  54  Reebok contracted with Moltex Sporting Goods (Pvt.) Ltd., a Pakistani soccer and rugby ball manufacturer, and Reed and Associates, a French company specializing inresearch and development, sourcing and manufacturing of high quality soccer and rugby balls, to build a soccer ball manufacturing plant. The new facility, located in Sialkot, has been making Reebok balls since March 1997. Soccer balls produced for Reebok by Moltex bear the following label on one of the panels: "" Guarantee: Manufactured without child labor. "" According to company officials, the use of the label allows Reebok to communicate their policy to consumers and stakeholders interested in ending exploitative child labor. Reebok's decision to label soccer balls was based on two factors: (1) increasing concern by consumers about children stitching soccer balls;  55  and (2) Reebok's desire to distinguish itself from other brands by centralizing stitching and all other production processes in a single factory and requiring rigorous external monitoring of the facility. Reebok officials state they will be able to place their label on Reebok balls ""with absolute confidence. Our consumers will know that Reebok balls are, without any doubt, child labor-free.""  56 b. Program Structure The three major elements of Reebok's program include:  57     containment of all production inside a new facility in which all work on Reebok balls is performed, including stitching. All workers must be age 15 or older;   external monitoring to ensure that: a) children are not entering the workplace, and b) soccer ball panels are not leaving the factory where the risk exists that they may be stitched by children in stitching centers or in homes; and   support of education and/ or vocational education training for children in the  soccer ball manufacturing region or Pakistan.     Reebok officials acknowledge that there are additional costs associated with creating a new facility that will house all production processes. According to Peter Moore, Senior Vice President of the Global Soccer/ Rugby Division, this shift in manufacturing processes will cost Reebok approximately 15 percent more.  58  Reebok saysthese additional costs  associated with pensions, health insurance and transportation for workers at the new factory  will be absorbed by the company; the salesprice of Reebok soccer balls will remain the same.  59 c. Program Implementation According to Reebok, the Sialkot facility began making soccer balls in March1997. Reebok hired three independent monitors to check the effectiveness of the program. Two of the monitors are associated with human rights organizations,  60  and the third is a Lahore-based affiliate of a major U. S. accounting firm.  61  The two human rights monitors were asked to monitor the factory, interview workers, maintain ties to the local community, and visit surrounding villages to be sure no Reebok panels are stitched outside the factory. Each monitor has the right to inspect the facility on an announced or unannounced basis.  62  The third monitor was hired to audit factory records in order to correlate the number of balls produced with the number of stitchers in the factory.  63  Reebok intends to make monitoring reports publicly available upon request.  64 Reebok says the auditing firm conducted a test audit in March 1997.  65  A representative of the auditing firm acknowledged they visited the plant and recommended that a number of accounting measures be implemented so that the firm could begin auditing records by August 1997.  66  Reebok notes that because other soccer balls are also being made by Moltex, the auditing process is very difficult.Reebok plans to reassess the value of engaging the outside auditing firm in addition to the human rights monitors.  67 Reebok issued the human rights monitors' first report on August 14, 1997, summarizing their findings from March through July 1997.  68  During the first five months of the project, the monitors visited the Moltex facility nine times to determine if children were present; three of the visits were unannounced. As of June 4, the monitors had found 236 workers in the factory, including 176 stitchers; 179 artisans working on a contract basis were also present. No children were found at the Moltex facility. During an April 29 visit, the human rights monitors observed balls being made at Moltex for another major buyer.  69  The factory management said these balls were being sent out of the factory for stitching, but were not Reebok balls. In August, Reebok stated it had given Moltex a large enough order to fill up the company's manufacturing capacity, and non-Reebok balls would be out of the factory by September 30.  70 The monitors recommended that a plan be devised to clearly assure them that Reebok balls were not being stitched outside the factory. In May, Reebok authorized the human rights monitors to hire a guard to stand at the factory gate tomake sure no Reebok ball panels are commingled with panels for other buyers as they leave the factory to be stitched elsewhere. The guard, who reports directly to the human rights monitors, was hired in June. He has been instructed to make sure that no Reebok panels leave the factory, and that no completed Reebok balls are coming in from the villages or outside stitching centers where children might bepresent. As of the end of July, the monitors informed Reebok that the guard has not observed any problems with Reebok balls entering or leaving the factory. Reebok has commented on the monitors' report, stating that a number of health and safety concerns in the factory had been communicated to Moltex.  71  In response, large posters with Reebok's human rights production standards translated into Urdu are being sent to Pakistan. Finally, Reebok acknowledges that a number of record keeping procedures are not yet complete, such as establishing personnel records with historical data and creating worker identification cards. In addition to its new ball factory and monitoring project, Reebok is planning an educational project.  72  The company has a three-year plan to improve educational opportunities for children in villages in the Sialkot area, specifically targeting displaced child workers. Reebok is working with the Society for Advancement of Education in Sialkot to implement the plan.  3.  Baden Sports a. Program Overview Baden Sports, Inc. is a family- owned athletic ball manufacturer. Founded eighteen years ago, Baden sells baseballs, basketballs, broom balls, footballs, soccer balls,volleyballs and water polo balls. Baden now imports soccer balls directly from one manufacturer in China. Baden recently shifted suppliers from Pakistan to China due to ""complications facing the industry in solving this [the child labor] problem,""  73  and because they ""never found the manufacturers in Pakistan to be reliable or trustworthy, and our experience is that you cannot inspect with confidence or expect that the Pakistani companies will adhere to any monitoring programs.""  74  Recent consumer inquiries, combined with market research indicating great consumer interest in the elimination ofchild labor, are Baden's primary reasons for changing its supplier and production practices. Baden claims that by switching suppliers to China, it has ensured elimination of child labor in its production of soccer balls: ""With our newly automated manufacturing process for patent-pending stitched balls, we can now guarantee, and certifyon the ball itself, that no child or slave labor has been used in the production of oursoccer balls.""  75  A Baden representative also stated that the shift to China coincided with a corporate decision to produce machine-sewn balls.  76 Soccer balls imported by Baden bear the label: ""Certified: No Child or Slave Labor Used on this Ball."" Baden also intends to produce packaging and advertisements stating that no child labor is used in the production of their soccer balls. Baden began marketing soccer balls bearing the child labor-free label in 1997.  77  In a press release announcing the availability of the product, Baden CEO E. C.Schindler stated ""it is our goal to ensure that soccer is played by children, not made by children. We are so sure of the integrity and quality of our products, we certify it.""  78 b. Program Structure Baden soccer balls are stitched in China using sewing machines, leaving only the last patch to be hand-stitched after the ball is turned right side out and the bladder inserted.  79  This process is done entirely at a factory run by Kuan Ho Sporting Goods Company Ltd., a manufacturing facility located in Dongguan, Guangdong Province, China.  80  Baden believes that through machine stitching it can obtain better quality and greater production volume using fewer workers. Baden claims that it can produce soccer balls 50 percent faster using sewing machines than stitching the balls by hand.  81 Kuan Ho's manager explained the plant's recruitment policy to visiting Department of Labor officials. Under China's labor laws, no one under 16 years of age is permitted to work. About 400 of the 2,400 workers at the factory produce soccer balls.  82  According to Kuan Ho's manager, most of the workers are female, earning about 60 to 70 percent above the local minimum wage of 500 yuan ($ 60) a month, or up to 900 yuan ($ 108).  83  The work force is made up almost entirely of migrants from other provinces within China; according to the Kuan Ho manager, they have a stable workforce due to fairly liberal benefits, which include vacations and the possibility of returning home once a year.  84 Baden requires written certification from the manufacturer that child labor is not used in the manufacture of Baden products. According to Baden's Asia representative, the company also requires Kuan Ho to allow access to personnel records. c. Program Implementation Baden management states that the company's factory representative monitors the Kuan Ho facility weekly. The factory representative explained that he visits the plant to check for quality, design and child labor but did not indicate the frequency of his visits.  85  A form verifying the absence of child labor in the production of soccer balls is to be filled out during each visit and signed by Baden's factory representative and an officer of Kuan Ho.  86 Baden management states that, in addition to the procedures noted above, it requires its representatives to verify the no child labor statements and representations made by Kuan Ho officials. The factory representative told U. S. Department of Labor officials that during his factory visits, he accepts the word of the plant manager that they are not employing child labor.  87  In addition, Baden management stated that a representative from Baden's headquarters occasionally accompanies the factory representative on site visits to verify company policies are being carried out correctly. The Department of Labor team received a copy of Baden's inspection report of Kuan Ho that certifies no child labor (i.e., no workers under sixteen) was being used in the production of soccer balls.  88  The copy of the inspection report itself had been prepared but not yet signed by the Baden representative or the Kuan Homanager.  89 Baden has no set policy to deal with the discovery of a child worker.  90  KuanHo's plant manager was aware of Baden's child labor concerns even though Baden does not have a written corporate policy on human rights or a special training program that covers this topic.  91  Workers at Kuan Ho were not aware of the purpose of Baden's labeling program.  92  The firm's management believes that workers do not need to know about such a program, although human resource managers  who are responsible for the hiring  do.  93 Baden states that the price of its soccer balls will likely increase slightly as a result of the new manufacturing and monitoring process.  4.  Other Child Labor Consumer Labels More and more soccer ball companies are promoting child labor labels particularly since the February 14, 1997 signing of the Partners' Agreement to Eliminate Child Labor in the Soccer Ball Industry in Pakistan ( see Section E. 1). The Department of Labor has received information on seven such labels. All the labelspromise that the soccer balls are not made by children. Only one of the labeling programs, sponsored by Dunkin' Donuts, has a monitoring and certification component. Four of these labels are associated with brand-name soccer balls that are soldin retail outlets. The other two labels are produced both for retail outlets and youth soccer leagues/clubs in the United States. a. Dunkin' Donuts Promotion The spread of child labor-free labels for soccer ballsis illustrated by a soccer ball promotion conducted by Dunkin'Donuts franchise outlets in New England during the 1997summer season.  94  With any purchase, a customer could buy for $9.99 a hand-stitched soccer ball bearing three logos: the Dunkin' Donuts logo; that of the New England Revolution, the region's professional soccer team; and the statement ""Produced Without Child Labor."" Posters with a photo of Alexi Lalas, one of the star players of the New England Revolution, were placed in participating Dunkin' Donut stores; many of the posters stated ""Ball Produced Without Child Labor"" in their right bottom corner.  95  The promotion was originally intended to run during the months of June and July but was extended until all the balls in stock are sold. The idea to put child labor-free labels on the promotional soccer balls came from Dunkin' Donuts New England franchisees, who expressed concern about child labor being used in the production of soccer balls made in Pakistan.  96  In response, letters from the U. S. Sporting Goods Manufacturers Association (SGMA) and Talon Sports  97  (the Pakistani manufacturer) were sent to Dunkin' Donuts stating that the balls would not be made by children. A committee of Dunkin' Donuts franchisees was uncomfortable relying solely on the promises of the manufacturer and the trade association. They agreed to approve the campaign only if the balls were certified ""child labor-free"" by an independent organization. As a result of the franchisees' concern about the credibility of a ""no child labor"" guarantee, Dunkin' Donuts, working through a sports marketing consultant in charge of the campaign (Sports Team), requested that a Washington, DC- based NGO the International Labor Rights Fund (ILRF)  serve as an independent monitor. Consequently, ILRF designed a monitoring program to ensure that soccer balls produced by Talon in Pakistan for Dunkin' Donuts were child labor-free. A six- month agreement between Sports Team and ILRF granted ILRF monitors total access to all Talon facilities, including its factories and stitching centers. Talon provided the ILRF with a map of the 43 stitching centers, a list of the names of all workers, and all of its records. Talon also consented to unannounced visits by the monitors, granting them access to all facilities and the ability to talk to workers without the presence ofsupervisory personnel.  98  ILRF monitors reported that they did not find any instances of illegal child labor. At the end of the summer, Dunkin' Donuts representatives were to evaluatethe soccer ball promotion program and determine whether to launch a spring campaign and whether it should be expanded beyond New England.  99 b. Individual Company Labels Another example of new labels informing consumers that a soccer ball ismade without child labor is that of individual companies promising that their balls are made only by adults. In response to the Department of Labor's voluntary survey, the Kmart Corporation provided the Department with letters from Seneca Sports,Inc., Franklin Sports, Inc., Molten U. S. A. and Spalding Sports Worldwide stating thatthey have or are planning to have a labeling program for soccer balls sold in Kmart stores. All four of the companies have endorsed the Partners' Agreement to Eliminate Child Labour in the Soccer Ball Industry in Pakistan and seem to base some of their no child labor assurances solely on this agreement. The following is some brief information about the claims made by each company to Kmart.      In its letter to Kmart dated February 18, 1997, Seneca Sports,  Inc. certified that its manufacturing facility in Pakistan ""prohibits inhumane conditions, violations of human rights and the use of child labor."" The letter further states that ""our packaging will certify that no child labor was used in the manufacturing of Seneca Soccer Balls.""    100  The package containing the Seneca ball states, ""Seneca® balls are certified as free from child labor."" The box also states ""Seneca Sports® Certified."" A Seneca official informed the Department of Labor that in the past year it has been asking its Pakistani supplier, Awan Sports, for assurances that soccer balls produced for Seneca are child labor- free. The Seneca representative further stated that Awan Sports has consolidated all its soccer ball production into one facility, preventing the outsourcing of stitching operations, and thereby minimizing the chance of child labor. Both Seneca and Awan Sports endorse the Partners' Agreement.    101     Franklin Sports, Inc. informed Kmart on February 18, 1997 that  it is a member of the Partners' Agreement, noting that a monitoring system had been implemented to ensure compliance with the Agreement.    102  In addition, Franklin stated it will independently assure that: 1) factories manufacturing Franklin soccer balls will be monitored by an independent contractor on a quarterly basis, with reports available for review by Kmart management; 2) factories will use only factory managed labor in the production of soccer balls, eliminating any possibility that child labor could be used in a cottage industry environment; and 3) Franklin will include a visible mark/logo on packaging and/ or product stating clearly that no child labor has been used in the production of the product, no later than July 1, 1997.    103       The president of Franklin Sports explained that placing a child  labor-free label on the balls ""is a visible way to tell people that we are in compliance with the Partners' Agreement. Also, retailers want assurances that our balls were not made by children.""  104 In a follow-up interview with the Department of Labor, Franklin confirmed that effective July 1, 1997, a label reading ""Manufactured Without Child Labor"" is being printed on balls made in Pakistan and exported to the United States. Franklin believes that stitching centers are being set up to centralize production and better manage who stitches the soccer balls. Franklin notes that they are relying solely on the Partners'Agreement to monitor production. Franklin requires all its Pakistani manufacturers to be members of the Partners' Agreement.  105      Molten U. S. A., in a letter to Kmart dated February 21, 1997, stated that ""we can now guarantee that no child labor will be used in any phase of the production of soccer balls supplied to Kmart Corporation."" The letter further states that Molten U. S. A. ""will begin to include a sticker on the cosmetic package referencing the child labor issue as soon as the stickers are produced. This should be no later than March 15."" A representative of Molten explained that its soccer balls are made in Pakistan, India and China, although the labels described in their letter to Kmart refer only to balls made in Pakistan. The representative stated that both Molten and their Pakistani supplier, Sublime Sports, are members of the Partners' Agreement. As of mid-August, however, Molten had not put ""no child labor"" labels on its Pakistani-made soccer balls. The company maintains that it is in the process of investigating the issue of child labor in Pakistan, and wants to ensure that any child labor- free guarantee made by Molten is absolutely credible.    106     Spalding Sports Worldwide stated in a February 21, 1997 letter to Kmart that all Spalding soccer ball manufacturers comply with the industry criteria and Spalding's Worldwide Labor Policy. The letter further states that Spalding is a member of the Partners' Agreement. Finally, the letter states that Spalding has added the following logo to all its soccer packages: ""No Child Labor Used to Produce This Product."" A representative of Spalding explained that Spalding sources 75 percent of its soccer balls from Pakistan; the remaining balls are made in China, but are molded and not hand- stitched. Spalding's two Pakistani manufacturers, Recto Sports    107  and Taj Mahal, are members of the Partners' Agreement. Spalding requires its manufacturers to certify Spalding balls have been produced without the use of child labor. Additionally, Spalding says that its quality control personnel visit the Pakistani facilities frequently and ensure that no child labor is used.    108       c. Child Labor Labeled Soccer Balls Provided to Youth Soccer Leagues In addition to the five companies listed above, other companies selling ballsdirectly to youth soccer leagues are making no child labor"" claims. While there maybe a number of companies supplying labeled balls to youth soccer leagues, the following two have come to the attention of the Department of Labor.      The Department of Labor obtained a soccer ball used at ""The  1997 Virginian Tournament,"" held in Springfield, Virginia, which carries the label ""No Child Labor Involved: Adult Sewn Product."" According to the information printed on the ball, it was made in Pakistan and imported by American Challenge, a U. S. importer of soccer balls. American Challenge officials informed the Department of Labor that its Challenge soccer balls are manufactured exclusively by JSD Sports (Pvt.) Ltd. in   Sialkot, Pakistan.  109  American Challenge has provided the Department of Labor with a letter from the Assistant Director of Labour Welfare, Government of the Punjab, stating that the mentioned manufacturer ""is abiding by all the by-laws in relation with employment of 'child labor' and there is no worker in the factory below the age of fifteen years. It is further certified that all workers/employees are free to leave the job and no bonded labour is involved in the manufacturing of products of the said concern.""    110  American Challenge stated that the company has been producing soccer balls with a ""no child labor"" label since January 1997. The soccer balls are sold to various dealers and individuals.    111     The American Soccer Company supplies soccer balls to ADULT  youth soccer leagues, soccer clubs, and stores under thebrand name SCORE. In the past year, the American Soccer Company began to distribute SCORE soccer balls with a PRODUCT label stating, ""Adult Sewn Product."" A SCORE representative said that placing the labels on the balls coincided with the signing of the Partners' Agreement, of which they are a member. SCORE requires that its Pakistani manufacturers be members of the Partners' Agreement as well. One of SCORE's suppliers in Pakistan is Talon Sports. Talon has provided letters to SCORE assuring that they do not use child labor in the production of their soccer balls. SCORE hopes to send company representatives to Pakistan at the end of the year to visit Talon and verify the no child labor assurances are accurate.    112     The two major organizations that sponsor and regulate youth soccer leagues in the United States, the United States Youth Soccer Association, Inc. (USYSA), andthe American Youth Soccer Organization (AYSO), have both publicly condemned the use of child labor in the manufacturing of soccer balls.  113  The official equipmentsupplier of the USYSA, the larger of the two groups, is Adidas, which does not place labels on its balls. The official ball of the AYSO is Spalding, which is placing child labor-free labels on AYSO sanctioned balls (see above). The AYSO states that is has obtained a guarantee from Spalding that its manufacturers do not engage in violation of children's rights, and that no child labor is used in the manufacturing of any of its products. Prior to this year, the official ball of the AYSO was SCORE, which is now placing no child labor labels on some of its balls.  E. Codes of Conduct in the Soccer Ball Industry In addition to the increase in child labor labels in the soccer ball industry, voluntary codes of conduct prohibiting child labor are also becoming more common. Such codes have been adopted by soccer organizations, sporting goods manufacturers, importers and retailers of soccer balls. This section first describes codes adopted by national and international organizations. The section then discusses the implementation of codes of conduct by individual U. S. importers and retailers of soccer balls, based on responses to a U. S. Department of Labor survey, other information gathered during the research for this report, and field visits by U. S. Department of Labor officials. 1.  Partners' Agreement to Eliminate Child Labor in the Soccer Ball Industry in Pakistan On February 14, 1997, in Atlanta, Georgia, representatives of the Sialkot Cham-ber of Commerce and Industry (SCCI),  114  the International Labor Organization (ILO) and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) signed the Partners' Agreement toEliminate Child Labour in the Soccer Industry in Pakistan.  115  The goals of the Partners' Agreement are the elimination of child labor in soccer ball production and the eventual elimination of child labor in other industries in the Sialkot area. This will beaccomplished through the creation of new opportunities for children with an emphasis on education and training. The Partners' Agreement has two basic programelements: a prevention and monitoring program and a social protection program. A Coordinating Committee comprised of the Partners and NGOs will administer theproject.  116  Both segments of the Partnership Agreement are due to begin in late 1997. Companies endorsing the agreement ""agree to source balls made in Pakistanexclusively from manufacturers who indicate their commitment to act responsibly toensure that children are not utilized to make soccer balls by participating in the voluntary industry program.""  117  In all, 55 soccer ball companies have endorsed the Partners' Agreement.  118 a. Prevention and Monitoring Program The prevention and monitoring program will set up a registry and internaland external monitoring systems and replace home-based production with village-based stitching centers. The program will be managed by the ILO. The objective ofthe program is to have the factories and stitching units of at least 22 manufacturersand their subcontractors free of child labor within 18 months:  119     Internal monitoring:  In order to determine whether soccer ball manufacturers are complying with the Partners' Agreement, a registry of personnel and production sites will be established. This registry is the core of the internal monitoring system. Manufacturers participating in the program must provide the following information to the ILO by January 1, 1998. i) registration of the names and contact information of all subcontractors; ii) registration of the names, addresses and ages of all stitchers working for the subcontractors and identification of child workers under the age of 14 to be removed and placed in social protection programs; iii) a reasonable estimate of the annual target capacity of soccer balls to be produced by the manufacturer and a reasonable estimate of the number of stitchers to produce this amount; iv) registration of all stitching units no less than 25 percent of the annual target capacity; and v) registration of names and contact information of new subcontractors, and names, addresses and ages of new stitchers. The manufacturers are required to update the list of new subcontractors and stitchers every six months, and to have registered all the stitching units representing one-hundred percent of the annual target capacity by January 1999.     External monitoring:  The accuracy of the internal monitoring system will be checked by establishing an external monitoring system. The ILO will hire and train independent monitors to visit the stitching centers on an unannounced basis to verify the information provided by the internal monitoring system. The monitors will have free access to all stitching centers operated by manufacturers and subcontractors. Weekly and monthly monitoring reports will be made available to the   ILO; reports of violations of the Agreement will be given to the Coordinating Committee on a monthly basis or whenever requested.     b. Social Protection Program At the same time that a system is being put into place to phase children out of the soccer ball industry, a program will be established to provide the children with education and rehabilitation. The program includes a campaign to change community attitudes toward child labor in the soccer ball industry. Children and families identified by the internal monitoring program will receive non-formal education, counseling, health services, training in income generation for adults, provision of credit/savings facility for adults and pre-vocational training. Younger children will be mainstreamed to formal schools. A number of village education and action centers (VEA centers) will be set up to provide these services. The centers will be run by the Bunyad Literacy Community Council, a Pakistani NGO focusing on basic education, and the Pakistan Bait-ul-Mal, a social welfare agency set up by the Prime Minister'soffice. 2.  Sportsgoods Manufacturers and Exporters Association (India) As programs to eliminate child labor in the Pakistani soccer ball industrygained momentum and attention this year, representatives of the sporting goods industry in India also have begun deliberations about combating child labor. In April1997, members of the Indian Sportsgoods Manufacturers and Exporters Associationjoined representatives of NGOs, government, trade unions and international organizations in the First National Consultation on Child Labor in the Sports Goods Industry, organized by the Indian human rights group South Asian Coalition on Child Servitude (SACCS). The purpose of the meeting was to discuss the problem of child labor in the industry and create a plan of action for the elimination of child labor. Among the coalition's recommendations was to establish an ethical code of conductand an independent, professional and credible monitoring system to ensure the absence of child labor.  120  The Joint Committee on Child Labor in the Sporting Goods Industry was created, consisting of 8 industry representatives, 3 NGO representatives, the Sports Goods Export Promotion Council (a governmental body), the ILO and UNICEF. At the same time that the Joint Committee was being established by SACCS,members of the Sportsgoods Manufacturers and Exporters Association of India  121  held a special meeting to discuss child labor in May 1997. The meeting, attended by 25 of the largest soccer ball manufacturers and exporters in India, the ILO and the World Federation of Sporting Goods Industry,  122  was called in response to a May 1997 Christian Aid report on child labor in the Indian sporting goods industry and recent negative media coverage in the United Kingdom.  123 In a declaration prior to the May meeting, the Indian Sportsgoods Manufac-turers and Exporters Association stated its opposition to child labor. Similar to the industry leaders in Pakistan, the Indian association explained that there are no children producing soccer balls in the factories themselves,  124  but that subcontractors could be distributing work to village shops and homes where child labor is more likely to be found.  125  To deal with this problem, the Association adopted a self-monitoring system consisting of the following elements:    the industry will: (1) identify stitchers and prepare lists of their names, address, ages, sex, address of workplace, etc.; (2) identify children working in homes or in factories; and (3) cross check the lists of stitchers with the number of stitched balls, and/ or other goods exported annually from India;      the first monitoring of the lists will be conducted by the Sportsgoods Manufacturers and Exporters Association,   Jalandhar;     a second monitoring will be conducted by the Sports Good Export Promotion Council; and     the third monitoring will be done by an outside agency such as the Indian Labor Department or the   ILO.  126     At a June 1997 meeting, the chairman of the Sportsgoods Manufacturers and Exporters Association asked that all members fill out forms ""to identify child labour""  127   employed directly or indirectly in the production of soccer balls. While the Association deems the monitoring system as self-certifying, it acknowledges that some form of independent monitoring is necessary for the system to be credible.  128  Whether an Indian government agency is considered to be independent for purposes of monitoring is open to question. The Sportsgoods Manufacturers and Exporters Associationhas also encouraged members to work with the Punjabi state government, which will reportedly provide assistance if members are interested in setting up centralizedstitching centers in lieu of using individual subcontractors.  129 On September 13, 1997, the Sportsgoods Manufacturers and Exporters Association reported that 27 exporting companies have provided information on their stitchers. Eighteen of these companies have obtained lists of stitchers from their contractors.  130 3.  FIFA The International Federation of Football Associations (FIFA)  131  authorizes the use of its logo on soccer balls that meet international matchball standards. On September 3, 1996, FIFA announced an agreement with three international unions  132  on a Code of Labor Practice for all goods bearing its logo.  133   Use of the FIFA logo bya licensee would signify that production was carried out in compliance with ILO Conventions banning child labor and forced labor, ensuring non-discrimination in employment, guaranteeing the right of workers to form and join trade unions and to bargain collectively, and ensuring payment of a minimum wage.  134  These commitments would be binding not only on the licensees, but also on each contractor and subcontractor in the production and distribution of FIFA- licensed products.  135  The FIFA Code of Labour Practice has not been embraced by soccer ball manufacturers or importers. In the year since the Code of Labor Practice was announced, FIFA has endorsed the Partners' Agreement but has not issued any information on the implementation of the FIFA code.  136 4.  Survey Results In addition to endorsing the Partners' Agreement, some U. S. importers of soccer balls have issued their own codes of conduct that prohibit the use of child labor. Some retailers have also adopted similar codes of conduct. In order to gather information on the extent and implementation of codes of conduct and labeling programs regarding child labor in the soccer ball industry, the U. S. Department of Labor conducted a voluntary survey of 7 importers and 3 retailersof soccer balls.  137  ( See Box IV- 1 for a list of the companies surveyed and Appendix B for the Company Questionnaire). Nine companies responded to the survey: Adidas, Baden Sports, Brine, Kmart, Nike, Pentland (Mitre), Reebok, Umbro, and Wal-Mart. The respondents indicated they import soccer balls either directly from foreign manufacturers in China, Indonesia or Pakistan, or through a U. S.- based purchasing agent.    Six of the seven importers source their soccer balls directly from a foreign manufacturer; one firm   (Pentland) also sources its balls through a purchasing agent. The seventh, Adidas, currently imports its soccer balls through a licensee, Molten, U. S. A. None of the seven importers own foreign manufacturing facilities. However, Reebok and Nike have invested in special facilities being built by their Pakistani producers in order to meet their child labor-free production policies.     The two retailers responding to the survey use U. S. licensees or purchasing agents to obtain soccer balls. Kmart, for example, purchases soccer balls from Seneca Sports, Franklin Sports, Molten U. S. A., and Spalding Sports ( see Section D. 4. b. above).     Seven of the companies responding to the survey indicated they have a written corporate policy prohibiting child labor. The written policies take the form of a code of conduct, vendor agreement, purchase order, or statement of principles.In cases where the company purchases and/or sells numerous products, the code applies to all the products, not just soccer balls. Copies of the policies are reproduced in Appendix C.    All seven importers (Adidas, Baden Sports, Brine, Nike, Pentland (Mitre), Reebok and Umbro) have endorsed the Partners' Agreement in addition to their individual corporate policies against child labor.    Brine stated that it has no written policy prohibiting child labor, although it is a member of the Partners' Agreement and has always made it clear to suppliers that child labor is unacceptable. However, this policy is not included in their purchase orders or vendor agreements.     Adidas' licensing agreement requires its licensees and manufacturers to comply with all applicable laws, including those prohibiting child labor. Manufacturers are also required to ensure that subcontractors comply with these standards. Failure to comply may be a basis for terminating the agreement.     Although Baden has no written code of conduct prohibiting child labor, they  require their factory representatives to verify that no children are engaged in making their products.     Nike's code of conduct prohibits the use of child labor. Child labor is defined as a person under the age of 15, unless national law states that the minimum age for work is fourteen  or  the age at which compulsory schooling has ended, whichever is greater.     TABLE IV-2 Type of Policy Prohibiting Child Labor (Based on Responses to Department of Labor Questionnaire)     * Company participates in the Partners' Agreement to Eliminate Child Labour in the Soccer Ball industry in Pakistan a  Company has its own labeling program b  Company has a formal code of conduct, statement of principals or compliance certificate c  Company has a purchase order, letter of credit, or buying agent agreement, which contains a specific prohibition on child labor in overseas production.        Pentland's letter of credit requires suppliers to certify that items were not mined, produced, manufactured, assembled or packed by the use of child labor as defined by national law.     Kmart's Workplace Code of Conduct is applicable to all suppliers and the suppliers' subcontractors in the United States and abroad. Kmart's code requires suppliers and their contractors to comply with local child labor laws and regulations. Children under the local legal age should not be employed by the supplier.     Reebok's code of conduct states that it will not work with business partners that use child labor. Reebok defines child labor as work performed by a person under 14, or younger than the age for compulsory schooling, whichever is higher.     Umbro requires its suppliers to sign a pledge every year certifying that they are observing national child labor laws.     Wal-Mart's Standards for Vendor Partners declares that Wal- Mart will not tolerate the use of child labor in the manufacture of products it sells. The standard applies to vendor partners as well as to their contractors, subcontractors or any other entity with whom they have a relationship for the manufacture of products sold by Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart defines child labor as work by a person younger than 15 (or 14 if so designated by national law) or younger than the age for completing compulsory education if that age is higher than 15.     Only three respondents  all importers  indicated that they communicatetheir no child labor policy directly to consumers. The remaining importers and retailers report either that they have no method to inform consumers that no childlabor is used in the foreign production of soccer balls, or that their suppliers label the balls.    Reebok and Baden have adopted labels to inform consumers that their soccer balls are made without child labor ( see Section D above). Reebok's code of conduct is reproduced on its internet website.     Nike said that consumers can learn about their no child labor policy on its internet website or by calling a toll- free number set up by the Soccer Industry Council of America that lists the names of companies participating in the Partner's Agreement.     Kmart noted that their four suppliers (Seneca Sports, Franklin Sports, Molten U. S. A., and Spalding Sports) have submitted letters indicating that they would label the balls child labor- free. Three of the four suppliers (Seneca Sports, Franklin Sports, and Spalding Sports) are now selling labeled balls to Kmart ( see Section D. 4. b. above for a more detailed discussion).     Brine noted that they do not have a separate mechanism for informing consumers that a soccer ball is not made by children, as their brand name alone should stand for not using child labor. Brine raised the concern that creating a special ""not made with child labor"" designation will lead to exploitation of the situation, and that smaller manufacturers that are financially unable to mount a large no child labor public relations campaign are bound to suffer even if they do have a no child labor commitment.     The companies surveyed indicated that they utilize a variety of means to monitor that their codes of conduct or policies on child labor are respected by their suppliers. Details of Reebok, Baden, and Kmart's monitoring procedures are found in Section D above. Table IV- 3 illustrates the type of monitoring the respondents employ. Seven of the nine respondents (Adidas, Baden, Brine, Kmart, Nike, Reebokand Wal- Mart) stated that they use contractual monitoring, i. e., they require their suppliers, through contractual agreements, to certify that their soccer balls are not made by children. The two retailers (Kmart and Wal- Mart) use only contractual monitoring to ensure their policy is being properly implemented. Seven of the nine respondents (Adidas, Baden, Brine, Nike, Pentland, Reebok and Umbro) send company staff, buyer agents or other parties to inspect facilities to verify that suppliers are actually implementing their code of conduct. Nike andReebok indicated that, in addition to contractual and internal monitoring, they use external accounting, auditing, testing or consulting firms, and/ or NGOs to monitor labor practices. In response to the Department's survey, some respondents submit-ted letters from the local Pakistani Labor Department certifying that a factory manufacturing soccer balls is free of child labor. Adidas, Brine, Nike, Pentland, Reebok and Umbro explained that they relyon the system established by the Partners' Agreement to monitor their child labor policy  in addition to any monitoring they might conduct on their own. Companies that support the Partners' Agreement pledge only to do business with Pakistani manufacturers who participate in the Agreement and consent to internal and external monitoring. As indicated above, however, the internal and external monitoring programs established by the Agreement have not yet been fully implemented.  TABLE IV-3 Monitoring Strategies for Compliance with International Child Labor Policies (Based on Responses to Department of Labor Questionnaire)     a  Company relies on guarantees made by suppliers through contractual documents or certificates that they are adhering to the company's policies. b  Company uses site visits and inspections by company staff, buyer agents, or other parties to verify that suppliers are actually implementing the codes of conduct. c  Company uses external accounting, auditing, testing or consulting firms, NGOs, or international organizations to monitor labor practices.        Local and quality control personnel employed by Adidas regularly visit manufacturers facilities. Adidas submitted a letter from the Punjabi Directorate of Labour Welfare attesting that children have never been found in the factory of their supplier, Sublime Sports.     Kmart's code of conduct requires suppliers and their subcontractors to allow full access to their facilities at all times for inspections by Kmart representatives or independent firms retained by Kmart. Kmart states that it has never found any child labor in the production of soccer balls.    138 It is not clear whether Kmart's monitoring system specifically applies to the soccer balls sold in their stores. However, in February 1997, Kmart received letters from four soccer ball suppliers assuring the retailer that the balls were not made by children. The suppliers' letters informed Kmart that each company is participating in the Partners' Agreement.     Nike imports soccer balls from SAGA Sports in Sialkot. Nike and SAGA  determined jointly that the best way to eliminate child labor was to create village stitching centers where it would be easier to monitor the ages of the   stitchers. By mid-1997, three stitching centers were operating with two additional centers scheduled to be completed by September 1997.    139  One of the centers is exclusively for women. Nike states that it monitors its code of conduct in Pakistan through its own internal procedures, and by using a Pakistani affiliate of Grant Thornton as an external monitor.     Pentland's soccer ball product managers visit their production facilities about three times a year to monitor compliance with their child labor policy. Pentland noted, however, that it is difficult to monitor for child labor since children are seldom found in the factories, but stitch soccer balls in homes and small workshops in the rural areas.   Over the next two years, Pentland plans to implement a China- specific monitoring plan in response to their concern about the use of child labor in China's soccer ball industry. The policy will have three components: 1) better factory control of home working situations; 2) documenting the age of young factory workers; and 3) protecting older working children (14, 15, 16 and 17 year olds) by restricting overtime and identifying areas of potential hazard where they should not be working.   Umbro personnel make spot- checks at suppliers' factories in 4- 8 week cycles. Umbro stated that although they conduct spot checks on ""external stitching facilities,"" they can never be completely certain that no child labor is being used.    F. Conclusion There has been significant public attention focused on the use of child laborin the soccer ball industry.  140  Most reports describe Pakistani children sitting forhours a day in small workshops stitching soccer balls. Other more recent reportsdescribe a similar situation in India's soccer ball industry. Soccer balls are also madein China and Indonesia, but the Department is not aware of any child labor allegations in the soccer ball industries of these countries. One company surveyed for this report, however, plans to implement an internal monitoring system in China due to concerns of child labor. Children stitch soccer balls in small workshops or homes, many times inremote rural areas. It is rare for a child to be found working in a large soccer ball factory. In Pakistan and India, child labor laws prohibit children from working in factories, but not in the type of subcontracting or homework arrangements common to the soccer ball industry. Some of the children work full-time. Others work during non-school hours. Many work for up to nine or ten hours a day. The international soccer ball industry has responded to the child labor accusations by creating codes of conduct and monitoring systems. In February 1997,Pakistani manufacturers signed an agreement (Partners'Agreement) with the ILO andUNICEF to phase children out of the industry, to provide education and other services to them, and to participate in internal and external monitoring programs. Over 50 U. S. and Pakistani companies pledged to support the agreement. By the time this report was written, the Partners' Agreement was not yet fully operational. In India,the industry is moving toward an agreement to stop the use of child labor. Discussions are underway between representatives of the industry, ILO, UNICEF, NGOs,trade unions and government to determine how best to accomplish this goal. Some individual companies are responding to public pressure by placingchild labor-free labels on their balls. The Department of Labor has identified eight companies that are using such labels. Reebok and Baden are both changing their production processes and implementing monitoring systems to support the use ofthe label. Reebok has hired independent human rights monitors to verify that no children stitch Reebok balls. Dunkin' Donuts sold promotional soccer balls duringthe 1997 summer months bearing a child labor-free label. Dunkin's Donuts asked a U.S.-based NGO to monitor the production of these balls and certify that they were not made by children. The other companies are making their no child labor claimsbased upon their participation in the Partners' Agreement. It is premature, however,to make such a claim because the monitoring components of the Partners' Agreement have not yet been fully implemented. Other companies are changing their production processes to prevent the use of child labor. For instance, Reebok has centralized all soccer production in one factory. Nike has created stitching centers in order to better monitor where production takes place. Baden has changed from Pakistani to Chinese suppliers and mecha-nized the stitching process. Although some individual companies have developed labels for their soccer balls, the majority of the soccer ball industry has opted instead to implement a variety of different codes of conduct to prohibit and prevent child labor. All companies responding to a Department of Labor survey on codes of conduct and labeling programs indicated that they have some type of corporate policy prohibiting child labor. Not all these policies are in writing, and very few are enforced through a rigorous monitoring system.    This report was produced by the staff of the International Child Labor Program and is published by the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of International Labor Affairs.

Introduction The soccer ball industry of Pakistan, principally concentrated in the city of Sialkot, has been under scrutiny in recent years for employing child workers. Manyreports describe children stitching soccer balls in small rural workshops or in homes.  1  The widespread coverage of children stitching soccer balls galvanized consumers,labor and religious groups and government officials to call for a stop to this practice.In June 1996, the U. S. Secretary of Labor and members of Congress helped launch the  FoulBall  campaign to ensure that soccer balls used by American children arestitched by adults and not children.  2 The public attention led U. S. importers to enter into an agreement with Paki-stani manufacturers, the ILO and UNICEF to stop using child labor.  3  More recently, public attention has focused on the use of child labor in India's soccer ball industry, leading to negotiations between Indian soccer ball manufacturers, exporters, NGOsand international organizations to develop a code of conduct prohibiting child labor. In addition, individual companies have taken steps to assure consumers thattheir products are not made by children. They have done so by revising their production process or creating child labor labels. For instance, Reebok has centralized all its soccer ball production in a new factory.  4  Nike also changed its manufacturing process in Pakistan by creating new stitching centers in order to better ensure chil-dren are not stitching Nike soccer balls.  5  Some U. S. importers, including Reebok and Baden Sports, have begun to label their soccer balls as produced without child labor. These labeling programs are the primary focus of this chapter. Information about labeling programs has been obtained from the companies using labels, from surveys of U. S. importers and retailers, and from field visits to India, Pakistan and China by Department of Labor officials. Section B of this chapter presents an overview of the industry and the market for soccer balls in the United States. Section C examines the role children play in the production of soccer balls around the world. Section D describes various labelingprograms. Finally, Section E reports responses of U. S.- based soccer ball importers and retailers to the child labor issue, based on a voluntary survey.  B. Industry Profile Soccer, or ""football"" as it is known in most countries, is the world's mostpopular sport.  6  Although soccer gained popularity slowly in the United States, enthusiasm for the sport has grown in recent years.  7  In 1980, there were fewer than 1 million youths registered to play soccer; by 1996 this figure had tripled to over 3 million.  8 Growth in the volume of U. S. imports of soccer balls reflects this trend. AsTable IV- 1 illustrates, in 1989, U. S. soccer ball imports were valued at $15.7 million;by 1996, the comparable figure was $34.2 million, a growth of 118 percent.  9  FigureIV- 1 lists U. S. imports of soccer balls by country and value. Some 71 percent ofthose imports came from Pakistan, 19 percent from China, 5 percent from Indonesia,1 percent from India, and the remaining 4 percent from other countries.  10  Soccerballs are not produced in the United States.  11 Soccer balls generally consist of a number of synthetic leather panels stitchedtogether in geometric patterns on the outside with an inflatable bladder inside.  12   Panels in high quality balls are hand- stitched for durability.  13  Hand- stitching these panels together is a very labor- intensive process and is where children have been found working. Figure IV- 2 illustrates the chain of production within the international soccerball industry. This schematic also highlights relationships among the various entitiesresponsible for production. The key actors can be described as follows:  14     Retailers typically sell a wide range of sporting goods, including soccer balls. They are not normally direct soccer balls importers; instead, they order the balls from brand name merchandisers. Retail outlets selling soccer balls include nationwide sporting goods or soccer specialty stores, independent sporting goods stores, department stores, mass-merchandisers, and toy stores.   Importers/ Design and Marketing Firms/ Merchandisers develop ball specifications and marketing strategies to promote their particular brand. They do not own the factories producing the balls, but contract with foreign manufacturers who produce the made-to-order balls. Some merchandisers have their own retail outlets for the sale of soccer balls and other products.   Contractors are foreign manufacturers who produce soccer balls for U. S. importers/ design and marketing firms/ merchandisers. They may produce soccer balls for several different buyers. Contractors usually do some of the production in their factories (e. g., cutting and packing), and outsource stitching and other tasks to subcontractors.

As of 1996, Korea no longer produced soccer balls for the U.S. market.   Source: Official Statistics of the U.S. Department of Commerce          Subcontractors are individuals who function as middlemen between the  contractor and village   stitchers.  15  Subcontractors typically deliver soccer ball kits to workers in surrounding villages. After the stitching is completed, the subcontractor pays the stitchers and returns the completed kits to the contractor.   Stitchers sew together the panels of a soccer ball and glue in the inflatable bladder. They are employed by subcontractors, typically on a piece rate basis, and may work in a stitching center, small village workshop, or in homes.      C. Child Labor in the Soccer Ball Industry The use of child labor in the production of soccer balls has been documentedprimarily in Pakistan and India.  16  Soccer balls are also made in China and Indonesia, but there are no known allegations of child labor in the soccer ball industries of these countries. The manufacture of soccer balls is controlled from the city but decentralized to homes and small workshops in surrounding villages. At the city factories or warehouses, the designs are printed and the pieces are cut. These are then packed into sacks and handed over to middlemen or subcontractors who distribute them in villages to families and workshops, where stitching traditionally is done both by adults and children. Subcontractors provide soccer ball kits to village workshops and/or households, where workers hand-stitch individual pieces together, glue the bladder to the material, and sew in the final piece. Some of the larger subcontractors in Pakistan have up to 300 stitchers working for them.  17  In some instances, there may be two or more tiers of subcontractors, with the balls passing through many hands on the way from the stitcher to the manufacturer. Once completed, the stitched soccer balls are then brought back by the middlemen to the factories for packing andshipment.  Pakistan Nearly all soccer balls are made in and around Sialkot, Pakistan  a regionfamous as a soccer ball producing hub for at least 80 years.  18  Seventy-five percent of the world's soccer balls were produced in Sialkot in 1996.  19  It is estimated that there are about 10,000 urban workers and 30,000 rural workers in the 1,450 surrounding villages of Sialkot involved in the production of soccer balls.  20 As recently as 1995, Pakistani soccer ball manufacturers denied that children were stitching soccer balls. The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan noted that when they visited Sialkot in 1995, manufacturers seemed to have instructed their contractors not to talk about child labor, and taken the contractors to task, ""not so much for employing child labor as for letting it become visible.""  21  At the time, theCommission reported that they found many children working in the soccer ball industry, despite the local industry's best efforts to conceal the children from view.  22 In 1996, an ILO study in the Sialkot region estimated that more than 7,000 Pakistani children between the ages of 5 and 14 stitched balls on a regular, full- time basis.  23  In addition, large numbers of children worked part-time outside of school hours. The great majority of these children were boys. More than 90 percent of the children stitching soccer balls are between theages of 10 and 14.  24  Most work in small shops or at home.  25  Seventy percent of the children work 8 to 9 hours a day; others work 10 to 11 hours per day.  26  It is estimated that 19 percent of the boys and 36 percent of the girls have never attended school.  27  Twenty-two percent of the boys and 25 percent of the girls attend school and work.  28  Although most of the child workers can read and write, many havedropped out of school because of uninteresting curricula, unsympathetic teachers and an uncomfortable school environment.  29 A recent study conducted for the Soccer Industry Council of America (SICA)found that stitchers make between 20 to 30 Pakistani rupees, or approximately $0.50 to $0.75, per ball.  30  On average, children are paid 20 to 22 Pakistani rupees per ball, or about $0.50 to $0.55. Payment tends to vary according to ball quality.  31  Most high quality balls are stitched by adults at stitching centers. The ILO reports that children are not likely to stitch high quality balls because they are not strong enough to make the required stitches. The wages for high quality balls are almost double than thosefor lower quality balls.  32  Depending upon skill and experience, a person is reportedly able to stitch between 1 and 5 balls a day.  33 There have been allegations of debt servitude in the soccer ball industry in Pakistan,  34  charges denied by Pakistani manufacturers  35  and a recent Save the Children-UK report.  36  However, the study commissioned by the Soccer Industry Council of America (SICA), the Save the Children report and a study conducted jointly by the ILO and the Punjab Department of Labor acknowledge that many families in thesoccer ball industry take loans or advances from subcontractors.  37  The advances are generally repaid through a deduction in the amount paid to the stitchers.  38  Most reports, however, are careful to note that intergenerational debt-bondage is not prevalent in the soccer ball industry. India India's sporting goods industry has its roots in Sialkot, Pakistan. When India was partitioned at independence in 1947, many of Sialkot's skilled Hindi craftsmen migrated across the border into the Punjab, settling in Jalandhar, where the Indian sporting goods industry is now based.  39  The Indian sporting goods industry has expanded to include the areas of Meerut, Uttar Pradesh, and Gurgaon, Haryana. Most of India's sporting goods, including soccer balls, are exported to the United Kingdom. Allegations of child labor in India's soccer ball industry have appeared since 1994.  40  Although these allegations were initially repudiated by some members of the Indian Sports Goods Export Promotion Council, recent public statements by members of the industry are more qualified, denying that child labor is used inmembers' factories, but acknowledging that the practice may occur through the process of contracting out to homeworkers.  41  About 300,000 persons work in the sporting goods industry producing over 200 different products.  42  It is estimated that about 10 percent of this work force, or 25,000 to 30,000 workers, are children.  43 Soccer ball production in India is similar to that in Pakistan: middlemen distribute soccer ball kits provided by large factories to small workshops and homes in surrounding villages, where soccer balls are stitched and returned. A 1997 study by Christian Aid, a British NGO, found children as young as seven stitching soccerballs in their homes.  44  The report described children working in small workshops orat home in urban slum areas and remote villages.  45  They work for many hours stitching the soccer balls while sitting in a hunched, squatting position. Some of thechildren go to school as well as work.  46  The report quotes the director of a Jalandhar soccer ball company as saying, ""the football industry uses children at the age of 10or 12. The quantity of footballs exported is too much to employ all the people we need in factories. Women and children do it in their houses whenever they get freetime.""  47 As in Pakistan, stitchers are paid per completed ball. One major exporter stated that stitchers average 13 to 14 Indian rupees per ball ($ 0.37 - $0.39) for the low quality soccer balls, and between 20 and 22 Indian rupees per ball ($ 0.56-$0.62cents) for the most commonly produced medium quality balls. Some Indian children reportedly earn as little as 7 Indian rupees per ball, or about $0.20.  48   D. Consumer Labeling Programs in the Soccer Ball Industry 1.  Introduction Adverse publicity in the United States and Europe about children stitchingsoccer balls prompted some importers to adopt labels informing consumers that their products have been produced in a child labor-free environment. In some cases, these programs are accompanied by changes in production processes to prevent theemployment of children. Although some individual companies have developed labels for their soccer balls, the majority of the soccer ball industry has opted instead to implement avariety of different codes of conduct to prohibit and prevent child labor. At a November 1996 meeting of the World Federation of the Sporting Goods Industry (WFSGI), companies rejected the possibility of labeling products, concluding that ""our ownindustrial brand names were statements of quality and ethics in their own rights and any disclaimer put on a separate label would only weaken that statement and the perception of the brand.""  49  They emphasized that by labeling only some balls, unlabeled balls might unfairly be thought to be made by children.  50  On the other hand, the President of the WFSGI commented that over time, it might be conceivable that products would carry a stamp indicating membership in WFSGI. Since the WFSGI isan endorser of the Pakistan Partners' Agreement, such a stamp would imply that aball made in Pakistan fulfilled the no child labor requirements of this agreement.  51  In making this proposal, the President noted that for such a stamp to be credible, it must be backed up by a strong and transparent monitoring system in addition to an enforcement mechanism capable of denying the use of the stamp or expelling members found violating the agreement.  52 Notwithstanding the WFSGI policy, recent evidence shows that child labor labeling is becoming more common in the soccer ball industry. For example, both Reebok and Baden Sports recently began selling soccer balls with a label stating that the balls are not made by children. The Reebok balls are made in Pakistan, while the Baden balls are made in China. The retail chain Dunkin' Donuts sold promotional soccer balls with a no child labor label during the 1997 summer months. Additionally, in response to a Department of Labor survey, the Kmart Corporation provided letters from their suppliers indicating that their balls are, or will be, labeled child labor-free. These labeling programs are described in the next few pages.  2.  Reebok a. Program Overview Reebok International Ltd. (Reebok) is a leading designer, marketer and worldwide distributor of sports, fitness and casual footwear, apparel, and sporting equipment. Total sales for 1996 were approximately $3.5 billion.  53  Reebok, a publicly held corporation, issued a code of conduct known as the Reebok Human Rights Production Standards in 1992. Among other things, the code of conduct bars the use of child labor in making Reebok products.  Recognizing the high incidence of child workers in the Pakistani soccer ball industry, in June 1996 Reebok officials said they were planning to buy Pakistani-made soccer balls that they ""knew with certainty"" were not made with child labor.  54  Reebok contracted with Moltex Sporting Goods (Pvt.) Ltd., a Pakistani soccer and rugby ball manufacturer, and Reed and Associates, a French company specializing inresearch and development, sourcing and manufacturing of high quality soccer and rugby balls, to build a soccer ball manufacturing plant. The new facility, located in Sialkot, has been making Reebok balls since March 1997. Soccer balls produced for Reebok by Moltex bear the following label on one of the panels: "" Guarantee: Manufactured without child labor. "" According to company officials, the use of the label allows Reebok to communicate their policy to consumers and stakeholders interested in ending exploitative child labor. Reebok's decision to label soccer balls was based on two factors: (1) increasing concern by consumers about children stitching soccer balls;  55  and (2) Reebok's desire to distinguish itself from other brands by centralizing stitching and all other production processes in a single factory and requiring rigorous external monitoring of the facility. Reebok officials state they will be able to place their label on Reebok balls ""with absolute confidence. Our consumers will know that Reebok balls are, without any doubt, child labor-free.""  56 b. Program Structure The three major elements of Reebok's program include:  57     containment of all production inside a new facility in which all work on Reebok balls is performed, including stitching. All workers must be age 15 or older;   external monitoring to ensure that: a) children are not entering the workplace, and b) soccer ball panels are not leaving the factory where the risk exists that they may be stitched by children in stitching centers or in homes; and   support of education and/ or vocational education training for children in the  soccer ball manufacturing region or Pakistan.     Reebok officials acknowledge that there are additional costs associated with creating a new facility that will house all production processes. According to Peter Moore, Senior Vice President of the Global Soccer/ Rugby Division, this shift in manufacturing processes will cost Reebok approximately 15 percent more.  58  Reebok saysthese additional costs  associated with pensions, health insurance and transportation for workers at the new factory  will be absorbed by the company; the salesprice of Reebok soccer balls will remain the same.  59 c. Program Implementation According to Reebok, the Sialkot facility began making soccer balls in March1997. Reebok hired three independent monitors to check the effectiveness of the program. Two of the monitors are associated with human rights organizations,  60  and the third is a Lahore-based affiliate of a major U. S. accounting firm.  61  The two human rights monitors were asked to monitor the factory, interview workers, maintain ties to the local community, and visit surrounding villages to be sure no Reebok panels are stitched outside the factory. Each monitor has the right to inspect the facility on an announced or unannounced basis.  62  The third monitor was hired to audit factory records in order to correlate the number of balls produced with the number of stitchers in the factory.  63  Reebok intends to make monitoring reports publicly available upon request.  64 Reebok says the auditing firm conducted a test audit in March 1997.  65  A representative of the auditing firm acknowledged they visited the plant and recommended that a number of accounting measures be implemented so that the firm could begin auditing records by August 1997.  66  Reebok notes that because other soccer balls are also being made by Moltex, the auditing process is very difficult.Reebok plans to reassess the value of engaging the outside auditing firm in addition to the human rights monitors.  67 Reebok issued the human rights monitors' first report on August 14, 1997, summarizing their findings from March through July 1997.  68  During the first five months of the project, the monitors visited the Moltex facility nine times to determine if children were present; three of the visits were unannounced. As of June 4, the monitors had found 236 workers in the factory, including 176 stitchers; 179 artisans working on a contract basis were also present. No children were found at the Moltex facility. During an April 29 visit, the human rights monitors observed balls being made at Moltex for another major buyer.  69  The factory management said these balls were being sent out of the factory for stitching, but were not Reebok balls. In August, Reebok stated it had given Moltex a large enough order to fill up the company's manufacturing capacity, and non-Reebok balls would be out of the factory by September 30.  70 The monitors recommended that a plan be devised to clearly assure them that Reebok balls were not being stitched outside the factory. In May, Reebok authorized the human rights monitors to hire a guard to stand at the factory gate tomake sure no Reebok ball panels are commingled with panels for other buyers as they leave the factory to be stitched elsewhere. The guard, who reports directly to the human rights monitors, was hired in June. He has been instructed to make sure that no Reebok panels leave the factory, and that no completed Reebok balls are coming in from the villages or outside stitching centers where children might bepresent. As of the end of July, the monitors informed Reebok that the guard has not observed any problems with Reebok balls entering or leaving the factory. Reebok has commented on the monitors' report, stating that a number of health and safety concerns in the factory had been communicated to Moltex.  71  In response, large posters with Reebok's human rights production standards translated into Urdu are being sent to Pakistan. Finally, Reebok acknowledges that a number of record keeping procedures are not yet complete, such as establishing personnel records with historical data and creating worker identification cards. In addition to its new ball factory and monitoring project, Reebok is planning an educational project.  72  The company has a three-year plan to improve educational opportunities for children in villages in the Sialkot area, specifically targeting displaced child workers. Reebok is working with the Society for Advancement of Education in Sialkot to implement the plan.  3.  Baden Sports a. Program Overview Baden Sports, Inc. is a family- owned athletic ball manufacturer. Founded eighteen years ago, Baden sells baseballs, basketballs, broom balls, footballs, soccer balls,volleyballs and water polo balls. Baden now imports soccer balls directly from one manufacturer in China. Baden recently shifted suppliers from Pakistan to China due to ""complications facing the industry in solving this [the child labor] problem,""  73  and because they ""never found the manufacturers in Pakistan to be reliable or trustworthy, and our experience is that you cannot inspect with confidence or expect that the Pakistani companies will adhere to any monitoring programs.""  74  Recent consumer inquiries, combined with market research indicating great consumer interest in the elimination ofchild labor, are Baden's primary reasons for changing its supplier and production practices. Baden claims that by switching suppliers to China, it has ensured elimination of child labor in its production of soccer balls: ""With our newly automated manufacturing process for patent-pending stitched balls, we can now guarantee, and certifyon the ball itself, that no child or slave labor has been used in the production of oursoccer balls.""  75  A Baden representative also stated that the shift to China coincided with a corporate decision to produce machine-sewn balls.  76 Soccer balls imported by Baden bear the label: ""Certified: No Child or Slave Labor Used on this Ball."" Baden also intends to produce packaging and advertisements stating that no child labor is used in the production of their soccer balls. Baden began marketing soccer balls bearing the child labor-free label in 1997.  77  In a press release announcing the availability of the product, Baden CEO E. C.Schindler stated ""it is our goal to ensure that soccer is played by children, not made by children. We are so sure of the integrity and quality of our products, we certify it.""  78 b. Program Structure Baden soccer balls are stitched in China using sewing machines, leaving only the last patch to be hand-stitched after the ball is turned right side out and the bladder inserted.  79  This process is done entirely at a factory run by Kuan Ho Sporting Goods Company Ltd., a manufacturing facility located in Dongguan, Guangdong Province, China.  80  Baden believes that through machine stitching it can obtain better quality and greater production volume using fewer workers. Baden claims that it can produce soccer balls 50 percent faster using sewing machines than stitching the balls by hand.  81 Kuan Ho's manager explained the plant's recruitment policy to visiting Department of Labor officials. Under China's labor laws, no one under 16 years of age is permitted to work. About 400 of the 2,400 workers at the factory produce soccer balls.  82  According to Kuan Ho's manager, most of the workers are female, earning about 60 to 70 percent above the local minimum wage of 500 yuan ($ 60) a month, or up to 900 yuan ($ 108).  83  The work force is made up almost entirely of migrants from other provinces within China; according to the Kuan Ho manager, they have a stable workforce due to fairly liberal benefits, which include vacations and the possibility of returning home once a year.  84 Baden requires written certification from the manufacturer that child labor is not used in the manufacture of Baden products. According to Baden's Asia representative, the company also requires Kuan Ho to allow access to personnel records. c. Program Implementation Baden management states that the company's factory representative monitors the Kuan Ho facility weekly. The factory representative explained that he visits the plant to check for quality, design and child labor but did not indicate the frequency of his visits.  85  A form verifying the absence of child labor in the production of soccer balls is to be filled out during each visit and signed by Baden's factory representative and an officer of Kuan Ho.  86 Baden management states that, in addition to the procedures noted above, it requires its representatives to verify the no child labor statements and representations made by Kuan Ho officials. The factory representative told U. S. Department of Labor officials that during his factory visits, he accepts the word of the plant manager that they are not employing child labor.  87  In addition, Baden management stated that a representative from Baden's headquarters occasionally accompanies the factory representative on site visits to verify company policies are being carried out correctly. The Department of Labor team received a copy of Baden's inspection report of Kuan Ho that certifies no child labor (i.e., no workers under sixteen) was being used in the production of soccer balls.  88  The copy of the inspection report itself had been prepared but not yet signed by the Baden representative or the Kuan Homanager.  89 Baden has no set policy to deal with the discovery of a child worker.  90  KuanHo's plant manager was aware of Baden's child labor concerns even though Baden does not have a written corporate policy on human rights or a special training program that covers this topic.  91  Workers at Kuan Ho were not aware of the purpose of Baden's labeling program.  92  The firm's management believes that workers do not need to know about such a program, although human resource managers  who are responsible for the hiring  do.  93 Baden states that the price of its soccer balls will likely increase slightly as a result of the new manufacturing and monitoring process.  4.  Other Child Labor Consumer Labels More and more soccer ball companies are promoting child labor labels particularly since the February 14, 1997 signing of the Partners' Agreement to Eliminate Child Labor in the Soccer Ball Industry in Pakistan ( see Section E. 1). The Department of Labor has received information on seven such labels. All the labelspromise that the soccer balls are not made by children. Only one of the labeling programs, sponsored by Dunkin' Donuts, has a monitoring and certification component. Four of these labels are associated with brand-name soccer balls that are soldin retail outlets. The other two labels are produced both for retail outlets and youth soccer leagues/clubs in the United States. a. Dunkin' Donuts Promotion The spread of child labor-free labels for soccer ballsis illustrated by a soccer ball promotion conducted by Dunkin'Donuts franchise outlets in New England during the 1997summer season.  94  With any purchase, a customer could buy for $9.99 a hand-stitched soccer ball bearing three logos: the Dunkin' Donuts logo; that of the New England Revolution, the region's professional soccer team; and the statement ""Produced Without Child Labor."" Posters with a photo of Alexi Lalas, one of the star players of the New England Revolution, were placed in participating Dunkin' Donut stores; many of the posters stated ""Ball Produced Without Child Labor"" in their right bottom corner.  95  The promotion was originally intended to run during the months of June and July but was extended until all the balls in stock are sold. The idea to put child labor-free labels on the promotional soccer balls came from Dunkin' Donuts New England franchisees, who expressed concern about child labor being used in the production of soccer balls made in Pakistan.  96  In response, letters from the U. S. Sporting Goods Manufacturers Association (SGMA) and Talon Sports  97  (the Pakistani manufacturer) were sent to Dunkin' Donuts stating that the balls would not be made by children. A committee of Dunkin' Donuts franchisees was uncomfortable relying solely on the promises of the manufacturer and the trade association. They agreed to approve the campaign only if the balls were certified ""child labor-free"" by an independent organization. As a result of the franchisees' concern about the credibility of a ""no child labor"" guarantee, Dunkin' Donuts, working through a sports marketing consultant in charge of the campaign (Sports Team), requested that a Washington, DC- based NGO the International Labor Rights Fund (ILRF)  serve as an independent monitor. Consequently, ILRF designed a monitoring program to ensure that soccer balls produced by Talon in Pakistan for Dunkin' Donuts were child labor-free. A six- month agreement between Sports Team and ILRF granted ILRF monitors total access to all Talon facilities, including its factories and stitching centers. Talon provided the ILRF with a map of the 43 stitching centers, a list of the names of all workers, and all of its records. Talon also consented to unannounced visits by the monitors, granting them access to all facilities and the ability to talk to workers without the presence ofsupervisory personnel.  98  ILRF monitors reported that they did not find any instances of illegal child labor. At the end of the summer, Dunkin' Donuts representatives were to evaluatethe soccer ball promotion program and determine whether to launch a spring campaign and whether it should be expanded beyond New England.  99 b. Individual Company Labels Another example of new labels informing consumers that a soccer ball ismade without child labor is that of individual companies promising that their balls are made only by adults. In response to the Department of Labor's voluntary survey, the Kmart Corporation provided the Department with letters from Seneca Sports,Inc., Franklin Sports, Inc., Molten U. S. A. and Spalding Sports Worldwide stating thatthey have or are planning to have a labeling program for soccer balls sold in Kmart stores. All four of the companies have endorsed the Partners' Agreement to Eliminate Child Labour in the Soccer Ball Industry in Pakistan and seem to base some of their no child labor assurances solely on this agreement. The following is some brief information about the claims made by each company to Kmart.      In its letter to Kmart dated February 18, 1997, Seneca Sports,  Inc. certified that its manufacturing facility in Pakistan ""prohibits inhumane conditions, violations of human rights and the use of child labor."" The letter further states that ""our packaging will certify that no child labor was used in the manufacturing of Seneca Soccer Balls.""    100  The package containing the Seneca ball states, ""Seneca® balls are certified as free from child labor."" The box also states ""Seneca Sports® Certified."" A Seneca official informed the Department of Labor that in the past year it has been asking its Pakistani supplier, Awan Sports, for assurances that soccer balls produced for Seneca are child labor- free. The Seneca representative further stated that Awan Sports has consolidated all its soccer ball production into one facility, preventing the outsourcing of stitching operations, and thereby minimizing the chance of child labor. Both Seneca and Awan Sports endorse the Partners' Agreement.    101     Franklin Sports, Inc. informed Kmart on February 18, 1997 that  it is a member of the Partners' Agreement, noting that a monitoring system had been implemented to ensure compliance with the Agreement.    102  In addition, Franklin stated it will independently assure that: 1) factories manufacturing Franklin soccer balls will be monitored by an independent contractor on a quarterly basis, with reports available for review by Kmart management; 2) factories will use only factory managed labor in the production of soccer balls, eliminating any possibility that child labor could be used in a cottage industry environment; and 3) Franklin will include a visible mark/logo on packaging and/ or product stating clearly that no child labor has been used in the production of the product, no later than July 1, 1997.    103       The president of Franklin Sports explained that placing a child  labor-free label on the balls ""is a visible way to tell people that we are in compliance with the Partners' Agreement. Also, retailers want assurances that our balls were not made by children.""  104 In a follow-up interview with the Department of Labor, Franklin confirmed that effective July 1, 1997, a label reading ""Manufactured Without Child Labor"" is being printed on balls made in Pakistan and exported to the United States. Franklin believes that stitching centers are being set up to centralize production and better manage who stitches the soccer balls. Franklin notes that they are relying solely on the Partners'Agreement to monitor production. Franklin requires all its Pakistani manufacturers to be members of the Partners' Agreement.  105      Molten U. S. A., in a letter to Kmart dated February 21, 1997, stated that ""we can now guarantee that no child labor will be used in any phase of the production of soccer balls supplied to Kmart Corporation."" The letter further states that Molten U. S. A. ""will begin to include a sticker on the cosmetic package referencing the child labor issue as soon as the stickers are produced. This should be no later than March 15."" A representative of Molten explained that its soccer balls are made in Pakistan, India and China, although the labels described in their letter to Kmart refer only to balls made in Pakistan. The representative stated that both Molten and their Pakistani supplier, Sublime Sports, are members of the Partners' Agreement. As of mid-August, however, Molten had not put ""no child labor"" labels on its Pakistani-made soccer balls. The company maintains that it is in the process of investigating the issue of child labor in Pakistan, and wants to ensure that any child labor- free guarantee made by Molten is absolutely credible.    106     Spalding Sports Worldwide stated in a February 21, 1997 letter to Kmart that all Spalding soccer ball manufacturers comply with the industry criteria and Spalding's Worldwide Labor Policy. The letter further states that Spalding is a member of the Partners' Agreement. Finally, the letter states that Spalding has added the following logo to all its soccer packages: ""No Child Labor Used to Produce This Product."" A representative of Spalding explained that Spalding sources 75 percent of its soccer balls from Pakistan; the remaining balls are made in China, but are molded and not hand- stitched. Spalding's two Pakistani manufacturers, Recto Sports    107  and Taj Mahal, are members of the Partners' Agreement. Spalding requires its manufacturers to certify Spalding balls have been produced without the use of child labor. Additionally, Spalding says that its quality control personnel visit the Pakistani facilities frequently and ensure that no child labor is used.    108       c. Child Labor Labeled Soccer Balls Provided to Youth Soccer Leagues In addition to the five companies listed above, other companies selling ballsdirectly to youth soccer leagues are making no child labor"" claims. While there maybe a number of companies supplying labeled balls to youth soccer leagues, the following two have come to the attention of the Department of Labor.      The Department of Labor obtained a soccer ball used at ""The  1997 Virginian Tournament,"" held in Springfield, Virginia, which carries the label ""No Child Labor Involved: Adult Sewn Product."" According to the information printed on the ball, it was made in Pakistan and imported by American Challenge, a U. S. importer of soccer balls. American Challenge officials informed the Department of Labor that its Challenge soccer balls are manufactured exclusively by JSD Sports (Pvt.) Ltd. in   Sialkot, Pakistan.  109  American Challenge has provided the Department of Labor with a letter from the Assistant Director of Labour Welfare, Government of the Punjab, stating that the mentioned manufacturer ""is abiding by all the by-laws in relation with employment of 'child labor' and there is no worker in the factory below the age of fifteen years. It is further certified that all workers/employees are free to leave the job and no bonded labour is involved in the manufacturing of products of the said concern.""    110  American Challenge stated that the company has been producing soccer balls with a ""no child labor"" label since January 1997. The soccer balls are sold to various dealers and individuals.    111     The American Soccer Company supplies soccer balls to ADULT  youth soccer leagues, soccer clubs, and stores under thebrand name SCORE. In the past year, the American Soccer Company began to distribute SCORE soccer balls with a PRODUCT label stating, ""Adult Sewn Product."" A SCORE representative said that placing the labels on the balls coincided with the signing of the Partners' Agreement, of which they are a member. SCORE requires that its Pakistani manufacturers be members of the Partners' Agreement as well. One of SCORE's suppliers in Pakistan is Talon Sports. Talon has provided letters to SCORE assuring that they do not use child labor in the production of their soccer balls. SCORE hopes to send company representatives to Pakistan at the end of the year to visit Talon and verify the no child labor assurances are accurate.    112     The two major organizations that sponsor and regulate youth soccer leagues in the United States, the United States Youth Soccer Association, Inc. (USYSA), andthe American Youth Soccer Organization (AYSO), have both publicly condemned the use of child labor in the manufacturing of soccer balls.  113  The official equipmentsupplier of the USYSA, the larger of the two groups, is Adidas, which does not place labels on its balls. The official ball of the AYSO is Spalding, which is placing child labor-free labels on AYSO sanctioned balls (see above). The AYSO states that is has obtained a guarantee from Spalding that its manufacturers do not engage in violation of children's rights, and that no child labor is used in the manufacturing of any of its products. Prior to this year, the official ball of the AYSO was SCORE, which is now placing no child labor labels on some of its balls.  E. Codes of Conduct in the Soccer Ball Industry In addition to the increase in child labor labels in the soccer ball industry, voluntary codes of conduct prohibiting child labor are also becoming more common. Such codes have been adopted by soccer organizations, sporting goods manufacturers, importers and retailers of soccer balls. This section first describes codes adopted by national and international organizations. The section then discusses the implementation of codes of conduct by individual U. S. importers and retailers of soccer balls, based on responses to a U. S. Department of Labor survey, other information gathered during the research for this report, and field visits by U. S. Department of Labor officials. 1.  Partners' Agreement to Eliminate Child Labor in the Soccer Ball Industry in Pakistan On February 14, 1997, in Atlanta, Georgia, representatives of the Sialkot Cham-ber of Commerce and Industry (SCCI),  114  the International Labor Organization (ILO) and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) signed the Partners' Agreement toEliminate Child Labour in the Soccer Industry in Pakistan.  115  The goals of the Partners' Agreement are the elimination of child labor in soccer ball production and the eventual elimination of child labor in other industries in the Sialkot area. This will beaccomplished through the creation of new opportunities for children with an emphasis on education and training. The Partners' Agreement has two basic programelements: a prevention and monitoring program and a social protection program. A Coordinating Committee comprised of the Partners and NGOs will administer theproject.  116  Both segments of the Partnership Agreement are due to begin in late 1997. Companies endorsing the agreement ""agree to source balls made in Pakistanexclusively from manufacturers who indicate their commitment to act responsibly toensure that children are not utilized to make soccer balls by participating in the voluntary industry program.""  117  In all, 55 soccer ball companies have endorsed the Partners' Agreement.  118 a. Prevention and Monitoring Program The prevention and monitoring program will set up a registry and internaland external monitoring systems and replace home-based production with village-based stitching centers. The program will be managed by the ILO. The objective ofthe program is to have the factories and stitching units of at least 22 manufacturersand their subcontractors free of child labor within 18 months:  119     Internal monitoring:  In order to determine whether soccer ball manufacturers are complying with the Partners' Agreement, a registry of personnel and production sites will be established. This registry is the core of the internal monitoring system. Manufacturers participating in the program must provide the following information to the ILO by January 1, 1998. i) registration of the names and contact information of all subcontractors; ii) registration of the names, addresses and ages of all stitchers working for the subcontractors and identification of child workers under the age of 14 to be removed and placed in social protection programs; iii) a reasonable estimate of the annual target capacity of soccer balls to be produced by the manufacturer and a reasonable estimate of the number of stitchers to produce this amount; iv) registration of all stitching units no less than 25 percent of the annual target capacity; and v) registration of names and contact information of new subcontractors, and names, addresses and ages of new stitchers. The manufacturers are required to update the list of new subcontractors and stitchers every six months, and to have registered all the stitching units representing one-hundred percent of the annual target capacity by January 1999.     External monitoring:  The accuracy of the internal monitoring system will be checked by establishing an external monitoring system. The ILO will hire and train independent monitors to visit the stitching centers on an unannounced basis to verify the information provided by the internal monitoring system. The monitors will have free access to all stitching centers operated by manufacturers and subcontractors. Weekly and monthly monitoring reports will be made available to the   ILO; reports of violations of the Agreement will be given to the Coordinating Committee on a monthly basis or whenever requested.     b. Social Protection Program At the same time that a system is being put into place to phase children out of the soccer ball industry, a program will be established to provide the children with education and rehabilitation. The program includes a campaign to change community attitudes toward child labor in the soccer ball industry. Children and families identified by the internal monitoring program will receive non-formal education, counseling, health services, training in income generation for adults, provision of credit/savings facility for adults and pre-vocational training. Younger children will be mainstreamed to formal schools. A number of village education and action centers (VEA centers) will be set up to provide these services. The centers will be run by the Bunyad Literacy Community Council, a Pakistani NGO focusing on basic education, and the Pakistan Bait-ul-Mal, a social welfare agency set up by the Prime Minister'soffice. 2.  Sportsgoods Manufacturers and Exporters Association (India) As programs to eliminate child labor in the Pakistani soccer ball industrygained momentum and attention this year, representatives of the sporting goods industry in India also have begun deliberations about combating child labor. In April1997, members of the Indian Sportsgoods Manufacturers and Exporters Associationjoined representatives of NGOs, government, trade unions and international organizations in the First National Consultation on Child Labor in the Sports Goods Industry, organized by the Indian human rights group South Asian Coalition on Child Servitude (SACCS). The purpose of the meeting was to discuss the problem of child labor in the industry and create a plan of action for the elimination of child labor. Among the coalition's recommendations was to establish an ethical code of conductand an independent, professional and credible monitoring system to ensure the absence of child labor.  120  The Joint Committee on Child Labor in the Sporting Goods Industry was created, consisting of 8 industry representatives, 3 NGO representatives, the Sports Goods Export Promotion Council (a governmental body), the ILO and UNICEF. At the same time that the Joint Committee was being established by SACCS,members of the Sportsgoods Manufacturers and Exporters Association of India  121  held a special meeting to discuss child labor in May 1997. The meeting, attended by 25 of the largest soccer ball manufacturers and exporters in India, the ILO and the World Federation of Sporting Goods Industry,  122  was called in response to a May 1997 Christian Aid report on child labor in the Indian sporting goods industry and recent negative media coverage in the United Kingdom.  123 In a declaration prior to the May meeting, the Indian Sportsgoods Manufac-turers and Exporters Association stated its opposition to child labor. Similar to the industry leaders in Pakistan, the Indian association explained that there are no children producing soccer balls in the factories themselves,  124  but that subcontractors could be distributing work to village shops and homes where child labor is more likely to be found.  125  To deal with this problem, the Association adopted a self-monitoring system consisting of the following elements:    the industry will: (1) identify stitchers and prepare lists of their names, address, ages, sex, address of workplace, etc.; (2) identify children working in homes or in factories; and (3) cross check the lists of stitchers with the number of stitched balls, and/ or other goods exported annually from India;      the first monitoring of the lists will be conducted by the Sportsgoods Manufacturers and Exporters Association,   Jalandhar;     a second monitoring will be conducted by the Sports Good Export Promotion Council; and     the third monitoring will be done by an outside agency such as the Indian Labor Department or the   ILO.  126     At a June 1997 meeting, the chairman of the Sportsgoods Manufacturers and Exporters Association asked that all members fill out forms ""to identify child labour""  127   employed directly or indirectly in the production of soccer balls. While the Association deems the monitoring system as self-certifying, it acknowledges that some form of independent monitoring is necessary for the system to be credible.  128  Whether an Indian government agency is considered to be independent for purposes of monitoring is open to question. The Sportsgoods Manufacturers and Exporters Associationhas also encouraged members to work with the Punjabi state government, which will reportedly provide assistance if members are interested in setting up centralizedstitching centers in lieu of using individual subcontractors.  129 On September 13, 1997, the Sportsgoods Manufacturers and Exporters Association reported that 27 exporting companies have provided information on their stitchers. Eighteen of these companies have obtained lists of stitchers from their contractors.  130 3.  FIFA The International Federation of Football Associations (FIFA)  131  authorizes the use of its logo on soccer balls that meet international matchball standards. On September 3, 1996, FIFA announced an agreement with three international unions  132  on a Code of Labor Practice for all goods bearing its logo.  133   Use of the FIFA logo bya licensee would signify that production was carried out in compliance with ILO Conventions banning child labor and forced labor, ensuring non-discrimination in employment, guaranteeing the right of workers to form and join trade unions and to bargain collectively, and ensuring payment of a minimum wage.  134  These commitments would be binding not only on the licensees, but also on each contractor and subcontractor in the production and distribution of FIFA- licensed products.  135  The FIFA Code of Labour Practice has not been embraced by soccer ball manufacturers or importers. In the year since the Code of Labor Practice was announced, FIFA has endorsed the Partners' Agreement but has not issued any information on the implementation of the FIFA code.  136 4.  Survey Results In addition to endorsing the Partners' Agreement, some U. S. importers of soccer balls have issued their own codes of conduct that prohibit the use of child labor. Some retailers have also adopted similar codes of conduct. In order to gather information on the extent and implementation of codes of conduct and labeling programs regarding child labor in the soccer ball industry, the U. S. Department of Labor conducted a voluntary survey of 7 importers and 3 retailersof soccer balls.  137  ( See Box IV- 1 for a list of the companies surveyed and Appendix B for the Company Questionnaire). Nine companies responded to the survey: Adidas, Baden Sports, Brine, Kmart, Nike, Pentland (Mitre), Reebok, Umbro, and Wal-Mart. The respondents indicated they import soccer balls either directly from foreign manufacturers in China, Indonesia or Pakistan, or through a U. S.- based purchasing agent.    Six of the seven importers source their soccer balls directly from a foreign manufacturer; one firm   (Pentland) also sources its balls through a purchasing agent. The seventh, Adidas, currently imports its soccer balls through a licensee, Molten, U. S. A. None of the seven importers own foreign manufacturing facilities. However, Reebok and Nike have invested in special facilities being built by their Pakistani producers in order to meet their child labor-free production policies.     The two retailers responding to the survey use U. S. licensees or purchasing agents to obtain soccer balls. Kmart, for example, purchases soccer balls from Seneca Sports, Franklin Sports, Molten U. S. A., and Spalding Sports ( see Section D. 4. b. above).     Seven of the companies responding to the survey indicated they have a written corporate policy prohibiting child labor. The written policies take the form of a code of conduct, vendor agreement, purchase order, or statement of principles.In cases where the company purchases and/or sells numerous products, the code applies to all the products, not just soccer balls. Copies of the policies are reproduced in Appendix C.    All seven importers (Adidas, Baden Sports, Brine, Nike, Pentland (Mitre), Reebok and Umbro) have endorsed the Partners' Agreement in addition to their individual corporate policies against child labor.    Brine stated that it has no written policy prohibiting child labor, although it is a member of the Partners' Agreement and has always made it clear to suppliers that child labor is unacceptable. However, this policy is not included in their purchase orders or vendor agreements.     Adidas' licensing agreement requires its licensees and manufacturers to comply with all applicable laws, including those prohibiting child labor. Manufacturers are also required to ensure that subcontractors comply with these standards. Failure to comply may be a basis for terminating the agreement.     Although Baden has no written code of conduct prohibiting child labor, they  require their factory representatives to verify that no children are engaged in making their products.     Nike's code of conduct prohibits the use of child labor. Child labor is defined as a person under the age of 15, unless national law states that the minimum age for work is fourteen  or  the age at which compulsory schooling has ended, whichever is greater.     TABLE IV-2 Type of Policy Prohibiting Child Labor (Based on Responses to Department of Labor Questionnaire)     * Company participates in the Partners' Agreement to Eliminate Child Labour in the Soccer Ball industry in Pakistan a  Company has its own labeling program b  Company has a formal code of conduct, statement of principals or compliance certificate c  Company has a purchase order, letter of credit, or buying agent agreement, which contains a specific prohibition on child labor in overseas production.        Pentland's letter of credit requires suppliers to certify that items were not mined, produced, manufactured, assembled or packed by the use of child labor as defined by national law.     Kmart's Workplace Code of Conduct is applicable to all suppliers and the suppliers' subcontractors in the United States and abroad. Kmart's code requires suppliers and their contractors to comply with local child labor laws and regulations. Children under the local legal age should not be employed by the supplier.     Reebok's code of conduct states that it will not work with business partners that use child labor. Reebok defines child labor as work performed by a person under 14, or younger than the age for compulsory schooling, whichever is higher.     Umbro requires its suppliers to sign a pledge every year certifying that they are observing national child labor laws.     Wal-Mart's Standards for Vendor Partners declares that Wal- Mart will not tolerate the use of child labor in the manufacture of products it sells. The standard applies to vendor partners as well as to their contractors, subcontractors or any other entity with whom they have a relationship for the manufacture of products sold by Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart defines child labor as work by a person younger than 15 (or 14 if so designated by national law) or younger than the age for completing compulsory education if that age is higher than 15.     Only three respondents  all importers  indicated that they communicatetheir no child labor policy directly to consumers. The remaining importers and retailers report either that they have no method to inform consumers that no childlabor is used in the foreign production of soccer balls, or that their suppliers label the balls.    Reebok and Baden have adopted labels to inform consumers that their soccer balls are made without child labor ( see Section D above). Reebok's code of conduct is reproduced on its internet website.     Nike said that consumers can learn about their no child labor policy on its internet website or by calling a toll- free number set up by the Soccer Industry Council of America that lists the names of companies participating in the Partner's Agreement.     Kmart noted that their four suppliers (Seneca Sports, Franklin Sports, Molten U. S. A., and Spalding Sports) have submitted letters indicating that they would label the balls child labor- free. Three of the four suppliers (Seneca Sports, Franklin Sports, and Spalding Sports) are now selling labeled balls to Kmart ( see Section D. 4. b. above for a more detailed discussion).     Brine noted that they do not have a separate mechanism for informing consumers that a soccer ball is not made by children, as their brand name alone should stand for not using child labor. Brine raised the concern that creating a special ""not made with child labor"" designation will lead to exploitation of the situation, and that smaller manufacturers that are financially unable to mount a large no child labor public relations campaign are bound to suffer even if they do have a no child labor commitment.     The companies surveyed indicated that they utilize a variety of means to monitor that their codes of conduct or policies on child labor are respected by their suppliers. Details of Reebok, Baden, and Kmart's monitoring procedures are found in Section D above. Table IV- 3 illustrates the type of monitoring the respondents employ. Seven of the nine respondents (Adidas, Baden, Brine, Kmart, Nike, Reebokand Wal- Mart) stated that they use contractual monitoring, i. e., they require their suppliers, through contractual agreements, to certify that their soccer balls are not made by children. The two retailers (Kmart and Wal- Mart) use only contractual monitoring to ensure their policy is being properly implemented. Seven of the nine respondents (Adidas, Baden, Brine, Nike, Pentland, Reebok and Umbro) send company staff, buyer agents or other parties to inspect facilities to verify that suppliers are actually implementing their code of conduct. Nike andReebok indicated that, in addition to contractual and internal monitoring, they use external accounting, auditing, testing or consulting firms, and/ or NGOs to monitor labor practices. In response to the Department's survey, some respondents submit-ted letters from the local Pakistani Labor Department certifying that a factory manufacturing soccer balls is free of child labor. Adidas, Brine, Nike, Pentland, Reebok and Umbro explained that they relyon the system established by the Partners' Agreement to monitor their child labor policy  in addition to any monitoring they might conduct on their own. Companies that support the Partners' Agreement pledge only to do business with Pakistani manufacturers who participate in the Agreement and consent to internal and external monitoring. As indicated above, however, the internal and external monitoring programs established by the Agreement have not yet been fully implemented.  TABLE IV-3 Monitoring Strategies for Compliance with International Child Labor Policies (Based on Responses to Department of Labor Questionnaire)     a  Company relies on guarantees made by suppliers through contractual documents or certificates that they are adhering to the company's policies. b  Company uses site visits and inspections by company staff, buyer agents, or other parties to verify that suppliers are actually implementing the codes of conduct. c  Company uses external accounting, auditing, testing or consulting firms, NGOs, or international organizations to monitor labor practices.        Local and quality control personnel employed by Adidas regularly visit manufacturers facilities. Adidas submitted a letter from the Punjabi Directorate of Labour Welfare attesting that children have never been found in the factory of their supplier, Sublime Sports.     Kmart's code of conduct requires suppliers and their subcontractors to allow full access to their facilities at all times for inspections by Kmart representatives or independent firms retained by Kmart. Kmart states that it has never found any child labor in the production of soccer balls.    138 It is not clear whether Kmart's monitoring system specifically applies to the soccer balls sold in their stores. However, in February 1997, Kmart received letters from four soccer ball suppliers assuring the retailer that the balls were not made by children. The suppliers' letters informed Kmart that each company is participating in the Partners' Agreement.     Nike imports soccer balls from SAGA Sports in Sialkot. Nike and SAGA  determined jointly that the best way to eliminate child labor was to create village stitching centers where it would be easier to monitor the ages of the   stitchers. By mid-1997, three stitching centers were operating with two additional centers scheduled to be completed by September 1997.    139  One of the centers is exclusively for women. Nike states that it monitors its code of conduct in Pakistan through its own internal procedures, and by using a Pakistani affiliate of Grant Thornton as an external monitor.     Pentland's soccer ball product managers visit their production facilities about three times a year to monitor compliance with their child labor policy. Pentland noted, however, that it is difficult to monitor for child labor since children are seldom found in the factories, but stitch soccer balls in homes and small workshops in the rural areas.   Over the next two years, Pentland plans to implement a China- specific monitoring plan in response to their concern about the use of child labor in China's soccer ball industry. The policy will have three components: 1) better factory control of home working situations; 2) documenting the age of young factory workers; and 3) protecting older working children (14, 15, 16 and 17 year olds) by restricting overtime and identifying areas of potential hazard where they should not be working.   Umbro personnel make spot- checks at suppliers' factories in 4- 8 week cycles. Umbro stated that although they conduct spot checks on ""external stitching facilities,"" they can never be completely certain that no child labor is being used.    F. Conclusion There has been significant public attention focused on the use of child laborin the soccer ball industry.  140  Most reports describe Pakistani children sitting forhours a day in small workshops stitching soccer balls. Other more recent reportsdescribe a similar situation in India's soccer ball industry. Soccer balls are also madein China and Indonesia, but the Department is not aware of any child labor allegations in the soccer ball industries of these countries. One company surveyed for this report, however, plans to implement an internal monitoring system in China due to concerns of child labor. Children stitch soccer balls in small workshops or homes, many times inremote rural areas. It is rare for a child to be found working in a large soccer ball factory. In Pakistan and India, child labor laws prohibit children from working in factories, but not in the type of subcontracting or homework arrangements common to the soccer ball industry. Some of the children work full-time. Others work during non-school hours. Many work for up to nine or ten hours a day. The international soccer ball industry has responded to the child labor accusations by creating codes of conduct and monitoring systems. In February 1997,Pakistani manufacturers signed an agreement (Partners'Agreement) with the ILO andUNICEF to phase children out of the industry, to provide education and other services to them, and to participate in internal and external monitoring programs. Over 50 U. S. and Pakistani companies pledged to support the agreement. By the time this report was written, the Partners' Agreement was not yet fully operational. In India,the industry is moving toward an agreement to stop the use of child labor. Discussions are underway between representatives of the industry, ILO, UNICEF, NGOs,trade unions and government to determine how best to accomplish this goal. Some individual companies are responding to public pressure by placingchild labor-free labels on their balls. The Department of Labor has identified eight companies that are using such labels. Reebok and Baden are both changing their production processes and implementing monitoring systems to support the use ofthe label. Reebok has hired independent human rights monitors to verify that no children stitch Reebok balls. Dunkin' Donuts sold promotional soccer balls duringthe 1997 summer months bearing a child labor-free label. Dunkin's Donuts asked a U.S.-based NGO to monitor the production of these balls and certify that they were not made by children. The other companies are making their no child labor claimsbased upon their participation in the Partners' Agreement. It is premature, however,to make such a claim because the monitoring components of the Partners' Agreement have not yet been fully implemented. Other companies are changing their production processes to prevent the use of child labor. For instance, Reebok has centralized all soccer production in one factory. Nike has created stitching centers in order to better monitor where production takes place. Baden has changed from Pakistani to Chinese suppliers and mecha-nized the stitching process. Although some individual companies have developed labels for their soccer balls, the majority of the soccer ball industry has opted instead to implement a variety of different codes of conduct to prohibit and prevent child labor. All companies responding to a Department of Labor survey on codes of conduct and labeling programs indicated that they have some type of corporate policy prohibiting child labor. Not all these policies are in writing, and very few are enforced through a rigorous monitoring system.    This report was produced by the staff of the International Child Labor Program and is published by the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of International Labor Affairs.

The Department’s Employment Standards Administration   will introduce a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to revise the LM-2, the   reporting form required for large unions under the Labor-Management Reporting   and Disclosure Act of 1959. The LM-2 form has not undergone significant change   since it was first promulgated more than 40 years ago.      The proposed LM-2 form will give union members more detailed information   about the financial activities of their unions, in an easily understood format   that will be available on the Department’s website. The new forms will be   usefully organized according to the services and functions of the union,   enabling members to identify major receipts and disbursements for these various   activities. For the first time, union members will be able to examine financial   transactions of “joint trusts” and subsidiaries managed by their   unions, which currently have little or no accountability to rank-and-file   members.      Enhanced disclosure will help union members better exercise their   self-governance rights and detect financial mismanagement and misconduct by   union officials. U.S. Labor Department investigations of union financial fraud   result in an average of 11 criminal convictions a month, with a total of more   than 640 convictions during the past five years.      Only the largest and most financially sophisticated unions—about   20%—will be materially affected by these proposed transparency reforms.   The Department expects the burden of compliance to be substantially reduced by   new reporting software it is developing for unions to use, free of charge, in   preparing and filing their reports.      “Despite the increasing complexity and activity of labor unions   over the years, the form used to disclose their financial information to   members has remained virtually unchanged in the last 40 years,” said   Victoria Lipnic, Assistant Secretary for the Employment Standards   Administration. “These reforms will give union members better, more   understandable information for them to judge the financial health and integrity   of their unions.”      The LM-2 form was created under the Labor-Management Reporting   Disclosure Act, passed by Democrats and Republicans in 1959.      As part of the proposed rulemaking, comments are invited for 60 days   after publication in the Federal Register.
