How Real is 20th      Century Warming?         Surface Temperatures           In  Figure        2  we see a record of surface temperature anomalies with respect to        a 30-year period, 1961-1990. Anomalies, being relative to each ""thermometer's""        individual average are perhaps the most accurate way of combining observations        from the wide array of temperature measurements around the world for the        past hundred years or so since instrumental observation began. The record        shows a rise in global surface temperatures of nearly 1.0°C (~ 1.8°F)        since 1920. But this rise has been neither smooth nor monotonic. It can        be broken into roughly five pieces (the large warming in 1998 is unprecedented        and will be discussed separately):                             Figure 2. Measured global surface        temperatures relative to the average for the 30-year period 1961 to 1990        (the horizontal line)                                                              1860-1920  relatively        constant         1920-1940  rapid rise         1940-1975  slight decline (at least in the northern hemisphere)        1975-1982  rapid rise        1982-1997  slow rise complicated by cooling from two volcanoes         But the single year        numbers for the entire Earth do not tell the complete story as they are        averages of a rich variation in regional temperatures. In  Figure        3   we see the difference in temperatures between averages 1955-1974        and 1975-1994. Especially prominent is the cooling in parts of the oceans        and warming in the high-latitude land masses. In addition, it has been found        that much of the warming results not from increases in daytime temperatures        but from lack of decreases at night. Thus, whatever the climate is doing,        the Earth seems to be having difficulty radiating away its heat at night.        Finally, the warming seen so far in 1998 has a regional character ( Figure        4 ) significantly different. It shows warming relative to the period        1992-1998 that includes most land masses (Europe is cooler due to a change        in North Atlantic atmospheric conditions called the North Atlantic Oscillation),        and most of the oceans (cooler region in equatorial Pacific is strong La        Niña signature). Thus the magnitude and extent of the 1998 warming        is cause for considerable attention.                                           Figure 3. Change (from 1955-74 to        1975-94) of annual land-surface air temperature and sea surface temperature                                                                                         Figure 4.

Reynolds NCEP/NWS/NOAA                                                                            In his book        Fred Singer attacks the validity of records like  Figure        2  by suggesting        the so-called ""urban heat island effect."" There is always the concern that        part of the observed warming is an instrumental effect of the observational        sites being engulfed by our expanding cities that at times are warmer than        the surrounding countryside. In his Figure 7 he shows observations made        in California showing this effect. The intent here is to suggest that there        is little or no warming which is a remarkable reading of the data. In truth        many painstaking studies have been done to determine how great this effect        might be on a global scale. All major studies show it to be quite small.                  Figure        5  is the latest        result from the National Climate Data Center (NCDC) which employed satellite        surveys to separate observational sites into urban, suburban, and rural.        The results are curious in that they show an insignificant difference until        1992 (during the rapid cooling caused by aerosols injected into the stratospheric        by the Mt. Pinatubo eruptions). This result is corroborated by satellite        observations of temperature which, of course, are not affected by the effect        in question (see discussion of satellite temperatures below).                      Figure 5. Global surface temperatures separated into three categories, those in rural, suburban, and urban areas. (NCDC unpublished graph)                        Singer goes on to guide        the reader to the wrong conclusion by showing an earlier NCDC result for        the United States (his Figure 8). The temperatures in this graph (after        correction for urban effects) actual decline from 1940 to 1985. What Singer        does not show is that record is virtually indistinguishable from the one        without the correction! In fact the US temperatures for this period do not        follow global ones as is true for Europe (also shown in his Figure 8). This        is more a result of American and European proximity to and dependence upon        the North Atlantic which was cooling during that period. Reference to my         Figure 3  shows that this situation has changed        in the last 20 years.         Satellite Temperatures           Since 1979, surface        measurements have been augmented by observations from satellites. A series        of 9 successive but overlapping platforms have been taking the Earth’s        temperature via variations in the microwave radiation from atmospheric oxygen—the        so-called Microwave Sounding Units, MSU. Looking down in two different frequency        bands, which sense the stratosphere (MSU 4, roughly 12-27 km) and the upper        troposphere (MSU 2, roughly 0-12 km), respectively, these satellites have        given us the first truly global assessment of temperatures, albeit high        in the Earth’s atmosphere. In an attempt to record temperatures more        characteristic of the lower atmosphere (MSU 2R, roughly 0-7 km), the MSU        2 detector is tilted to look towards the horizon at several angles, which        allows subtraction of the upper troposphere contribution. Thus, we have        global temperature records from three altitudes in our atmosphere. The record        of most interest because it most nearly approximates temperatures at the        surface is MSU 2R (characteristic of the lower atmosphere) shown in  Figure        6 . This can be compared with the surface record shown in  Figure        7  for both land and ocean (note tick marks indicating the start of        satellite observations as well as times of cooling due to eruptions of volcanoes,        El Chichon and Pinatubo). The two major coolings in the satellite record        (largely due to the volcanic eruptions already mentioned), and the remarkable        temperature increase in 1998 are clearly seen. Satellite records are roughly        substantiated by balloon measurements (called radiosondes). The three records—surface,        balloon, and satellite—are compared in  Figure        8 . There is good agreement among these with the exceptions of a short        time around 1980 when surface temperatures in the tropics were cooler than        the others, and since 1992 after the Mt. Pinatubo eruption. Of course at        any given time there is no reason why temperatures in the lower troposphere        should agree exactly with those near the surface within the so-called planetary        boundary layer (for instance the satellite missed much of the warming due        to the 1996-97 El Niño). But on the larger global-scale average over        several years one would expect fairly close agreement that is seen.              Singer’s        book documents a controversy raised by the so-called ""Contrarians"" who dispute        global warming. In attempting to determine whether the atmosphere was warming        or cooling during the time of the satellite record (1979-1997), a straight        line was drawn through it. Since the satellites observed slightly higher        temperatures around the beginning and slightly cooler at the end, the slope        of the line is unduly dominated by these end points and shows a slight cooling.        The surface record shows only moderate warming (moderated as it was by two        volcanic coolings). Thus, while agreement between the two records is largely        very good, the small and largely artificial difference in trends shows one        cooling and one warming. Much has been made in the ""Contrarian"" press of        this. This is the essence of Singers’ figures 6 and 9 complete with straight lines included. In addition,      Figure 6 shows not general agreement between surface and satellite, but a growing difference.      Compare this result with that ( (Figure 9)   published in the referred literature and substantiated          Figure 6. Satellite observations (MSU-2R)(monthly global temperature changes for the lower             troposphere) (surface to 8 km height)                                                 Figure 7.

Dashed line (inset) is MSU 4 minus radiosonde. (Note: MSU 2R and MSU 4 are channels of the MSU instrument designed to sample the lower troposphere and stratosphere, respectively.                            by John Christy (private communication), who is in charge of the satellite        temperature program for NASA. This shows the difference between the satellite's        MSU 2R record and the surface for the entire Earth, northern subtropics,        tropics, and southern subtropics. Note that the small disagreement around        1980 is confined to the tropics, and that the disagreement during Mt. Pinatubo        cooling and recovery is global. The rest of the record is essential agreement.        I am not certain where Singer got his data for Figure 6, but I believe it        to be incorrect.  Figure 9  shows that a better way to determine temperature        trends during this period would be to draw a straight line through the record        from 1981 to 1992 and discuss the end points separately. Done this way Singer’s        Figure 6 is misleading and unfortunate. His Figure 9 goes on to show latitudinal        variations in that straight line trend which continues to mislead; however,        it does show an interesting agreement for the north latitudes where most        of the continents are. We will discuss this later since far from contradiction        warming expectations, it actually supports them.                Finally, there        has been much in the referred literature about the difficulties of determining        satellite temperatures and trends when the record is a patchwork quilt from        9 different platforms which had to be cross calibrated and all of which        were plagued by orbital decay and drifts. Christy himself has continually        published adjustments to this record that changed the straight line trend.        It is instructive to look at the history of these changes which is shown        in  Figure 10 . At first the trend trended to        increase cooling due partly to the disagreement between satellite and surface        in the amount of recovery from Pinatubo cooling. This was followed by adjustments        that culminated in a trend indistinguishable from zero with the inclusion        of orbit decay and drift corrections. The final point given me by Christy        (private communication) incorporates the massive warming of 1998.                 My reading of attempts to compare surface and satellite temperatures  is that we are finding general corroboration of the surface record, albeit with some fascinating differences, which may lead to better understanding of coupling between the surface and planetary boundary layer on the one hand and the lower troposphere on the other. But perhaps most important, the general agreement of satellite with surface represents  extremely strong support for the conclusion that there the global urban heat island effect is negligible.                  Summary to Question: is 20th Century Temperature Record Real?        Thus, while continued careful study is necessary, the general agreement between surface instruments, balloon-borne and satellite detectors, leaves little doubt that the warming in the 20th century is real and is approaching 1°C and that the arguments put forth in Singer’s book are misleading, incorrect, and unfortunate, given the potential seriousness of the problem.

Red is an increase in the average temperature,     and blue is a decrease in average temperature. The large increase     in 1982 was caused by the volcanic eruption of El Chichon, and     the increase in 1991 was caused by the eruption of Mt. Pinatubo     in the Philippines. December 1997   and January 1998, were     the coldest months on record for the stratosphere. (If you click     on the chart above, you will get the data with which the chart     was created.)

GX236-58-6584091	"4  S&TR July/August 2002  Our planet's climate is warming up. The effects are, for the first time, visible on a regional scale.  G  LOBAL warming. Few phrases elicit so much controversy today. But is our climate truly changing? And if it is, do we know why it is changing? At the United Nations, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) certainly thinks the world is getting warmer and puts much of the blame on human activity. In its 2001 Third Assessment Report, the IPCC projects that average global temperature will increase by 1.6 to 6C by 2100. The report indicates that, globally, the 1990s were the warmest decade on record, with 1998 the single warmest year. Accompanying this global-scale temperature increase were changes in other climate variables, such as precipitation, snow cover, glacier extent, and sea level. The changes in these variables are broadly consistent with the IPCC's estimate that Earth's  surface warmed by roughly 0.6C over the 20th century. The 2001 IPCC report concluded that ""there is new and stronger evidence that most of the warming observed over the last 50 years is attributable to human activity."" Atmospheric carbon dioxide and other trace gases help keep our planet warm by absorbing some of the Sun's heat that the Earth would otherwise emit back into space. This natural greenhouse effect makes Earth's surface about 34C warmer than it would be without greenhouse gases. But human activities, such as the burning of fossil fuels, have added greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. Atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, for example, have increased by about 30 percent since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. This human-caused enhancement of the natural greenhouse effect has contributed to the warming of the planet over the last century. Climate change can occur even in the absence of human activities. The climate system is like a bell that rings in a certain way. One form of ""ringing"" is  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory   S&TR July/August 2002  Climate Modeling  5  El Chichn  Mount Pinatubo  Height, hectopascals  El Nio 1997 to 1998  the ocean warming phenomenon known as El Nio or its cooling sister, La Nia. Such changes are thought to be due to the internal variability of the climate system. But external events can also cause natural climate changes. Large volcanic eruptions can pump massive quantities of dust into the upper atmosphere (the stratosphere). The dust may remain in the stratosphere for years, cooling Earth's surface by absorbing and reflecting some of the incoming sunlight. Natural changes in the Sun's energy output and slow changes in Earth's orbit can also influence climate. Carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases get the most press, but there are other human influences as well. Changes in land use can be a concern. For example, Livermore scientists recently showed that human-caused changes in land-use patterns (especially conversion of forests to farm land) may have caused a gradual global cooling of approximately 0.25C, mostly before the 20th century. Large-scale burning of rain forests sends particulate matter into the lower atmosphere, warming us. At the same time, with fewer trees, less carbon dioxide can be absorbed from the atmosphere, which warms us further. Land surface changes also affect Earth's reflectivity, or albedo. If Earth is getting warmer, is it possible to expose individual factors  Globally averaged temperatures have changed at different levels in Earth's atmosphere. This profile is from close to Earth's surface through to the stratosphere. Temperatures are in the form of departures (anomalies) from long-term monthly means computed from 1979 to 1999 and are in degrees Celsius. The stratospheric warming caused by the El Chichn and Mount Pinatubo volcanic eruptions is clearly evident, as is the cooling of the lower atmosphere after Pinatubo. Results are from the so-called reanalysis project jointly performed by the National Center for Environmental Prediction and the National Center for Atmospheric Research.  causing climate change? And what will global warming mean on a regional level? Two Livermore research teams are searching for--and finding--answers. Atmospheric scientist Ben Santer, a 1998 John A. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation Fellow, has used sophisticated climate models to separate the effects of recent major volcanic eruptions and El Nios from other causes of climate change. The motivation for this research was to shed light on one of the outstanding puzzles in climate science: why Earth's surface has apparently warmed faster than the lower atmosphere. At the same time, a team led by physicist Philip Duffy has brought the highest resolution yet to global climate modeling, revealing a wealth of regional effects for the first time. Instead of a 300-kilometer grid--the previous state  of the art--Duffy's team has been able to perform global simulations using models with grid cell sizes of 75 and even 50 kilometers. These are the finest-resolution global climate simulations performed to date. The figure on p. 6 compares these resolutions. Duffy's work would not be possible without Livermore's massively parallel supercomputers, which can quickly perform the computationally demanding calculations inherent in global climate modeling. The first simulations using the 50-kilometer grid ran on the Advanced Simulation and Computing (ASCI) White computer during its initial, unclassified testing period in December 2000. Because the ASCI White computer is now used exclusively for classified computations, models used by Duffy's group are being  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory   6  Climate Modeling  S&TR July/August 2002  run on other supercomputers at Livermore and at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. A 1-year simulation of global climate using the 300-kilometer grid can now be accomplished in 4 or 5 hours. Five years ago, it would have taken over a day to complete a comparable simulation. For the 50-kilometer grid, ""At best, we can do about a month of simulated climate in a day,"" says Duffy. A 50-kilometer grid for climate modeling was the stuff of dreams 5 years ago. Why the Controversy? Much of the controversy about global warming results from two apparent contradictions. One relates to observed temperature data and the other to the issue of how well computer models of (a) 300-kilometer model  the global climate system can represent such observations. While Earth's surface has warmed by about 0.15 to 0.2C per decade since 1979, temperatures in the troposphere (the layer of the atmosphere extending from Earth's surface to 8 to 16 kilometers above it) have shown little warming, and even a slight cooling. The apparent lack of tropospheric warming from 1979 to the present has been used to cast doubt on the reality of strong surface warming. It is important to understand whether this difference between surface and tropospheric warming rates is real or is an artifact of data problems. If this difference is real, what factors might be causing it? (b) 50-kilometer model  The second puzzle relates to the inability of many climate models to simulate the apparent difference in surface and tropospheric warming rates. This inconsistency is sometimes used to bolster arguments that models are inappropriate tools for making projections of future climate change. Recent work by Santer and his colleagues has addressed both of these puzzles. They have learned that at least some of the differential warming of Earth's surface and lower troposphere is real and attributable to the combined effects of stratospheric ozone depletion, volcanic eruptions, and natural climate variability. Differences in the geographic regions sampled by the surface thermometer network and the satellite-based tropospheric temperature measurements also explain some of the divergent temperature changes of the surface and troposphere. ""But,"" Santer concedes, ""accounting for these effects still does not fully explain the different rates of temperature change. Nor does it explain why models don't reproduce this differential behavior accurately."" A Search for Resolution For several years, Santer has been working with other investigators at Livermore and research institutions around the world to reconcile the apparent contradictions in actual data and global climate models. In one study of climate between 1979 and 1998, they discovered that a model including anthropogenic (humancaused) factors and volcanic aerosols produced surfacetroposphere temperature differences that were the closest yet to actual observed data. As a follow-up, they wanted to examine the influence of volcanoes alone. But, says Santer, ""We had a bit of bad luck. Nature made our lives difficult. There was a major El Nio in  225  500  1,000  1,500 Elevation, meters  2,000  2,500  2,800  The topography of California and Nevada is simulated in models with (a) 300-kilometer and (b) 50-kilometer grids. Models that use the 300-kilometer grid have been the state of the art, but Livermore has developed a 50-kilometer-grid model. Even with 50-kilometer grids, the topography of California and Nevada is not represented. The Coast Range mountains are not visible in (b), and the data smoothing process lowers the elevation of the Sierra Nevada mountains.  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory   S&TR July/August 2002  Climate Modeling  7  1982, at the same time as the eruption of El Chichn in Mexico. A smaller El Nio coincided with the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines. This made it tough to disentangle the effects that volcanoes and El Nios had on surface and tropospheric temperatures."" Santer and his Livermore colleagues had been doing similar work for the past 10 years. For the first half of that time, they were trying to identify humancaused climate signals in observed temperature records. This involved using both model and observational climate data to understand the characteristic (a) Lower troposphere  fingerprints of the many natural and anthropogenic influences on climate. (See the figure on p. 8.) Previous researchers had attempted to remove the effects of explosive volcanic eruptions and El Nios from surface and tropospheric temperatures so they could obtain better estimates of the underlying human component of climate change. But Santer's team was the first to deal fully with the correlation of volcanic eruptions and El Nios, known in statistical problems as collinearity. The team's observational data were land and ocean surface temperatures (b) Earth's surface 1979  compiled at the Climatic Research Unit in Norwich, England, together with satellite-based tropospheric temperature measurements. Their model data came from a number of different sources: the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg, Germany, the Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York, and the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado. Researchers from all of these organizations participated in the team. Other team members were with Livermore's Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison,  1980  1998  Geographic patterns of annually averaged temperature anomalies in (a) the lower troposphere and (b) at Earth's surface. Tropospheric temperature measurements are from polar-orbiting satellites, and surface measurements were made by thermometers. White areas denote missing data. Although the satellites have near-global coverage, the surface data have large gaps. Comparing satellite and surface data over areas of common coverage helps to explain some of the differential warming of the surface and troposphere.

The team first dealt with observed data. They found that removing El Nio and volcanic effects always led to larger warming trends in the residual surface and lower tropospheric data than in the raw observational data (where these effects were left in). Although El Nios caused a (a) 10 25 50  small net warming from 1979 to 1999, the El Chichn and Mount Pinatubo volcanic eruptions caused a larger net cooling during the same period. Removing both El Nios and volcanoes more clearly revealed the underlying warming trend in surface and tropospheric temperatures. It also helped to explain some of the differential warming of the surface and troposphere.  30 26 22 18  100 14 200 300 500 850 10 Height, kilometers 6 2  (b) 10 25 50 18 100 14 200 300 500 850 60S 45S 30S 15S 0 Latitude 15N 30N 45N 60N 10 6 2 30 26 22  12  10  8  6  4 2 0 2 4 Temperature, degrees Celsius  6  8  10  12  (a) Atmospheric temperature changes predicted to occur in response to a doubling of preindustrial levels of carbon dioxide. (b) Projected temperature response to a 2-percent increase in the Sun's energy output. Each factor that influences our climate has a characteristic ""fingerprint."" Scientists typically use computer models of the climate system to gain information on these fingerprints. In a model, it is possible to study the climatic effects of a single influence only, such as changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide. This is not feasible in the real world, where multiple factors that influence climate are changing simultaneously. Both (a) and (b), which are clearly dissimilar, show annual mean changes (in degrees Celsius) as a function of latitude and altitude.  ""It's clear that if the Mount Pinatubo and El Chichn eruptions had not occurred, the lower troposphere would have experienced more pronounced warming,"" says Santer. The team then removed volcanic and El Nio effects from model output and compared the results with observations. It is important to do this because even in a model with ""perfect"" representation of El Nio variability, the simulated El Nios would not necessarily occur at the same time that they happened in the real world. Also, some model experiments include the effects of well-observed volcanoes (such as Mount Pinatubo) but exclude other eruptions where less is known about the properties of the volcanic aerosols. Removing volcano and El Nio effects from both models and observations allows a fairer comparison of the underlying simulated and observed responses to humancaused changes in greenhouse gases. The general conclusion from such comparisons was that removing volcano and El Nio effects from atmospheric temperature data improves the correspondence of the modeled and observed differential warming of the surface and troposphere over the last several decades. It does not, however, fully reconcile models and reality. The remaining differences are probably caused by problems with the observational temperature data; missing or inaccurately specified ""forcings"" in the climate model experiments, such as the neglect of land use changes or aerosol particles from biomass burning; and errors in the climate responses that the models predict. Santer and his colleagues are actively investigating these possibilities.""We hope we've showed that this is a complex scientific issue,"" says Santer. ""It can't be reduced to a one-minute sound bite. This issue is important, because it relates to our ability to evaluate climate models  Pressure, hectopascals  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory   S&TR July/August 2002  Climate Modeling  9  and to determine whether these models are useful tools for predicting climate change over the next century."" An Up-Close Look The IPCC's prediction that mean global temperatures will increase from 1.6 to 6C by the end of this century isn't especially useful for farmers and others whose livelihoods depend on the weather. They need more specific information on temperature increases expected in their area, whether it be Kansas or Kenya. They also need to know about changes in temperature extremes and in other important quantities such as precipitation.By providing improved simulations of climate change on regional scales, Livermore's highresolution climate simulations should allow for more accurate assessments of the effects of climate change on society. Grids of 50 kilometers and less are already used in numerical weather prediction, which is much less computationally intensive than climate modeling because it requires much shorter forecasts (days rather than decades). For long-term climate modeling with resolution this fine, scientists had to await the arrival of huge computers with hundreds of processors operating simultaneously. Duffy's team is using the Community Climate Model 3, or CCM3, an atmospheric model developed by the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in Boulder, Colorado. CCM3, the fourth-generation CCM model, is used at coarse resolutions in climate modeling centers around the world. ""For every change in horizontal resolution, there's the problem of retuning the model,"" says Duffy. Several physical processes such as convection, cloudiness, and precipitation are too small to be represented explicitly in climate models and are therefore treated using semiempirical parameterizations.

After using an iterative method to successively refine estimates of El Nio and La Nia effects on tropospheric temperatures, these effects are removed from the original temperature data in (a). The cooling effects of the El Chichn and Mount Pinatubo eruptions are now more easily seen in (c). It is clear in (d) that removing both volcanoes and El Nio effects yields a pronounced warming trend that was not apparent in the original temperature data.  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory   10  Climate Modeling  S&TR July/August 2002  For example, although clouds may be too small to be represented directly in a grid cell, they must be accounted for because cloud cover affects the flow of radiation in the atmosphere. ""So we parameterize their effects by modifying the optical properties of that layer of the atmosphere,"" says Duffy. Because these parameterizations are not based on first-principles physics, they must be tuned carefully at each resolution. Tuning is done by adjusting parameter values to make the model's results agree as closely as possible with observations. The 300-kilometer model has already (a) 300-kilometer resolution  been carefully tuned at NCAR to optimize results at that resolution. In collaboration with researchers at NCAR, Livermore researchers retuned their 75-kilometer model. Thus far, tuning done for the 75-kilometer model has also worked reasonably well with the 50-kilometer grid. The team's proof of principle with the 50- and 75-kilometer models was to compare their modeling results to observed data. Although, as Duffy notes, ""the 50-kilometer model actually has better resolution than most of our observational data."" Perhaps not surprisingly, simulations using the  50-kilometer model agreed better with observed data than either a 75- or 300-kilometer grid. In some cases, there were substantial improvements. When the team examined results in more localized regions of interest, the results were striking. The upper figure below shows simulated precipitation over the U.S. in December, January, and February using 50-, 75-, and 300kilometer grids and compares all three to observed data.

Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory   S&TR July/August 2002  Climate Modeling  11  that as spatial resolution becomes finer, not only is fine-scale detail added to the model results, but the large-scale aspects of the solution also become more realistic. Simulations of California climate are a real test of climate models because of the great variability in climate that occurs within the state's relatively small area. Much of this variability results directly or indirectly from the state's major topographic features: the Coast Range, the Central Valley, and the Sierra Nevada. The figure at left, bottom, compares actual elevations at 50-kilometer resolution with topography as represented in models having 300-, 75-, and 50-kilometer resolutions. Although the topography is more realistic as the model resolution becomes finer, neither the coastal mountains nor the Central Valley are adequately represented in even the 50-kilometer model. In part because of improved representations of topography, the model's ability to simulate precipitation in California improves dramatically as the resolution becomes finer. Nonetheless, 50-kilometer resolution is still not adequate to represent the state's Coast Range and Central Valley; even at this resolution, the simulation of precipitation differs noticeably from observations. Simulations of Arctic climate similarly improve dramatically with finer resolution, but further improvements are nonetheless needed. Most coarseresolution oceanatmospheresea ice climate models produce poor simulations of the pattern of sea-level pressure in the Arctic region.

In addition to these simulations of the present climate, Duffy's team has simulated the effects of increased greenhouse gases (that is, global warming) with the 75-kilometerresolution model. This is the finestresolution simulation of global warming performed to date and shows very different results from comparable simulations performed at coarser resolutions. Although the globally  averaged responses of temperature and other variables to increased greenhouse gases are quite similar in the 75-kilometer model and in coarserresolution models, the regional responses can be very different. For example, the figure on p. 12 shows predicted wintertime temperature changes between 2000 and 2100 in the U.S. The finer-resolution model shows regions of strong warming in the western U.S. and southeastern Canada, which are not predicted by the coarser-resolution model.

Temperatures at the Antarctic Peninsula have increased by 2.5C over the last 50 years, much faster than the global average. Getting Arctic and Antarctic models right is crucial for determining what may happen to sea levels around the world as temperatures continue to rise. Closing in on how much humans are responsible for the changes in our planet's climate is equally important. Getting it right matters to us all. --Katie Walter Key Words: climate modeling, Community Climate Model 3 (CCM3), global warming, National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR).

GX012-85-2483942	"At first glance, the themes considered under the purview of Earth System Science (ESS) might seem to be a hodgepodge of unrelated subjects. While the actual interrelationships may at first glance seem unconnected on this page, it does give several examples of some of the frequently cited topics in different subjects under study (e.g., volcanic eruptions, ocean parameters (particularly sealevel rise), the Greenhouse effect, polar temperatures; El Niño; the Ozone Hole), while showing how observations from space contribute to monitoring these phenomena. Of special interest are the predicted changes in temperatures, sugar maple distribution, and grain yield, regionally or globally, if the current mean carbon dioxide content in the atmosphere is doubled.      Evidence for Global Warming:   Degradation of Earth's Atmosphere; Sealevel Rise; Ozone Holes; Vegetation Response        ""Global change"". ""Greenhouse effect"". ""Global warming"". The media are full of statements, concerns, guesses, and speculation about these phenomena, as scientists and policy-makers around the world struggle to address recent scientific observations that indicate human activities impact our environment. And yet, each of these is a ""natural"" phenomenon, as are many others. Hurricanes, droughts, and monsoons all occur without any control by humans, to initiate, forestall or moderate them.       We can learn about our planet's interacting physical systems by observing the results of such natural phenomena, and use our knowledge to explore human-induced changes. Consider, for example, the eruption of a volcano, such as Mount Pinatubo in the Philippine Islands in 1991, that happened without human intervention. This volcano had been dormant for more than 600 years.                    When a volcano erupts it spews millions of tons of ash, debris, and gases into the atmosphere, not to mention the lava flows from some volcanoes. Because of the presence of instruments - on the ground, at the ocean's surface, and in space - we observed a cloud of sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ), emitted by Pinatubo, make its way westward, extending well past India within twelve days of the original eruption. By three months, that cloud had completely encircled the Earth, as shown from space (below), and inside of a year SO 2  particles in the atmosphere were providing gloriously-colored sunsets all over the globe and lowering global temperatures, as well. Clearly, an erupting volcano impacts more people and places than just within its immediate vicinity.                      16-4:  Why does the Pinatubo ash tend to stay confined to a wide equatorial zone?  ANSWER       Mt. Pinatubo offers a stellar example of how monitoring from space can continually update the status of transient ground events (that, in unpopulated areas [not the case in Luzon] may go unnoticed. Below are two SIR-C radar color composites (L-band HH = red; L-band HV = green; C-band = blue) taken in May (left) and September (right) of 1995, both showing the effects of the 1991 eruption. Ash from an earlier phase of the 1991 event appears in red just above the summit of the volcano .                      16-5:  There is one noticeable change in the right radar image. Find it. Make a guess as to its cause (clue: the volcano didn't erupt between May and September of 1995).  ANSWER       Another fascinating example of a natural phenomenon, we know as El Niño, because it occurs with some regularity (although not complete predictability) around Christmas time. El Niño refers to the baby Jesus, whose birthday we celebrate at the end of December. When an El Niño occurs, a pool of warm water from the western Pacific Ocean moves eastward to the western coast of South America. In the process, weather patterns around the world changes often to the detriment of human populations–as do South American fish populations. In non-El Niño years, fish are abundant in this region, because of the cold, nutrient-filled waters. When an El Niño occurs, that cold water flows deep into the Pacific, and fish populations decline dramatically, with concomitant effects on humans whose livelihood depends on those fish.                  Other such phenomena abound. Some are readily observable by space sensors, particularly meteorological and oceanographic measurements (see Section 14). As examples, consider these near-global plots. The top from comes from the Seasat Radar Scatterometer and shows prevailing wind patterns over the oceans at supercontinental scales. The bottom one depicts the mean day, night, and day-nite temperatures of the Earth's land and sea surfaces, averaged for January of 1979, from Nimbus 6's High-resolution Infra-red Sensor (HIRS) 3.4 and 4.0 µm channels ( page 14-4 ), integrated with MSU microwave and infrared data. Suffice to say that even without human contributions Earth is a dynamic system, one that changes routinely and often drastically.                                             In addition to the observed phenomena described above, scientists have accumulated other relevant, environmental recordings. For example, levels of several trace gases in our atmosphere have been rising and continue to rise. This change in atmospheric gas composition may be the most serious threat to the global well-being of Earth's environment. Information about this has been nicely summarized in an October, 1997 pamphlet entitled  Climate Change: State of Knowledge , prepared and distributed by the President's Office of Science and Technology (OST), from which information and selected illustrations on this page have been extracted.    One of these gases, carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) has been increasing at an accelerating rate since the middle of the last century, after many, many years of essentially stable levels. Why is this? A simple explanation is that the Industrial Revolution began at about the time these increases started. With that social upheaval, came the use of biomass and coal for fuel to support these new industries. Burning such material generates CO 2 .                Other trace gases have been rising, as well. Carbon Monoxide (CO) is particularly deletorious. Methane (CH 4 ), from rice paddy production and enteric fermentation, is increasing, as are chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) that have been used for many years as a refrigerant and to produce foam.                                              16-6:  The carbon dioxide curve shows regular oscillations (much like a sine curve). Why? With what do these three curves best correlate?  ANSWER       These gases contribute to the greenhouse effect that is warming our atmosphere to the levels we now record. The greenhouse effect results from the trapping of solar radiation that reflects from the Earth’s surface by these (and other) gases.  This is illustrated below.       The atmosphere is essentially transparent to incoming solar radiation. After striking the Earth's surface, the wavelength of this radiation increases as it loses energy. The gases we discussed are opaque to this lower energy radiation, and therefore trap it as heat, thereby increasing the atmospheric temperature. As these gases increase, due to natural causes and human activity, they enhance the greenhouse effect, and may raise temperatures even more. If the climate warms, the vegetation belts will tend to move northward, changing global ecological and biome patterns. Other effects may be discerned in precipitation patterns, sea level changes, and more.        Clearly, global mean annual temperatures are rising, and we continue to monitor this condition with space observations to help settle the question: how much is just a natural trend (e.g., inevitable interglacial warming) and how much is due to man's activities? Calculations show that the burning of fossil fuels (mainly coal, petroleum derivatives, and natural gas) add about 6 billion metric tons of carbon (as the element) to the air annually; each year also, deforestation permits an extra 1-2 billion metric tons of carbon to reach the atmosphere.    As an indication of how much worldwide temperatures have risen in the last few years, this next map of the globe shows temperature anomalies, with measurements from various sources as compiled by NASA GISS (Goddard Institute for Space Science), for the 9 month period in 2001 as shown.       GISS is continually refining its models. Daily inputs improve the credibility of the predictions. Now that Aqual (page 16-11) is operational, its AMSR instrument can provide global data covering very short time spans. This map is of worldwide surface temperatures on August 27, 2003:       The trend of temperature changes on an annual and 5 year running average proves that in the second half of the 20th Century the global atmosphere has been slowly warming - about 0.5 ° C, as shown here:       GISS has designed its model to predict both sea surface and surface air temperatures up to 50 years in the future. Here is a recently published forecast, which suggests that under current trends the temperature rise will be somewhat greater (more than 1 °C) than the last 50 years:       Scientists need to establish a long-term data base, which includes temperatures from previous centuries. One way to estimate past temperatures is from CO 2  measurements of  air trapped in glacial ice that has been accumulating for thousands of years. The plot below shows the general trend in rising CO 2  during the last 160,000 years (includes recent ice ages), with estimates of temperatures (derived from a CO 2  model) shown for comparison.      The next two graphs provide more details on the increasing levels of CO 2  during the last 140 years. The top shows carbon dioxide concentration increases, based on ice core measurement until 1960 and Mauna Loa Observatory measurements thereafter. Below it is the measured temperature changes averaged for the entire world; the trend upwards, amounting to about 1.5° F, shows some irregularities (not smoothly cyclic) which result from other climatic factors.         Armed with the data that relate CO 2  increase to temperature rise, models allow prediction of the global distribution of changing temperatures if the total amount of carbon dioxide in the air were to double or quadruple from today's values (arbitrarily set at 275° F). The 4x case could be truly catastrophic, leading to worldwide deserts unless the added heat in the atmosphere also notably increase vegetation growth (to tropical forms). Thus:            One obvious consequence of the significant rise in CO 2  in the northern polar latitudes would be melting of Arctic Ocean and Greenland Ice Cap ices, releasing huge quantities of stored water that would have an extremely serious impact on global sea levels. A rise to 550 ppm CO 2  by the end of year 2100 would bring about rises from 8 to 37 inches, enough to greatly modify present beach and shoreline configurations and even submerge such cities and New Orleans and Venice (which is also presently sinking because of groundwater withdrawal).    Evidence has been building, through satellite and ground measurements, that the Arctic region of the northern hemisphere has been steadily warming. This is summarized in this map of that upper northern hemisphere using data from the last 30 years. The Arctic ice shelf has responded by thinning. Further south, the western U.S. and Siberia are both in a warming trend. Note that the only region that has cooled during this time is in eastern Canada-Greenland.        A somewhat more precise map of temperature changes in the Arctic covering the two decades between 1972 and 1992 has been constructed from meteorological satellite data as shown here:        The net effect has been an overall shrinkage of the outer extent of the main sea ice cover within the Arctic Circle, as indicated here (lavender line is 1987 position; blues indicate decrease in ice thickness whereas yellows and reds show some thickening).       This can be displayed visually using data from the SSMI (Special Sensor Microwave Imagery) instrument, taken in 1979 and again in 2003. The Arctic Ocean appears to be opeining up off eastern Siberia and northern Alaska.      Despite the interior cooling of Greenland (suggesting enough snow to increase the ice cap's thickness), the edge of this ice cap is currently shrinking as confirmed by two separate aerial/ground studies in which remote sensing played a part. A NASA team made survey passes across Greenland by air using a laser altimeter to measure elevations. A second group used the Global Positioning System (GPS) ( page 11-6 ) to track movements of ice. When both results were analyzed, the map shown below was constructed. It shows increase in ice in the central part of this huge island (possibly related to the recent winter cooling) but significant shrinking near the edges (increases in summer temperature). The net loss of ice is estimated to be 51 cubic kilometers a year, enough to fill a lake 30 miles long, 30 miles wide, and 70 feet deep (spread globally to the oceans this would cause a rise of 0.005 inches a year; this contributes 7% of the total rise now being measured).       This map shows similar results from a different perspective:       Scientists visiting Greenland in the last few years have remarked about significant increases in the onset of melting along the edge of the western fringes. This is visible in MODIS images taken from 2001 into 2003, with the zone of active melting showing up as a darker gray (presence of water):        On page  14-14  evidence of major changes in Antarctica were discussed. This is in response to notable rises in temperature; in the Antarctic Peninsula, a cumulative rise between 2 to 3°C (3.6 to 5.4°F) has occurred in recent years. In the late few years parts of the fringing ice shelves have broken loose as massive ice bergs floating northward. Use of laser altimetry and interferometric measurements of data obtained by InSAR (Interferometric SAR) are showing up as annual velocities of ice movement both within the continent and along its edges, as seen in this composite image:         The Antarctic ice shelves appear in gray in this map. Letters indicate 33 named glaciers. As the ice sheets thin and break off, the glaciers respond by increased (accelerating) outward flow. The West Antarctic ice sheets (primarily the Ross Shelf) are losing ~65 cubic kilometers per year, enough to raise ocean levels by 0.16 mm/yr; worldwide sealevel is rising by 1.8 mm/yr (0.7 inches/yr), primarily from Arctic, Antarctic, and Greenland sources. Scientists have calculated that if all of the ice in Greenland and the Antarctic were to completely melt through significant warming the worldwide sealevel would rise 70 meters (230 feet), which would be catastrophic to the large fraction of global populations living near continental edges    Another sign of global warming would be shifts in the distribution of both natural vegetation and food crops. Consider this next diagram which is a map pair showing, on the left, the current range of the common sugar maple with the shift that could occur from just the predicted temperature rise associated with a CO 2  increase to 700 ppm, and, on the right, a more drastic withdrawal northward if soil moisture reduction is included. This happens simply because the climate zone that favors this maple is sensitive to specific temperature and moisture ranges.           This shift in vegetation is still being demonstrated. Measurements of green leaf distribution and other measures of vegetation (various Veg. Indices) over the last 20 years using satellite data have now revealed a substantial increase in the ""greening effect"". A study reported in the journal Science includes a map that shows the regions of the world that have experienced greater vegetation development and areas losing vegetation, largely as a result of climate changes:         In parts of the northern hemisphere, the increase seen in this summary diagram (purple is highest; green lowest increase) shows a distinct distribution in parts of Europe, Asia, and North America. The first Spring leafing is now about 1 week earlier and Fall loss of leaves is almost a week later. The most likely explanation is the warming effect of greenhouse gases and the greater availability of CO 2 .           Even more alarming would be the changing conditions that are suitable to supporting certain staple crops. A CO 2  rise to 550 pm would redistribute crop yields worldwide for common grains, as shown below. Note that warming in the higher latitudes of the northern hemisphere would favor increases in crop production in Canada/Alaska, Scandinavia, and most of Europe and Russia but changes in South America and most of Africa would move towards drops in yield.          Another observable global change, caused by certain trace gases in the atmosphere, including the CFCs, is the depletion of stratospheric ozone. Ozone in the stratosphere absorbs incoming solar ultraviolet radiation (UVR) that is dangerous to living systems. This UVR causes damage to the genetic material in living systems. Ozone prevents the UVR from reaching the Earth’s surface , and so protects us from its harmful effects. Spacecraft sensors have observed ozone depletion during the Antarctic winter, an observation that helped determine the chemistry underlying this process. Over the south pole, the right combination of cold stratospheric temperatures, ice crystals (or other solids with surfaces upon which the destruction chemistry occurs), and the global wind patterns intensify the process. Space sensors have observed similar (although smaller) depletions in the Arctic, and some of the chemical agents are increasing over mid-latitude regions, i.e., where most humans live.       These depletions have come to be known as ""ozone holes"". That this is an apt description is evident in this image of the Antarctic variations in ozone level that have been depicted in 3-D by ""contouring"" the different values:                         The size and extent of the ""hole"" varies with time as is obvious in this series of October Antarctic ozone maps taken between the years 1979 and 1992.                    16-7:  Comment on the patterns of ozone change you decipher from the above October sequence.  ANSWER          Other human activities may increase the rate of global change. One activity now grabbing attention is deforestation, whereby humans slash and burn, or just clear-cut, huge tracts of trees to use the land for agriculture or the wood for building shelters. As developers denude these large regions, biodiversity decreases, and land-use, water run-off patterns, and local weather phenomena change. Satellite remote sensing has produced dramatic images of progressive deforestation, as witnessed in these two scenes taken five years apart over the State of Rondonia in the Brazilian Amazon Basin by NOAA's AVHRR.                           16-8:  Estimate the percentage increase in deforestation in the middle of the image pair (eastern Rondonia). ANSWER                  All in all, the evidence seems to be mounting that there is a definite increase in regional and global temperatures. One sign, not commonly cited, is the progressive migration toward the poles of various animals and birds. In North America, rattlesnakes (very sensitive to temperatures) have moved into New England and the Canadian Great Plains. Tropical and desert birds found in Mexico are now spilling over into Texas and Arizona. Populations of the Snowy Owl have been decreasing in the Arctic (ecologists surmise that this is due to a large drop in the lemning population, the owls chief food source). Some of this temperature rise may by natural (warming trends during interglacial intervals are the norm); some is now recognized by experts as the consequence of manmade perturbations to the atmosphere.         Thus, many observations and other data seem to point to humans as a major causative source, having at least the potential for modifying global phenomena. However, we are not always sure of this. We continue to wonder if some of the observed changes, such as an apparent increase in atmospheric temperature, are really due to human activities? Or are they part of a natural cycle that we are only now observing in detail, because of the presence of instruments and sensors that were hitherto not available? We also ask whether the current trends will continue and how detrimental they may be.                                      Primary Contact: Nicholas M.

GX012-22-12759953	Global surface temperature has been measured since 1880 at a network of  ground-based and ocean-based sites.  Over the last century, the average  surface temperature of the Earth has increased by about 1.0 o   F. The eleven warmest years this century have all occurred since 1980,  with 1995 the warmest on record (Figure 7).   The higher latitudes have warmed more than the equatorial regions.   Beginning in 1979, satellites have been used to measure the temperature  of the atmosphere up to a height of 30,000 feet.  The long-term surface  record and the recent satellite observations differ, but that fact is not  surprising: the two techniques measure the temperature of different parts  of the Earth system (the surface, and various layers of the atmosphere).   In addition to this, a variety of factors, such as the presence of  airborne materials from the 1991 eruption of the volcano Mt. Pinatubo,  affect each record in a different way.  Satellite observations were  initially interpreted as showing a slight cooling, but more recent  analyses accounting for natural, short-term fluctuations imply warming,  just as the ground-based measurements have indicated over a longer time  period.  As more data from the satellite record become available, and as  the quality of measurements is improved, comparison of these two records  should yield additional insights.   What does warming do?  A warmer Earth speeds up the global water cycle:  the exchange of water among the oceans, atmosphere, and land.  Higher  temperatures cause more evaporation, and soils will tend to dry out  faster.  Increased amounts of water in the atmosphere will mean more rain  or snow overall.    We may be seeing the first signs of changes in the water cycle.  Since  the beginning of the century, precipitation in the United States has  increased by about 6 percent, while the frequency of intense  precipitation events (heavy downpours of more than two inches per day)  has increased by 20 percent.  Such events can cause flooding, soil  erosion, and even loss of life (Figures  8  and    9  ).  In some midcontinental areas,  increased evaporation has led to drought because the heavy rains fell  elsewhere.     There is also evidence that ecosystems are reacting to warming.  Between  1981 and 1991, the length of the growing season in the northern high  latitudes (between 45 o and 70 o  N) increased by a  total of up to twelve days, as documented by satellite imagery.  Greening  in spring and summer occurred up to eight days earlier, and vegetation  continued to photosynthesize an estimated four days longer.    Global mean sea level has risen 4 to 10 inches over the last 100 years,  mainly because water expands when heated.  The melting of glaciers, which  has occurred worldwide over the last century, also contributes to the  rise. Formerly frozen soils (permafrost) in the Alaskan and Siberian  arctic have also begun to melt, damaging both ecosystems and  infrastructure.  Melting and tundra warming will also lead to decay of  organic matter and the release of trapped carbon and methane, creating an  additional source of greenhouse gases.

The analysis supports scientists' claim that human activity is influencing the earth's climate. The findings are published in the December 15 issue of Geophysical Research Letters. NCAR's primary sponsor is the National Science Foundation.   ""Once the volcanic and El Nino influences have been removed,"" says Wigley, ""the overall record is more consistent with our current knowledge, which suggests that both natural and anthropogenic influences on climate are important and that anthropogenic influences have become more substantial in recent decades.""   Volcanic emissions cool the planet by blocking sunlight, while El Nino events raise global temperatures through warmer ocean waters. Sometimes the two occur simultaneously, muddying evidence of any underlying warming trend. During the past two decades, two massive volcanic eruptions--El Chichn in April 1982 and Mt. Pinatubo in June 1991--coincided with significant El Ninos, making trend detection more difficult.   Wigley quantified the effects of major volcanic eruptions and El Nino episodes on global mean temperatures. Overall, he found the cooling effect from sun-blocking volcanic emissions was slightly stronger than the warming effect of the coincident El Ninos. He then removed both from the temperature record to reveal an intensified, step-like warming trend over the past century.   In the raw temperature record--not adjusted for the influence of volcanic eruptions and El Nino events--the warming trend during the past two decades is similar in intensity to an earlier warming (1910 to 1940). Several decades of slight cooling separate the two warm periods. However, ""When ENSO and volcanic effects are removed,"" writes Wigley, ""the recent warming trend increases to 0.25 degree Celsius [from 0.18 degree C] per decade and becomes highly significant compared to the earlier period."" (ENSO stands for El Nino-Southern Oscillation, a term that describes interannual changes in both sea surface temperatures and atmospheric pressure across the Pacific basin.)   The overall result is a long-term warming trend that intensifies by century's end, in sync with increasing emissions of greenhouse gases. Using the raw data, greenhouse skeptics have claimed that the earlier warming's similarity to the later one suggests that both were due to natural variations rather than human activity.   Wigley also quantified and removed the warming influence of the 1997- 98 El Nino from the temperature record of the past decade. He found that of the 16 months in 1997-98 announced by the National Climatic Data Center as record breakers, at least six can be attributed to El Nino rather than to a longer-term global warming. ""The sequence is still unusual, but no more unusual than 1990-91, when an equal number of records occurred in the ENSO-adjusted data,"" writes Wigley. Nevertheless, the past decade's warmth is striking in the overall record.

Sunny  Q A  ""Why is it important to know the method of sea surface temperature determination?""  The value of the sea surface temperature (""SST"") depends to some extent on how it is measured. An increasing number of ships are being fitted with thermometers that are fastened to the inside skin of the hull (""hull contact sensors""). Provided that they are kept in calibration, we believe that these instruments give the most accurate SST values. The plot shows the average difference between SST values from Engine Room Intake (""ERI"") thermometers and those from hull contact sensors (dotted line).  1.0 Night... 0.8 SST difference (C)  Day...  0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0 -0.2 200 400 600 800 1000 1 3 5 7 0  -0.4  Total Cloud cover/ Heating from the sun (oktas) (W/m2)  For both day and night the ERI values are warmer by about 0.3 to 0.4C.

Compared to the period between 1960 to 1990, in earlier years both the air and the sea were colder by a few tenths C. In more recent years warmer air and sea temperatures have been observed. These changes, detected in the weather reports from Voluntary Observing Ships, suggest that rapid global warming, is occurring perhaps due to changes in the atmosphere caused by man. As a result many countries have agreed to limit the release of gases like carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Some countries have taken measures which have a direct impact on the everyday lives of their citizens - taxes on power consumption for example. In other countries there remain doubts as the degree of warming After all the changes are relatively small and the graph could only be plotted after making significant corrections to the data. To really understand these changes it is important that in future we obtain data of the highest accuracy - the VOS-Clim project will help in this. Remember, if the predictions are correct rising sea level could be catastrophic for some island states. Storms of increasing frequency and strength would be associated with high winds and more frequent damaging floods. Your observations will help us tell to what extent this is already happening. In fact, we urgently need to understand the climate better we need high quality data - we are asking you to help!   Q A  ""I've been making marine weather observations for many years... so why are they particularly important now?"" We have described how the marine weather observations from the past are providing vital information on the world's climate, and have highlighted the present increases in global temperatures. With improving understanding of the weather, more data from satellites, and improved computer models to help in weather forecasting, there is now an emphasis on obtaining ever higher quality measurements over the ocean. The ships in the VOS-Clim project have been chosen as the ships which we believe can provide the high quality reports which we need.  Q A  ""Will the way we make weather observations change in the future?"" Better instrumentation has already been successfully tested on research ships and prototype systems are being installed on a few Voluntary Observing Ships. But these instruments are very expensive. Once the VOS-Clim project has demonstrated the values of a chosen high quality subset of the VOS the possibility of equipping them with advanced instrumentation will be much higher.  Q A  ""So are there any direct benefits to the shipping industry?"" The VOS-Clim project will help in the development of future marine meteorological systems which are expected not only to produce better marine weather forecasts, but also to give ships much more comprehensive real-time weather information for operational purposes. In participating in the VOS-Clim project the shipping industry will also be helping mankind face one of its greatest challenges... to face the large scale weather changes associated with a changing climate.

GX255-91-1957115	"4  S&TR April 2003  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory   S&TR April 2003  Aerosols and Climate Change  5  Computer models reveal the significant effects of aerosols resulting from human activity.  O  NE of the most controversial scientific issues is determining the causes of the gradual warming of Earth's atmosphere over the past century, especially the last 50 years. Lawrence Livermore scientists have been among the leaders in modeling global climate change to better understand the nature of the warming, to predict the probable climate in the coming decades, and to determine the role of anthropogenic (human) activity in climate change. Until recently, the most important factor in global climate change appeared to be the steady accumulation of greenhouse gases, mainly produced by the burning of fossil fuels in cars, factories, and power plants. These greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, are known to trap sunlight and thereby warm the atmosphere. Close observations of global temperature records over the past 50 years have shown less global  warming than predicted by computer models that include only accumulations of greenhouse gases. The explanation for this apparent discrepancy is that increasing concentrations of anthropogenic aerosols in the atmosphere may be cooling the planet and so partially counteracting the effects from the greenhouse gases. In the past 10 to 15 years, scientists have also begun to consider how aerosols, microscopic particles directly suspended in the atmosphere or trapped in clouds, may be changing the planet's climate. Beginning in the early 1990s, calculations showed that aerosols composed of sulfates (a form of sulfuric acid and a main component of air pollution) could be cooling the atmosphere by backscattering incoming solar radiation. The process works in much the same manner as volcanic eruptions, which spew many tons of sulfates into the higher atmosphere that eventually result in the cooling of Earth's climate. (See the box on pp. 1011.)  Spotlight on Aerosols In the past few years, intriguing data from ground stations and satellites, together with insight gained from computer models, have made aerosols a major focus of atmospheric research. ""Ten years ago, the focus was on greenhouse gases. Now aerosols are getting the attention,"" says Livermore atmospheric scientist Catherine Chuang. Chuang notes, however, that large variations in aerosol concentrations have made it difficult to confidently assess the magnitude of their effects on climate. Aerosol chemistry and physics, especially in clouds, are complex and not completely understood. Particles typically remain aloft in the troposphere (lower atmosphere) for a week or less, in contrast to greenhouse gases, which can persist for about a century. Because they are short-lived, aerosols do not mix homogeneously around the planet's atmosphere, and so concentrations differ greatly from one region to the next. What's more, aerosols come in a wide range of  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory   6  Aerosols and Climate Change  S&TR April 2003  particle sizes, with particles smaller than a micrometer exerting comparatively greater climatic effects. As a result, says Chuang, one of the greatest uncertainties in climatic change is the role played by anthropogenic aerosols. To reduce these uncertainties, scientists are turning to sophisticated computer simulations in an attempt to gain insight into aerosols' climatic effects. During the past few years, Chuang and colleagues including Joyce Penner (now at the University of Michigan), Keith Grant, Jane Dignon, Peter Connell, Daniel Bergman, and Douglas Rotman have used Livermore's TeraCluster2000 multiparallel supercomputer and the resources of the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory to model how anthropogenic aerosols affect global and regional 3  climate. The researchers' simulations show in unprecedented detail how aerosols are partially offsetting the effect of global warming and changing the properties of clouds. In some industrial regions, the generation of aerosols from fossil fuel combustion and biomass (forest and grassland) burning may be as important to climate change as greenhouse gases. Also, climate changes caused by aerosols vary significantly by season and by region. The research team belongs to the Atmospheric Chemistry and Aerosols Group, part of the Atmospheric Science Division of Livermore's Energy and Environment Directorate. The team's advanced simulations, whose findings have been corroborated by field measurements at different geographical locations, build on Livermore's expertise in aerosols, climate, chemistry, and  supercomputer simulations. The research has received funding from the Department of Energy, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and Laboratory Directed Research and Development. The work also contributes to fulfilling the goals of the federal government's National Aerosol Climate Interactions Program, an interagency effort created last year. Chuang explains that aerosol concentrations from natural sources, such as volcanoes, sea spray, and desert dust storms, are believed to have remained generally steady over the past century. However, like greenhouse gases, anthropogenic aerosols have increased markedly since 1950. Based on satellite data, models, and information on urban and agricultural activities, scientists  Greenhouse gases  2 Radiative change, watts per square meter Carbon dioxide  Aerosols  1 Hydrocarbon Nitrogen oxide 0 Tropospheric ozone Sulfate Halocarbons Stratospheric ozone  Fossil fuel Biomass burning burning (black (black carbon) carbon)  Mineral dust  Tropospheric aerosol indirect effect  Fossil fuel burning (organic carbon)  1  Biomass burning (organic carbon)  2  Global climate change by greenhouse gases and aerosols since 1750.

A vertical line between two data points indicates scientific uncertainty regarding the estimated contribution of a particular factor.  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory   S&TR April 2003  Aerosols and Climate Change  7  believe anthropogenic aerosols currently contribute about half of the total submicrometer-size aerosols in the atmosphere. Most of the anthropogenic aerosols are sulfates and carbonaceous compounds produced by the burning of fossil fuels and biomass. Solar Reflection Means Cooling When directly suspended in the atmosphere, most aerosol particles exert a direct cooling effect on the global climate by scattering sunlight back into space. Aerosols also exert a significant indirect effect by serving as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) for raindrops to form. Increases in CCN result in clouds with more but smaller droplets, thereby increasing the cloud's reflectivity of solar radiation, or albedo. Clouds with (a) Sulfate, maximum 15.87 g/m3 Latitude, degrees 60 30 0 30 60 180 120 60 0 60 120 180  numerous small droplets tend to last longer and so prolong the cooling effect. Complicating matters is the recently discovered influence of black carbon aerosols, such as soot (incompletely burned carbon), that absorb heat instead of reflecting it back into space. Black carbon aerosols are particularly prevalent over parts of Europe, eastern China, and India, where much coal is burned. Beginning in the early 1990s, Chuang focused first on modeling the direct effects of anthropogenic sulfate aerosols because they were thought to be the most important compound involved in pollution over China, Europe, and the eastern coast of the United States. She then added the contribution from carbonaceous compounds because of their sizable  emission from many industrialized regions of the Northern Hemisphere and tropical regions where agricultural burning is prevalent. The simulations also took into account the solar absorptive properties of black carbon, the first time this effect had been modeled. The simulations showed that biomass aerosols suspended in the clear sky cool the climate by between 0.16 and 0.23 watts per square meter, while black carbon from fossil fuels heats the climate by between 0.16 and 0.20 watts per square meter. Also, sulfate aerosols cool the atmosphere by between 0.53 to 0.81 watts per square meter. The sum of the cooling effects ranges between 0.35 and 0.65 watts per square meter. (To place these figures in perspective, about 340 watts per square meter of  (b) Organic matter, maximum 21.65 g/m3 (c) Black carbon, maximum 4.65 g/m3  180 120  60 0 60 120 Longitude, degrees  180  180 120  60  0  60  120  180  0  0.1 0.5  1  2  4  8  12  16  0  0.5  1  2  4  8  12  16  22  0 0.05 0.1 0.5  1  2  3  4  5  Concentration, micrograms per cubic meter (g/m3)  (d) Sea salt, maximum 16.79 g/m3 Latitude, degrees 60 30 0 30 60 180 120 60 0 60  (e) Dust, maximum 1,726 g/m3 Aerosols vary greatly from region to region.

Chuang's research then moved to the vastly more complex task of modeling the indirect effects of anthropogenic sulfate and carbonaceous aerosols through their interaction with clouds. These simulations indicated that the indirect effects of aerosols are greater than the direct effects. The simulations also showed that aerosols can mask the warming effects of greenhouse gases, at least in regions with high pollution levels. AerosolCloud Interactions The simulations estimated that aerosols acting as CCN cool Earth by about 1.85 watts per square meter, with  0.30 watts per square meter associated with anthropogenic sulfate, 1.16 watts per square meter associated with carbonaceous aerosols from biomass burning, and 0.52 watts per square meter associated with carbonaceous aerosols from fossil fuel combustion. While concentrations of anthropogenic carbonaceous aerosols are about equal in the Northern and Southern hemispheres, aerosols of anthropogenic sulfates are more prominent in the Northern Hemisphere. Also, the simulations showed that concentrations of aerosols vary with the seasons. The global average of indirect effects by anthropogenic aerosols is greatest in April through June, a period  when biomass of savanna and forested areas is burned in the topics. The indirect cooling effect is highest in May, with 2.4 watts per square meter. Chuang also addressed how black carbon absorption affects solar energy in clouds. She found that including this absorption does not decrease the overall cooling effect by more than 0.07 watts per square meter on a global scale, but that locally, it can decrease the cooling effect by as much as 0.7 watts per square meter in regions that have significant black carbon emissions. The model shows that if the effect of black carbon absorption in clouds is not included, the indirect cooling effect by carbonaceous aerosols may be overestimated by up to  (a) Carbonaceous aerosols from biomass burning 90 60 Latitude, degrees 30 0 30 60 90  (b) Carbonaceous aerosols from fossil fuels  (c) Anthropogenic sulfate aerosols 90 60 Latitude, degrees 30 0 30 60 90 180 120 60 0 60 120  (d) All anthropogenic aerosols  120 180 180 Longitude, degrees  60  0  60  120  180  Simulations show the direct (that is, without interactions with clouds) climate effects of (a) carbonaceous aerosols from biomass burning, (b) carbonaceous aerosols from fossil fuel burning, (c) anthropogenic sulfate aerosols, and (d) all anthropogenic sources.

The Livermore assessments were based on a three-dimensional general circulation model called Community Climate Model-1 (CCM-1), which was  developed by the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado. General circulation models predict global changes that result from changing concentration of gases by dividing the global atmosphere into  tens of thousands of boxes and using the equations describing motion, energy, and mass to predict the changes in climate.

""Both GRANTOUR and CCM-1 were developed more than a decade ago,"" notes Chuang. ""They lack advanced physics and modeling techniques that prevent us from exploring in greater detail the interrelationship between aerosols, clouds, and climate variation.  We believe this interrelationship is the leading source of uncertainty in predicting future climate change."" New Era of Modeling The research team's goal is to move to what Chuang describes as a ""new era of modeling"" that will link the most advanced atmospheric chemistry and climate codes. To that end, last year Chuang and her colleagues added improvements to Livermore's integrated,  massively parallel atmospheric chemical transport (IMPACT) code so that it better represents aerosol chemistry and runs faster on multiparallel supercomputers. IMPACT, which was previously applied by Livermore researchers to global ozone calculations, includes both the stratosphere and troposphere and uses databases of monthly averaged emissions compiled by scientists and government agencies worldwide to treat global chemistry processes.  Aerosols: A Short Primer Aerosols are concentrations of exceedingly minute particles suspended in the atmosphere. Aerosol particles range in size from 0.01 micrometer (millionth of a meter) to several tens of micrometers in diameter. Particles generated by pollution tend to be less than a millimeter in diameter. The particles enter the atmosphere from many different natural and anthropogenic (human activityrelated) sources. For example, nature generates sulfate aerosols from volcanoes, salt aerosols from sea spray, dust aerosols from desert areas, and carbonaceous aerosols formed from volatile organic compounds emitted by plants. A growing fraction of aerosols are byproducts of human activities, as seen in the ubiquitous hazes that persist in the industrialized regions of the world. Anthropogenic aerosols include sulfuric acid, soot and smoke from the burning of fossil fuels in factories, vehicles, power plants, cookstoves, and fireplaces. The burning of forests and grasslands to clear them for farming is another source of carbonaceous aerosols. (Although dust is typically considered a natural source of aerosols, human activities such as farming or erosion caused by changing land use also kick large amounts of dust into the atmosphere.) Aerosols have a significant effect on climate. Whereas greenhouse gases trap the Sun's heat, thereby warming Earth's atmosphere and surface, aerosols mainly reflect solar radiation, a phenomenon called the aerosol direct effect. By reducing the amount of solar energy reaching the Earth's surface, aerosols serve as agents of climate cooling. Aerosols also cool the climate indirectly, by changing the properties of clouds, which cool Earth by reflecting solar radiation back to space. (Of the daily average of about 340 watts per square meter of solar radiation that reaches the atmosphere, clouds reflect about 45 watts per square meter.) Although commonly thought of as pristine sources of water, clouds could not form without aerosol particles (natural or anthropogenic) acting as cloud condensation nuclei, which are sites on which water droplets can condense. Reflecting Sunlight, Modifying Rainfall Higher concentrations of aerosols in the atmosphere lead to the formation of clouds with water content spread over many more particles. Clouds with smaller, more numerous droplets have a larger surface area and therefore reflect up to 30 percent more sunlight, a phenomenon called aerosols' first indirect effect. What's more, the smaller water droplets in the cloud fall more slowly, thereby prolonging the lifespan of the cloud and strengthening its cooling effect. This second indirect effect is believed to be changing rainfall patterns in populated regions worldwide. Complicating the scientific understanding of aerosols' climatic effects are recent satellite observations revealing that aerosols of black carbon from biomass and fossil fuel burning can absorb sunlight in the atmosphere, thereby increasing the warming effect of greenhouse gases. Satellite observations have also revealed that the absorption of heat by soot can evaporate cloud droplets and thus reduce the presence of clouds. This phenomenon, called the aerosol semidirect effect, is particularly prevalent over heavily polluted areas. Taken together, all of the direct and indirect effects of aerosols are believed to increase Earth's albedo (percentage of sunlight reflected), thereby cooling the surface and offsetting the warming effects of greenhouse gases by 25 to 50 percent globally (and even much more in some areas). However, aerosols' climatic effects cannot be simply compared to those of greenhouse gases because they are distributed in time and space far differently. For example, greenhouse gases are well mixed in the atmosphere and have a lifetime of up to 100 years. In contrast, aerosols suspended in the troposphere (lower atmosphere) last only about a week before they are removed by winds and rain. (The exception is the injection of sulfates into the stratosphere, or upper atmosphere, where they can remain for a few years. The global cooling observed following large volcanic eruptions, such as  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory   S&TR April 2003  Aerosols and Climate Change  11  With the recent revisions, IMPACT can simulate the complicated reactions involving sulfate aerosols that are formed from sulfur dioxide generated by power plants and biomass burning. The code can also account for other sources of sulfates, including the production of dimethylsulfide by plankton, sulfur dioxide by volcanoes, and hydrogen sulfide by soils, forests, and crops. The new version of IMPACT also predicts the concentrations of black carbon and  other carbonaceous compounds, dust, and sea salt as well as their seasonal variations. To better represent the ever-changing size distribution of aerosol particles, Chuang is adapting an aerosol microphysics module developed at Brookhaven National Laboratory. The module simulates aerosol dynamics through complicated nucleation, growth, and transport processes by tracking the lower order moments of an aerosol size distribution in space and time.  Chuang plans to link IMPACT and the new microphysics module with the Community Climate Model-3, or CCM-3, the fourth-generation model developed by the National Center for Atmospheric Research. This climate model allows more realistic and higher resolution simulations of aerosol effects on regional climate. For example, it can show how aerosols are transported to different regions by strong winds and removed by rainfall.  Clouds could not form without aerosol particles (natural or anthropogenic) acting as cloud condensation nuclei or sites on which water droplets can condense. Anthropogenic emissions increase aerosol concentrations and result in clouds with smaller and more numerous droplets. These clouds have a larger albedo (percentage of reflected sunlight) and a longer lifetime, and thus they reflect more sunlight back into space.  that of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines in 1991, provides dramatic evidence for the climatic influence of aerosols.) Also, many anthropogenic aerosols are localized and occur near or downwind from their sources, such as power plants, factories, and large urban populations. As a result, most aerosols are found in the Northern Hemisphere, where most industrialized nations are located. Instrument Data, Models Aid Understanding To accurately study aerosol distribution and composition requires continuous observations from instruments located on satellites and aircraft as well as ground-based field stations. Data from these instruments, combined with numerical models that mimic the formation of aerosols and their interactions with clouds, have led to a much greater understanding of how and to what degree aerosols influence  climate. Lawrence Livermore scientists have been among the leaders in developing these models. Aerosol research marked a turning point in January 2002, when more than 50 leading American atmospheric scientists (including Livermore's Catherine Chuang), together with representatives from federal agencies, met to explore ways to achieve breakthroughs in understanding and modeling aerosols' role in climate change. The meeting led to the formation of a national Aerosol Climate Interactions Program supported by several federal agencies. The program's goals are to more accurately measure the sources, distribution, and properties of aerosols and their influence on climate; to more completely model the processes that govern aerosols' distributions and climatic effects; and to better quantify the relative importance of aerosols and greenhouse gases in global warming, including the effects on regional climates.

Such coarse resolution limits the code's usefulness because it does not adequately represent topographic features that strongly influence surface temperature and precipitation. Much finer resolutions are required to examine regional climate change and the transport of aerosols through the atmosphere. Chuang notes that a Livermore team headed by Philip Duffy has simulated the effects of increased  greenhouse gases by using CCM-3 at 50-kilometer resolution to obtain the finest resolution of global warming performed to date. (See S&TR, July/August 2002, pp. 412.) Putting Everything Together With all the modeling elements in place, Livermore atmospheric scientists will be able to simulate early next year the global and regional climate changes caused by both aerosols and major greenhouse gases. ""With more complete chemistry and physics in our models, we hope to have more accurate answers about how human activities are affecting our climate,"" Chuang says. Ultimately, she says, realistic climate models--augmented by other data-- provide the only viable approach for determining how aerosols are changing the planet's climate and for assessing the effects of future emissions. ""Models are the only tools for making predictions about climate change so that we can help policymakers arrive at the most informed decisions for responding to changes in the environment.""  She notes that at first glance, it might seem that aerosols are a positive element because they tend to counter the effects of global warming. However, purposely allowing a greater buildup of aerosols to offset global warming would lead to greater health and ecological damage. Aerosols that affect climate are associated with air pollution and acid rain, lower visibility, and decreased agricultural production. The results from the advanced Livermore simulations will surely help society as it decides to manage air pollution, global warming, changing rainfall patterns, and the unavoidable effects on human health and society. --Arnie Heller Key Words: aerosols, biomass, black carbon, cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), Community Climate Model (CCM), dimethylsulfide, global warming, GRANTOUR, IMPACT, National Center for Atmospheric Research, soot, sulfate.

A. Hattemer-Frey, Oak Ridge National Laboratory T. R. Karl and F. T. Quinlan, National Climatic Data Center This publication describes 34 prominent climatic indices and provides an annotated listing and bibliography of additional indices to help meet the information needs of researchers who are evaluating the effects of increased atmospheric CO2 levels. The goal was to discuss a wide range of indices that would be useful to scientists working directly in diverse areas of CO2-climate research and those individuals interested in climate research results for other applied studies. This publication is a source to consider first to determine what information is available and how knowledge of climatic indices may help investigators meet their research goals. To ensure that a broad spectrum of indices was considered, indices from the following ten subject areas are included: (1) Global/Hemispheres, (2) Marine Data Sets, (3) Long-Term Regional and Local Temperature and Precipitation Data Sets, (4) Atmospheric Constituents Data Sets, (5) Upper Air Data Sets, (6) Southern Oscillation/El Nio Data Sets, (7) Solar Data Sets, (8) Proxy Data Sets, (9) Lake Levels and River Flows Data Sets, and (10) Snow Cover and Sea Ice Extent Data Sets. Each description provides a brief but detailed summary of the index's relevance, importance, and derivation. Seventeen descriptor fields were used to describe each index, including primary references, relevant background information, calculation of the index, temporal resolution, spatial coverage, unit of measurement, period of record, reliability, relationship to other indices, application, and citation information.  TR051  A Comprehensive Precipitation Data Set for Global Land Areas (DOE/ER-69017T-H1, April 1991) http://cdiac.esd.ornl.gov/ndps/tr051.html J. K. Eischeid and H. F. Diaz, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration R. S. Bradley, University of Massachusetts P. D. Jones, University of East Anglia An expanded and updated compilation of long-term station precipitation data, together with a new set of gridded monthly mean fields for global land areas, are described. The present data set contains 5328 station records of monthly total precipitation, covering the period from the mid-1800s to the late 1980s. The station data were individually tested and visually inspected for the presence of spurious trends, jumps, and other measurement biases. The quality control procedure which was used to check the station records for nonclimatic discontinuities and other biases is detailed. We also discuss some of the problems which typically contribute to potential inhomogeneities in precipitation records. The station data were interpolated onto a 4 latitude by 5 longitude uniform grid. Comparisons of these data with two other global-scale precipitation climatologies are  4   Section A  DOE Sponsored Research Reports  presented. We find good agreement among the three global-scale climatologies over the common areas in each set. Three different indices of long-term precipitation variations over the global land areas all indicate a general increase of annual precipitation since the 1940s, although a decline is evident over the last decade. There is some indication that the last few decades of the 19th century may have been as wet as the recent ones. An interesting feature of this study is the presence of relatively large differences in seasonal trends, with MarchMay and September November becoming wetter in the last few decades. The DecemberFebruary and JuneAugust seasons exhibit smaller overall trends, although the northern winter season does exhibit large decadalscale fluctuations.  Climate Data Bases of the People's Republic of China 18411988 (DOE/NBB-0091T, January 1993) http://cdiac.esd.ornl.gov/ndps/tr055.html D. Kaiser, University of Tennessee and Oak Ridge National Laboratory S. Tao, C. Fu, Z. Zeng, and Q. Zhang, Chinese Academy of Sciences W.-C. Wang, State University of New York, Albany T. Karl, National Climatic Data Center A data base containing meteorological observations from the People's Republic of China (PRC) is described. These data were compiled in accordance with a joint research agreement signed by the U.S. Department of Energy and the PRC Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) on August 19, 1987. CAS's Institute of Atmospheric Physics (Beijing, PRC) has provided records from 296 stations, organized into five data sets: (1) a 60-station data set containing monthly measurements of barometric pressure, surface air temperature, precipitation amount, relative humidity, sunshine duration, cloud amount, wind direction and speed, and number of days with snow cover; (2) a 205-station data set containing monthly mean temperatures and monthly precipitation totals; (3) a 40-station subset of the 205-station data set containing monthly mean maximum and minimum temperatures and monthly extreme maximum and minimum temperatures; (4) a 180-station data set containing daily precipitation totals; and (5) a 470-station data set containing 10-day precipitation totals. Sixteen stations from these data sets (13 from the 60-station set and 3 from the 205-station set) have temperature and/or precipitation records that begin prior to 1900, whereas the remaining stations began observing in the early to mid-1900s. Records from most stations extend through 1988. These data can be used in defining regional climate changes, establishing relationships between regional and large-scale climates, studying the climatic impacts of urbanization and increased concentrations of greenhouse gases, and assembling large-scale climate data bases. Additional uses could include examining impacts of periodic events such as volcanic eruptions or the El Nio/Southern Oscillation. These data sets represent the most comprehensive, long-term instrumental Chinese climate data currently available.

An Introduction to the Literature (May 1988) http://cdiac.esd.ornl.gov/epubs/cdiac/cdiac24v1/cdiac24v1.htm C. A. S. Hall, State University of New York and University of Montana S. Brown, University of Illinois F. M. O'Hara Jr., Consultant, Oak Ridge National Laboratory P. B. Bogdonoff, D. Barshaw, E. Kaufman, and S. Underhill, Cornell University  CDIAC Reports ORNL/ CDIAC-24/V1  This bibliography is Part I of a two-part volume; the second part will be an ecological and landuse bibliography on South Asia by J. F. Richards. World literature on tropical rain forests, tropical deforestation, land-use change in the tropics, tropical forest conversion, and swidden agriculture as related to the global carbon cycle is covered in this bibliography. Historic papers and books are included, but comprehensive coverage was only sought for 1980 through 1987. This compendium of nearly 2000 entries forms the point of departure for a series of bibliographies on this topic. Other works in this series will be on the global carbon cycle and rain forests in specific geographic areas, whereas this volume includes references to literature about the global carbon cycle and rain forests anywhere in the world. The bibliography is ordered alphabetically by author and is indexed by subject and author. This bibliography is the third in a series of up-to-date, specialized, and evaluated bibliographies that have been produced by the cooperative efforts of DOE's Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center and carbon dioxide researchers.  Bibliography on Tropical Rain Forests and the Global Carbon Cycle. Vol. 2. South Asia (February 1989) http://cdiac.esd.ornl.gov/epubs/cdiac/cdiac24v2/cdiac24v2.htm E. P. Flint and J. F. Richards, Duke University Considerable debate has centered on the role of biotic carbon release and uptake in the global carbon cycle. Carbon release caused by deforestation may contribute significantly to increased global atmospheric CO2. The first bibliography in this series addressed worldwide tropical rain forests and the carbon cycle, emphasizing the most recent literature. The focus of this bibliography is South Asia, primarily India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh and including some references to Nepal, Bhutan, Sri Lanka, Burma, and other nations.  ORNL/ CDIAC-24/V2  This bibliography covers a range of ecological, botanical, forestry, agricultural, geological, and geographical sources for the period from 1889 to the present. References include land-use change as it affects all South Asia vegetation types, from tropical rain forests to high mountain systems to deserts. This broad scope was chosen because forests are believed to have covered most of South Asia within the past few millennia and because massive human impact is believed to be responsible for the prevalence of grassland, semidesert, and thorn forests in the regional landscape today. Major emphases include biomass and productivity of all natural and agricultural South Asian vegetation types, forest area and volume, deforestation and environmental degradation, official 9   CDIAC Reports  Section B  land-use statistics, descriptive and quantitative studies of vegetation and animals, forest history, and local and regional case studies of land-use. This bibliography is the fourth in a series of up-to-date, specialized, and evaluated bibliographies that have been produced by the cooperative effort of DOE's Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center and CO2 researchers.  ORNL/ CDIAC-28  Environmental Consequences of CO2-Climate Interactions: The Need for Integrated Resource Analysis (January 1989) http://cdiac.esd.ornl.gov/epubs/cdiac28/cdiac28.htm R. M. Cushman, J. C. Waterhouse, and M. P. Farrell, Oak Ridge National Laboratory The increasing concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide is expected to alter the global climate and thereby affect agriculture, forestry, fisheries, and water resources. Resources such as these interact on a regional scale, and realistic projections of the effects on these resources must take into account the important interactions and feedbacks linking them. In addition, carbon dioxide directly affects the water use and growth of vegetation; therefore, the interactive effects of carbon dioxide and climate must also be considered. These interactions and feedbacks pose a significant challenge to any attempt to model the response of resources to changing carbon dioxide and climate. In particular, model linkage and the integration of processes that operate on different spatial and temporal scales are problems that must be addressed.  ORNL/ CDIAC-32  A Plan for Intermodel Comparison of Atmospheric CO2 Projections with Uncertainty Analysis (June 1990) http://cdiac.esd.ornl.gov/epubs/cdiac32/cdiac32.htm A. W. King and M. J. Sale, Oak Ridge National Laboratory Projecting future concentrations of atmospheric CO2 is one of the principle objectives of the U.S. Department of Energy's Carbon Dioxide Research Program (CDRP). These projections are needed to assess the likelihood of significant global and regional change as a consequence of the continued use of fossil fuels and to determine whether alternative scenarios of future energy use can significantly alter this likelihood. The projection of future atmospheric CO2 concentration requires (1) estimates of the anthropogenic release of CO2 to the atmosphere from the combustion of fossil fuels and changes in land use and (2) global carbon cycle models describing the atmospheric retention of that CO2. However, all model projections of future CO2 concentrations involve some degree of uncertainty. Much of this uncertainty can be attributed to (1) uncertainties in future energy and land-use emissions, (2) uncertainties about the global carbon cycle reflected in the structural and conceptual differences between models, and (3) measurement error and uncertainty in the parameters and variables within a particular model. Fortunately, methods for quantifying model uncertainty exist so that projects can be made with confidence limits that reflect the associated uncertainties. This document is a plan for an intermodel comparison of atmospheric CO2 projections that includes uncertainty analysis of the global carbon cycle models used to make those 10   Section B  CDIAC Reports  projections. The plan includes a procedure for the documentation, support, and archiving of global carbon cycle models within CDIAC at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Uncertainty analysis is the examination of uncertainties in predictions from simulation models. The analysis identifies the dependence of model predictions on inputs, initial conditions, and parameters. Uncertainty analysis of global carbon cycle models can identify carbon cycle components and processes with the greatest sensitivities and uncertainties. This information can then be used to determine which uncertainties have the greatest influence on future atmospheric CO2 concentrations and where further research and data collection could be most effectively applied to reduce uncertainties. An intermodel comparison of atmospheric CO2 projections with uncertainty analysis can help define research that will improve model performance.  Environmental Atlas of the Iowa-Kansas-Missouri-Nebraska Climate-Change Study Region (March 1990) http://cdiac.esd.ornl.gov/epubs/cdiac33/cdiac33.htm L. J. Allison, C. T. Hunsaker, R. M. Cushman, T. W. White, and J. D. Draves Oak Ridge National Laboratory In 1988 DOE began an integrated research project to study the potential effect of changing climate on environmental resources. The area of study chosen was the four-state midwestern region of Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, and Nebraska. Baseline years are defined as 19841987 for agricultural crops and livestock and 1985 for water resources. Agriculture and water--resources that are sensitive to climate, interactive, and important to the study region and to the United States--were chosen for study. Essential to an integrated regional study is a comprehensive data base of environmental resources in the region, both to characterize the regional resources as they exist today and to serve as input for modeling the response of the resources to climate change. This atlas contains 45 maps and corresponding tabulated data showing the baseline agricultural and water resource data for the Iowa-Kansas-Missouri-Nebraska study region along with basic geographic reference data. This atlas may serve as input for modeling the response of resources to climate change and provides DOE project investigators with critical baseline agricultural and water resource data for the Iowa-Kansas-Missouri-Nebraska study region.

ORNL/ CDIAC-34 (WDC-A)  11   CDIAC Reports ORNL/ CDIAC-38  Section B  Documentation and Analysis of a Global CO2 Model Developed by Peng et al. (July 1990) http://cdiac.esd.ornl.gov/epubs/cdiac38/cdiac38.htm H. I. Jager, T.-H. Peng, A. W. King, and M. J. Sale, Oak Ridge National Laboratory In 1983, Peng et al. developed a modification of the Oeschger et al. 1975 ocean model. Both the original and the modification are one-dimensional representations of the ocean, including (1) CO2 exchange between a well mixed atmosphere and a well mixed ocean surface layer and (2) diffusive mixing into the waters lying below the mixed layer. Peng et al. also added a representation of deep-water cycling from intermediate depths to the surface polar outcrop to the ocean bottom and then back to the surface. In addition, they incorporated oceanic primary productivity into the model and benchmarked the model against the penetration of bomb-produced tritium measured by the Geochemical Ocean Sections Study (GEOSECS) program. This report documents that modified model and describes how the model was standardized to allow comparison with other models. Before being subjected to sensitivity analysis, the standardized version of the model was supplemented with a calibration routine to define reasonable combinations of initial conditions. This routine improved the model's ability to hold an initial equilibrium state. The subsequent sensitivity analysis showed that the model was sensitive to different parameters at different points in its run time. For short runs, the initial conditions selected were of greatest importance; the significance of the initial conditions declined in longer simulations. With the pCO2 excluded from the sensitivity analysis, ocean surface area was always second in importance. Next, the CO2 exchange rate was most important in short runs, but the alkalinity of the oceans was in all but the shortest runs.  ORNL/ CDIAC-39 (WDC-A)  Glossary: Carbon Dioxide and Climate (August 1990) http://cdiac.esd.ornl.gov/pns/glossary.html Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center and World Data Center-A for Atmospheric Trace Gases, Oak Ridge National Laboratory The impact of increased concentrations of CO2 and other trace gases in the atmosphere is of concern in both scientific and nontechnical fields. This glossary contains definitions of selected CO2-related terms and has been compiled to help fill the gaps in information related to climate-change terminology. Terms in the glossary are defined with an emphasis on their relationship to CO2 and climate. Many of the definitions are then followed by a more comprehensive discussion of the terms and their use. References to the literature from which the definitions were taken are listed at the end of the glossary. In addition to terminology associated with the CO2-climate issue, a variety of other types of nomenclature is required to fully understand crucial relations between emissions, atmospheric conditions, and changing climate. The Glossary also contains seven tables of International System of Units Prefixes, common conversion factors, useful quantities found in CO2 research, geological time scales, and abbreviations and acronyms commonly used in atmospheric research.  12   Section B  CDIAC Reports  This is the third edition of Glossary: Carbon Dioxide and Climate. This new edition contains more than a hundred new terms, redefinitions of many of the original terms, and an expansion of a section of tables.  Climate Change and Water Supply, Management and Use: Literature Review (May 1992) http://cdiac.esd.ornl.gov/epubs/cdiac52/cdiac52.htm L. H. Chang, J. D. Draves, and C. T. Hunsaker, Oak Ridge National Laboratory There is evidence that concentrations of atmospheric CO2, tropospheric O3, and CH4, among other gases that contribute to the greenhouse effect, have increased in recent decades and that these changes may induce changes in global air temperatures and regional climate features in coming years. A literature review was conducted to sample the literature base on which our understanding of the water resource impacts of climate change rests. Water resource issues likely to be important include hydrologic response to climate change, the resilience of water supply systems to changing climatic and hydrologic conditions, and the effects of climate change on water quality and water uses (such as navigation and energy generation). A computer-assisted search of literature on the effects of climate change on these subjects was conducted. All studies were classified by type of paper (e.g., review, discussion, or case study), region, water resource variable studies, and source of climate scenario. The resulting bibliography containing more than 200 references was largely annotated. Case studies of potential hydrologic impacts have been more common than studies of impacts on water management or water use, but this apparent gap is closing. Case studies demonstrating methods of incorporating potential risks of climate change into water project planning and management have been performed. Considerable variability in regional coverage exists; the Great Lakes basin and California receive relatively more attention than such regions as New England and the Missouri River basin. General circulation mode-based and hypothetical climate scenarios have been the dominant sources of climate scenarios used in case studies, although a variety of other methods for developing climate scenarios have been developed.  ORNL/ CDIAC-52  Adapting to Sea-Level Rise in the U.S. Southeast: The Influence of Built Infrastructure and Biophysical Factors on the Inundation of Coastal Areas (November 1992) http://cdiac.esd.ornl.gov/epubs/cdiac54/cdiac54.htm R. C. Daniels, The University of Tennessee and Oak Ridge National Laboratory V. M. Gornitz, Goddard Institute for Space Studies A. J. Mehta, and S.-C. Lee, University of Florida R. M. Cushman, Oak Ridge National Laboratory The Earth's mean surface air temperature has increased by 0.5 C over the past 100 years. This warming trend has occurred concurrently with increases in the concentration and number of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere (e.g., CO2, N2O, H2O, CH4, and CFCs). These gases may be partially responsible for this temperature increase and may cause this trend to accelerate in the future because of the increased amount of thermal radiation that will be trapped in the troposphere  ORNL/ CDIAC-54  13   CDIAC Reports  Section B  by these gases. This trapping effect may result in a net increase in the earth's global mean surface air temperature of 1.5 to 4.5 C by the year 2100. An increase in the mean surface air temperature of this magnitude could cause significant increase. This increase in sea surface temperature will cause sea levels to rise--from thermal expansion of the sea and the addition of melt waters from alpine glaciers and continental ice sheets. To allow for the cost-effective analysis of the impacts that sea-level rise may have on the U.S. Southeast, a method is needed that will allow sites potentially at risk to be identified for study. Previously, no objective method was available to identify such sites. This project addresses the problem of potential coastal damage by using a geographic data base that has information on both physical and climatological factors to identify areas of the U.S. Southeast at risk to inundation or accelerated erosion as a result of sea-level rise. The following six areas were selected for further study from the many identified as being at high risk: Galveston, Texas; Caminada Pass, Louisiana; Bradenton Beach, Florida; Daytona Beach, Florida; McClellanville, South Carolina; and Nags Head, North Carolina. These six areas are representative of three of the major stages of economic development on the East and Gulf coasts (i.e., urban/residential, undeveloped/rural, and resort/recreational), consequently any conclusion drawn from these case studies may be generalized to other high risk regions with similar geologic and economic histories. For each study area the amount of land, by land-use type, in danger from inundation was calculated for three sea-level-rise scenarios. The calculated values were based on elevation alone. These studies were then extended by considering the effects that built infrastructure (e.g., seawalls) and biophysical factors (e.g., erosion/accretion rates) would have on the actual amount of land that would be inundated if the sea were allowed to advance unchecked. By considering these factors, a best-guess estimation of the amount of land that may be lost to the sea was derived for each study area and each scenario. These estimated values consider both natural (e.g., elevation and erosion/accretion) and anthropogenic (e.g., built infrastructure) effects when predicting the future location of the coastline in the years 2050 and 2100 for each study area, for each scenario.

Boden and D. P. Kaiser, Oak Ridge National Laboratory R. J. Sepanski and F. W. Stoss, The University of Tennessee, Energy, Environment, and Resources Center This document provides synopses of frequently used global-change data. This third issue of the Trends series presents historical and modern records of atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), two chlorofluorocarbons (CFC-11 and CFC-12), a hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC-22), and two halons (H-1301 and H-1211) from an expanded number of globally distributed sites. Virtually all of the modern records extend into the 1990s, some into 1994. Additional trace gas data presented in Trends '93 include historical atmospheric CO2, CH4, and N2O records derived from ice cores. Trends '93 also includes revised and updated estimates through 1991 for global, regional, and national CO2 emissions produced from the burning of fossil fuels, gas flaring, and the production of cement. Updated global emissions estimates through 1992 are presented for CFC-11 and CFC-12. Trends '93 also updates and expands the presentation of long-term temperature records, whose spatial coverage ranges from an individual Antarctic ice core site to the entire globe and from the Earth's surface to the lower stratosphere. New subject matter appearing in Trends '93 includes a chapter for long-term regional precipitation records, several time-series records for atmospheric aerosols, and isotopic 14 C measurements for atmospheric CO2 from several globally distributed sites. Data records are presented in multipage formats, each dealing with a specific site, region, or emissions species. The data records include tables; graphs; discussions of methods for collecting, measuring, and reporting the data; trends in the data; and references to literature providing further information. Instructions for citing contributions by the principal investigator(s) are provided for each data summary.  15   CDIAC Reports (WDC-A)  Section B  Trends Online: A Compendium of Data on Global Change http://cdiac.esd.ornl.gov/trends/trends.htm Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center and World Data CenterA for Atmospheric Trace Gases, Oak Ridge National Laboratory The Trends series continues to be produced as an online document accessible from CDIAC's Web site.

ORNL/ CDIAC-69  Report of the International Workshop on Quality Control of Monthly Climate Data (October 1993) http://cdiac.esd.ornl.gov/epubs/cdiac69/cdiac69.htm National Climatic Data Center Monthly climate data must rely on quality control techniques that are predominantly statistical. While the actual quality control may use numerical formulae or visual inspections of graphs, at the heart of most techniques are some basic statistical relationships. These relationships primarily fall into three categories: (1) relationships of data elements to themselves (e.g., outliers from long-term means), (2) relationships to nearby data (e.g., neighbor checks), and (3) relationships to some other data parameter (e.g., sea level pressure to station pressure). The purpose of this workshop was to discuss these data relationships and other quality control techniques, to relate experiences in applying quality control to data, and to organize cooperation in the production of quality control software.  16   Section B Direct Effects of Atmospheric CO2 Enrichment on Plants and Ecosystems: An Updated Bibliographic Data Base (June 1994) http://cdiac.esd.ornl.gov/ndps/cdiac70.htm B.

Dickson, Scripps Institution of Oceanography C. Goyet, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution The collection of extensive, reliable, oceanic carbon data is a key component of the U.S. Joint Global Ocean Flux Study (JGOFS). A portion of the JGOFS oceanic carbon dioxide measurements will be made during the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) Hydrographic Program with funding from the U.S. Department of Energy Special Research Grant Program 89-7A: Global survey of carbon dioxide in the oceans. A science team has been formed from the investigators supported by DOE to plan and coordinate the various activities needed to produce high quality oceanic carbon dioxide measurements under this program. This handbook was prepared at the request of, and with the active participation of, that science team. The procedures detailed in this handbook have been agreed on by the members of the science team and describe well-tested methods. The methods, together with an appropriate quality control plan, are intended to provide standard operating procedures (SOPs) for measurements made as part of this survey. These SOPs are not the only techniques in use for measuring the parameters of the oceanic carbon system; however, they do represent the current state-of-the-art methodology for shipboard measurements.

Program Developed for CO2 System Calculations (February 1998) http://cdiac.esd.ornl.gov/oceans/co2rprt.html E. Lewis and D. Wallace Brookhaven National Laboratory  ORNL/ CDIAC-105  Investigators interested in studying the ocean carbonate system are not in complete agreement on how to calculate inorganic carbon speciation in seawater. Over the years there have been many determinations and reviews of the constants used to describe the dissociation of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the ocean, but no universally accepted set of constants exists. Several subtly different pH scales remain in common use, as do variations in the definition of total alkalinity and arguments over the relative merits of reporting the partial pressure vs the fugacity of CO2 . As ocean CO2 measurements become steadily more accurate and investigators seek to evaluate very small changes in concentrations, these issues grow in importance. It is hoped that the recently released a computer program will be of general use and perhaps help to clear up some of the confusion. Given any two of the four measurable carbonate system parameters, this program calculates the other two, together with the inorganic carbon speciation and the saturation of calcite and aragonite. The program also allows the user to select from four different pH scales and several sets of dissociation constants widely cited in the literature.  19   Section C  CDIAC Numeric Data and Computer Model Distribution  21   Section C  CDIAC NDPs and CMP NDP-001 (WDC-A)  Atmospheric CO2 Concentrations--Mauna Loa Observatory, Hawaii, 19581997 (revised August 1998) http://cdiac.esd.ornl.gov/ndps/ndp001.html or http://cdiac.esd.ornl.gov/trends/co2/sio-mlo.htm C. D. Keeling and T. P. Whorf (contributors) Since 1958, air samples have been continuously collected at Mauna Loa Observatory and analyzed by infrared spectroscopy for CO2 concentrations. Data are averaged to give monthly and annual atmospheric CO2 concentrations. These data represent the longest continuous record of atmospheric CO2 concentrations in the world. This precise data record covers a single site (Mauna Loa Observatory, Hawaii). It is a reliable indicator of the regional trend in the concentration of atmospheric CO2 in the middle layers of the troposphere and is critical to CO2-related research.

Blasing and D. N. Duvick (contributors) Tree core samples (4 mm in diameter) were extracted from the trunks of white oak (Quercus alba) at three sites in central Iowa (Duvick Back Woods, Ledges State Park, and Pammel). At least 60 trees were sampled at each site, and at least two cores were taken from each tree. The growth rings of each core were dated by calendar year and measured; the measurements were then transformed into dimensionless ring-width indices and correlated with annual precipitation. Data were collected for the years 1680 through 1979. Each tree ring was characterized by the site, year, tree-ring-width index, number of core samples, decade year, and the annual reconstructed precipitation estimate. These data have more than 50% of their variance in common with the known annual statewide average precipitation for Iowa and serve as useful indicators of the precipitation and drought history of the region for the past 300 years. The data are in two files: tree-ring-chronology data (8 kB) and the annual reconstructed precipitation data for central Iowa (2 kB).

G. Brewer, T. Takahashi, and R. T. Williams (contributors) The 1981 TTO North Atlantic experiment cruise consisted of seven legs and visited 250 hydrographic stations across the North Atlantic Ocean in 200 days. About 9000 water samples were taken for analysis of salinity, oxygen, and nutrients. More than 3000 samples were collected for tritium analysis, and more than 1000 samples for radiocarbon analysis. Samples were characterized hydrographically (e.g., sample depth, ocean depth, and water temperature) and chemically (e.g., alkalinity, salinity, silicate concentrations, and nitrate concentrations). They may be used for ocean-mixing studies, for testing models of ocean CO2 uptake, and for determining the 23  NDP-004 (WDC-A)   CDIAC NDPs and CMP  Section C  exchange of carbon dioxide between the atmosphere and the ocean.

J. Conway and P. Tans (contributors) The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Climate Monitoring and Diagnostics Laboratory (NOAA/CMDL) has measured CO2 in air samples collected weekly at a global network of sites since the late 1970s and from two stations since the late 1960s. Determinations of atmospheric CO2 mixing ratios on the air samples collected in glass flasks are accomplished by nondispersive infrared gas analysis. All CMDL flask samples are measured relative to standards traceable to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) Central CO2 Laboratory operated by C. D. Keeling at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. These measurements constitute the most geographically extensive, carefully calibrated, internally consistent atmospheric CO2 data set available and are essential for studies aimed at better understanding the global carbon cycle budget. This data report documents monthly atmospheric CO2 mixing ratios and CO2 measurements obtained by analyzing individual flask air samples from the NOAA/CMDL global cooperative flask sampling network. Records from 40 land-based sites and from shipboard measurements covering 14 latitude bands in the Pacific Ocean and South China Sea are provided. The earliest NOAA/CMDL flask CO2 records date back to 1967. Records through 1993 are provided for all operating sites. Approximately 60,000 individual flask CO2 measurements are provided including those not considered indicative of regional, background, tropospheric conditions. Each measurement is flagged according to the degree the CO2 determination satisfies the NOAA/CMDL data selection criteria.

Marland (contributors) Global carbon dioxide emissions for 1950 through 1982 were estimated by Marland and Rotty (1984) from fuel production data from the UN Energy Statistics Yearbook (1983, 1984). Data before 1950 came from Keeling (1973). Fuel-production data were used in these calculations because they appeared to be more reliable on a global basis than fuel-consumption data. The data given are the year and annual global CO2 emissions (annual global total; cumulative global total since 1860; and annual global emissions from solid fuels, liquid fuels, natural gas, gas flaring, and cement manufacturing). These data provide the only pre-1950 estimates of the amount of carbon emitted to the atmosphere from fossil-fuel burning. The CO2 emission record since 1950 has been updated and revised several times with the most recent estimates being published by Marland et al. (1989).

J. Beardsmore and G. I. Pearman (contributors) From 1972 through 1981, air samples were collected in glass flasks from aircraft at a variety of latitudes and altitudes over Australia, New Zealand, and Antarctica. The samples were analyzed for CO2 concentrations with nondispersive infrared gas analysis. The resulting data contain the sampling dates, type of aircraft, flight number, flask identification number, sampling time, geographic sector, distance in kilometers from the listed distance measuring equipment (DME) station, station number of the radio navigation distance measuring equipment, altitude of the aircraft above mean sea level, sample analysis date, flask pressure, tertiary standards used for the analysis, analyzer used, and CO2 concentration. These data represent the first published record of CO2 concentrations in the Southern Hemisphere expressed in the WMO 1981 CO2 Calibration Scale and provide a precise record of atmospheric CO2 concentrations in the troposphere and lower stratosphere over Australia and New Zealand.

Angell (contributor) Surface temperatures and thickness-derived temperatures from a global network of 63 radiosonde stations have been used to estimate annual and seasonal temperature anomalies over the globe and several zonal regions from 1958 through 1996. These estimates are calculated relative to a 1958-1977 reference period mean, and pertain to the surface and the following atmospheric layers: troposphere (850-300 mb), tropopause (300-100 mb), low stratosphere (100-50 and 100-30 mb), and from the surface up to 100 mb. Individual data sets containing the above measurements are provided for the globe, the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, and the following latitudinal zones: North (60-90 N) and South (60-90 S) Polar; North (30-60 N) and South (30-60 S) Temperate; North (10-30 N) and South (10-30 S) Subtropical; Tropical (30 N-30 S); and Equatorial (10 N-10 S). Most of the values are column-mean temperatures obtained from the differences in height between constant-pressure surfaces at individual radiosonde stations. The pressure-height data before 1980 were obtained from published values in Monthly Climatic Data for the World. These temperature anomalies may be used to analyze long-term temperature trends for a layer of the atmosphere (i.e., surface, troposphere, tropopause, and low stratosphere), a region (i.e., polar, temperate, subtropical, and equatorial), a hemisphere, or the globe. The data are in 11 files totaling 98 kB.  NDP-008  25   CDIAC NDPs and CMP NDP-009  Section C  Growth and Chemical Responses to CO2 Enrichment--Virginia Pine (Pinus Virginiana Mill.)

Rogers (contributors) From June 28 to October 29 in 1982, Virginia pine seedlings were exposed to elevated CO2 levels in open-top growth chambers at one of four concentrations (75, 150, 300, and 600 ppm above ambient). Plant dry weight; height; stem diameter; and chemical contents of leaf, stem, and root tissues were measured before and after exposure. Soil variables were also characterized. These data illustrate the short-term physical and chemical response of Virginia pine seedlings to elevated levels of CO2. The data are in seven files: initial dry weights before exposure (844 kB), dry weights after exposure (4 kB), major nutrient concentrations after final harvest (12 kB), minor nutrient concentrations after final harvest (17 kB), soil nutrient concentrations after final harvest (4 kB), soil leachate elements after final harvest (5 kB), and soil leachate solutes after final harvest (4 kB).

Webb, III (contributor) To determine regional and global climatic variations during the past 6000 years, pollen, lake level, and marine plankton data from 797 stations were compiled to form a global data set. Radiocarbon dating and dated tephras were used to determine the ages of the specimens. The data available for the pollen data are site number, site name, latitude, longitude, elevation, and percentages of various taxa. For lake-level data, the data are site number, site name, latitude, longitude, and lake-level status. And for marine plankton, the data are site number, site name, latitude, longitude, water depth, date, dating control code, depth of sample, interpolated age of sample, estimated winter and summer sea-surface temperatures, and percentages of various taxa. The data are in 55 files: 5 files for each of 9 geographic regions and 10 supplemental files. The files for each region include (1) a FORMAT file describing the format and contents of the data for that region, (2) an INDEX file containing descriptive information about each site and its data, (3) a DATA file containing the data and available climatic estimates, (4) a PUBINDEX file indexing the bibliographic references associated with each site, and (5) a REFERENCE file containing the bibliographic references.

Lamb (contributor) Lamb's Dust Veil Index (DVI) is a numerical index that quantifies the impact of a particular volcanic eruption's release of dust and aerosols over the years following the event, especially 26   Section C  CDIAC NDPs and CMP  the impact on the Earth's energy balance. DVIs have been calculated for eruptions occurring from 1500 through 1983. The methods used to calculate the DVI have been intercalibrated to give a DVI of 1000 for the eruption of Krakatoa in 1883. The DVI for any volcanic eruption is based on a review of the observational, empirical, and theoretical studies of the possible impact on climate of volcanic dust veils. The DVI allows one to compare volcanic eruptions by a single numerical index. The data base includes the name of the erupting volcano, year of eruption, volcano latitude and longitude, maximum extent of the dust veil, veil duration, DVI for the entire globe, DVI for the Northern Hemisphere, and DVI for the Southern Hemisphere. The data are in one file (22.6 kB).  Solar Records: The Wolf Sunspot Index and Umbral/Penumbral Ratio (August 1985) http://cdiac.esd.ornl.gov/ndps/ndp014.html D. V. Hoyt (contributor) These data from observations of sunspot activity cover the period 1875 through 1981; reconstructions are possible back to 1832. Available sunspot models and the theory of mixing length indicate that the observed changes in the umbral/penumbral (U/P) ratio may be equivalent to changes in the solar constant. The U/P ratio is calculated from measurements of solar activity and has been shown to be in good agreement with the Northern Hemisphere temperature record. The data consist of year, number of sunspot groups, Wolf sunspot number, umbra area, whole area, penumbral area, and umbral/penumbral ratio. The data are in one file (3.3 kB).  NDP-014  Major World Ecosystem Complexes Ranked by Carbon in Live Vegetation: A Database (September 1985) http://cdiac.esd.ornl.gov/ndps/ndp017.html J. S. Olson, J. A. Watts, and L. J. Allison (contributors) In 1980, this data base and the corresponding map were completed after more than 20 years of field investigations, consultations, and analyses of published literature. They characterize the use and vegetative cover of the Earth's land surface with a 0.5  0.5 grid. The data include latitude, longitude, and vegetation code. This world-ecosystem-complex data set and the accompanying map provide a current reference base for interpreting the role of vegetation in the global cycling of CO2 and other gases and a basis for improved estimates of vegetation and soil carbon, of natural exchanges of CO2, and of net historic shifts of carbon between the biosphere and the atmosphere. The data are in one file of 109 kB.  NDP-017 (WDC-A)  Worldwide Organic Soil Carbon and Nitrogen Data (September 1986) http://cdiac.esd.ornl.gov/ndps/ndp018.html P. J. Zinke, A. G. Stangenberger, W. M. Post, W. R. Emanuel, and J. S. Olson (contributors) This data base was begun with the collection and analysis of soil samples from California. Additional data came from soil surveys of Italy, Greece, Iran, Thailand, Vietnam, various tropical 27  NDP-018 (WDC-A)   CDIAC NDPs and CMP  Section C  Amazonian areas, and U.S. forests and from the soil-survey literature. The analyzed samples were collected at uniform soil-depth increments and included bulk-density determinations. The data on each sample are soil profile number; soil profile carbon content; soil profile nitrogen content; sampling site latitude and longitude; site elevation; profile literature reference source; and soil profile codes for Holdridge life zone, Olson ecosystem type, and parent material. These data may be used to estimate the size of the soil organic carbon and nitrogen pools at equilibrium with natural soil-forming factors. The data are in one file of 323 kB.  NDP-019  United States Historical Climatology Network (U.S. HCN) Monthly Temperature and Precipitation Data (revised January 1996) http://cdiac.esd.ornl.gov/epubs/ndp019/ndp019.html D. R. Easterling, T. R. Karl, E. H. Mason, P. Y. Hughes, and D. P. Bowman (contributors) Extending through 1994, this data base contains monthly total precipitation and temperature data from 1219 stations in the contiguous U.S. To be included in the Historical Climatology Network (HCN), a station had to be currently active (1994), have at least 80 years of monthly temperature and precipitation data, and have experienced few station changes. These data were derived from a variety of sources including the National Climatic Data Center archives, state climatologists, and published literature. The database contains several hundred variables, including state number; station number; monthly temperatures (minimum, maximum, and mean); total monthly precipitation; and time of observation. This is probably the best monthly temperature and precipitation data set available for the contiguous U.S. because station moves, instrument changes, urbanization effects, and time-of-observation differences have been considered and, where necessary, the data have been corrected. The data are in 13 files (one station inventory file, one station history file, six temperature files, one precipitation file, one time-of-observation correction file, and two quality-assessment files). The file sizes range from 5 kB to approximately 50 MB and are available on 9-track magnetic tape only.  NDP-020  An Updated Global Grid Point Surface Air Temperature Anomaly Data Set: 18511990 (revised October 1991) http://cdiac.esd.ornl.gov/ndps/ndp020.html P. D. Jones, S. C. B. Raper, B. S. G. Cherry, C. M. Goodess, T. M. L. Wigley, B. Santer, P. M. Kelly, R. S. Bradley, and H. F. Diaz (contributors) This NDP presents land-based monthly surface-air-temperature anomalies (departures from a 19511970 reference period mean) on a 5 latitude by 10 longitude global grid. Monthly surface-air-temperature anomalies (departures from a 19571975 reference period mean) for the Antarctic (grid points from 65 S to 85 S) are presented in a similar way as a separate data set. The data were derived primarily from the World Weather Records and from the archives of the United Kingdom Meteorological Office. This long-term record of temperature anomalies may be used in studies addressing possible greenhouse-gas-induced climate changes. To date, the data have been employed in producing regional, hemispheric, and global time series for determining whether recent (i.e., post-1900) warming trends have taken place.  28   Section C  CDIAC NDPs and CMP  The present updated version of this data set is identical to the earlier version for all records from 18511978 except for the addition of the Antarctic surface-air-temperature anomalies beginning in 1957. Beginning with the 1979 data, this package differs from the earlier version in several ways. Erroneous data for some sites have been corrected after a review of the actual station temperature data, and inconsistencies in the representation of missing values have been removed. For some grid locations, data have been added from stations that had not contributed to the original set. Data from satellites have also been used to correct station records where large discrepancies were evident. The present package also extends the record by adding monthly surface-air-temperature anomalies for the Northern (grid points from 85 N to 0) and Southern (grid points from 5 S to 60 S) Hemispheres for 19851990. In addition, this updated package presents the monthly-mean-temperature records for the individual stations that were used to produce the set of gridded anomalies. The periods of record vary by station. Northern Hemisphere data have been corrected for inhomogeneities, while Southern Hemisphere data are presented in uncorrected form. The data consist of 14 files, including five ASCII data files, eight FORTRAN 77 and SAS retrieval routines, and a descriptive file. The data files range in size from 2 kB to 20 MB. Because of the size of the data files, it is not feasible to distribute these data on floppy diskettes, even as compressed files.  Historical Sunshine and Cloud Data in the United States (revised 1991) http://cdiac.esd.ornl.gov/ndps/ndp021.html P. M. Steurer and T. R. Karl (contributors) This data base presents monthly sunshine data from 240 U.S. stations (including Puerto Rico and nine Pacific Islands) and monthly cloud amount data from 197 U.S. stations. The longest periods of record are 1891 through 1987 for the sunshine data and 1871 through 1987 for the cloud data. The sunshine data were derived from measurements taken by a variety of sunshine-recording instruments. The cloud data were derived from land-based estimates of fractional cloud amount, which were made with observation practices that have varied during the period of record. Station number, station name, latitude, and longitude are given for all stations in each network. The sunshine data include monthly and annual total hours of recorded sunshine, monthly and annual maximum possible hours of sunshine, monthly and annual percentages of possible sunshine (hours recorded/hours possible), and dates of use for specific types of sunshine recorders at each station. The cloud data contain monthly and annual cloud amount (in percent of sky cover). The sunshine data are in four files: one station inventory (34.1 kB), one monthly and annual hours of measured sunshine (1.6 MB), one monthly and annual maximum possible hours of sunshine (21.5 kB), and one monthly and annual percentage of possible sunshine (2.1 MB). The cloud data are in two files: one station inventory (20.4 kB) and one monthly and annual cloud amount (2.4 MB). The data are available on 9-track magnetic tape only.  NDP-021  29   CDIAC NDPs and CMP NDP-022  Section C  Global and Hemispheric Annual Temperature Variations Between 1861 and 1991 (revised August 1994) http://cdiac.esd.ornl.gov/ndps/ndp022.html P. D. Jones, T. M. L. Wigley, and P. B. Wright (contributors) This data set contains estimates of global and hemispheric annual temperature variations, relative to a 1950 through 1979 reference period, for 1861 through 1991. The estimates are based on corrected land and ocean data. Land data were derived from meteorological data and fixed- position weather-ship data that were corrected for nonclimatic errors, such as station shifts and/or instrument changes. The marine data used were those in the Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set (COADS) compilation, which with updates covers to 1986. Updates to 1991 were made with hemispheric sea-surface temperature estimates produced by the U.K. Meteorological Office. Each record includes year and six annual temperature variations: one estimate each for the globe, the Northern Hemisphere, and the Southern Hemisphere and another estimate each that reflects an adjustment to account for the influence of El Nio/Southern Oscillation events. The data are in one file of 13 kB. PLEASE NOTE. Updates to these global and hemispheric temperature anomaly series produced by Jones et al. are now available through CDIAC's Trends Online. For the time being, NDP-022 contains data only through 1991, so users are encouraged to access the data through Trends Online, since the data extend through 1997. In the future, NDP-022 will be updated to catch up with the records as presented in Trends Online.  NDP-023 (WDC-A)  Annual and Seasonal Global Variation in Total Ozone and LayerMean Ozone, 19581987 (January 1991) http://cdiac.esd.ornl.gov/ndps/ndp023.html J. K. Angell, J. Korshover, and W. G. Planet (contributors) For 1958 through 1987, this data base presents total ozone variations and layer mean ozone variations expressed as percent deviations from the 1958 to 1977 mean. The total ozone variations were derived from mean monthly ozone values published in Ozone Data for the World by the Atmospheric Environment Service in cooperation with the World Meteorological Organization. The layer mean ozone variations are derived from ozonesonde and Umkehr observations. The data records include year, seasonal and annual total ozone variations, and seasonal and annual layer mean ozone variations. The total ozone data are for four regions (Soviet Union, Europe, North America, and Asia); five climatic zones (north and south polar, north and south temperate, and tropical); both hemispheres; and the world. Layer mean ozone data are for four climatic zones (north and south temperate and north and south polar) and for the stratosphere, troposphere, and tropopause layers. The data are in two files [seasonal and year-average total ozone (13.4 kB) and layer mean ozone variations (24.2 kB)].  30   Section C  CDIAC NDPs and CMP NDP-025  Monthly Mean Pressure Reconstructions for Europe (17801980) and North America (18581980) (June 1987) http://cdiac.esd.ornl.gov/ndps/ndp025.html P. D. Jones, T. M. L. Wigley, and K. R. Briffa (contributors) Real and reconstructed measurements of monthly mean pressure data have been constructed for Europe for 1780 through 1980 and North America for 1858 through 1980. The reconstructions use early pressure, temperature, and precipitation data from a variety of sources including World Weather Records, meteorological and national archives, circulation maps, and daily chart series. Each record contains the year, monthly mean pressure, quality code, and annual mean pressure. These reconstructed gridded monthly pressures provide a reliable historical record of mean sea-level pressures for Europe and North America. The data are in two files: pressure reconstructions for Europe (1.47 MB) and for North America (0.72 MB).  Climatological Data for Clouds Over the Globe from Surface Observations (February 1988) http://cdiac.esd.ornl.gov/ndps/ndp026.html C. J. Hahn, S. G. Warren, J. London, R. L. Jenne, and R. M. Chervin (contributors) With some data from as early as 1930, global long-term monthly and/or seasonal total cloud cover, cloud type amounts and frequencies of occurrence, low cloud base heights, harmonic analyses of annual and diurnal cycles, interannual variations and trends, and cloud type co-occurrences have been compiled and presented in two atlases (Warren et al. 1988, 1990). These data were derived from land and ship synoptic weather reports from the ""SPOT"" archive of the Fleet Numerical Oceanography Center (FNOC) and from Release 1 of the Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set (COADS) for the years 19301979. The data are in 12 files (one containing latitude, longitude, land-fraction, and number of land stations for grid boxes; four containing total cloud, cloud types, harmonic analyses, and interannual variations and trends for land; four containing total cloud, cloud types, harmonic analyses, and interannual variations and trends for oceans; one containing first cloud analyses for the first year of the GARP Global Experiment (FGGE); one containing cloud-type co-occurrences for land and oceans; and one containing a FORTRAN 77 program to read and produce maps). These files range in size from 12.5 kB to 5.67 MB and are available on 9-track magnetic tape only.  NDP-026  Climatological Data for Clouds Over the Globe from Surface Observations, 19821991: The Total Cloud Edition (October 1994) http://cdiac.esd.ornl.gov/ndps/ndp026a.html C. J. Hahn, S. G. Warren, and J. London (contributors) Routine, synoptic surface weather reports from ships and land stations over the entire globe, for the 10-year period December 1981 through November 1991, were processed for total cloud cover and the frequencies of occurrence of clear sky, sky-obscured due to precipitation, and skyobscured due to fog. Archived data, consisting of various annual, seasonal and monthly averages, are provided in grid boxes that are typically 2.5 2.5 for land and 5 5 for ocean. Day and 31  NDP-026A   CDIAC NDPs and CMP  Section C  nighttime averages are also given separately for each season. Several derived quantities, such as interannual variations and annual and diurnal harmonics, are provided as well. This data set incorporates an improved representation of nighttime cloudiness by utilizing only those nighttime observations for which the illuminance due to moonlight exceeds a specified threshold. This reduction in the night-detection bias increases the computed global average total cloud cover by about 2%. The impact on computed diurnal cycles is even greater, particularly over the oceans where it is found (in contrast to previous surface-based climatologies), that cloudiness is often greater at night than during the day.  NDP-026B  Edited Synoptic Cloud Reports from Ships and Land Stations Over the Globe, 19821991 (February 1996) http://cdiac.esd.ornl.gov/epubs/ndp/ndp026b/ndp026b.htm C. J. Hahn, S. G. Warren, and J. London (contributors) Synoptic surface weather reports for the entire globe for the 10-year period from December 1981 through November 1991 have been processed, edited, and rewritten to provide a data set designed for use in cloud analyses. The information in these reports relating to clouds, including the present weather information, was extracted and put through a series of quality control checks. Reports not meeting certain quality control standards were rejected, as were reports from buoys and automatic weather stations. Correctable inconsistencies within reports were edited for consistency, so that the ""edited"" cloud report can be used for cloud analysis without further quality checking. Cases of ""sky obscured"" were interpreted by reference to the present weather code as to whether they indicated fog, rain or snow and were given appropriate cloud type designations. Nimbostratus clouds, which have not previously been assigned a standard synoptic code, were also given a special designation. Changes made to an original report are indicated in the edited report so that the original report can be reconstructed if desired. While low cloud amount is normally given directly in the synoptic report, the edited cloud report also includes the amounts, either directly reported or inferred, of middle and high clouds, both the non-overlapped amounts and the ""actual"" amounts (which may be overlapped). Since illumination from the moon is important for the adequate detection of clouds at night, both the relative lunar illuminance and the solar altitude are given, as well as a parameter that indicates whether our recommended illuminance criterion was satisfied. This data set contains 124 million reports from land stations and 15 million reports from ships. Each report is 56 characters in length. The archive consists of 240 files, one file for each month of data for land and ocean separately. Due to the size of the database (~8 GB), the data are available on 8 mm tapes or via Internet only. With this data set, a user can develop a climatology for any particular cloud type or group of types, for any geographical region, and for any spatial and temporal resolution desired.  32   Section C  CDIAC NDPs and CMP NDP-027 (WDC-A)  GEOSECS Atlantic, Pacific, Indian, and Mediterranean Radiocarbon Data (January 1988) http://cdiac.esd.ornl.gov/oceans/ndp027.html H. G. stlund and M. Stuiver (contributors) Radiocarbon data for the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian oceans were obtained between 1972 and 1977 as part of the Geochemical Ocean Section Study (GEOSECS) cruises during which more than 2200 water samples were collected. Some Mediterranean Sea data were also collected. Samples for 14C were collected at 124 stations, and approximately 18 samples were collected at each station from intervals throughout the water column. The data included in the data base are ship position (latitude and longitude), sample number, depth, potential temperature, salinity, and delta 14C. The GEOSECS data sets allow a better understanding of large-scale oceanic transport and mixing and the establishment of the gross rate of deep-ocean circulation. The data are in three files (radiocarbon data for the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans) ranging in size from 39.9 to 50.4 kB.  Carbonate Chemistry of the Weddell Sea (January 1988) http://cdiac.esd.ornl.gov/oceans/ndp028.html C.-T. A. Chen (contributor) In the late austral winter of 1981, carbonate data were obtained from the Weddell Sea as part of the U.S.U.S.S.R. Weddell Polynya Expedition (WEPOLEX-81). Both surface samples and vertical-station samples were taken. The data include ship position (latitude and longitude), date, station number, sample depth, salinity, water temperature, pH, normalized surface total alkalinity, and calcium. These data represent the first comprehensive carbonate data obtained in the Weddell Sea during late winter. Because of the importance of the Weddell Sea as a source of deep water for the world's oceans, these data have improved the understanding of the oceanic circulation of excess CO2 in the carbon cycle. The data are in two files [one for data from surface stations (15.5 kB) and one for data from vertical stations (5.9 kB)].

Gendron (contributors) Carbonate chemistry data from 41 stations in the North Pacific Ocean were obtained during two NOAA CO2 Dynamics Cruises (JuneJuly 1981 and MayJune 1982) and two legs of the NORPAX HawaiiTahiti Shuttle Experiment (April 1979 and MarchApril 1980). The data for each sample include ship position (latitude and longitude), date, station number, sample depth, salinity, water temperature, pH, normalized total alkalinity, and normalized calcium. The data from each of the three cruises are in separate files ranging in size from 7.1 kB to 10.1 kB.

Marland, R. J. Andres, T. A. Boden, C. Johnston, and A. L. Brenkert (contributors) Global, regional, and national annual estimates of CO2 emissions from fossil fuel burning, cement production, and gas flaring have been calculated through 1996, some as far back as 1751. These estimates, derived primarily from energy statistics published by the United Nations, were calculated using the methods of Marland and Rotty (1984). Cement production estimates from the U.S. Department of Interior's Bureau of Mines were used to estimate CO2 emitted during cement production. Emissions from gas flaring were derived primarily from UN data but were supplemented with data from the U.S. Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration, Rotty (1974), and with a few national estimates provided by Marland. At present, this subdirectory provides three files containing the global (global96.ems), regional (region96.ems), and national (nation96.ems) CO2 emissions estimates, along with a country code file (country.cod) and a region definition file (region.def).  NDP-032  Antarctic Surface Temperature and Pressure Data (December 1991) http://cdiac.esd.ornl.gov/ndps/ndp032.html P. D. Jones and D. W. S. Limbert (contributors) Monthly mean surface temperature and pressure data for 30 Antarctic stations (the earliest beginning in 1903 and all extending through 1988) were assembled primarily from World Weather Records and Monthly Climatic Data for the World. The data were assessed for quality and long-term homogeneity. The data presented are station name, station latitude and longitude, station elevation, first and final year of data record, year, mean monthly sea-level or station-level pressure, and mean monthly surface temperature. The data are in four files (two temperature and two pressure data files) ranging in size from 25 to 43 kB.  NDP-033 (WDC-A)  Atmospheric CO2 Concentrations Derived from Flask Samples Collected at U.S.S.R.-Operated Sampling Sites (May 1994) http://cdiac.esd.ornl.gov/ndps/ndp033.html A. M. Brounshtein, E. V. Faber, and A. A. Shashkov (contributors) This NDP represents the first CDIAC data package to result from our involvement with Soviet scientists as part of Working Group (WG) VIII of the U.S.-U.S.S.R. Joint Committee on Cooperation in the Field of Environmental Protection. The U.S.-U.S.S.R. Agreement on Protection of the Environment, established in 1972, covers a wide variety of areas, including environmental pollution, the urban environment, nature preserves, arctic and subarctic ecological systems, earthquake prediction, and institutional measures for environmental protection. WG VIII is concerned with the influence of environmental changes on climate.  34   Section C  CDIAC NDPs and CMP  These atmospheric CO2 concentrations are considered indicative of regional background air conditions and are directly traceable to the World Meteorological Organization's primary CO2 standards. These measurements support the rising trend in atmospheric CO2 concentrations measured at other monitoring sites around the world and may be compared with similar measurements made by various monitoring programs at other northern-latitude sites. Annual mean atmospheric CO2 concentrations, calculated from available individual flask measurements for the four sites, have increased from 352.38 parts per million by volume (ppmv) in 1988 to 354.97 ppmv in 1990 for Teriberka Station, 343.52 ppmv in 1983 to 355.68 ppmv in 1990 for Ocean Station Charlie, 345.19 ppmv in 1986 to 354.93 ppmv in 1990 for Bering Island, and 351.96 ppmv in 1987 to 356.05 ppmv in 1990 for Kotelny Island. The atmospheric CO2 measurements from each site show a pronounced annual seasonal oscillation caused by photosynthetic depletion during the northern growing season. The amplitudes of these seasonal oscillations are quite large (10 to 30 ppmv) and are consistent with measurement records from other northern-latitude locations. The NDP consists of a written document and a magnetic tape containing seven files: four data files (one for each station) that provide the atmospheric CO2 concentrations from individual flask measurements, a descriptive file, and FORTRAN 77 and SAS computer codes to access the data files. The written document presents the atmospheric CO2 concentrations in graphic and tabular form, describes the sampling methods, defines limitations and restrictions of the data, and describes the information on the magnetic media. The data files range in size from 0.97 to 20.01 kB. These data are also available on CD-ROM or via FTP. For those wishing to receive these data on floppy diskette, the same files are available on IBM-formatted, high- or low-density, 5.25- or 3.5-inch floppy diskettes as DOS ASCII text files.  Atmospheric CO2 Concentrations--The Canadian Background Air Pollution Monitoring Network (December 1995) http://cdiac.esd.ornl.gov/ndps/ndp034.html N. B. A. Trivett, V. C. Hudec, and C. S. Wong (contributors) Flask air samples collected at roughly weekly intervals at three Canadian sites [Alert, Northwest Territories (July 1975 through July 1992); Sable Island, Nova Scotia (March 1975 through July 1992); and Cape St. James, British Columbia (May 1979 through July 1992)] were analyzed for CO2 concentration with the measurements directly traceable to the WMO primary CO2 standards. Each record includes the date, atmospheric CO2 concentration, and flask classification code. They provide an accurate record of CO2 concentration levels in Canada during the past two decades. Because these data are directly traceable to WMO standards, this record may be compared with records from other Background Air Pollution Monitoring Network (BAPMoN) stations. The data are in three files (one for each of the monitoring stations) ranging in size from 9.4 to 20.1 kB.

R. Birdwell and R. C. Daniels (contributors) This NDP is unique in that it represents CDIAC's first offering of ARC/INFOTM export data files and equivalent flat ASCII data files that may be used by raster or vector geographic information systems (GISs). The data set contains 61 variables, including information on tropical storms, hurricanes, super typhoons, extratropical cyclogeneses, polar lows, cyclonicity, influence of winds in monsoon regions, and sea-ice concentrations. Increased availability of source data has made it possible to extend the area of these data variables to regional or global coverages. All data variables except five are referenced to 1o  1o or 5o  5o grid cells of latitude and longitude. These data help meet the demand for new and improved climatologies of storm events and may be used in climate research studies, including the verification of general circulation models and the calculation of storm-recurrence intervals. The NDP consists of a written report and a 9-track magnetic tape containing 34 files, including eight ARC/INFOTM files, flat ASCII files, and FORTRAN 77 and SAS retrieval routines; a vector coordinate file; and a descriptive file. The data files range in size from 0.1 kB to 5.31 MB. The data are also available on CD-ROM or via FTP. For those wishing to receive these data on floppy diskettes, CDIAC will provide all except the ARC/INFOTM files on IBM-format, high-density 5.25- or 3.5-in. diskettes.

Grall (contributors) This data set presents 14C activities from water samples taken at various locations and depths in the Indian and Southern oceans through the Indien Gaz Ocean (INDIGO) project. These data were collected as part of the INDIGO 1, INDIGO 2, and INDIGO 3 cruises, which took place during the years 1985, 1986, and 1987, respectively. These data have been used to estimate the penetration of anthropogenic CO2 in the Indian and Southern oceans. The records include the station, date, ocean bottom depth, latitude and longitude, sampling depth, potential temperature, salinity, density, total CO2, 13C, and 14C activity. The data are in one file of 25 kB.  36   Section C  CDIAC NDPs and CMP NDP-037  Carbon Dioxide Enrichment: Data on the Response of Cotton to Varying CO2 Irrigation, and Nitrogen (May 1993) http://cdiac.esd.ornl.gov/ndps/ndp037.html B.

Pros, and J. Martinez (contributors) This NDP presents data on the effects of continuous CO2 enrichment of cotton during five consecutive growing seasons, 1983 to 1987, under both optimal and limiting levels of water and nitrogen. Unlike many prior CO2-enrichment experiments in growth chambers or greenhouses, these studies were conducted on field-planted cotton at close to natural conditions with open-top chambers. Measurements were made on a variety of crop-response variables during the growing season and upon crop harvest. The initial experiment examined the effects of varying CO2 concentration only. During the following two seasons, the interactive effects of CO2 concentration and water availability were studied. During the final two seasons, the interactions among CO2 concentration, water availability, and nitrogen fertility were investigated. The data include identification variables (such as year, institution and site codes, and treatment regimens), intermediate growth measurements (such as plant height, leaf-area index, number of flowers, and dry weight of leaves) taken at various times during the growing season, and cropharvest results (such as lint yield, seed yield, and total aboveground dry biomass). These data will be useful in studying the possible future effects on crop production of a doubling of global atmospheric CO2 concentrations and for validating crop-growth models designed to predict the effects of elevated CO2 on cotton growth. The data show that, for all five growing seasons and all experimental treatments, cotton yields and plant dry weights were increased significantly by CO2 enrichment. The NDP includes a 48.4-kB ASCII accessing the data, a descriptive file, supplemental text that describes and weather, soil profile properties (e.g., and fertilizer treatments. data file, FORTRAN 77 and SAS computer codes for and written documentation. The documentation includes a presents data for many other parameters, including daily initial soil moisture and nitrogen conditions), and irrigation  Two Long-Term Instrumental Climatic Data Bases of the People's Republic of China (September 1997) http://cdiac.esd.ornl.gov/ndps/ndp039.html S.

The first version of this database extended through 1988 and was made available in 1991 as CDIAC NDP-039. This update of the database includes data through 1993. These data sets were compiled in accordance with a joint research agreement signed by the U.S. Department of Energy and the PRC Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) on Aug. 19, 1987. CAS has provided records from 270 stations, partitioned into two networks of 65 and 205 stations.  NDP-039  37   CDIAC NDPs and CMP  Section C  The 65-station-network data contain monthly means, extremes, or totals of barometric pressure, air temperature, precipitation amount, relative humidity, sunshine duration, cloud amount, dominant wind direction and frequency, wind speed, and number of days with snow cover. Station histories are available from 59 of the 65 stations. The 205-station-network data contain monthly mean temperatures and monthly precipitation totals; however, station histories are not currently available. Sixteen stations from these data sets (13 from the 65-station, 3 from the 205-station) have temperature and/or precipitation records beginning before 1900, whereas the remaining stations began observing in the early to mid-1900s.

Martuganov (contributors) Under an international agreement, the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) in Asheville, N.C., is exchanging climatological information with the Research Institute of Hydrometeorological Information in Obninsk, Russia. To expedite the dissemination of these data, CDIAC, with funding provided by NCDC, is distributing one of the more useful archives acquired through this exchange: a 223-station daily data set covering from 1881 to 1989. The data set contains (1) minimum, mean, and maximum daily temperatures; (2) daily precipitation; (3) station inventory information (i.e., WMO number, name, coordinates, and elevation); (4) station history (i.e., station relocation and rain-gage replacement informat ion); and (5) qualityassurance information (i.e., flag codes that were assigned as a result of various data checks). The data are in 18 files.  NDP-041  The Global Historical Climatology Network: Long-Term Monthly Temperature, Precipitation, Sea Level Pressure, and Station Pressure Data (February 1992) http://cdiac.esd.ornl.gov/epubs/ndp/ndp041/ndp041.html R. S. Vose, R. L. Schmoyer, P. M. Steurer, T. C. Peterson, R. Heim, T. R. Karl, and J. K. Eischeid (contributors) This NDP contains monthly temperature, precipitation, sea-level pressure, and station-pressure data for thousands of meteorological stations worldwide. The database was compiled from preexisting national, regional, and global collections of data as part of the Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN) project. It contains data from roughly 6000 temperature stations, 7500 precipitation stations, 1800 sea level pressure stations, and 1800 station pressure stations. Each station has at least 10 years of data, 40% have more than 50 years of data. Spatial coverage is good over most of the globe, particularly for the United States and Europe. Data gaps are evident over the Amazon rainforest, the Sahara desert, Greenland, and Antarctica. A detailed analysis has revealed that most stations (95% for temperature and precipitation; 75% for pressure) contain high-quality data. However, gross data-processing errors (e.g., keypunch problems) and discontinuous inhomogeneities (e.g., station relocations and instrumentation  38   Section C  CDIAC NDPs and CMP  changes) do characterize a small number of stations. All major data processing problems have been flagged (or corrected, when possible). Similarly, all major inhomogeneities were flagged, although no homogeneity corrections were applied. The NDP consists of a written report, two magnetic tapes of data, and FORTRAN 77 and SAS data retrieval codes. Because of the size of the data base, the NDP is not available on floppy diskette.   United States Historical Climatology Network Daily Temperature and Precipitation Data (November 1995) http://cdiac.esd.ornl.gov/ndps/ndp042.html P. Y. Hughes, E. H. Mason, T. R. Karl, and W. A. Brower (contributors) This package consists of a data base containing daily observations of maximum and minimum temperature and precipitation amounts at 138 U.S. stations. These stations are a specially chosen subset of the 1219-station United States Historical Climatology Network (HCN), which was compiled by the National Climatic Data Center (Asheville, North Carolina) and is contained in NDP-019/R1. The daily data network (referred to as the HCN/D) consists of stations considered to be the best of those in the HCN, selected to provide effective coverage of the contiguous U.S. after considering the temporal homogeneity of each station's observing times, instrument positioning, and surroundings. The data for each station extend through 1987, and most station records are complete for at least 80 years. The daily resolution of these data lends maximum flexibility for studies attempting to detect and monitor long-term climatic changes on a regional scale. The data are contained in seven files (one station-inventory file, one station-history file, and five temperature and precipitation data files). The files range in size from 10 kB to approximately 31 MB.  NDP-042  A Coastal Hazards Data Base for the U.S. East Coast (June 1995) http://cdiac.esd.ornl.gov/ndps/ndp043a.html V. M. Gornitz and T. W. White (contributors) This NDP presents data on coastal geology, geomorphology, elevation, erosion, wave heights, tide ranges, and sea levels for the U.S. east coast. These data may be used either by nongeographic database management systems or by raster or vector geographic information systems (GISs). The database integrates several data sets (originally obtained as point, line, and polygon data) for the east coast into 0.25o-latitude by 0.25o-longitude grid cells. Each coastal grid cell contains 28 data variables. This NDP may be used to predict the response of coastal zones on the U.S. east coast to changes in local or global sea levels. Information on the geologic, geomorphic, and erosional states of the coast provides the basic data needed to predict the behavior of the coastal zone into the far future. Thus, these data may be seen as providing a baseline for the calculation of the relative vulnerability of the east coast to projected sea-level rises. This data will also be useful to research, educational, governmental, and private organizations interested in the present and future vulnerability of coastal areas to erosion and inundation. The data are in 13 files, the largest of which is 1.42 MB; the entire data base takes up 3.29 MB, excluding the ARC/INFOTM files. 39  NDP-043A   CDIAC NDPs and CMP NDP-043B A Coastal Hazards Data Base for the U.S. Gulf Coast (June 1995) http://cdiac.esd.ornl.gov/ndps/ndp043b.html V. M. Gornitz and T. W. White (contributors)  Section C  This document describes the contents of a digital data base that may be used to identify coastlines along the U.S. Gulf Coast at risk to sea-level rise. The data base integrates point, line, and polygon data for the U.S. Gulf Coast into 0.25o latitude by 0.25o longitude grid cells and into 1:2,000,000 digitized line segments that can be used by raster or vector geographic information systems (GIS) as well as by non-GIS data base systems. Each coastal grid cell and line segment contains data on elevations, geology, geomorphology, sea-level trends, shoreline displacement (erosion/accretion), tidal ranges, and wave heights. To allow for the identification of coastlines at risk from sea level rise, 7 of the 22 original data variables in this data base were classified by vulnerability and used to create 7 relative risk variables. These relative risk variables range in value from 1 to 5 and may be used to calculate a coastal vulnerability index for each grid cell and/or line segment. The data for these 29 variables (i.e., the 22 original variables and 7 risk variables) have been placed into the following data formats: 1. Gridded polygon data for the 22 original data variables. Data include elevations, geology, geomorphology, sea-level trends, shoreline displacement (erosion/accretion), tidal ranges, and wave heights. 2. Gridded polygon data for the seven classified risk variables. The risk variables are classified versions of mean coastal elevation, geology, geomorphology, local subsidence trend, mean shoreline displacement, maximum tidal range, and maximum significant wave height. 3. 1:2,000,000 line segment data containing the 29 data variables (i.e., the 22 original data variables and the 7 classified risk variables). 4. Supplemental point data for the stations used in calculating the sea-level trend and tidal range data sets. 5. Supplemental line segment data containing a 1:2,000,000 digitized coastline of the U.S. Gulf Coast as defined by this numeric data package (NDP). This document provides sample listings of the data and detailed descriptions of the file formats; offers FORTRAN 77 and SAS retrieval program listings; describes the methods used in calculating each variable; discusses the sources, restrictions, and limitations of the data; provides five ARC/INFOTM export coverages and flat ASCII data files containing these data; and provides reprints of pertinent literature.  40   Section C  CDIAC NDPs and CMP NDP-043C  A Coastal Hazards Data Base for the U.S. West Coast (December 1997) http://cdiac.esd.ornl.gov/epubs/ndp/ndp043c/43c.htm V. M. Gornitz and T. W. Beaty (contributors) This document describes the contents of a digital database that may be used to identify coastlines along the U.S. West Coast that are at risk to sea-level rise. The database integrates point, line, and polygon data for the U.S. West Coast into 0.25 latitude by 0.25 longitude grid cells and into 1:2,000,000 digitized line segments in a latitude/longitude coordinate system that can be used by raster or vector geographic information systems (GIS) as well as by non-GIS databases. East coastal grid cell and line segment contains 29 data variables on elevation, geology, geomorphology, sea-level trends, shoreline displacement (erosion/accretion), tidal ranges, and wave heights. Seven of the 22 original data variables in this database were classified by susceptibility to sea level rise and/or erosion to form 7 relative risk variables. These risk variables range in value from 1 to 5 and may be used to calculate a Coastal Vulnerability Index (CVI). Algorithms used to calculate several CVIs are listed within this text.  Surface Water and Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide and Nitrous Oxide Observations by Shipboard Automated Gas Chromatography: Results from Expeditions Between 1977 and 1990 (February 1993) http://cdiac.esd.ornl.gov/oceans/ndp044.html R. F. Weiss, F. A. Van Woy, and P. K. Salameh (contributors) This NDP presents the results of surface water and atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) measurements carried out on shipboard by gas chromatography from 1977 to 1990. These data include results from 41 legs of 11 ocean surveys conducted in the Atlantic, Pacific, Indian, and Southern oceans, as well as the Mediterranean and Red seas. The measurements were made by an automated high-precision shipboard gas chromatographic system that measures CO2 by flame ionization after quantitative reduction to methane in a stream of hydrogen. Nitrous oxide is measured by a separate electron-capture detector. The chromatographic system measures 196 dry-gas samples a day, divided equally among the atmosphere, gas equilibrated with surface water, a low-range gas standard, and a high-range gas standard. These data constitute one of the most extensive records available of CO2 and, particularly, N2O in marine air and surface seawater. The data will be valuable in modeling the ocean's role in the global cycles of carbon and nitrogen, in studies of ocean--atmosphere dynamics, and in evaluations of other methods for determining pCO2. The records include the names of the expedition and research vessel, sample date and time, latitude and longitude, sample type (i.e., marine air or surface seawater), barometric pressure, surface water temperature, and dry-gas mole fractions of CO2 and N2O. The data are in 82 files totaling 7.1 MB.

W. Chipman, T. Takahashi, D. Berger, and S. C. Sutherland (contributors) This document presents the procedures and methods used to obtain CO2, hydrographic, and chemical data during the R/V Meteor Expedition 11/5 in the South Atlantic Ocean, including the Drake Passage (Section A-12); the Northern Weddell Sea; and the Eastern South Atlantic Ocean (Section A-21). This cruise was conducted as part of the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE). The cruise started from Ushuaia, Argentina, on January 23, 1990, and ended at Capetown, South Africa on March 8, 1990. Samples were collected at 78 stations that covered the Drake Passage (5663 S); the Northern Weddell Sea (4535 W); a section along the 58 W parallel (25 Wprime meridian); and two segmented S-N sections between the Northern Weddell Sea and Capetown, South Africa. Measurements taken at WOCE sections A-12 and A-21 included pressure, temperature, salinity measured by the Conductivity, Temperature and Depth sensor (CTD); bottle salinity, oxygen; phosphate; nitrate, nitrite; silicate, total carbon concentration (TCO2); and partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) measured at 20C. In addition, potential density at 0 decibar (dbar) and potential temperature were calculated from the measured variables. The TCO2 concentration in seawater samples was measured using a coulometer with an estimated precision of approximately 1  mol/kg. The coulometer was calibrated frequently at sea by using a high-precision gas pipette and CO2 gas (99.998%). The pCO2 value in seawater samples was measured at 20C by means of a constant-volume (500 ml seawater) equilibrator and a gas chromatograph. CO2 in equilibrated gas was first converted to methane, by using a ruthenium catalyst, and then measured by a flame-ionization detector. The precision of pCO2 measurements has been estimated to be approximately 0.1%.  NDP-046 (WDC-A)  Historic Land Use and Carbon Estimates for South and Southeast Asia: 18801980 (June 1995) http://cdiac.esd.ornl.gov/ndps/ndp046.html J. F. Richards and E. P. Flint (contributors) This digital data base contains estimates of land use change and the carbon content of vegetation for South and Southeast Asia for the years 1880, 1920, 1950, 1970, and 1980. These data were originally collected for climate modelers so they could reduce the uncertainty associated with the magnitude and time course of historical land use change and of carbon release. For this data base, South and Southeast Asia is defined as encompassing nearly 8  106 km2 of the earth's land surface and includes the countries of India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Myanmar (Burma), Thailand, Laos, Kampuchea (Cambodia), Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei, Singapore, Indonesia, and the Philippines. The most important change in land use over this 100-year period was the conversion of 107  106 ha of forest/woodland to categories with lower biomass.

The estimated total carbon content of and Southeast Asia has dropped progressively, from 59  109 Mg in 1880 Throughout the study period, the carbon stock in forests was greater than other categories combined, although its share of the total declined in 1880 to 73% in 1980.  The database was developed in Lotus 1-2-3TM by using a sequential bookkeeping model. The source data were obtained at the local and regional level for each country from official agricultural and economic statistics (e.g., the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization); historical geographic and demographic texts, reports, and articles; and any other available source. Because of boundary changes through time and disparities between the validity, availability, and scale of the data for each country, the data were aggregated into 94 ecological zones. The resulting data base contains land use and carbon information for 94 ecological zones and national totals for 13 countries. The database consists of 90 Lotus 1-2-3TM files, 3 ARC/INFOTM export files, and 5 ASCII data files. In addition to these, a descriptive file that explains the contents and format of each data file and 4 FORTRAN 77 and SAS retrieval programs for use with the ASCII data files are included.  Carbon Dioxide Concentrations in Surface Water and the Atmosphere During 19861989 NOAA/PMEL Cruises in the Pacific and Indian Oceans (March 1995) http://cdiac.esd.ornl.gov/oceans/ndp_047/ndp047.html P. P. Murphy, K. C. Kelly, R. A. Feely, and R. H. Gammon (contributors) This document presents data on carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations in surface water and the atmosphere collected during Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory (PMEL) expeditions during 19861989. CO2 was measured quasi-continuously on 5 PMEL expeditions (12 legs) in the Pacific and Indian Oceans. These cruises were conducted under support from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). CO2 measurements in the atmosphere and in surface water were made by analyzing mixing ratios of CO2 with an automated, temperaturecontrolled gas chromatograph system described by Murphy et al. (1991) and Bates et al. (1993). Instrument precision was determined by the average percent standard deviation of the standard response over a 6-h period. The precision varied between cruises but was always less than 1.2% and was more typically around 0.4%. Air was pumped through 3/8-in. diam., plastic-coated, aluminum tubing from the jackstaff on the bow of the ship (10 m above the sea surface) to the oceanographic laboratory for analysis. Surface seawater entered the ship via a forward intake line located approximately 5 m below the water level. Fifteen files are described in this report and distributed along with it, including one descriptive file (ndp047.doc) that provides an overview of the cruise network and describes details on the content and format of the thirteen data files; one FORTRAN 77 retrieval code (pmeldat.for) that may be used to read and print any of the data files; and thirteen data files, one (pmel8689.dat) that contains the data from all twelve legs, and separate files (12 total) for each leg. Each of the data files contains the same variables: cruise name; date (day, month, year); day of the year [Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)]; latitude and longitude (in decimal degrees); cumulative distance since the first sampling location on the leg; sea surface temperature (C); warming temperature [indicates 43  NDP-047 (WDC-A)   CDIAC NDPs and CMP  Section C  the warming (C) of seawater as it transited from the intake line to the analysis site]; sea surface salinity; atmospheric pressure; reported atmospheric CO 2 concentration [X(CO2)air], which is the mole fraction of the dried air pumped from the bow line; reported surface seawater CO2 concentration [X(CO2)sw], which is the mole fraction of the dried vapor drawn from the equilibrator headspace; the calculated fugacity values for the air [f(CO2)air] and seawater [f(CO2)sw] given in the data tables are the in situ fugacities, which have been corrected for the warming of the seawater; and data quality flags. The NDP consists of printed documentation and machine-readable files. The data files are available on 9-track magnetic tape; IBM-formatted floppy diskettes; 8-mm tapes; and 150-mB, quarter-inch tape cartridge and from CDIAC's anonymous FTP area via Internet. This document also contains an appendix, that is a full reprint of the NOAA Technical Memorandum ERL PMEL-101 authored by Murphy et al. in 1994. The appendix contains cruise information, fully describes the sampling methods and instrumentation, and defines limitations and restrictions of the data.

Martuganov (contributors) This database contains 6- and 3-hourly meteorological observations from a 223-station network of the former Soviet Union. These data have been made available through cooperation between the two principal climate data centers of the United States and the former Soviet Union: the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC), in Asheville, North Carolina, and the All-Russian Research Institute of Hydrometeorological Information--World Data Centre (RIHMI-WDC) in Obninsk, Russia. The first version of this database extended through the mid-1980s (ending year dependent upon station) and was made available in 1995 by CDIAC as NDP-048. This update of the database includes data through 1990. Station records consist of 6- and 3-hourly observations of some 24 meteorological variables including temperature, past and present weather type, precipitation amount, cloud amount and type, sea level pressure, relative humidity, and wind direction and speed. The 6-hourly observations extend from 1936 through 1965; the 3-hourly observations extend from 1966 through 1990. These data have undergone extensive quality assurance checks by RIHMI-WDC, NCDC, and CDIAC. The database represents a wealth of meteorological information for a large and climatologically important portion of the earth's land area, and should prove extremely useful for a wide variety of regional climate change studies. This NDP consists of a printed document detailing the initial version of the database (Razuvaev et al. 1995) that extended through the mid-1980s, 15 updated data retrieval and documentation files, and 223 data files updated through 1990 (one per station; ~2.9 gigabytes total, in uncompressed form) that are available via the Internet through CDIAC's Web site or anonymous FTP server, and upon request, on various magnetic media.  44   Section C  CDIAC NDPs and CMP NDP-049 (WDC-A)  Carbon-13 Isotopic Abundance and Concentration of Atmospheric Methane for Background Air in the Southern and Northern Hemispheres from 1978 to 1989 (January 1996) http://cdiac.esd.ornl.gov/ndps/ndp049.html C. M. Stevens (contributor) This data package presents atmospheric CH4 concentration and 13C isotopic abundance data derived from air samples collected over the period 19781989 at globally distributed clean-air sites. The data set comprises 201 records, 166 from the Northern Hemisphere and 35 from the Southern Hemisphere. The air samples were collected mostly in rural or marine locations remote from large sources of CH4 and are considered representative of tropospheric background conditions. The air samples were processed by isolation of CH4 from air and conversion to CO2 for isotopic analysis by isotope ratio mass spectrometry. These data represent one of the earliest records of 13C isotopic measurements for atmospheric methane and have been used to refine estimates of CH4 emissions, calculate annual growth rates of emissions from changing sources, and provide evidence for changes in the rate of atmospheric removal of CH4. The data records consist of sample collection date; number of samples combined for analysis; sampling location; analysis date; CH4 concentration; 13C isotopic abundance; and flag codes to indicate outliers, repeated analyses, and other information. The data are contained in one 21.5 kB file.  Continental Scale Estimates of the Biotic Carbon Flux from Land Cover Change: 1850 to 1980 (September 1995) http://cdiac.esd.ornl.gov/ndps/ndp050.html R. A. Houghton and J. L. Hackler (contributors) This data package contains annual carbon flux estimates from land cover change for nine regions of the world (i.e., North America, Europe, the former Soviet Union, Pacific developed region, China, South and Central America, North AfricaMiddle East, tropical Africa, and south and southeast Asia). Annual rates of land cover change and vegetationsoil response curves for each region and ecosystem are included in the database. The vegetationsoil response curves are used in bookkeeping the carbon model to estimate (1) the carbon flux in the atmosphere from clearing or degradation of vegetation, cultivation of soils, decay of dead vegetation, and (2) the recovery of abandoned lands. The model calculates the net flux of carbon in each region based on the land cover change rates and vegetationsoil response curves for the period 18501980 (a few regions have land cover records that begin in 1700 and carbon flux data ending in 1990). These data were collected and modeled in an attempt to reduce the uncertainty associated with the magnitude and time course of the flux of carbon from terrestrial vegetation to the atmosphere.

The biomass data and carbon estimates pertain to woody 47  NDP-055 (WDC-A)   CDIAC NDPs and CMP  Section C  vegetation in Tropical Africa. These data were collected to reduce the uncertainty associated with the possible magnitude of historical releases of carbon from land-use change. Tropical Africa is defined here as encompassing 22.7  10 6 km2 of the earth's land surface and includes those countries that are located for the most part in Tropical Africa. The report also contains information about maximum potential biomass and land cover but not biomass or carbon estimates. This report also contains countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea and in southern Africa (i.e., Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco, South Africa, Lesotho, Swaziland, and Western Sahara). The database was developed through the use of the GRID module in the ARC/INFOTM geographic information system. Source data were obtained from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the U.S. National Geophysical Data Center, and a limited number of biomass-carbon density case studies. These data were used to derive the maximum potential and actual (ca. 1980) aboveground biomass values at regional and country levels. The land-use data provided were derived from a vegetation map originally produced for the FAO by the International Institute of Vegetation Mapping, Toulouse, France. Analyses conducted with this database found that 18% of Tropical Africa was in closed forest and 36% was in open forest in 1980. These forested lands contained over 138  109 Mg of aboveground live biomass, equivalent to 69  109 Mg of carbon. Closed forests and open forests had mean aboveground biomass values of 209 Mg/ha and 67 Mg/ha, respectively, in 1980. These values are down from maximum potential aboveground live biomass values of 296 Mg/ha for closed forest and 108 Mg/ha for open forest. The 26 files consist of seven ARC/INFOTM export files, eight flat ASCII data files, ten FORTRAN 77 and SAS data retrieval files, and one descriptive file that explains the contents and format of each data file. The documentation contains information on the methods used in calculating each variable; detailed descriptions of file contents and formats; and a discussion of the sources, restrictions, and limitations of the data.  NDP-056 (WDC-A)  Carbon Dioxide, Hydrographic, and Chemical Data Obtained During the R/V Meteor Cruise 18/1 in the North Atlantic Ocean (WOCE Section A1E, September 1991) (October 1996) http://cdiac.esd.ornl.gov/oceans/ndp_056/ndp056.html K. M. Johnson, B. Schneider, L. Mintrop, and D. W. R. Wallace (contributors) This data package discusses the procedures and methods used to measure total carbon dioxide (TCO2) and total alkalinity (TALK) at hydrographic stations, as well as underway partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) measured during the R/V Meteor Cruise 18/1 in the North Atlantic Ocean (Section A1E). Conducted as part of the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) and the German North Atlantic Overturning Rate Determination expedition, the cruise began in Reykjavik, Iceland, on September 2, 1991, and ended in Hamburg, Germany, on September 25, 1991, after 24 days at sea. WOCE Zonal Section A1E began at 60 N and 3030' W (southeast of Greenland) and continued southeast with a closely spaced series of hydrocasts to 5220' N and 1415' W (Porcupine Shelves). Measurements made along WOCE Section A1E included pressure, temperature, salinity, and oxygen measured by a conductivity, temperature, and depth (CTD) sensor; bottle salinity; oxygen; phosphate; nitrate; nitrite; silicate; TCO2; TALK; and underway 48   Section C  CDIAC NDPs and CMP  pCO2. A total of 61 CTD casts were made, including 59 bottle casts and 2 calibration stations. Replicate samples from seven Niskin bottles at five stations were also collected for later shore-based reference analyses of TCO2 (by vacuum extraction and manometry) and TALK in the laboratory of Dr. Charles D. Keeling, Scripps Institution of Oceanography; these results are also included in this report. TCO2 was measured by using an automated sample processor to extract CO2 from seawater samples and a coulometer to detect the extracted gas. The precision and accuracy of the system was 1.60  mol/kg. Samples collected for TALK were measured by means of standard potentiometric techniques; precision was 2.0  mol/kg. Underway pCO2 was measured by infrared photometry; precision was 2  atm. The NDP consists of three oceanographic data files, three FORTRAN 77 data retrieval routine files, and an ndp-056.doc file, which describes the contents and format of all files as well as the procedures and methods used to obtain the data.  Carbon-14 Measurements in Atmospheric CO2 from Northern and Southern Hemisphere Sites, 19621993 (November 1996) http://cdiac.esd.ornl.gov/epubs/ndp/ndp057/ndp057.htm R. Nydal and K. Lvseth (contributors) In the 1960s, thermonuclear bomb tests released significant pulses of radioactive 14C into the atmosphere. This major perturbation allowed scientists to study the dynamics of the global carbon cycle by measuring and observing rates of isotopic exchange. The Radiological Dating Laboratory at the Norwegian Institute of Technology performed 14C measurements in atmospheric CO2 from 1962 to 1993 at a network of ground stations in the Northern and Southern hemispheres. These measurements were supplemented during 1965 with high-altitude (912.6 km) air samples collected by aircraft from the Norwegian Air Force. The resulting database, coupled with other 14C data sets, provides a greater understanding of the dynamic carbon reservoir and a crude picture of anomalous sources and sinks at various geographical latitudes. This database is outstanding for its inclusion of early 14C measurements, broad spatial coverage of sampling, consistency of sampling method, and 14C calculation results corrected for isotopic fractionation and radioactive decay. This database replaces previous versions published by the authors and the Radiological Dating Laboratory. Fourteen stations spanning latitudes from Spitsbergen (78 N) to Madagascar (21 S) were used for sampling during the lifetime of the Norwegian program. Some of the stations have data for only a brief period, while others have measurements through 1993. Sampling stations subject to local industrial CO2 contamination were avoided. The sites have sufficient separation to describe the latitudinal distribution of 14C in atmospheric models. The sampling procedure for all the surface (102400 m asl) 14C measurements in this database consisted of quantitative absorption of atmospheric CO2 in carbonate-free 0.5 N NaOH solution. The 14C measurements were made in a CO2 proportional counter and calculated ( 14C) as per mille excess above the normal 14C level defined by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Atmospheric 14C content is finally expressed as 14C, which is the relative deviation of the measured 14C activity from the NIST oxalic acid standard activity after correction for isotopic fractionation and radioactive decay related to age. The data are organized by sampling station, and each record of the database contains the sampling dates; values for 14C excess ( 14C) relative to the NIST standard, fractionation 13C ( 13C) relative to the Pee Dee Belemnite (PDB) standard, and corrected 14 C (14C) excess; and the standard deviation for 14C. The 14C calculation results presented here are thus corrected for isotopic fractionation and radioactive decay, and they constitute the final product of a research effort that has spanned three decades. 49  NDP-057 (WDC-A)   CDIAC NDPs and CMP  Section C  The 14C station data show a sharp increase in tropospheric radiocarbon levels in the early 1960s and then a decline after the majority of nuclear tests came to an end on August 5, 1963 (Test Ban Treaty). The sharp peaks in tropospheric radiocarbon in the early 1960s are more pronounced in the Northern Hemisphere, reflecting the location of most atomic weapons tests. The measurements show large seasonal variations in the 14C level during the early 1960s mainly as a result of springtime transport of bomb 14C from the stratosphere. During the 1970s, the seasonal variations are smaller and result partly from seasonal variations in CO2 from fossil-fuel emissions. The rate of decrease of atmospheric radiocarbon provides a check on the exchange constants of the atmosphere and ocean. The Nydal and Lvseth atmospheric 14C database comprises 21 data files totaling 0.2 MB in size. The report describes the sampling methods and analysis. In addition, the report includes a complete discussion of CDIAC's data-processing efforts, the contents and format of the data files, and a reprint of a related Nydal and Lvseth journal article.  NDP-057A (WDC-A)  Carbon-14 Measurements in Surface Water CO2 from the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans, 19651994 (March 1998) http://cdiac.esd.ornl.gov/epubs/ndp/ndp057a/ndp57a.html R. Nydal (contributor) In the 1960s, thermonuclear bomb tests released significant pulses of radioactive carbon-14 (14C) into the atmosphere. These major perturbations allowed scientists to study the dynamics of the global carbon cycle by calculating rates of isotopic exchange between the atmosphere and ocean waters. The Radiological Dating Laboratory at the Norwegian Institute of Technology performed 14C measurements of atmospheric CO2 from 1962 to 1993 at a network of ground stations in the northern and southern hemispheres; in addition it performed 14C measurements at high-altitude (between 9-12.6 km) during 1965 (Nydal and Lvseth, 1983, 1996). The Norwegian Radiological Dating Laboratory performed similar measurements on seawater samples collected at the ocean surface from 1965 through 1994. The data from NDP-057A, coupled with other 14C data sets, can lead to a greater understanding of the dynamic carbon reservoir and lead to a crude picture of anomalous sources and sinks at different geographical latitudes. The database is outstanding for its inclusion of early 14C measurements, broad spatial coverage of sampling, relative consistency of sampling methods, and 14C calculation results corrected for isotopic fractionation and radioactive decay. This database replaces previous versions published by the author and the Radiological Dating Laboratory.  NDP-058 (WDC-A)  Geographic Patterns of Carbon Dioxide Emissions from Fossil-Fuel Burning, Hydraulic Cement Production, and Gas Flaring on a One Degree by One Degree Grid Cell Basis: 1950 to 1990 (February 1997) http://cdiac.esd.ornl.gov/epubs/ndp/ndp058/ndp058.html R. J. Andres, G. Marland, I. Fung, and E. Matthews (contributors) This data package presents data sets recording 1 latitude by 1 longitude CO2 emissions in units of thousand metric tons of carbon per year from anthropogenic sources for 1950, 1960, 50   Section C  CDIAC NDPs and CMP  1970, 1980, and 1990. Detailed geographic information on CO2 emissions can be critical in understanding the pattern of the atmospheric and biospheric response to these emissions. Global, regional, and national annual estimates for 1950 through 1992 were published previously. Those national, annual CO2 emission estimates were based on statistics about fossil-fuel burning, cement manufacturing and gas flaring in oil fields as well as energy production, consumption, and trade data, using the methods of Marland and Rotty (1984). The national annual estimates were combined with gridded 1 data on political units and 1984 human populations to create the new gridded CO2 emission data sets. The same population distribution was used for each of the years as proxy for the emission distribution within each country. The implied assumption for that procedure was that per capita energy use and fuel mixes are uniform over a political unit. The consequence of this first-order procedure is that the spatial changes observed over time are solely due to changes in national energy consumption and nation-based fuel mix. Increases in emissions over time are apparent for most areas; for example, from 1980 and 1990, a 63% increase in CO2 emissions (based on 1980 emissions) occurred in mainland China and a 95% increase in India. However, actual decreases from 1980 to 1990 occurred in Western Europe: 30% in Sweden, 27% in France, and 23% in Belgium. Latitudinal summations of emissions show a slow southerly shift (in the Northern Hemisphere) in the bulk of emissions over time. The large increases, from 1950 to 1990, in China's and India's contributions to anthropogenic CO2 emissions compared to those by the United States are, for example, very apparent at the latitudinal band around 25.5 North.  Carbon Dioxide Emission Estimates from Fossil-Fuel Burning, Hydraulic Cement Production, and Gas Flaring for 1995 on a One Degree Grid Cell Basis (March 1998) http://cdiac.esd.ornl.gov/ndps/ndp058a.html A. L. Brenkert This data package presents the gridded (one degree latitude by one degree longitude) summed emissions from fossil-fuel burning, hydraulic cement production and gas flaring for 1995. Analogous to the data presented in NDP-058 (which includes estimates for 1950, 1960, 1970, 1980, and 1990), national emission estimates from the 1995 United Nations Energy Statistics Database, hydraulic cement production estimates from the U.S. Department of Interior's Bureau of Mines, and supplemental data on gas flaring from the U.S. Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration were processed by Marland et al. following the methods of Marland and Rotty. The only change in the methodology used to calculate the national CO2 emission estimates for 1995 was the implementation of separate carbon coefficients for soft and hard coal; the emissions estimates in NDP058 were calculated using a single carbon coefficient to characterize the carbon content of all coals. To distribute the national emission estimates from 1995 within each country, the population data base developed by Li and documented by CDIAC (DB1016) was used as proxy. Previously, Andres had used a 1984 human population data set (Goddard Institute of Space Studies, Lerner et al., 1988) as proxy for gridding the 1950 through 1990 emission estimates within countries. The structure of the gridded 1995 emission data file differs, consequently, from the 1950-1990 gridded emission files in that individual grid cells may have been partitioned into more than one country analogous to Li's population data base. A country's representation in a grid cell is quantified by the percentage of that country's land area in a particular grid cell and identified by its United Nations identification code. The percentages and United Nations identification codes were used to allocate the national CO2 emissions estimates to the grid cells. 51  NDP-058A   CDIAC NDPs and CMP  Section C  Only those grid cells with a United Nations identification code, population estimate and carbon emission estimate are listed in the data file. Grid cells representing more than one country are repeated for each country represented. Note that to calculate national estimates from the data file, one has to sum by United Nations identification code. To calculate emissions for each grid cell or by latitude one has to sum by grid cell (latitude and longitude), or by latitude, respectively. A number of manipulations of Li's population database were necessary (and documented) to properly distribute the national 1995 CO2 emission estimates over each country's grid cells.  NDP-059  Daily Snow Depth Measurements from 195 Stations in the United States (March 1997) http://cdiac.esd.ornl.gov/ndps/ndp059.html D. R. Easterling, P. Jamason, D. Bowman, P. Y. Hughes, and E. H. Mason (contributors) This document describes a database containing daily measurements of snow depth at 195 National Weather Service (NWS) first-order climatological stations in the United States. The data have been assembled and made available by the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) in Asheville, North Carolina. The 195 stations encompass 388 unique sampling locations in 48 of the 50 states; no observations from Delaware or Hawaii are included in the database. Station selection criteria emphasized the quality and length of station records while seeking to provide a network with good geographic coverage. Snow depth at the 388 locations was measured once per day on ground open to the sky. The daily snow depth is the total depth of the snow on the ground at measurement time. The time period covered by the database is 18931992; however, not all station records encompass the complete period. While a station record ideally should contain daily data for at least the seven winter months (January through April and October through December), not all stations have complete records. Each logical record in the snow depth database contains one station's daily data values for a period of one month, including data source, measurement, and quality flags. The snow depth data have undergone extensive manual and automated quality assurance checks by NCDC and CDIAC. These reviews involved examining the data for completeness, reasonableness, and accuracy and included comparison of some data records with records in NCDC's Summary of the DayFirst Order on-line database. Since the snow depth measurements have been taken at NWS first-order stations that have long periods of record, they should prove useful in monitoring climate change.

Twenty-five bio-optics stations were sampled for the Joint Global Ocean Flux Study, and at 21 stations CO2 measurements were provided for DOE's Global Change Research Program. Hydrographic and chemical measurements made along WOCE Section P16C included pressure, temperature, salinity, and oxygen measured by conductivity, temperature, and depth sensor as well as bottle salinity, oxygen, phosphate, nitrate, nitrite, silicate, chlorofluorocarbon (CFC)-11, CFC-12, TCO2, and TALK. In addition, potential temperatures were calculated from the measured variables.

Goyet, R. M. Key, K. F. Sullivan, and M. Tsuchiya (contributors) On May 31, 1991, R/V Thomas Washington departed San Diego for the first of its three consecutive TUNES series WOCE legs. Stations were numbered consecutively from the beginning of the R/V Thomas Washington work on Leg 1, TUNES-1 Expedition, starting off the coast of California and ending in Papeete, Tahiti, on July 11, 1991. During the 42-day expedition, 123 hydrographic stations (including 9 large-volume stations) were completed. All stations were sampled to the bottom and consisted of a rosette/CTD cast. Basic station spacing was 30 nautical miles, closing to 10 nautical miles between 3 S and 3 N. Sampling was performed primarily with a 36-place double-ring rosette of 10-L bottles and mounted CTD and transmissometer. CTD data consisted of pressure, temperature, conductivity, oxygen, and transmissometry. Water samples were collected for analyses of salt, oxygen, silicate, phosphate, nitrate, and nitrite at all stations and for CFC-11, CFC-12, helium, tritium,  14C, TCO2, and TALK at selected stations. Underway measurements included ADCP, surface temperature, and surface water and atmospheric pCO2 and N2O.

In addition to the standard WOCE hydrographic parameters measured on these cruises, discrete and underway carbon measurements were made by members of the CO2 survey team. The survey team is a part of the Joint Global Ocean Flux Study (JGOFS) supported by the U.S. Department of Energy to make carbon system measurements on the WOCE global survey cruises. As part of the survey team, the Princeton University Ocean Tracers Laboratory constructed an automated system for underway analysis of surface water and marine air CO2 concentrations (hereafter referred to as the underway system). With the help of the other science team members, the underway system was run aboard the R/V Knorr during all nine legs of the Indian Ocean survey.

The second cruise (WOCE Section P17E/P19S) began in Papeete on December 4, 1992, and finished in Punta Arenas, Chile, on January 22, 1993. The third expedition (WOCE Section P19C) started in Punta Arenas, on February 22 and finished in Panama City, Panama, on April 13, 1993. A total of 422 hydrographic stations were occupied during the three expeditions. Hydrographic and chemical measurements made along WOCE Sections P16A/P17A, P17E/P19S, and P19C included pressure, temperature, salinity, and oxygen [measured by conductivity, temperature, and depth (CTD) sensor], as well as bottle measurements of salinity, oxygen, phosphate, nitrate, nitrite, silicate, chlorofluorocarbon (CFC)-11, CFC-12, TCO2, and pCO2 measured at 4 and 20 C. In addition, potential temperatures were calculated from the measured variables. The TCO2 concentration in 4419 seawater samples was determined with a coulometric analysis system; the pCO2 in 4419 discrete water samples was determined with an equilibrator/gas chromatograph system. At 114 stations, complete vertical profiles from the surface to the ocean floor were obtained, whereas at the remainder of stations only surface mixed layer samples were taken. In addition, 758 coulometric measurements for the Certified Reference Material (batches 12 and 13) were made. The shipboard analyses agreed with the Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO) manometric values within 1.2  mol/kg. The overall precision of TCO2 measurements is estimated to be ~2  mol/kg.

Goyet, G. Eischeid, and A. Kozyr Measurements of the fugacity of carbon dioxide (fCO2) in surface seawater are an important part of studies of the global carbon cycle and its anthropogenic perturbation. An important step toward the thorough interpretation of the vast amount of available fCO2 data is the establishment of a database system that would make such measurements more widely available for use in understanding the basin- and global-scale distribution of fCO2 and its influence on the oceanic uptake of anthropogenic CO2. Such an effort, however, is based on knowledge of the comparability of data sets from different laboratories. Currently, however, there is not much known about this subject. In the light of the aforementioned situation, an International Intercomparison Exercise of Underway fCO2 Systems was proposed and carried out by the Institut fuer Meereskunde Kiel (IfMK) (Institute of Marine Research at the University of Kiel), Kiel, Germany, during the R/V Meteor Cruise 36/1 from Hamilton, Bermuda, to Las Palmas, Gran Canaria, Spain. Nine groups from six countries (Australia, Denmark, Germany, France, Japan, and the United States) participated in this ambitious exercise, bringing together 15 participants with 7 underway fCO2 systems, 1 discrete fCO2 system, and 2 underway pH systems, as well as discrete systems for alkalinity and total dissolved inorganic carbon. This report presents only the results of the underway measurements of fCO2. The main idea of the exercise was to compare surface seawater fCO2 synchronously measured by all participating instruments under identical conditions. This synchronicity was accomplished by providing the infrastructure during the exercise, such as a common seawater 56   Section C  CDIAC NDPs and CMP  and calibration gas supply. Another important issue was checks of the performance of the calibration procedures for CO2 and of all equilibrator temperature sensors. Furthermore a common procedure for the calculation of final fCO2 was applied to all data sets. All these measures were taken in order to reduce the largest possible amount of controllable sources of error. In this report we will demonstrate that the results of three of the seven underway systems agreed to within 2  atm throughout the cruise. This was not only the case for seawater fCO2 measurements but also for measurements of the  atmospheric mole fraction of CO2 (xCO2). One system was in good agreement (+/-2  atm) for most of the time but showed a considerable positive offset of up to 9  atm for about 40 h. However, it was found that significant offsets of up to 10  atm occurred in underway fCO2 measurements for three systems under typical and identical field work conditions. Although at least in one case this may be a consequence of a technical failure, it is an indication of significant systematic differences in other cases. Finally, the discrete fCO2 system measurements agreed within its nominal accuracy of 1% with the three most consistent underway fCO2 systems data sets. On the basis of a detailed comparison and evaluation of this large intercomparison data set we try to come up with general conclusions and recommendations for underway fCO2 work. These may serve as background information for a successful preparation of a coherent database of surface ocean fCO2 values. The results of this exercise certainly underline the need to address carefully the important issue of the inter-laboratory comparability of fCO2 data.

Prinn, D. Cunnold, P. Fraser, R. Weiss, P. Simmonds, B. Miller, F. Alyea, and A. Crawford (contributors)  Other Data Sets DB1001 (WDC-A)  In the ALE/GAGE/AGAGE global network program, continuous high frequency gas chromatographic measurements of two biogenic/anthropogenic gases (methane, CH4; nitrous oxide, N2O; and five anthropogenic gases (chlorofluorocarbons CFCl3, CF2Cl2, and CF2ClCFCl2; methyl chloroform, CH3CCl3; carbon tetrachloride, CCl4) are carried out at globally distributed sites. The program, which began in 1978, is conveniently divided into three parts associated with three changes in instrumentation: the Atmospheric Lifetime Experiment (ALE), which utilized Hewlett Packard HP5840 gas chromatographs; the Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment (GAGE), which utilized HP5880 gas chromatographs; and the recently initiated Advanced GAGE (AGAGE). AGAGE uses a new fully automated system from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography containing a custom-designed sample module and HP5890 and Carle Instruments gas chromatographic components. The current station locations are Cape Grim, Tasmania (41 S, 145 E), Point Matatula, American Samoa (14 S, 171 E), Ragged Point, Barbados (13 N, 59 W), and Mace Head, Ireland (53 N, 10 W). Stations also previously existed at Cape Meares, Oregon (45 N, 124 W), and Adrigole, Ireland (52 N, 10 W). The current Mace Head station replaced the Adrigole station and a station is planned at Trinidad Head, California (41 N, 124 W) to replace Cape Meares. Presently, data from all three experiments are available. Data through March 1998 are now available for all five existing sites. All ALE and GAGE data have been recalculated according to the current AGAGE calibration standards, thus creating a unified ALE/GAGE/AGAGE data set based upon the same standards. Data have been calibrated to the standards as of September, 1998. Please note that the AGAGE database has been completely re-computed (April 1998) to introduce a new and improved pollution analysis scheme and thus pollution designations may differ from previous versions of the data. Individual measurements (generally made 4 times daily at each site for ALE, 12 times daily at each site for GAGE, and more than 30 times daily at each site for AGAGE) and monthly summary averages are provided for each site.

ICRCCM produced benchmark, longwave, line-by-line (LBL) fluxes that may be compared against each other and against models of lower spectral resolution. During ICRCCM, infrared fluxes and cooling rates for several standard model atmospheres with varying concentrations of water vapor, carbon dioxide, and ozone were calculated with LBL 61  DB1002   Other Data Sets  Section D  methods at resolutions of 0.01 cm-1 or higher. For comparison with other models, values were summed for the IR spectrum and given at intervals of 5 or 10 cm-1. This archive contains fluxes for ICRCCM-prescribed clear-sky cases. Radiative flux and coolingrate profiles are given for specified atmospheric profiles for temperature, water vapor, and ozonecontains 328 files, including spectral summaries, formatted data files, and a variety of programs (i.e., C-shell scripts, FORTRAN codes, and IDL programs) to read, reformat, and display data.

S. Bradley, L. G. Ahern, and F. T. Keimig (contributors) Color-shaded and contoured images of global, gridded instrumental data have been produced as a computer-based atlas. Each image simultaneously depicts anomaly maps of surface temperature, sea-level pressure, 500-mbar geopotential heights, and percentages of reference-period precipitation. Monthly, seasonal, and annual composites are available in either cylindrical equidistant or northern and southern hemisphere polar projections. Temperature maps are available from 1854 to 1991, precipitation from 1851 to 1989, sea-level pressure from 1899 to 1991, and 500-mbar heights from 1946 to 1991. The source of data for the temperature images is Jones et al.'s global gridded temperature anomalies. The precipitation images were derived from Eischeid et al.'s global gridded precipitation percentages. Grids from the Data Support Section, National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) were the sources for the sea-level-pressure and 500-mbar geopotential-height images. All images are in GIF files (1024  822 pixels, 256 colors) and can be displayed on many different computer platforms. Each annual subdirectory contains 141 images, each seasonal subdirectory contains 563 images, and each monthly subdirectory contains 1656 images. The entire atlas requires approximately 340 MB of disk space, but users may retrieve any number of images at one time. Users should have monitors with the capability of displaying 256 colors (SVGA, 8-bit RGB color) and software for viewing GIF files. The monitor is necessary to take advantage of the highresolution color images and to display them correctly. For users needing a GIF viewer, three shareware viewers are provided--one for an IBM-compatible PC, one for a Macintosh, and one for a workstation. A CD-ROM version of the atlas is available for $30.00.

R. Karl, R. G. Baldwin, M. G. Burgin, D. R. Easterling, R. W. Knight, and P. Y. Hughes (contributors) This database is a companion to the Historical Climatology Network (HCN) database for the contiguous United States (see NDP-019/R3 on page 28). The database contains monthly temperature (minimum, maximum, and mean) and total monthly precipitation data for 47 Alaskan stations. These data were derived from a variety of sources including the National Climatic Data Center archives, the state climatologist for Alaska, and published literature. The period of record varies by station. The longest record is for the Sitka Magnetic Observatory (1828) and most records extend through 1990. Unlike the HCN database for the contiguous U.S., adjustments have not been made to these climate records for time-of-observation differences, instrument changes, or station moves. The data are in three files [one data file that contains all four climate variables, one station inventory file, and one station history file]. The file sizes range from 3.5 kB to 1.7 MB.

Doyle (contributors) The Forest Responses to Anthropogenic Stress (FORAST) project was designed (1) to determine whether evidence of alterations of long-term growth patterns of several species of eastern forest trees was apparent in tree-ring chronologies from within the region and (2) to identify environmental variables that were temporally or spatially correlated with any observed changes. The project was supported principally by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) with additional support from the National Park Service. The FORAST project was initiated in 1982 as exploratory research to document patterns of radial growth of forest trees during the previous 50 or more years within 15 states in the northeastern United States. Radial growth measurements from more than 7000 trees are provided along with data on a variety of measured and calculated indices of stand characteristics (basal area, density, and competitive indices); climate (temperature, precipitation, and drought); and anthropogenic pollutants (state and regional emissions of SO2 and NOx, ozone monitoring data, and frequency of atmospheric-stagnation episodes and atmospheric haze). These data were compiled into a single database to facilitate exploratory analysis of tree growth patterns and responses to local and regional environmental conditions. The database files are divided into three groups. Two of the groups (FORASTR and FORAST) contain the same tree-ring chronology information (ring-width and basal area increments); one is sorted by region, and the other by tree species. The third group (FORASTEC) is a collection of miscellaneous background data including climate, air quality, and tree and site characteristics. The database consists of 99 data files. The original 48 SAS data files are provided and require approximately 111 MB of disk space. In addition, CDIAC has created 48 ASCII files of the same data, an ASCII db1005.doc file, region file, and species file. The region and species files merge all  DB1005  63   Other Data Sets  Section D  the files in the respective subdirectory. Hard copy documentation describing the experimental protocols used and the format of the database files is available from CDIAC. Portions of the FORAST database have been incorporated into the International Tree-Ring Data Base (ITRDB), a large collection of tree-ring data archived by and available from the National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC).

Khalil and R. A. Rasmussen (contributors) This database presents continuous automated atmospheric methane (CH4) measurements taken at the atmospheric monitoring facility in Cape Meares, Oregon, by the Oregon Graduate Institute of Science and Technology. The Cape Meares data represent some 119,000 individual atmospheric methane measurements carried out during 19791992. Analysis of ambient air (collected 12 to 72 times daily) was carried out by means of an automated sampling and measurement system, using the method of gas chromatography and flame ionization detection. Despite the long course of the record and the large number of individual measurements, these data may all be linked to a single absolute calibration standard. The data are contained in three files. The largest file (2.14 MB) contains all individual atmospheric methane measurements, collected at Cape Meares over the period January 1979January 1992. A second file (189 kB) contains daily average concentrations of methane, sampling statistics, and interpolations for days when data were not taken. The last file (10 kB) contains monthly averages (derived from the individual and daily data) and statistics of dispersion, calculated by three different methods: the arithmetic mean (along with 90% confidence limits), the median (along with 5th and 95th percentile values), and a middle value (also with accompanying 90% confidence limits) based on a non-parametric statistical method.  64   Section D  Other Data Sets DB1008 (WDC-A)  Atmospheric Methane Mixing Ratios--The NOAA/CMDL Global Cooperative Air Sampling Network, 19831993 (November 1994) http://cdiac.esd.ornl.gov/ndps/db1008.html E. J. Dlugokencky, P. M. Lang, K. A. Masarie, and L. P. Steele (contributors) This database presents atmospheric methane (CH4) mixing ratios from flask air samples collected over the period 19831993 by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Climate Monitoring and Diagnostics Laboratory's (NOAA/CMDL's) global cooperative air sampling network. Air samples were collected approximately once per week at 44 fixed sites (37 of which were still active at the end of 1993). Samples were also collected at 5 degree latitude intervals along shipboard cruise tracks in the Pacific Ocean between North America and New Zealand (or Australia) and at 3 latitude intervals along cruise tracks in the South China Sea between Singapore and Hong Kong. The shipboard measurements were made approximately every 3 weeks per latitude zone by each of two ships in the Pacific Ocean and approximately once every week per latitude zone in the South China Sea. All samples were analyzed for CH4 at the NOAA/CMDL laboratory in Boulder, Colorado, by gas chromatography with flame ionization detection, and each aliquot was referenced to the NOAA/CMDL methane standard scale. In addition to providing the complete set of atmospheric CH4 measurements from flask air samples collected at the NOAA/CMDL network sites, this database also includes files which list monthly mean mixing ratios derived from the individual flask air measurements. These monthly summary data are available for 35 of the fixed sites and 21 of the shipboard sampling sites. The data for the complete set of individual measurements are contained in 85 files, ranging in size from 2.7 kB to 187 kB and totaling 2.7 MB. Two additional files contain the monthly summary data. One of these files (30.2 kB) contains all monthly mean methane values for NOAA/CMDL fixed monitoring sites. The second file (14.3 kB) contains all monthly mean methane values for NOAA/CMDL shipboard sites. An additional file (151.0 kB) contains a PostScript image showing the locations of all fixed sampling sites in the NOAA/CMDL cooperative air sampling network; also shown are the approximate sampling locations from ocean vessels participating in the shipboard sampling program. The data and accompanying descriptive material are available in electronic form only; hard copy documentation is not available.  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), Working Group 1, 1994: Modelling Results Relating Future Atmospheric CO2 Concentrations to Industrial Emissions (January 1995) http://cdiac.esd.ornl.gov/ndps/db1009.html I. G. Enting, T. M. L. Wigley, and M. Heimann (eds.) This database contains the results of various projections of the relation between future CO2 concentrations and future industrial emissions. These projections were contributed by groups from a number of countries as part of the scientific assessment for the report, ""Radiative Forcing of Climate Change"" (1994), issued by Working Group 1 of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. There were three types of calculations: (1) forward projections, calculating the 65  DB1009 (WDC-A)   Other Data Sets  Section D  atmospheric CO2 concentrations resulting from specified emissions scenarios; (2) inverse calculations, determining the emission rates that would be required to achieve stabilization of CO2 concentrations via specified pathways; (3) impulse response function calculations, required for determining Global Warming Potentials. The projections were extrapolations of global carbon cycle models from pre-industrial times (starting at 1765) to 2100 or 2200 A.D. There were two aspects to the exercise: (1) an assessment of the uncertainty due to uncertainties regarding the current carbon budget, and (2) an assessment of the uncertainties arising from differences between models. To separate these effects, a set of standard conditions was used to explore inter-model differences and then a series of sensitivity studies was used to explore the consequences of current uncertainties in the carbon cycle. The contents of this database are found in three subdirectories: ""inputs"", ""results"", and ""report"". The ""inputs"" subdirectory (11 files totaling 130 kB) contains the empirical time series data that were used as the basis of the modeling projections. These data include historical and modern measurements of atmospheric CO2 concentrations, CO2 emissions from industry and land-use changes, and 14C activities for atmospheric CO2. The ""results"" subdirectory (46 files totaling 1.02 MB) contains the projections (as time series) contributed by 10 groups of carbon cycle modelers. The categories of data in this subdirectory include (1) projected CO2 concentrations for specified emissions scenarios, (2) ocean CO2 fluxes for specified regimes of emissions or atmospheric concentrations, and (3) industrial emissions (from inverse calculations) for specified concentration time series (i.e., stabilization pathways). The ""report"" subdirectory (8 files totaling 4.45 MB) contains a set of PostScript files that constitute the report ""Future Emissions and Concentrations of Carbon Dioxide: Key Ocean/Atmosphere/Land Analyses"" (CSIRO Division of Atmospheric Research, Technical Paper No. 31). This report details the specifications for the modeling projections, the models that were used, and the results that were obtained.

A. Rasmussen (contributors) This data set presents globally averaged atmospheric concentrations of chlorofluorocarbon 11, known also as CFC-11 or F-11 (chemical name: trichlorofluoromethane; formula: CCl3F). The monthly global average data are derived from flask air samples collected at eight sites in six locations over the period August 1980July 1992. The sites are Barrow (Alaska), Cape Meares (Oregon), Cape Kumukahi and Mauna Loa (Hawaii), Cape Matatula (American Samoa), Cape Grim (Tasmania), Palmer Station, and the South Pole (Antarctica). At each collection site, monthly averages were obtained from three flask samples collected every week. In addition to the monthly global averages available for 19801992, this data set also contains annual global average data for 19751985. These annual global averages were derived from January measurements at the South Pole and in the Pacific Northwest of the United States (specifically, Washington state and the Oregon coast). The data are contained in a single 1.8 kB file and are located in the subdirectory /pub/db1010.  66   Section D  Other Data Sets DB1011 (WDC-A)  Atmospheric Carbon Monoxide Mixing Ratios NOAA Climate Monitoring and Diagnostics Laboratory Cooperative Air Sampling Network, 19881993 (October 1994) http://cdiac.esd.ornl.gov/ndps/db1011.html P.

Masarie (contributors) Individual site files provide CO mixing ratios in parts per billion (ppb) (ppb = parts in 10*9 by mole fraction) on the basis of measurements from the NOAA/CMDL Cooperative Air Sampling Network. Data are provided through June 1993 for stations at which the first sample was collected before July 1991. The report includes a list of locations from which samples of air were collected and analyzed for CO and a listing of all sites in the air sampling network used for CO measurements (as of 9/94). The latter listing, which is in the form of a table, includes the three letter code used to identify each site, the location of the site, latitude and longitude (in degrees and minutes), the altitude of the sampling location (in meters above mean sea level), the start and end dates for sampling CO, the country, and the cooperating agency. Sampling frequencies are approximately weekly for the fixed sites and average one sample every 3 weeks per latitude zone for PAW and OPC and about one sample every week per latitude for SCS. The air samples are collected by two general methods: (1) flushing and then pressurizing glass flasks with a pump or (2) opening a stopcock on an evacuated glass flask. During each sampling event a pair of flasks is filled in series. All samples were analyzed for CO at the NOAA/CMDL laboratory in Boulder by gas chromatography with mercuric oxide reduction detection, and all measurements are referenced to the CMDL CO scale.

Suchet and J.-L. Probst (contributors) The mission of the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) of Strasbourg Cedex, France, is to study ""The Global Carbon Cycle and its Perturbation by Man and Climate, the Terrestrial Biosphere."" With the support of the Environment Programme of the European Communities, modeling of the spatial distribution of atmospheric-soil CO2 consumption by chemical weathering of continental rocks has been and is being conducted. One of the major results of these studies is a set of global maps which show the distribution of CO2 consumption (FCO2) and the transport of bicarbonate (FHCO3-) from rivers to the ocean, each in moles per kilometer squared per year (mol km2/year). This database contains estimates of the net flux of atmospheric-soil CO2 (FCO2) produced by a model by Suchet and Probst and the associated bicarbonate river flux (FHCO3-). These variables are referenced to a 1 latitude by 1 longitude world grid. The grid contains 64,800 records (i.e., grid cells) originating at -180 W by -90 N and extending to 180 W by 90 N.

Bischof (contributors) This database contains estimates of the annual mean value of  13C of CO2 emissions from fossilfuel consumption and cement manufacture for 18601992. It also contains estimates of the value of  13C for 1 latitude bands for the years 1950, 1960, 1970, 1980, 1990, 1991, and 1992. These estimates of the carbon isotopic signature account for the changing mix of coal, petroleum, and natural gas being consumed and for the changing mix of petroleum from various producing areas with characteristic isotopic signatures. This time series of fossil-fuel  13C signature provides an additional constraint for balancing the sources and sinks of the global carbon cycle and complements the atmospheric  13C measurements that are used to partition the uptake of fossil carbon emissions among the ocean, atmosphere, and terrestrial biosphere reservoirs. The data are in two files ranging in size from 2.8 to 12.9 kB.

Francey, and C. E. Allison (contributors) Since 1982, a continuous program of sampling atmospheric CO2 to determine stable isotope ratios has been maintained at the Australian Baseline Air Pollution Station, Cape Grim, Tasmania (40 40'56"" S, 144,41'18"" E). This program uses a unique combination of factors with respect to obtaining a globally representative signal from a surface site: the process of in situ extraction of CO2 from air, the preponderance of samples collected in conditions of strong wind from the marine boundary layer of the Southern Ocean, and the determination of all isotope ratios relative to a common high-purity CO2 reference gas with isotopic  13C close to atmospheric values. Air samples are collected during baseline condition episodes at a frequency of around one sample per week. Baseline conditions are characterized by wind direction in the sector 190280, condensation nucleus concentration below 600/cm3, and steady continuous CO2 concentrations (variation + 0.2 ppmv/hour). Mass spectrometer analyses for  13C and  18O are carried out by CSIRO's Division of Atmospheric Research in Aspendale, usually one to three weeks following collection. This record is possibly the most accurate representation of global atmospheric 13C behavior over the last decade and may be used to partition the uptake of fossil-fuel carbon emissions between ocean and terrestrial plant reservoirs. The database consists of two files, a descriptive db1014.doc file (153 lines) and a data file (""isotope.cgo,"" 440 lines) that contains the in situ 13C and 18O ratios of atmospheric CO2 from Cape Grim for 1982 through 1993.  68   Section D Global Patterns of Carbon Dioxide Emissions from Soils on a 0.5 Degree Grid Cell Basis (March 1996) http://cdiac.esd.ornl.gov/ndps/db1015.html J. W. Raich and C. S. Potter (contributors)  Other Data Sets DB1015 (WDC-A)  Semi-mechanistic, empirically-based statistical models were used to predict the spatial (0.5 degree grid cells) and temporal (monthly and annual) patterns of global carbon emissions from terrestrial soils. Emissions include the respiration of both soil organisms and plant roots. Geographically referenced data of mean monthly air temperature and precipitation, soil organic carbon and nitrogen content, soil type and natural vegetation type were used in the model development. It was found that at the global scale the rates of soil CO 2 efflux correlate significantly with temperature and precipitation, have a pronounced seasonal pattern in most locations, and contribute to observed wintertime increases in atmospheric CO 2. The DB1015 data are the predicted CO 2 emissions of the model based on untransformed precipitation data and the exponential relationship between soil biological activity and temperature. The data at the 0.5 latitude by longitude spatial and monthly temporal resolution represents the best resolved estimate to date of global CO2 fluxes from soils and should facilitate investigations of net exchanges between the atmosphere and terrestrial biosphere. The data files ( 10 MB total) consist of 12 monthly and one annual model output files, one geographic information file and a db1015.doc file with simple FORTRAN 77 data access information.

Forest depletions (source terms for atmospheric CO2) are identified as forest pests, forest dieback, forest fires, forest harvest, and land-use changes (predominantly the conversion of forest, temperate woodland, and shrubland to cropland). Forest accruals (sink terms for atmospheric CO2) are identified as fires exclusion, fire suppression, and afforestation or crop abandonment. The changes in areal extent and gross merchantable wood volume are calculated separately for each of the following biomes: forest tundra, boreal softwoods, mixed hardwoods, temperate softwoods, temperate hardwoods, and temperate wood- and shrublands.

Curtis (contributor) A multi-parameter database was generated to aid in a statistically rigorous synthesis of research results on the response by woody plants to increased atmospheric CO2 levels. Eighty-four independent CO2-enrichment studies, covering 65 species and 35 response parameters, met the necessary criteria for inclusion in the database, reporting mean response, sample size and variance of the response (either as standard deviation or standard error). The data were retrieved from published literature and, in a few instances, from unpublished reports. The effects of environmental factors (e.g., drought, heat, ozone, ultraviolet-B radiation), and the effects of experimental conditions (e.g., duration of CO2 exposure, pot size, type of CO2 exposure facility) on plant responses to elevated CO2 levels can be explored with this database. The database consists of a 26-field data file of CO2-exposure experiment responses by woody plants, a paperreference file, a paper-comment file and SAS and FORTRAN-77 codes to read the data file.  DB1019  The Environmental Measurements Laboratory's Stratospheric Radionuclide (RANDAB) and Trace Gas (TRACDAB) Databases (October 1997) http://cdiac.esd.ornl.gov/epubs/db/db1019/db1019.html R. Leifer and N. Chan (contributors) This subdirectory contains two databases contributed by Robert Leifer and Nita Chan (Environmental Measurements Laboratory [EML]). The databases contain stratospheric radionuclide (RANDAB) and trace gas (TRACDAB) measurements.  70   Section D  Other Data Sets  RANDAB represents the worlds largest collection of stratospheric and upper tropospheric radionuclide data. The database contains results of measurements made from 1957 to 1983 during the ASHCAN, STARDUST, AIRSTREAM, and High Altitude Sampling Program (HASP) projects. More than 20,000 filters were collected during this period and analyzed for approximately 40 different radionuclides. All of the available data characterizing each filter are included in RANDAB. RANDAB offers gas samples characterizing the tritium, radon and 14CO2 concentration in stratospheric air. Only a limited amount of data is available for radon because of analytical and sampling problems. The tritium data were provided graciously by Dr. Allen Mason of the Los Alamos Laboratory and Dr. H. G. stlund of the Tritium Laboratory, University of Miami. The second database, TRACDAB, contains more than 1000 stratospheric trace gas measurements for the period 1974 to 1983. These samples were collected during Project AIRSTREAM. During the years 1974 to 1976, the samples were analyzed at EML. Subsequently, Washington State University (19761979) and the Oregon Graduate Institute for Science & Technology (formerly the Oregon Graduate Center 19801983) were under contract to EML to analyze AIRSTREAM gas samples. During the period 19741983, 980 gas samples were analyzed for one or more of the following gases CCl3F, CCl2F2, CCl4, CH3CCl3, SF6, N20, CO2, CH4, and COS.  Measurement of Air Pollution from Satellites (MAPS) 1994 Correlative Atmospheric Carbon Monoxide Mixing Ratios (December 1998) http://cdiac.esd.ornl.gov/epubs/db/db1020/db1020.html Paul Novelli and Ken Masarie (contributors) This subdirectory contains a database contributed by Paul Novelli [NOAA Climate Monitoring and Diagnostics Laboratory (CMDL), Boulder, Colorado] and Ken Masarie [Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES), University of Colorado, Boulder, Colorado]. The database offers select carbon monoxide (CO) mixing ratios from eleven field and aircraft measurement programs around the world. Carbon monoxide mixing ratios in the middle troposphere have been examined for short periods of time by using the Measurement of Air Pollution from Satellites (MAPS) instrument. MAPS measures CO from a space platform, using gas filter correlation radiometry. During the 1981 and 1984 MAPS flights, measurement validation was attempted by comparing space-based measurements of CO to those made in the middle troposphere from aircraft. Before the 1994 MAPS flights aboard the space shuttle Endeavour, a correlative measurement team was assembled to provide the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) with results of their CO field measurement programs during the April and October shuttle missions. To maximize the usefulness of these correlative data, team members agreed to participate in an intercomparison of CO measurements. The correlative data presented in this database provide an internally consistent, ground-based picture of CO in the lower atmosphere during Spring and Fall 1994. The data show the regional importance of two CO sources: fossil-fuel burning in urbanized areas and biomass burning in regions in the Southern Hemisphere.

GX011-66-0901362	Mao, J.  and alan Robock 1998: Surface air temperature simulations by AMIP general circulation models: volcanic and ENSO signals and systematic errors.   Journal of Climate,   11 , 1538–1552.  Thirty surface air temperature simulations for 1979–88 by 29 atmospheric general circulation models are analyzed and compared with the observations over land. These models were run as part of the Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP). Several simulations showed serious systematic errors, up to 4°–5°C, in globally averaged land air temperature. The 16 best simulations gave rather realistic reproductions of the mean climate and seasonal cycle of global land air temperature, with an average error of  0.9°C for the 10-yr period. The general coldness of the model simulations is consistent with previous intercomparison studies. The regional systematic errors showed very large cold biases in areas with topography and permanent ice, which implies a common deficiency in the representation of snow-ice albedo in the diverse models. The SST and sea ice specification of climatology rather than observations at high latitudes for the first three years (1979–81) caused a noticeable drift in the neighboring land air temperature simulations, compared to the rest of the years (1982–88). Unsuccessful simulation of the extreme warm (1981) and cold (1984–85) periods implies that some variations are chaotic or unpredictable, produced by internal atmospheric dynamics and not forced by global SST patterns.   Among the 16 best simulations, 8 reproduced the dominant El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) mode in the 10-yr period, which includes the 1982–83 and 1986–87 warm episodes and the 1988 cold episode. On the average, the ENSO mode explains about 30% of the total variance in surface air temperature fluctuation and has a 2-month lag from the Southern Oscillation index. In this mode, North America displays a Pacific–North American–like anomaly pattern, but Eurasia gave little response to warm SSTs in the eastern equatorial Pacific, in good agreement with results based on historical data.   The special design of the AMIP experiment provides a unique opportunity to estimate the effects of the El Chichón volcanic eruption in spring 1982, which was not included in the model forcing. Comparison of the simulations with data delineated a visible global cooling in the first months following the El Chichón eruption, in addition to the cooling from the volcanic eruption of Nyamuragira in December 1981, due to the reduction of incoming solar radiation by volcanic aerosols. However, the mean climate shift in the AMIP experiment due to the forcing data discontinuity at the end of 1981 made the quantitative estimate of El Chichón global cooling influence impossible. The contrast between the simulated ENSO signal and observations shows that the major warming over the northern continents during the 1982/83 winter (DJF) is not an ENSO-like signal. Instead it is most likely a pattern resulting from the enhanced polar vortex produced by a larger pole-to-equator temperature gradient. This gradient was due to the larger absorption of radiation in low latitudes by the El Chichón volcanic sulfate aerosols in the stratosphere. These results suggest that during the Northern Hemisphere wintertime, the stratospheric polar vortex has substantial influence on surface air temperature fluctuations through its effects on vertically propagating planetary waves of the troposphere, and imply that current GCMs are deficient in simulation of stratospheric processes and their coupling with the troposphere.
GX011-46-14337332	"March 12, 2003         The 1991 Mt. Pinatubo Eruption Provides a Natural Test for the Influence       of Arctic Circulation on Climate         A recent NASA-funded study has linked the 1991 eruption of the Mount         Pinatubo to a strengthening of a climate pattern called the Arctic Oscillation.         For two years following the volcanic eruption, the Arctic Oscillation         caused winter warming over land areas in the high and middle latitudes         of the Northern Hemisphere, despite a cooling effect from volcanic particles         that blocked sunlight.          One mission of NASA's Earth Science Enterprise, which funded this research,         is to better understand how the Earth system responds to human and naturally-induced         changes, such as large volcanic eruptions.          ""This study clarifies the effect of strong volcanic eruptions on climate,         important by itself, and helps to better predict possible weather and         short-term climate variations after strong volcanic eruptions,"" said         Georgiy Stenchikov, a researcher at Rutgers University's Department of         Environmental Sciences, New Brunswick, N.J., and lead author on a paper         that appeared in a recent issue of the Journal of Geophysical Research.          A positive phase of the Arctic Oscillation has slowly strengthened over         the few last decades and has been associated in prior research with observed         climate warming.          ""The study has important implications to climate change because it provides         a test for mechanisms of the Arctic Oscillation,"" Stenchikov said.          A positive phase of the Arctic Oscillation is associated with strengthening         of winds circulating counterclockwise around the North Pole north of         55°N, that is, roughly in line with Moscow, Belfast, and Ketchikan, Alaska.         In winter these winds pull more warm air from oceans to continents causing         winter warming, and like a top spinning very fast, they hold a tight         pattern over the North Pole and keep frigid air from moving south.          According to this research, temperature changes caused by a radiative         effect of volcanic aerosols in two lower layers of the atmosphere, the         troposphere and the stratosphere, can lead to a positive Arctic Oscillation         phase. The troposphere extends from Earth's surface to an altitude of         7 miles in the polar regions and expands to 13 miles in the tropics.         The stratosphere is the next layer up with the top at an altitude of         about 30 miles.          The study uses a general circulation model developed at the National         Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory         to simulate how volcanic aerosols following the Pinatubo eruption impacted         the climate.          In the troposphere, volcanic aerosols reflect solar radiation and cool         the Earth's surface, decreasing temperature differences between the equator         and the North Pole in the bottom atmospheric layer. These changes end         up inhibiting processes that slow counterclockwise winds that blow around         the North Pole mostly in the stratosphere. This in turn strengthens a         positive phase of the Arctic Oscillation.          In the stratosphere, volcanic aerosols absorb solar radiation, warm         the lower stratosphere (about 15 miles above the Earth's surface) and         increase stratospheric temperature differences between the equator and         the North Pole. These changes strengthen westerly winds in the lower         stratosphere and help to create a positive phase of the Arctic Oscillation.          In previous research, an observed positive Arctic Oscillation trend         has been attributed to greenhouse warming that led to an increase of         stratospheric temperature differences between equator and pole. But this         study finds that tropospheric temperature change in the course of climate         warming may play an even greater role.          In one type of computer simulation, Stenchikov and colleagues isolated         the contribution of a decreased temperature difference in the troposphere,         and found that it could produce a positive phase of the Arctic Oscillation         by itself. That's because greenhouse heating near the North Pole melts         reflective sea ice and snow, and reveals more water and land surfaces.         These surfaces absorb the Sun's rays and increasingly warm the Earth's         polar regions. Polar heating at the Earth's surface lessens the temperature         differences between the equator and North Pole in the troposphere, which         ultimately strengthens a positive phase of the Arctic Oscillation.          The study also finds that when aerosols get into the stratosphere, very         rapid reactions that destroy ozone (especially in high latitudes) take         place on the surfaces of aerosol particles. When ozone gets depleted,         less UV radiation is absorbed in the stratosphere. This cools the polar         stratosphere, and increases the stratospheric equator-to-pole temperature         difference, creating a positive phase of the Arctic Oscillation. Ozone         data were obtained from NASA's Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS)         satellite and ozonesonde observations.         ###        Contacts:           Krishna Ramanujan     Goddard Space Flight Center,     Greenbelt, Md.

Pinatubo in Philippines in June 1991, inject millions of ton of sulfur         dioxide gas at the altitudes of about 15 miles where it interacts with         water vapor producing a volcanic aerosol layer that consists of tiny         droplets of highly concentrated sulfuric acid.          As a result of the Pinatubo eruption, globally averaged         surface temperature decreased by about 0.3 Kelvin (0.3 Celsius) for two         years after the eruption and the temperature in the tropical lower stratosphere         increased by about 2-3 Kelvin (2-3 Celsius). The tropospheric response         over most land areas in the Northern Hemisphere is characterized by summer         cooling and winter warming. Credit: U.S. Geological Survey, J.N.

GX035-81-1573678	"Top Weather and Climate Stories of 1998      January 6, 1999    D. Le Comte, Climate Prediction Center   Information compiled by Climate Prediction Center, Tropical Prediction Center, and National Climatic Data Center             United States       Summary       O  The United States was warm and wet in 1998. Preliminary data indicate 1998 was in a virtual tie with 1934 as the warmest year since detailed records began in 1895. This was also the fifth wettest year on record. Heat was persistent and widespread during the year, with the country observing its 2nd warmest winter on record, 28th warmest spring, 9th warmest summer, and 2nd warmest autumn. Among the contiguous 48 states, only California was cooler than normal, due in part to an abnormally cool spring. The number five ranking for wetness was all the more remarkable given the severe spring-summer drought in the South. The drought, which is believed to have cost over $6 billion, followed the El Niño-related stormy winter on the West Coast and the Southeast, which caused well over $1.5 billion in damages. The seven tropical storms and hurricanes that struck the country may have cost the United States as much as $6.5 billion, but helped to relieve drought in the South. Though the abnormal weather contributed to a 28% drop in the nation's cotton crop and 21% drop in the orange crop compared with 1997, adequate rainfall and lack of sustained heat in the Corn Belt resulted in record soybean production and the second greatest corn output. Aided by El Niño-enhanced rains, the nation harvested its largest wheat crop since 1990.                Highlights       O   El Niño-related winter storms swept across California from December 1997 to March 1998, triggering floods, high winds, mudslides, and heavy mountain snows. Damage to property and crops totaled over $550 mil. and fatalities numbered 17. Most of the damage came from fierce storms in February, mainly during the first 10 days of the month. California winter (December-February) precipitation totaled 200 to 400% of normal, making this the state's seventh wettest winter in the past 103 years. February precipitation totals exceeded 15 inches in several locations, with the L.A. Civic Center's 13.68 inches breaking a February record that had stood since 1884. The Sierra Nevada amassed as much as 197 inches of snow during February, including 5 feet from one storm alone on February 2-4. March snow depths in the Sierra Nevada exceeded 20 feet. The heavy snow pack enhanced the state's water supplies.       O   One of the worst ice storms on record struck upstate New York and northern New England during January 5-9, causing extensive damage to trees and powerlines. A 1- to 3-inch coating of ice left as many as 500,000 utility customers without power and made road travel nearly impossible. In Maine, four out of five residents lost electrical service. Overall damages approached $400 million, and 16 deaths were blamed on the storm. This was the worst ice storm to hit the country since February, 1994, when a Southeastern storm caused billions of dollars in damage.        O   El Niño-related storms, floods, and tornadoes during winter-spring 1998 caused over $1 billion in damage and 132 deaths in the Southeast. Florida, where winter rainfall (Dec-Feb) averaged 19 inches or 220% of normal, recorded both its wettest winter and wettest November-March ever. Severe thunderstorms on February 2-3 featured 90-mph-plus wind gusts in the Miami area of Florida, leaving 220,000 utility customers without power. Florida also endured its deadliest tornado outbreak on record when storms on the night of February 22 killed 41people in the Kissimmee area and destroyed 800 residences.        O   The second mildest winter in 103 years (Dec-Feb) of record saved consumers billions of dollars in heating costs while urban areas saved funds on snow-removal costs. Winter temperatures averaged more than 10F above normal over the North-Central states and more than 5F above normal from the Midwest through the Northeast.        O   Spring and summer heat and drought across the South from Texas/Oklahoma eastward to the Carolinas caused over $6 billion in damages and costs and at least 200 deaths. April-June was the driest such period in 104 years of record in Florida, Texas, Louisiana, and New Mexico. May-June was the warmest such period on record in Florida, Texas, Louisiana, and Arkansas. Wildfires in Florida from late May to early July consumed nearly 500,000 acres of land and destroyed 356 structures, resulting in over $270 million in damages. Wildfires in Texas burned 143,000 acres in May-June, while the severe drought caused more than $2 billion in damage to agriculture, according to state officials. Wildfires across the southern U.S. burned 1.3 million acres during 1998, four times the acreage burned in 1997.        O   A wet, stormy spring with numerous severe weather outbreaks broke rainfall records in the Midwest and Northeast and damaged crops in California. The West had its wettest May-June ever, and April-June was the wettest such period since at least 1895 in Rhode Island and Massachusetts, the third wettest in Tennessee, and the fourth wettest in Iowa. Severe storms were rampant in spring, with a tornado outbreak taking 34 lives in Alabama on April 8. On May 30, a tornado destroyed Spencer, South Dakota, and claimed 6 lives. On June 7, a squall line packing 100-mph winds mowed down thousands of trees in southeast Minnesota and western Wisconsin. The nation recorded 330 tornadoes (but only 3 deaths) in June, about 150 more than average. Although severe weather diminished after June, the preliminary national death toll during 1998 reached 129, about twice the number recorded in 1997 and three times the average.        O   El Niño-related drought in Hawaii from autumn of 1997 to May 1998 resulted in water restrictions in several areas and diminished reservoir supplies. As of mid-June, Honolulu had measured only 1.76 inches of rain since January 1, just 16% of normal.       O   Three hurricanes and four tropical storms hit the U.S. this year-more than twice the average--causing an estimated $6.5 billion in damage. Hurricane Bonnie struck the North Carolina coast on August 26, killing three, cutting off power to nearly a half-million people, and causing an estimated $720 million in direct damage (non-agricultural). Earl hit the Florida Panhandle on September 3, costing an estimated $79 million. Hurricane Georges may have caused over $3 billion in losses on Puerto Rico during September 21-22, damaging or destroying more than 170,000 homes before crossing Hispaniola and the Florida Keys and coming ashore near Biloxi, Mississippi on September 27. Up to 20 inches of rain deluged Puerto Rico as well as northwest Florida and southeastern Alabama. Hurricane Mitch, which caused over 9,000 deaths in Central America, crossed southern Florida as a tropical storm on November 4-5, bringing tornadoes, heavy rains, and flooding.        O   Heavy rains from Tropical Storms Charley and Frances, along with several other weather systems, inundated eastern and southern Texas from August to November, ending drought over much of the state but causing severe flooding. Charley, which dropped a record 17.03 inches of rain on Del Rio during August 23, triggered flooding that took nine lives in Texas. Frances made landfall on September 11, bringing a 5-foot storm surge and over 2 feet of rain to coastal Texas. Another weather system brought over a foot of rain to southeast Texas on October 17-18, causing major flooding and at least 29 deaths. Raging floodwaters swept away or destroyed dozens of homes. Damage estimates reached $400 million. San Antonio tallied 18.07 inches of rain in October, its wettest month ever, including 11.26 inches on the 17th, its wettest day ever. Even more record rains hit south Texas in mid-November, with Victoria's 8.44 inches on November 12-14 setting three consecutive daily records.        O   One of the most intense mid-latitude November storms ever observed crossed the Great Plains on the 10th, setting all-time low pressure readings in Iowa and Minnesota.  The ""super storm"" brought 90-mph wind gusts to Wisconsin, over a foot of snow to the northern Plains, and 20-foot waves to Lake Michigan.       O   Summer-autumn drought from the mid-Atlantic to Tennessee Valley damaged crops, increased wildfire risk, and threatened water supplies. July-November rainfall was the lowest since 1930 in Washington, D.C. and Baltimore, Maryland. Drought decimated crops in Maryland for the second consecutive year. Maryland, Tennessee, and Virginia posted their second, third, and fourth driest autumns in 104 years of record, respectively.       O   Flooding drove thousands of residents to shelters after 10 inches of rain swamped south-central Kansas during October 30-November 1. A massive frontal system crossing the country just days later inundated Kansas City, Missouri with heavy rains, causing floods that took 12 lives.        O   An unprecedented autumn ""heat wave"" from mid-November to early December broke or tied some 700 daily-high temperature records from the Rockies to the East Coast. The unseasonable warmth set over 70 monthly temperature records in the first 8 days of December alone, as temperatures rose to 20 to 30F or more above normal. Readings hit the 70s as far north as South Dakota and Maine. Washington, D.C. set an all-time December record on December 7 with a balmy 79F, the third monthly record set in 1 week. There and elsewhere, confused flowers started to blossom and trees bud.               O   A series of Pacific storms slammed into the Northwest during November and early December, hurling 100-mph winds at the coast, knocking roofs off of buildings and cutting power to thousands of people. Heavy rains triggered floods in Washington and Oregon. Seattle, Washington set a November record with 11.62 inches of rain.                  Global       O   One of the two strongest El Niño's of the century suddenly ended during spring--followed by La Niña. During the first half of the year, the El Niño contributed to heat and drought across Mexico and Central America, floods in Ecuador, Peru, Argentina, and Paraguay, drought in northeast Brazil, and drought in Southeast Asia. The ending of El Niño allowed an abnormally active tropical storm season to develop in the Atlantic basin, with 14 named storms versus an average of 9. The La Niña contributed to abnormally heavy rains during the last half of the year in Australia and Indonesia.        O   Assisted by the waning influence of El Niño, global surface temperatures in 1998 were the highest since surface observations began more than a century ago. This continued an upward trend in observed surface temperatures that fueled debate on the role of societal impacts on climate.            O   Hurricane Mitch, the fourth strongest storm ever recorded in the Atlantic basin, triggered massive flooding and landslides in Central America during late October that killed over 9,000 people, displaced another 2.4 million, and damaged or destroyed over 130,000 homes. Mitch may have been the deadliest Atlantic basin storm since 1780. The storm dropped over 2 feet (600 mm) of rain on northern Honduras, decimating the country's infrastructure. Mitch likely caused over $5 billion in damages to agriculture, buildings, and infrastructure in Honduras and Nicaragua alone, the two countries most affected. Guatemala and El Salvador also sustained major impacts from the storm, the most powerful October hurricane on record.        O   Hurricane Georges devastated the northern Caribbean in late September, dumping up to 20 inches of rain, killing at least 500 people--mainly in the Dominican Republic--and causing billions of dollars in damage. Georges' heavy rains, high winds, and flooding damaged 85% of the houses on St. Kitts and Nevis, leaving nearly 10% of the population homeless, and costing $400 million in insured property losses. Georges left at least 100,000 people homeless in the Dominican Republic, but other estimates placed the number of homeless at 400,000 and those displaced at 865,000. Hundreds and perhaps thousands died in the Dominican Republic, where the storm destroyed 90% of all plantation crops. Damage to the power system alone totaled more than $1 billion, and estimated damage to the Dominican Republic's agriculture reached $260 million. Haiti reported 147 deaths and agricultural losses of $179 million. In Cuba, thousands of homes were lost and 200,000 people were evacuated.        O   Summer floods in China killed over 3,000 people, as heavy rains inundated the south, the Yangtze River Valley, and the northeast. The floods left 14 million people homeless and may have caused $36 billion in damages. During June-July, locations near the Yangtze reported more than 30 inches (750 mm) of rain, with isolated amounts exceeding 50 inches (1,270 mm).        O   Torrential rains struck South Korea twice within the first week of August, causing catastrophic flooding first in the south and then in the Seoul metropolitan area. The floods left at least 234 dead and 212,000 homeless, causing over $300 million in property damage. Monthly rainfall in Seoul totaled a phenomenal 49.25 inches (1,251 mm), 40.43 inches (1,027 mm) above normal.       O   Heavy monsoon rains from June to August caused flooding in India and Bangladesh that took over 2,800 lives. Another 250 died in Nepal. In Bangladesh, three major floods occurred during July and August, leaving about 50% of the country under water for periods of up to 67 days at depths up to 10 feet (3 meters). In India, heavy monsoon rains in July and August flooded 12 states in the north, affecting over 23 million people and leaving up to 8 million homeless. Though Bangladesh suffered significant crop losses, food crop production in India declined only about 2% from the record levels set the year before.       O   A May-June heat wave in India and Pakistan reportedly killed 2,500 people as temperatures soared to 122F (50C) and above.       O   Periodic stifling heat affected the Middle East and Mediterranean region from June into September. Hot, dry weather helped to spread wildfires from Italy eastward to Lebanon and sent hundreds of people to hospitals. During the week ending July 4, temperatures averaged up to 14F (8C) above normal in the Mediterranean region, with highs reaching 104 to 113F (40-45C) in parts of Greece and southern Italy. Wildfires reportedly destroyed thousands of acres of forest around Athens, Greece.        O   Drought contributed to a rash of wildfires that burned more than 1.25 mil. acres (500,000 hectares) in Mexico and Central America from January to June. Smoke from the fires cast a pall over much of the region and spread northward into the United States.             O   Abnormal warmth and dryness in Brazil encouraged the spread of thousands of wildfires during 1998. Three large areas experienced fire outbreaks during the year: the northern Amazon region of Brazil, where February-March rainfall totaled less than 50% of normal; northeast Brazil, which was abnormally dry during the first half of the year; and southwestern Brazil (and northeastern Bolivia) from June through September. By September 1, one huge fire in the central Brazilian region of Mato Grosso had burned more than 3,200 square kilometers of pastures and forests. Numerous fires were still burning in the northeast at the end of the year. During June through August, the country reportedly experienced 30% more fires than during the same period one year earlier.        O   El Niño-related floods and landslides in Peru and Ecuador caused over $3 billion dollars in damage from November 1997 to May 1998. February rainfall alone totaled over 28 inches (700 mm) along Peru's northwest coast.  The town of Tumbes, in northwest Peru measured over 82 inches (2,100 mm) from December to May, or more than 10 times normal.  In Ecuador, flooding and landslides killed at least 251 people and cost about $2 billion in damage. Crop production declined by as much as 75% from the previous year's levels. In Peru, storms left 234,000 homeless, destroyed or damaged at least 50,000 homes, and killed over 300 people. Damage costs reached $1.5 billion.        O   Floods from heavy rains in Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay displaced over 170,000 people from December 1997 to May 1998. April rainfall alone in southern Paraguay and northeast Argentina totaled 16 inches (400 mm). The Parana River inundated vast areas of Paraguay in May, killing 55 and forcing approximately 75,000 from their homes. Damage estimates ranged into the billions of dollars. Heavy rains in April caused major flooding in northeastern Argentina, forcing the evacuation of 85,000 people. Floodwaters reportedly covered 23,000 square miles (60,000 square km). Damage estimates from the heavy rains and flooding exceeded $2 billion in Argentina. Uruguay and southern Brazil also sustained flooding, with over 10,000 people in Uruguay forced to flee their homes.        O   Canada's worst ice storm in modern times left over 1 million households without power and caused over $1 billion in economic losses during January 5-9. Quebec endured most of the damage from the storm, which left some homes without power for an entire month.        O   El Niño-related drought contributed to fires, crop losses, and food shortages in Southeast Asia from January to May. Fires in Indonesia this year burned 7.5 million acres (3 million hectares). This was in addition to the 12 million acres (5 million hectares) burned during the drought in 1997. Fire pollution costs in Southeast Asia resulting from the drought in 1997 have been estimated at $1.3 billion. Damage and costs from the 1998 fires should be less but also considerable.        O   Severe spring flooding in northern Siberia in Russia forced over 51,000 residents from their homes. Rivers began overflowing in mid-May and reached their highest levels in 70 years in the following weeks. A sudden rise in temperature and a rapid snow melt caused huge ice jams to build up, bringing unprecedented flooding to the Lena River and its tributaries in the northeastern Republic of Sakha.        O   Heat and dryness across a large part of Asia from June to August cut crop production and aided the spread of wildfires. Insufficient moisture contributed to Russia's cereal crop production dropping 42% from the previous year. Ukraine production fell 20% and Kazakhstan lost 40%. Numerous wildfires spread across eastern Siberia, including Sakhalin island, from May to October. Before rain quenched most of the fires in mid-October, over 1,300 fires had burned about 5 million acres (2 million hectares). Smoke from the fires, which affected over 1 million people, travelled all the way to Canada. The Russian Far East lost about 15 million cubic meters of timber, or about three times its annual production.       O   Torrential rains in September caused floods and landslides that cut off 400,000 people in Mexico's Chiapas state. Over 16 inches (400 mm) of rain fell in 1 week.       O   Major flooding in Sudan during September reportedly affected 300,000 people. A delayed start to the rainy season in the south aggravated crop losses in a region already suffering from famine. In May, a premature end to the seasonal rains in Somalia worsened food shortages resulting from armed conflict and the El Niño-related flooding late in 1997. Flooding hit a number of countries in the Sahel this summer, but the ample rainfall produced favorable harvests, with Chad, Niger, and Mali collecting record crops.        O   Typhoons Zeb and Babs crossed the northern Philippines in October, causing over 200 deaths. Supertyphoon Zeb left as much as 24 inches (600 mm) of rain in the northern Philippines on October 13-14 before striking Taiwan and Japan. The storm reportedly took 74 lives in the Philippines, 31 in Taiwan, and 12 in Japan. Only 8 days later, Supertyphoon Babs crossed the Philippines, submerging parts of Manila, taking 132 lives, and forcing more than 320,000 people from their homes.        O   An Arabian Sea tropical cyclone struck northwest India on June 9, taking over 900 lives.        O   In Vietnam, five tropical storms caused destruction from mid-November to mid-December. A trio of tropical cyclones (Chip, Dawn, and Elvis) caused heavy rains and flooding in Vietnam during a 2-week period in November, killing at least 267 people, destroying over 9,000 houses, and damaging 470,000 more. Reported losses were $48 million. Still a fourth tropical storm, Faith, struck the central Vietnamese coast on December 13 in the same area hit by the first three storms, and Tropical Storm Gil caused severe damage in the Mekong Delta on December 11.       O   Severe cold and snowstorms from mid-November to early December spread across Russia and Europe, contributing to 180 deaths. In Moscow, temperatures from November 10 to December 1 averaged just 10F (-12C), or 18F (10C) below normal. On December 1, readings dipped to -10F (-24C). At the same time the frigid air mass stretched across the Eurasian continent, record heat was covering much of the North American continent on the other side of the world.        O   Canada recorded its warmest year since records began in 1948 with the temperature 2.4C above normal, based on data through November. Six of 11 months set new temperature records and another two were second warmest. All 11 months were warmer than normal. It was also the ninth driest year. Lack of moisture and the record-breaking temperatures resulted in extreme fire severity. The 1998 fire season ended with approximately 10,600 fires consuming a total of 11.4 million acres (4.6 million hectares) of forested land. The number of acres burned was about 60% greater than average, making this the fifth worst year on record."
GX009-82-1270034	"Globally-Averaged Atmospheric Temperatures         The  figure above shows the monthly temperature deviations from a seasonally adjusted average for the lower stratosphere - Earth's atmosphere from 14 to 22 km (9 to 14 miles). Red is an increase in the temperature from the average, and blue is a decrease in temperature. The large increase in 1982 was caused by the volcanic eruption of  El Chichon , and the increase in 1991 was caused by the eruption of  Mt. Pinatubo  in the Philippines. September 1996 was the coldest month on record for stratospheric temperature.         This chart shows the monthly temperature changes for the lower troposphere - Earth's atmosphere from the surface to 8 km, or 5 miles up. The temperature in this region is more strongly influenced by oceanic activity, particularly the  ""El Niño"" and ""La Niña""  phenomena, which originate as changes in oceanic and atmospheric circulations in the tropical Pacific Ocean. Like the upper plot, the overall trend in the data is downward, about 0.06 degrees C per decade. Click on the charts to get the numerical data.    Surface thermometer measurements indicate that the temperature of the Earth is warming, while the satellite data show long-term cooling trends.

Stenchikov,2 Alan Robock2 The sensitivity of Earth's climate to an external radiative forcing depends critically on the response of water vapor. We use the global cooling and drying of the atmosphere that was observed after the eruption of Mount Pinatubo to test model predictions of the climate feedback from water vapor. Here, we first highlight the success of the model in reproducing the observed drying after the volcanic eruption. Then, by comparing model simulations with and without water vapor feedback, we demonstrate the importance of the atmospheric drying in amplifying the temperature change and show that, without the strong positive feedback from water vapor, the model is unable to reproduce the observed cooling. These results provide quantitative evidence of the reliability of water vapor feedback in current climate models, which is crucial to their use for global warming projections. Water vapor plays a key role in regulating Earth's climate. It is the dominant greenhouse gas (1) and provides the largest known feedback mechanism for amplifying climate change (2). Because the equilibrium vapor pressure of water increases rapidly with temperature, it is generally believed that the concentration of water vapor will rise as the atmosphere warms. If so, the added radiative absorption from water vapor will act to further amplify the initial warming. Current cli1 Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory/National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ 08542, USA. 2Department of Environmental Sciences, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ 08901, USA.  *To whom correspondence should be addressed. Email: bjs@gfdl.gov  mate models suggest that this provides an important positive feedback, roughly doubling the sensitivity of the surface temperature to an increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gases (35). If the actual feedback by water vapor is substantially weaker than predicted by current models, both the magnitude of warming and range of uncertainty resulting from a doubling of CO2 would be substantially diminished (5). Despite the importance of water vapor feedback in determining the sensitivity of Earth's climate, the fidelity of its representation in climate models has remained a topic of debate for more than a decade (6, 7 ). The difficulty in verifying models partly stems from the lack of observed climate variations that can provide quantitative tests of the feedbacks in question. Assessments of water va-  por feedback are often based on regional, seasonal, or interannual variations of Earth's climate (812), which differ markedly in both cause and character from the more uniform, radiatively forced perturbations that result from increasing CO2. Thus, their conclusions are often qualitative, and their relevance to feedbacks that arise from global warming are often questioned (6, 1315). It has long been recognized that volcanic eruptions provide a valuable opportunity to observe the climate system's response, albeit a transient one, to the presence of an external radiative forcing (1619). Strong volcanic eruptions inject large amounts of sulfuric gas into the lower stratosphere where it combines with water and oxygen to form small, yet optically important, aerosol particles. Winds rapidly disperse the particles throughout the lower stratosphere, resulting in a near-global perturbation to the radiative energy balance. Because they are more effective at scattering sunlight than absorbing longwave terrestrial radiation, the net radiative effect of volcanic aerosols is to cool the planet. The eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines in June of 1991 resulted in unprecedented observations of both radiative forcing from volcanic aerosols as well as the climate system's response to this forcing. Satellite observations confirm the decrease in solar heating due to Mount Pinatubo aerosols (2022), which led to a global cooling of the lower troposphere (23, 24 ). Associated with this cooling was a reduction in the global water vapor concentrations, which closely tracked the decrease in temperature (25). Thus, Mount Pinatubo provides a unique opportunity to not only study the sensitivity of the climate system but, more importantly, to also assess the response of water vapor and quantify its role in determining that sensitivity. It is widely recognized that current climate models possess a strong positive feedback by water vapor (35, 26 ). Nevertheless, one can  www.sciencemag.org SCIENCE VOL 296 26 APRIL 2002  727   REPORTS construct a model with a substantially weakened water vapor feedback by artificially removing the longwave (LW) (terrestrial) component of the feedback loop (27 ). Studies have shown that when water vapor feedback is removed in this fashion, the variability of the model is suppressed at all time scales, not just the longer (decadal to century) time scales associated with global warming. As we show, this enables us to evaluate model simulations with vastly differing strengths of water vapor feedback against observations of the actual climate system's response to the transient perturbation from Mount Pinatubo. The model used here is an atmospheric general circulation model (GCM) with specified clouds coupled to a mixed-layer ocean with prescribed horizontal heat transports (26, 28). Three pairs of model integrations are performed, each starting in January of 1991 (5 months before the eruption) and lasting 5 years. Each experiment pair consists of a ""control"" simulation, in which no aerosols are used, and a ""Mount Pinatubo"" simulation, in which the model is perturbed using the observed zonalmean distribution of Mount Pinatubo aerosols (26, 29). Because the transient response of the model depends on both its sensitivity and the external radiative forcing imposed on it, we first demonstrate the consistency between the modelsimulated radiative forcing with that measured by satellites (Fig. 1). Both the observations and model simulations yield very similar reductions in the absorbed solar or shortwave (SW) radiation (30), which are nearly twice as large as the reduction in emitted LW radiation, a net loss of radiative energy that cools the surface and lower troposphere. The magnitude of this cooling is documented by satellite measurements of lower tropospheric temperature from the microwave sounding unit (MSU) (31). The MSU data indicate a peak global cooling of 0.5 K nearly 18 months after the eruption, after which the temperature slowly returns to pre-Pinatubo levels (Fig. 2, top). In all three members of the ensemble, both the magnitude and duration of the model-predicted cooling agrees remarkably well with that measured by the MSU, confirming the model's ability to accurately reproduce the observed cooling (32). Other sources of climate variability, most notably the El NinoSouthern Oscillation ~ (ENSO), are not included in these model simulations but do influence the observed global temperature record. Indeed, the actual climate system was experiencing an extended El Nino during much of the early 1990s. ~ However, because the observed anomalies are expressed relative to the pre-eruption value (24 ), and because this El Nino began ~ before the eruption and was unusually persistent in nature, its impact on the global temperature anomalies from 1991 to 1995 is small. As evidence of this, Fig. 2 also shows the observed anomalies after being adjusted to remove the effects of ENSO (33). Removing ENSO slightly increases the peak cooling during mid-1992 and reduces the sharp drop in temperature at the end of 1995, both of which bring the observations and model simulations into better agreement. How does the water vapor field respond to the radiatively forced cooling? The model-predicted anomalies in total column water vapor (Fig. 2, middle) indicate a distinct drying of the global atmosphere that agrees well with observations from the NASA Water Vapor Project (NVAP) (25). Both indicate a peak reduction in global water vapor of 0.75 mm ( 3%), which coincides with the period of maximum cooling ( 0.5 K). The rate of global-mean drying ( 6%/K) agrees with the rate at which the saturation vapor pressure decreases with temperature in the lower troposphere, implying a nearly constant relative humidity change in water vapor mass. Such behavior at the global scale is a widely recognized characteristic of climate models (35, 7, 8).  Fig. 1. Comparison of the observed anomalies in absorbed SW (top) and emitted LW (bottom) radiative fluxes at the top of the atmosphere from Earth Radiation Budget Satellite observations (black) and three ensembles of GCM simulations (red). The observed anomalies are expressed relative to a 1984 to 1990 base climatology, and the linear trend is removed (30). The results are expressed relative to the pre-eruption ( January to May 1991) value of the anomaly and smoothed with a 7-month running mean (thick line). The GCM anomalies are computed as the difference between the control and Mount Pinatubo simulations for each ensemble member. Both the model and observed global averages are from 60N-60S due to the restriction of observed data to these latitudes.  Fig. 2. Comparison of the observed (solid line) and model-predicted (dashed line) global-mean (90N90S) changes in lower tropospheric temperature (top), total column water vapor (middle), and upper tropospheric (300 to 500 hPa) water vapor (bottom) after the eruption of Mount Pinatubo. The observed anomalies are computed using a 1979 to 1990 base climatology and expressed relative to the pre-eruption value, defined here as the mean anomaly for January 1991 to May 1991. The model anomalies are computed for each ensemble pair as the difference between the control and Mount Pinatubo experiments. All time series have been smoothed using a 7-month running mean.  728  26 APRIL 2002 VOL 296 SCIENCE www.sciencemag.org   REPORTS Because the concentration of water vapor mass decreases roughly exponentially with height, changes in the total column water vapor are dominated by the response of water vapor in the lower troposphere. Yet, water vapor in the upper troposphere has a disproportionately large effect on the outgoing LW radiation (34) and, consequently, on climate sensitivity (5). Therefore, we also examine the response of the upper tropospheric water vapor between 300 and 500 hPa. Because retrievals of upper tropospheric water vapor are less reliable than those for the total column, we include both NVAP (25) and TIROS ( Television Infrared Observation Satellite) Operational Vertical Sounder ( TOVS) products (26, 35) in our comparison (Fig. 2, bottom). Both sets of observations indicate a drying of the upper troposphere after the Mount Pinatubo eruption, although TOVS suggests a somewhat larger drying than does NVAP. The model simulations show similar reductions during the first half of the record, where the cooling is greatest. After mid-1993, the NVAP anomalies rapidly return to pre-eruption levels, whereas the model simulations and the TOVS retrievals show a more gradual return. However, given the difficulty in retrieving such small concentrations of water vapor, it is unclear whether this discrepancy reflects a deficiency in the model or in the inversion algorithms used by NVAP. This uncertainty can be avoided by comparing the model simulations directly with the satellite-observed radiances, thereby eliminating errors associated with the retrieval process (36). Figure 3 compares the satellite-observed equivalent blackbody temperatures at 6.7 m (T6.7) from the TOVS instrument (37) with those computed offline from the model's temperature and moisture profiles (38). Under clear skies, the 6.7- m channel is primarily sensitive to changes in relative humidity averaged over a deep layer of the upper troposphere (roughly 200 to 500 hPa) (39 ). Thus, if the water vapor mass in the upper troposphere decreases by conserving relative humidity as the atmosphere cools, only a small perturbation to T6.7 would be expected. Figure 3 confirms that both the observations and model simulations yield only a modest reduction in T6.7. In fact, the model-simulated anomalies are nearly identical to those obtained if one repeats the calculation of T6.7 under the assumption of a constant relative humidity change in the model's water vapor field [shown as a green curve in Fig. 3 (40)]. In contrast, consider the anomalies in T6.7 that would result if there was no decrease in water vapor mass in the model's upper troposphere [shown as a red curve in Fig. 3 (41 )]. In this case, the T6.7 would decrease by 0.8 K, more than twice what was observed, due to a reduction in Planck emission (cooling) without a compensating reduction in atmospheric opacity (drying). Thus, without a nearly constant-relative-humidity drying of the upper troposphere, the model would be unable to reproduce the observed record of T6.7. The above simulations show that the model atmosphere dries in response to the radiatively induced cooling in agreement with the observations. But to what extent does this drying amplify the cooling? To answer this question, we repeat our experiments using a configuration of the model in which water vapor feedback has been artificially suppressed by removing the LW component of the feedback loop (26, 42). Once again, three pairs of integrations are performed, where each pair consists of a control simulation and a Mount Pinatubo simulation using the same aerosol forcing as before. Figure 4 compares the Mount Pinatubo  induced cooling from both the ""standard"" (i.e., with water vapor feedback) and ""no water vapor feedback"" configurations of the model. In contrast to the standard model, the model without water vapor feedback is unable to reproduce the observed cooling. Over the period of June 1991 to December 1995, the standard model predicts an average global cooling of 0.31 K, which compares favorably with the observed cooling of 0.30 K [0.33 0.03K, with ENSO signal removed (43)]. Without water vapor feedback, the modelpredicted cooling is only 0.19 K. Thus, feedback from water vapor amplifies the magnitude of global cooling by 60%, which is in good agreement with the amplification predicted by climate models in response to a doubling of CO2 (3) and with that derived from idealized calculations using a constant relative humidity approximation (5). To reproduce the observed temperature record after the eruption of Mount Pinatubo, the model requires a strong positive feedback, equivalent in magnitude to that predicted for water vapor. Although it is possible that other processes, such as clouds, could act in place of water vapor to provide the strong positive feedback necessary to amplify the cooling, the observational evidence clearly indicates a reduction in water vapor that is consistent with the model predictions. This study highlights the role of water vapor feedback in amplifying the global cooling after the eruption of Mount Pinatubo. We note, however, that Mount Pinatubo does not provide a perfect proxy for global warming, because the nature of the external radiative forcing obviously differs between the two. Nevertheless, the results described here provide key evidence of the reliability of water vapor feedback predicted by current climate models in response to a global perturbation in the radiative energy balance. Given the importance of water vapor feedback in determining climate sensitivity, such confirmation is essential to the use of these models for global warming projections. 1. J. Kiehl, K.

The atmospheric model is a global spectral model with rhomboidal truncation at 30 wave numbers and 14 vertical levels. Details regarding the model's numerical formulation and physical parameterizations may be found in (26). The thickness of the ocean mixed-layer varies regionally and is specified according to its observed annual-mean climatology (S. Levitus, NOAA Prof. Paper 13, 1982). G. Stenchikov et al., J. Geophys. Res. 103, 13837 (1998). Beginning in 1994, additional anomalies in the satellite-observations of top-of-atmosphere absorbed solar radiation become evident, which are unrelated to the Mount Pinatubo eruption and therefore not reproduced in the model simulations. These anomalies are believed to stem from decadal-scale changes in the tropical circulation over the mid- to late 1990's [see J. Chen et al., Science 295, 838 (2002); and B. A. Wielicki et al., Science 295, 841 (2002], but their veracity remains the subject of debate. If real, their absence in the model simulations implies that discrepancies between the observed and model-simulated temperature anomalies, delayed 1 to 2 years by the climate system's thermal inertia, may occur by the mid-1990s. We therefore limit our analysis to the 5-year period 19911995, where the observations and model simulations are responding to similar changes in radiative forcing and encompass virtually all of the observed climate response to Pinatubo.

The ""GCM-predicted"" T6.7 was computed offline by inserting the GCM profiles of temperature, water vapor mixing ratio, and Mount Pinatubo aerosols into a narrow band radiative transfer model (46). These results were then subtracted from the T6.7 computed using the control simulations of temperature and water vapor mixing ratio, and the difference was plotted in Fig. 3. 39. Because, the T6.7 depends on both Planck emission (temperature) and atmospheric opacity (water vapor mass), variations in T6.7 cannot be unambiguously related to changes in water vapor mass, but rather are largely determined by changes in relative humidity (47, 48). 40. The ""constant rh"" T6.7 was calculated as in (38), but replacing the model-predicted water vapor mixing ratio with that obtained by fixing the relative humidity to its seasonally varying climatological value. Thus as the atmosphere cools, the mixing ratio used to compute the T6.7 decreases at a constant relative humidity rate. 41. The ""no drying"" T6.7 was calculated as in (38), but replacing the model-predicted water vapor mixing ratio with its seasonally varying climatological value. Thus, as the atmosphere cools, the mixing ratio used to compute the T6.7 remains unchanged. 42. We follow the same procedure as Hall and Manabe 43.

The time-average, global-mean cooling for the three versions of their data are 0.29 K (Nin 3 ~o index). 0.32 K (Nino 3.4 index), and 0.36 K (SOI index). ~ Because our results are insensitive to which version is used, for clarity, we have plotted only the intermediate of the three versions (Nino 3,4 index) in Figs. 2 and 4. ~ B.

The North Atlantic Spring Phytoplankton Bloom and Sverdrup's Critical Depth Hypothesis D. A. Siegel,1* S. C. Doney,2 J. A. Yoder3 More than 50 years ago, Harald Sverdrup developed a simple model for the necessary conditions leading to the spring bloom of phytoplankton. Although this model has been used extensively across a variety of aquatic ecosystems, its application requires knowledge of community compensation irradiance (IC), the light level where photosynthetic and ecosystem community loss processes balance. However, reported IC values have varied by an order of magnitude. Here, IC estimates are determined using satellite and hydrographic data sets consistent with the assumptions in Sverdrup's 1953 critical depth hypothesis. Retrieved values of IC are approximately uniform throughout much of the North Atlantic with a mean value of 1.3 mol photons meter 2 day 1. These community-based IC determinations are roughly twice typical values found for phytoplankton alone indicating that phytoplankton account for approximately one-half of community ecosystem losses. This work also suggests that important aspects of heterotrophic community dynamics can be assessed using satellite observations. The spring bloom of phytoplankton in the North Atlantic Ocean has long fascinated oceanographers from the 1930s to 1950s (1 3) to the present day, where large interdisciplinary field experiments have been conducted to assess its role in the global carbon cycle 1 Institute for Computational Earth System Science and Department of Geography, University of California Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 3060, USA. 2National Center for Atmospheric Research, 1850 Table Mesa Drive, Boulder, CO 80305, USA. 3 Graduate School of Oceanography, University of Rhode Island, Narragansett, RI 028821197, USA.  29. 30.  31. 32.  33. 34. 35. 36. 37.  *To whom correspondence should be addressed.

When viewed from space, the North Atlantic spring bloom is among the largest mass greenings observed on the Earth surface extending over scales of more than 2000 km (57 ). The North Atlantic spring bloom propagates to the north at speeds of the order of 20 km day 1 as can be clearly seen in time series observations of chlorophyll pigment concentration (Chl) made from spaceborne sensors (8).

In       response to these, as well as other long-term climate concerns, NOAA has established       routine monitoring programs utilizing both ground-based and satellite measurement       techniques (OFCM, 1988).                Selected indicators of stratospheric climate are presented in each Summary from       information contributed by NOAA personnel.

For 2001, the area covered by  extremely low total ozone values of less than 220 Dobson Units, defined as the Antarctic “ozone hole”,  was the third largest on record for October and November.  The ozone hole reached maximum size in September  and remained large through early October, then gradually decreased in size and ended in early December.   October anomalies of greater than  40 percent below the 1979-1986 base period were observed over Antarctica,  with negative anomalies of more than 10 percent also observed over southern South America.  Vertical  profiles of ozone amounts measured by balloons over the South Pole at the end of September and early  October 2001 showed essentially total destruction of ozone in the 15-20 km region, similar to observations  during other recent years. The minimum total ozone value of 101 Dobson Units, observed on October 4, 2001 at  the South Pole, was not as low as the record low value of 86 DU observed in 1993.  Lower stratosphere  temperatures over the Antarctic region in 2001 were again  low.  Temperatures below -78 C ( sufficiently low  for polar stratospheric cloud formation) occurred over a large region, thus promoting chemical  ozone loss.   At northern mid-latitudes, extensive ozone destruction was observed in the years following the massive  eruption of the Pinatubo volcano (approximately 1992-1996), with smaller losses observed in the past few years.   Uncertainties in the estimates of future ozone depletion include possible coupling to changes in water vapor  and carbon dioxide.  However, in the absence of further major eruptions, ozone depletion over much of the  globe is not expected to worsen substantially in the coming decade, because international actions have been  successful in reducing the release of ozone-depleting substances.          I.  DATA RESOURCES                  The data used for this report are listed below. This combination of complementary data,       from different platforms and sensors, provides a strong capability to monitor global ozone       and temperature.                  Method of Observation                                        Parameter               Ground-Based             Satellite/Instrument                                   Total Ozone             Dobson             NOAA/ SBUV/2                                                          Nimbus-7/SBUV                                  Ozone Profiles             Balloon-Ozonesonde              NOAA/ SBUV/2                                                          Nimbus-7/SBUV                                 Temperature Profiles             Balloon - Radiosonde             NOAA/TOVS                                         We have used total column ozone data from the NASA Nimbus-7  SBUV instrument from 1979 through February1985; NOAA-9 SBUV/2  from March 1985 to December 1989; NOAA-11 SBUV/2 from January 1989 to December 1993; NOAA-9 SBUV/2  from January 1994 to December 1995; NOAA-14 SBUV/2 from January 1996 to June 1998; NOAA-11 SBUV/2 from July 1998 to September 2000; and NOAA-16 SBUV/2 from October 2000.  Solar Backscatter Ultra-Violet (SBUV) instruments can produce data only for daylight-viewing conditions, so SBUV/2 data are not available at polar latitudes during winter darkness.  Increasing loss of NOAA-11 data at sub-polar latitudes from 1989 to1993 was caused by satellite precession, resulting in SBUV/2 viewing high latitudes only in darkness.  Recent NOAA-11 and NOAA-16 total ozone data have not yet been fully validated.  This impacts trends determined for the recent period.         II.  DISCUSSION             Figure 1  displays monthly average anomaly values (percent) of  zonal mean total ozone, as a function of latitude and time, from January 1979 to November 2001.  The anomalies are derived relative to each month's 1979-2001 average. Certain aspects of  long-term global ozone changes may be readily seen.  In the polar regions, ozone values have been substantially lower in the 1990s than in the 1980s.  Largest anomalies are shown for the polar regions in each hemisphere in winter-spring months, with positive anomalies of more than 10 percent in the earlier years changing to negative anomalies of greater than 10 percent for most recent years.  In September 2001, around 75 degrees south latitude, negative anomalies exceeded 26 percent (more than 52 percent lower than in earlier years), and were about 20 percent lower than average in October and November 2001.  At  midlatitudes, the anomalies also change from largely positive in the early years to negative in the 1990s.  Little or no significant trend is seen over the tropical region, but alternating years of positive and negative anomalies are seen, as part of a quasi-biennial oscillation.  At the end of  2001, positive anomalies were evident in the tropical region.       A map of monthly average  Southern Hemisphere SBUV/2 total ozone for October 2001 is  shown in  Figure 2 , with lowest ozone values displaced from the pole.   ""Ozone hole"" values  (defined as total ozone values less than 220) are shown over the South Atlantic sector of the Antarctic continent, with highest ozone over the Antarctic sector near the international dateline.   Figure 3  shows the difference in percent between the monthly mean total ozone for October 2001 and eight (1979-86) monthly means for October (Nagatani et al., 1988).  Negative anomalies in total ozone of up to 40 percent are shown over the South Atlantic sector of the Antarctic continent, and more than 10  percent below average values are also evident over southern South America.       Figure 4  compares for each year since 1979 the ozone hole area average for all days in October through November.   The growth in the ozone hole area  from the 1980s to the 1990s is quite apparent.  From a very small area in 1982, October-November average values increased dramatically to a maximum in 1998 of 16.2 million square kilometers. The October-November 2001 average ozone hole area value was 15.9 million square kilometers, much larger than the ozone hole area in 2000, and only a little smaller than the two previous  years.  September data for all years were not included for this calculation because SBUV/2 data over the South Polar region were not available in early September for years 1992, 1993, and 1995.      The center of the ozone hole, and associated lowest ozone, is often located close to the South Pole.   Figure 5  shows a time series during 2001 of ozone profiles  over the South Pole, measured using balloon-borne ozone instruments.  The appearance of anomalously low  ozone hole values is seen to begin in mid August, with extremely low values evident at the end of September  and in early October.  The  ozone destruction, especially in the 15 to 20 km region, is dramatic.    Figure 6  illustrates the change in ozone profiles measured  at the South Pole.  On 4 October 2001, 101 DU total column ozone amount was observed, the minimum value  for the year 2001.  This is compared with the profile on 8 July, with total ozone amount of 271 DU.  The decrease in total ozone between these two dates is 62 percent.  The 4 October profile shows nearly  complete destruction of ozone between 14 and 20 km.  The figure also shows the  region where temperatures  on 4 October were lower than -78 C.  In the region of low temperatures and chemical ozone depletion from  enhanced human produced chlorine and bromine, the 4 October profile shows markedly less ozone than the profile of 8 July.  This clearly demonstrates the value of vertical profile information in helping to understand the ozone depletion phenomenon and the processes responsible for changes in the total column amounts.         Figure 7  presents a time series at the South Pole of total column ozone, integrated from balloon-borne ozone measurements.  Minimum ozone amounts at the South Pole Station in 2001 are seen at the end of September and in early October.    Total ozone values were not as low during September as values for this time period for 2000, but values remained very low longer in 2001 than in 2000.  The extremely low total ozone values in early September likely reflected ozone depleted air which had previously been exposed to sunlight prior to moving over the South Pole.      Antarctic ozone depletion has occurred primarily between the altitudes of 12 and 20 km.  This is a region where polar stratospheric clouds form.   Figure 8  shows 12-20 km column ozone integrated from the balloon-borne ozone measurements at the South Pole. In 2001 the values were generally as low as in any previous year.  Large depletion rates are expected for the next decade or more, after which declining stratospheric chlorine amounts should result in slow recovery of stratospheric ozone.         Ozone amounts in the lower stratosphere are closely coupled to temperatures through dynamics and photochemistry.  Extremely low stratospheric temperatures (lower than -78 C) over the Antarctic region are believed to contribute to depletion of ozone, in that  low temperatures lead to the presence of polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs).  PSCs enhance the production and lifetime of reactive chlorine, leading to ozone depletion  (WMO, 1999).  Daily minimum temperatures over the polar region, 65S to 90S at 50 hPa (approximately 19 km) are shown in  Figure 9 .    For most of the southern hemisphere winter 2001, minimum temperatures in the polar region were low, but not near record low values.  However, minimum temperatures in late September, October and November were near record lows.  Minimum temperatures were sufficiently low (lower than -78 C) during May to November for polar stratospheric clouds to form and allow enhanced ozone depletion, in the presence of sunlight.   Figure 10  shows monthly average temperature anomalies at 50 hPa for three latitude regions, 25N-25S, 25S-65S, and 65S-90S.  For the polar region, temperatures for  October and November were 3 to 4 C  lower than the long-term average.  Negative temperature anomalies also predominated over the middle and tropical latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere.        Figure 11  presents time series of the area of the ozone hole, the size of the polar vortex, and the size of the polar area where lower stratosphere temperatures were below -78C.  The 2001 values are shown along with the average daily values and the maximum and minimum daily values for the most recent 10 years.  During 2001 the area for all three of these indicators was larger than average.  Indeed the ozone hole area and the polar vortex area were among the largest of recent years.      Figure 12  illustrates the direct relationship between the persistence of the ozone hole region and the persistence of the Antarctic polar vortex.  In years when the winter polar vortex persisted later in the season, the duration into the Spring season of the ozone hole also tended to be extended.  For the year 2001, the persistence of the ozone hole and the persistence of the Southern Hemisphere polar vortex were among the greatest for the years since 1982.  Indeed, 5 out of the most recent 7 years have had the longest duration of winter vortex and ozone hole.                            III.  CONCLUDING REMARKS           Very low ozone values were observed over Antarctica again in 2001.   Ozone depletion of 10 percent to more than 40 percent was observed over Antarctica compared to total ozone amounts observed in the early 1980's.  Vertical soundings over the South Pole during late September and early October 2001 again showed complete destruction of ozone at altitudes between 15 and 20 km.  Lower stratosphere temperatures in the winter and spring of 2001 over the Antarctic region were below average values, and were sufficiently low for ozone production of polar stratospheric clouds within the polar vortex.   The ozone hole area and the PSC area were again among the largest of all previous years.   For the year 2001, the ozone hole and Southern Hemisphere polar vortex persisted into December,  again among the longest duration of years since 1982.       Observations of chloroflourocarbons and of stratospheric hydrogen chloride support the view that international actions are reducing the use and release of ozone depleting substances (WMO, 1999; Anderson et al., 2000).  However, chemicals already in the atmosphere are expected to continue to deplete ozone for many decades to come.  Further, changing atmospheric conditions that modulate ozone can complicate the task of detecting the start of ozone layer recovery.  The eruption of the Pinatubo volcano provided an example of such a complication in the 1990s.  Based on an analysis of 10 years of South Pole ozone vertical profile measurements, Hofmann et al., (1997) estimated that recovery in the Antarctic ozone hole may be detected as early as the coming decade.  Indicators include: 1) an end to springtime ozone depletion at 22-24 km, 2) 12-20 km mid-September column ozone loss rate of less than 3 DU per day, and 3) a 12-20 km ozone column of more than 70 DU on September 15.  However, an intriguing aspect of recent observations of the Antarctic stratosphere is the apparent trend towards a later breakup of the vortex, as shown in Figure 12.  A full explanation of such meteorological anomalies is not yet available.  Continued monitoring and measurements, including total ozone and its vertical profile, are essential to achieving the understanding needed to identify ozone recovery.

GX262-52-0029233	"Vol. 4 No. 4  December, 1999  THE NORTHLAND SKY WATCHER For National Weather Service weather watchers of northeastern Minnesota and northwestern Wisconsin  A Look at a Century's Major Weather Stories for the Northland  I  t's been said, ""If you don't like our weather, just wait a few minutes; it'll change"", and a look at the century's major weather stories seems to make that statement more true. Our weather ranges from severe drought to severe flooding and unbearably hot to record-setting cold. Here is a look at a few of the most memorable weather events to hit the Northland in the 20th Century. Maybe you remember some of these.  Mataafa Storm, November 27-28, 1905 This N'oreaster, named for the ship that it beached in the Duluth Harbor, had severe gales of 42 mph that were sustained for 29 straight hours and 65 mph for 13 continuous hours, according to H. W. Richardson, meteorologist for the U.S. Weather Bureau at the time. The storm dumped 7 inches of snow and the strong winds created considerable drifting. A huge drop in temperature occurred as the storm passed and winds switched from northeast to north. The temperature dropped from 31E at noon on November 27th to -10E by midnight that night. The Mataafa was beached on the afternoon of the 27th and later broke in two. By the time Coast Guard rescue crews arrived, the ship was covered in frozen spray. While nine crew members perished, fourteen were saved. Nine other ships were either stranded or wrecked in the storm.  Drought, Summer of `18 The worst weather-related disaster to strike Minnesota this century was neither tornado, flood, nor blizzard. The warm and excessively dry Summer of 1918 set the stage for what was to be referred to as a hurricane of fire- the forest and brush fires that struck northeastern Minnesota on October12th. Much of the region saw very little rain that summer and into early fall. In fact, Duluth recorded it's 3rd driest summer with only 4.39 inches of rain for June, July, and August. The morning of October 12 in 1918 dawned clear and unusually warm for residents of northeastern Minnesota. Gusty west winds of 20 to 30 mph started to develop and temperatures rose into the middle and upper 70's. Sparks from passing railroad trains ignited the In This Issue: tinder dry brush and vegetation along the tracks.

New Names and Faces 4 Ask the Experts 5 See ""Northland Weather"", next page Y2K Ready 5   2 THE NORTHLAND SKY WATCHER  December, 1999  ""Northland Weather"", continued By the time the fires had burned themselves out, 1500 square miles were blackened, ten northeastern Minnesota towns were totally destroyed, 453 people were killed, and 85 people were seriously burned. Cities that were destroyed included Cloquet, Kettle River, and Moose Lake. The city of Duluth sustained heavy damage. Large sections of Carlton, Pine and St. Louis counties were burned with serious damage to Aitkin, Itasca, Cass, Crow Wing, and Wadena counties.  Minnesota North Woods Tornado Outbreak, August 6, 1969 On August 6, 1969 a major tornado outbreak occurred in northern Minnesota that left 15 dead and 106 injured. The first tornado touched down in Cass County, west of Pine River and moved to near Backus. At 3:48 pm the largest tornado of the outbreak set down near Stewart Lake in the far northwestern corner of Crow Wing County and moved northeast, passing north of Outing and lifted south of Hill City. Eleven deaths occurred on the shores of Roosevelt Lake near Outing in Cass County and one person died at Reservoir Lake, between Outing and Hill City. Forty children staying at a camp on Roosevelt Lake were injured. Many farms and cabins were destroyed by this massive tornado. It was on the ground for 33 miles and was 800 yards wide. From 4:25 pm and 5:50 pm more tornadoes moved across Aitkin, St. Louis and Lake counties. One person was killed near Jacobson in Aitkin County and 2 deaths occurred as a tornado moved from near Boulder Lake in St. Louis County to near Two Harbors. The twisters caused a total damage of $4.8 million.  Blizzard of January 10 - 12 1975 This storm was billed as Minnesota's ""Storm of the Century"". For three days, January 10-12, snow, rain, and freezing rain fell and winds gusted from 45 to 80 mph. Eight inches of snow fell in Duluth and there were many periods of rain, freezing rain, and sleet. 23.5 inches of snow fell at International Falls. The snow and wind were accompanied by falling temperatures. Duluth's high temperature dropped from 33E on the 11th to -3E on the 12th. Wisconsin stayed on the warm side of the low, but received plenty of rain and the strong winds. The Danbury station measured a record 24-hour rainfall of 1.20"".  Halloween Snow Storm, October 31 - November 2, 1991 A major early-season snowstorm struck northeastern Minnesota and northwestern Wisconsin from late on Halloween, 1991 into the early morning of November 2. The storm dumped 15 to 36 inches of snow, with the highest totals falling along the Wisconsin-Minnesota border. Snowfall rates occasionally ranged from 1 to 2 inches an hour. Strong northwest winds created 6 to 10 foot drifts. The storm closed schools, businesses, and transportation systems- some for several days. Continued on next page   3 THE NORTHLAND SKY WATCHER  December, 1999  Record Cold, January 31 - February 4, 1996 An Arctic outbreak brought record-setting cold to the Northland in 1996. From the period January 31 to February 4, 1996 daytime high temperatures were in the teens and 20s below zero and lows ranged from the -30's to the -50's. The coldest temperature ever in Minnesota was recorded at Tower (-60E) the morning of February 2. (This is also the coldest temperature ever recorded east of the Mississippi River.) A new cold temperature record was also established in Wisconsin when the temperature dipped to -55E in Couderay on February 2 and 4. The temperature finally rose above zero in Minnesota on February 4, when highs reached the single digits above zero. Wisconsinites had to wait one more day for their warm-up.

The table below lists in Hurley, Wisconsin during the winter of `96/`97- enough to set a new state seasonal snowfall is 277.7 inches.

One of the main factors was La Nia. La Nia is a cooling of the equatorial Pacific from the South American coast to near the international dateline. This year, La Nia is expected to maintain itself through early spring. Sea surfaces temperatures in the South Pacific are -.5EC to -1.5EC. What this means for us this winter, according to the NWS's Climate Prediction Center, is that the Northland will have near normal temperatures with above normal precipitation. The past November had near-record dryness and December so far is very dry and warm. But, we are just Typical January-March weather anomalies and atmospheric circulations during starting our climatological winter, so don't pack away those snow shovels and moderate to strong La Nia episodes.

Reports can be called or transmitted to the NWS anytime on Monday, but definitely no later than 10 am Tuesday. Snow depth water equivalents are a crucial part in forecasting the spring snowmelt flood potential of rivers. A special thank you to everyone who participates in this program. Anyone who is interested in taking snow core measurements should contact the NWS.  I heard on the news the other night that November was the second warmest on record. Are these unusually warm November temperatures the result of global warming? As you mentioned, November was unusually warm. Whether this particular temperature anomaly is a direct result of ""global warming"", however, is not clear. The science of climate change is complex. Scientists in this field are quite certain that carbon dioxide (and other greenhouse gases) concentrations are on the rise. These greenhouse gases do absorb and re-emit longwave radiation which would lead to more energy being held in the lowest levels of the atmosphere. Researchers recently discovered that the average temperature across the earth's surface has increased on the order of 0.6 to 1.2E F since the late 19th century which would seem to be indicative of global warming. What's unclear, however, is whether this rise might be a function of some natural climate change. Also at issue is the accuracy of the climate data. Considerable noise has been introduced to the climate record through moving sites from one location to another, through changes in observing systems, and from the timing of observations. In addition, a certain amount of year-to-year variability is normal. For instance, in contrast to this year's warmth, some of Duluth's coldest Novembers were recorded in the recent past. In fact, the fourth and fifth coldest November's occurred in 1995 and 1996. So, in answer to your question, the jury is issue of global warming, though research One thing that is certain, however, is that warm month does not adequately define a still out on the continues. one unusually trend.

Baron Editor Mary Ann Burke  We are privileged to have another article on the Automated Mutualassistance Vessel Rescue (AMVER) program, with several dramatic accounts of rescues at sea. In one notable incident, a fishing vessel, the SEA LION, adrift without engine power in the North Pacific during August 1998, began taking on water. In heavy seas, all ten crew members abandoned ship into a lifeboat. U.S. Coast Guard rescue coordinators located the AMVER vessel SOLAR WING a few miles away, and a boat-to-boat transfer was soon completed without loss of life. We encourage all mariners to participate in the AMVER program. Now in its 40th year, AMVER has 12,000 participating ships from 143 nations. Over the last five years alone, AMVER has rescued over 1,500 people, most of whom would have perished were it not for this extraordinary program. It's very easy to join AMVER. Simply complete an SAR Questionnaire (SAR-Q), available by fax from the AMVER Maritime Relations Office. You then provide AMVER with your sail plan before leaving port and update your position once every 48 hours while underway. Should you require assistance at sea, alert the nearest rescue coordination center in one of several ways, including INMARSAT, Radiotelex, EPIRB, or the distress button on your satellite or DSC terminal. For Voluntary Observing Ships, the special AMVER/SEAS software is now available to simplify preparation of weather and AMVER messages. When COMSAT receives weather messages formatted by this software, your vessel call sign and position is forwarded to the AMVER center (eliminating the need to send a separate AMVER position update), while the weather message goes to the National Weather Service. There is no cost to vessels using AMVER/SEAS software. A Y2K compliant version of the AMVER/SEAS software is now available (AMVER/SEAS version 4.51), and vessels are encouraged to obtain free copies. You can download this software from the web at http://seas.nos.noaa.gov/seas.html. For more information about AMVER, contact Mr. Rick Kenney, U.S. Coast Guard Maritime Relations Officer. For more information about the AMVER/SEAS software, contact Mr. Steve Cook, SEAS Program Manager. Both are listed in the back of this publication. Port Meteorological Officers and SEAS Field Representatives can also provide information about these valuable programs. By the time this issue is in print, Mariners Weather Log readers with complimentary subscriptions will have received questionnaires through the mail. This is to update our mailing list. Please fill out and return the questionnaire promptly, no later than May 30, 1999. Martin S.

Environmental phenomena such as strong winds, high waves, storm surge, restrictions to visibility, and thunderstorms can be hazardous to these ships while in these ports, or maneuvering in or out of port. Because the U.S. Navy recognized this as a serious concern to Navy ship captains, the Marine Meteorology Division of the Naval Research Laboratory, Monterey, California, was asked to evaluate the severe weather suitability of numerous ports and document the results. The resulting analyses provide decision-making guidance for ship captains as well as environmental information for operational forecasters. Well over a hundred port evaluations have been completed and disseminated.  This article will describe the development strategy for these port studies, provide insight into the details of the presentation of the information, and discuss the future direction and enhancements.  ship captains. A number of ""local"" wind events, including the Mistral, Bora, Levante, etc., are characterized by rapid onset and cessation and greatly varying spatial variations. These winds can cause an unprepared ship captain to drag anchor or part mooring lines. For over 20 years, the Naval Research Laboratory Marine Meteorology Division (formerly Naval Environmental Prediction Research Facility and Naval Oceanographic and Atmospheric Research Laboratory) has been developing severe weather port guidance for the U.S. Navy. The guidance research efforts can be categorized as follows: 1) Tropical Cyclone Haven Studies 2) Mediterranean Severe Weather Port Studies Continued on Page 5  1. Introduction U.S. Navy ship captains operating throughout the globe often find themselves in new port locations, with experience providing the cornerstone of operational safety, whether in peacetime or in time of conflict. Severe weather decision making can be extremely challenging for these ship captains. For example, when faced with an approaching tropical cyclone, a timely decision regarding the necessity and method of evasion must be reached. In complex regions such as the Mediterranean, the wind systems that are produced challenge the most skilled  4 Mariner s Weather Log   Naval Research Laborator y Por t Evaluation Continued from Page 4 3) Regional Severe Weather Guide Development The purpose of this article is to describe the development strategy for each of the above categories, provide insight into the details of the presentation of the information in hard copy and electronic form, and discuss future enhancements and requirements.  1993). Figures 1 and 2 provide locator maps for the two regions and identify ports evaluated. The port evaluations themselves were based on extensive data collection efforts and discussions with local port and meteorological officials. The format for each of the port studies included the following: 1) A brief description of the port location and surrounding topography. 2) A brief description of the harbor and facilities. 3) Tropical cyclone climatological information for the port. 4) Effects of storm surge and wave action within the harbor. 5) Effects of topography on tropical cyclone winds and seas. 6) Evasion rationale, including discussion of pertinent factors to consider in making a decision to remain in port or try to evade a tropical cyclone at sea. 7) General conclusions concerning the harbor as a tropical cyclone haven. As the typhoon and hurricane haven studies were completed, they were distributed to all U.S. Navy ships and shore locations in the Pacific and Atlantic areas.  of the irregular coastline and numerous islands in the Mediterranean, swell can be refracted around barriers and come from directions which vary greatly from those of the wind and wind waves. Anchored ships may experience winds and seas from one direction and swell from a different direction. This can be extremely hazardous for close maneuvering, tending of vessels, refueling, and small boating operations. During the past decade, the U.S. Navy identified 55 ports of interest in the Mediterranean region to be evaluated with respect to severe weather suitability. The following approach was used to develop the individual studies: 1) A literature search for reference material was performed. 2) Navy cruise reports were reviewed, if available. 3) Navy personnel with current or previous area experience were interviewed. 4) A preliminary report, which included questions on various local conditions, was developed. 5) Port visits were made by U.S. Navy and/or their representatives who gathered information through interviews with local harbor pilots, harbor masters, tug masters, meteorologists, etc. Local reference material was also obtained. 6) The cumulative information was reviewed, combined, and condensed for each port study.  2. Tropical Cyclone Haven Studies Tropical cyclones are among the most destructive weather phenomena a ship captain may encounter, whether the ship be in port or at sea. The dilemma to the ship captain is as follows: Should the ship remain in port, evade at sea, or if at sea, should the ship seek the shelter of a nearby port? In general, it is an oversimplification to label a harbor as merely good or bad. Consequently, enough information has to be conveyed for the ship commanding officer to reach a sound decision. The decision often is not based on weather conditions alone because the characteristics of the harbor and the ship itself must also be considered (Brand, 1978). The Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) Marine Meteorology Division has developed tropical cyclone ""havens"" handbooks for the western Pacific/Indian Ocean region (Brand, 1996) and the Atlantic Ocean region (Turpin and Brand, 1982; Perryman et al,  3. Mediterranean Severe Weather Por t Studies The complex land and sea distributions in and around the Mediterranean have a strong influence on the synoptic and mesoscale weather affecting many port and harbor areas.

The first section summarized harbor conditions and was intended for use as a quick reference guide by ship captains, navigators, harbor officials, or other in-port or at-sea personnel. This section contained the following: 1) A brief narrative summary of severe weather hazards. 2) A table display of vessel location/situations, potential No. Port 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 GAETA, ITALY NAPLES, ITALY CATANIA, ITALY AUGUSTA BAY, ITALY CAGLIARI, ITALY LA MADDALENA, ITALY MARSEILLE, FRANCE TOULON, FRANCE VILLEFRANCHE, FRANCE MALAGA, SPAIN NICE, FRANCE CANNES, FRANCE MONACO ASHDOD, ISRAEL HAIFA, ISRAEL BARCELONA, SPAIN PALMA, SPAIN IBIZA, SPAIN POLLENSA BAY, SPAIN LIVORNO, ITALY LA SPEZIA, ITALY VENICE, ITALY TRIESTE, ITALY CARTAGENA, SPAIN VALENCIA, SPAIN SAN REMO, ITALY GENOA, ITALY PORTO TORRES, ITALY  severe weather hazards, advance indicators of the hazards, and effects of hazards and precautionary/ evasion actions. 3) Local wind and wave conditions. 4) Tables depicting wave conditions at selected harbor locations resulting from propagation of deep-water swell into the harbor. The second section of the port study contained additional details and background information on hazardous conditions as a function of season. This section was designed to serve personnel who had a need for additional insights  on severe weather hazards and related weather events, and was intended more for use by operational weather forecasters. The 55 port evaluations were developed during the eight-year period 1988-1995. As they were completed, they were distributed to all U.S. Navy ships and shore locations in the Atlantic and Mediterranean regions in hard copy form. Because of interest in a compilation of the port studies as a ready-reference guide, the evaluations were condensed and disseminated as one handbook (Brand, 1997). In addition, to satisfy the demand for presentations via electronic media, the 55 port studies were also disseminated in CD-ROM form as well (U.S. Navy, 1995).

Regional Severe Weather Guide Development A good example of a regional severe weather guide is the Puget Sound area port guide (Gilmore et al., 1996). The guide was developed in response to a Navy request to evaluate the severe weather in a region where there were many Navy assets concentrated in one general location. Its prime purpose was to aid ship captains and other Navy officials in evaluating adverse weather situations and assist them in making decisions whether to move to a better anchorage, move to another port in the Puget Sound area, or to remain in a specific harbor. Continued on Page 9  Table 1. Mediterranean ports evaluated by study number and port name. 8 Mariner s Weather Log   Naval Research Laborator y Por t Evaluation Continued from Page 8 Puget Sound is located in an area of complex topography. Strong southerly winds are common over Puget Sound during late autumn, winter and early spring. The most severe weather conditions are associated with fronts and low pressure systems approaching from the Pacific. The effects of strong winds across the Puget Sound region varies greatly from one location to another. Wind conditions that may adversely affect one area of the Sound may have little or no effect on another. Many of the sites evaluated in the  guide are located adjacent to significant topographic features that either shield the port area from strong winds or enhance the wind flow at that location. Figure 4 shows the locations in Puget Sound of interest to the U.S. Navy that were evaluated in the severe weather guide. The guide presented the following information for each of the port locations shown in Figure 4: 1) A brief description of port location and surrounding topography. 2) A brief description of the harbor and facilities.  3) A description of normal and extreme weather conditions at the port. 4) A description of indicators of hazardous weather conditions. 5) A description of protective/ mitigating measures that can be taken. In addition to the above, the guide provided a description of general environmental conditions in the Puget Sound area, a discussion of the weather patterns by season, a presentation of extreme weather events, and a section describing sources of weather forecasts and warnings.

Future Direction Navy decision makers ashore and afloat are requesting that all of the documents discussed above be placed into electronic format. The electronic implementation could be flexible and allow for both Web and CD-ROM customer demand. Another future enhancement could be the capability to provide ship captains a simulated entry or exit view, in animated form, of the harbor region under a wide variety of conditions, such as day versus night, restricted visibility, etc. This would be extremely useful as a training tool for ship captains not familiar with local reference points or hazards. The CD-ROM is an ideal vehicle for this kind of simulated training or rehearsal, particularly for U.S. Navy ship captains who continuously find themselves in unfamiliar port situations. Requests for documents discussed in this article should be made in letter form to Naval Research Laboratory, Attn: Sam Brand, 7 Grace Hopper Avenue, Monterey, CA 93943-5502. For electronic examples of the Typhoon Havens Handbook and Hurricane Havens Handbook, refer to http://www. cnmoc.navy.mil. The requirement for new or updates of port evaluations is continuous and will ensure severe weather port studies for many years to come. For example, the Navy recently requested 147 ports be evaluated in the European  region. Many will be updates of previous studies, but most were new due to the ever-changing political scene in the European area. Navy ships are visiting many eastern European countries that they never thought they would be visiting a few years ago. In these new locations, the vulnerability to severe weather is still very real and significant.  0028, 126 pp. [Available from the Naval Research Laboratory, 7 Grace Hopper Avenue, Monterey, CA 93943.] Brand, S.

For days the winds howled, building mountainous seas and hurling all forms of blinding precipitation. From November 7-11, 1913, the upper Great Lakes offered no safety for ship or sailor. Most avoided confrontation with the elements and waited in port. Others, caught by the wintry blast, found no place to hide. The casualty toll was enormous, with 251 lives lost, 12 ships sunk, and many others damaged. Among those lost with all hands was the ARGUS. The ship ARGUS was built by the American Shipbuilding Co. and launched at Lorain, Ohio, on August 5, 1903. The 436 foot long freighter, originally known as the LEWIS WOODRUFF, went to work for the Gilchrist Transportation Company. The steam powered carrier could haul about 7000 tons of cargo per trip and usually brought iron ore or grain down the lakes and returned upbound with coal. Gilchrist transportation experienced hard times and when their fleet was disbanded, several vessels joined the Interlake Steamship Company. In 1913  LEWIS WOODRUFF was among the latter and sailed as the ARGUS. ARGUS departed November 7, 1913, from Buffalo with a load of coal and got as far as Lake Huron. There, on November 9-10, it went down with all hands. Reports from the nearby GEORGE G. CRAWFORD indicated the snow stopped falling long enough to watch the demise. Apparently, ARGUS got caught in the trough and could not pull out. The hull ""crumpled like an egg shell"" and sank.  A total of 24 sailors perished. The ship was valued at $136,000 (U.S. dollars in 1913).  Note: Skip Gillham is the author of 18 books, most related to Great Lakes ships and shipping. ""Seaway Era Shipwrecks,"" released in 1994, tells the story of 100 ship accidents from the opening of the St. Lawrence Seaway in 1959. Copies are available from the author for a fee.h  The ARGUS sank November 9-10, 1913, on Lake Huron. Twentyfour sailors perished. Photo courtesy of Milwaukee Public Library.

Her stories have appeared in Weatherwise, Mariner 's Weather Log, the Navy's ""Fathom"" magazine, The American Weather Observer, and the Weather Watcher Review. [Editors Note: This is a look back to 1992 (August 22-25), when the National Hurricane Center withstood the forces of Hurricane Andrew. The article was written in November 1992.] ore than one hundred people stood silent, eyes wide open in sudden fright, as the crash shook the National Hurricane Center (NHC), which was located on the sixth floor of the IRE Building (Gables One Tower) in Coral Gables, Florida. On the roof above the 12th floor, the white dome that 12 Mariners Weather Log  M  enclosed the radar unit shattered in the winds of Hurricane Andrew, shaking the entire building, sending the now-exposed radar unit crashing to the roof. ""Hearts stopped for a second and everyone's eyes got real big,"" remembers Joel Cline, a meteorologist at the NHC who worked in the Tropical Satellite Analysis and Forecasting Unit, all the while thinking to himself, ""It sounded like the radar fell off the roof!"" The silence that descended on the crowd of media, photographers, weather specialists, and their family members was broken by the lone figure who walked out of the radar room. ""I lost the scope"" he said, with a look of disbelief. ""Somewhere about 4:45 to 4:50 am or so, all the systems blew away,"" according to the National Hurricane Center 's Director, Dr. Robert Sheets. ""The instrumentation blew away, the radome itself shattered  and blew away. Even before that, we lost our satellite antennas; they were destroyed by the wind. The radar antenna itself was blown off of something like a little penthouse that sits on our roof. It's about fifteen feet above the normal roof level. So when it blew off, it fell onto the roof. It weighs a couple of tons and shook the whole building. Everybody sort of looked. I knew what it was and what had happened just based on the weight and the thud that took place. We didn't know how much damage that it may have caused on the roof, but fortunately, it did not cause any structural damage itself. The building was shaking from the wind anyway, sort of swaying a little bit."" The NHC and Miami's National Weather Service (NWS) shared the sixth floor of the IRE Building, Continued on Page 13   Hurricane Andrew1992 Hurricane Andrew Continued from Page 12 which was the only floor in the building with hurricane shutters. ""We had encapsulated ourselves with the exterior shutters we have for our floor,"" said Sheets. ""They were all closed early Sunday evening before the winds ever started to pick up. There we were, concrete floor above us, concrete floor below us, in this engineered building. So we felt reasonably safe from the elements of the hurricane."" Suddenly, around 3:30 am, the NHC lost electricity. Emergency generators roared to life. However, a problem with the generators prevented the Center 's air conditioning system from operating. Temperatures climbed to 95 degrees inside the cramped quarters, and stayed there for the next few days. Because of the excessive heat, some of the computer systems had to be shut down. Around 4:30 am, the eyewall of Hurricane Andrew began to cut a swath of destruction along South Florida's coastline. ""Here at the Hurricane Center itself, we were just outside of the eyewall. That meant that we did not get the strongest conditions, but we got strong enough to cause considerable problems here,"" said Sheets. ""On the roof of our building, which is an elevation of 150 feet or so, we measured sustained winds up to 120 to 125 mph, with gusts to 168 mph, about 3:30-4:00 in the morning, as the center approached the coast.""  Joel Cline stood in the darkness at the back door of the IRE Building, watching in amazement, as the satellite dishes were blown away in the early morning hours. ""The thing that impacted our work the most was the satellite dishes that blew away, because that allows us to see from Africa to Hawaii,"" says Cline. The duties of the fallen WSR-57 radar unit at the NHC were absorbed by other NWS radars. ""We were using the new SR-88D (Doppler) radar out of Melbourne to track the hurricane as it moved across the state."" said Sheets. ""We had been doing that prior to our own radar failure, but continued that every fifteen minutes that we were bringing in the imagery; we had that in loop form; until it got well out of range, out over the Gulf of Mexico. We also had the Tampa radar that we were monitoring as it was moving along, and then the Key West radar. So, even though we lost our radar, we still had three others that were on it."" Anticipating the worst, early in the morning on Sunday, August 23rd, the NHC sent six of their staff to the National Meteorological Center (NMC, now known as NCEP [National Centers for Environmental Prediction]) Meteorological Operations Division in Washington. Among them were Jerry Jarrell, Deputy Director of the NHC, and hurricane specialist Miles Lawrence. This move was made because the forecast track had Andrew at the front door of the NHC. The NMC is the alternate site used to send out hurricane watches and warn-  ings in case the NHC cannot operate. Although, in the end, the NHC never lost their forecasting abilities, once their satellite dishes were destroyed, they did require help from the NMC to get satellite data. Satellite imagery was sent by Ethernet line from Washington to Wallops Island, Virginia, then on to the NHC. Thus, satellite pictures continued to come in to the NHC, though delayed 40 minutes due to the rerouting. Although radar and satellite data was somewhat disrupted, reconnaissance aircraft flew into the hurricane continuously right up to the Miami coastline. When Andrew emerged in the Gulf of Mexico, the planes picked it up again. ""We did not lose (reconnaissance) communications,"" according to Sheets. ""We lost the direct link to the recon through the satellite link, but we were able to link those through Keesler Air Force Base and phone communications. So, we were at a reduced capacity, but continuing with the vital data."" The NHC held steadfastly to the computer forecast models of a possible landfall in the southern part of Florida, even when the hurricane weakened within a few millibars of being dismissed as a tropical system. Andrew started to increase in forward motion on Saturday, August 22, but the track remained consistent. ""In fact, our forecast, some 30 hours or so before the center moved across the coast was Continued on Page 14  December 1998 13   Hurricane Andr ew1992 Hurricane Andrew Continued from Page 13 within eight miles of where it made landfall"" said Sheets. ""We were about three hours slow in our forecast 30 hours before it struck. We had forecast that the center would cross the coast somewhere around 8:00 am on Monday morning, and it turned out to be closer to 5:00 am. So we were about three hours slow, but right on track with that."" When asked what he attributed to the accuracy in the forecast track of Hurricane Andrew, Cline responded, ""It was a straightmoving storm. The synoptic patterns were well forecast by models, and the pattern was not one that was rapidly changing. When you have a straight-moving storm, as opposed to a recurvature, then it doesn't matter which ocean you're in, you're always going to come out with a fairly accurate landfall forecast. You could even look back at forecasts of others that have done that same thing. Hugo was a good forecast. From the time it went around Puerto Rico until it hit Charleston, the course it took was pretty much a straight line."" According to Sheets, since pressures were extremely high to the north, that forced Andrew on a westward track rather than the normal recurvature out in the Atlantic. For a hurricane or a tropical storm that gets into that high of a latitude, they would normally start turning toward the north, as this storm did temporarily. Then the high pressure to the north strengthened, and it also got up under an upper level 14 Mariners Weather Log  anticyclone, so it was in a favorable area for strengthening. While the winds and destruction raged outside, the forecasters had to concentrate on their duties inside, not on their personal losses. Many employees had their mates and children, along with other family members, at the NHC to ride out the storm together. This was a policy that Sheets insisted on if ever a hurricane hit the area. Sheets added, ""I'd rather have their families up here rather than everyone worrying about them."" As positive proof to this statement, after the radar fell and shook the building, Sheets went back to check on all the families huddled at the NHC. Although he was in the middle of what would prove to be the most terrible natural disaster to hit the United States, he never lost sight of the reality that the people under his roof were all living through a terrifying experience. Even after being severely affected by the hurricane, Sheets and his department could not afford to contemplate what had happened because the West coast of Florida was expecting 120 mph winds as the storm moved out into the Gulf of Mexico. ""Even though the hurricane was striking us, we still had the responsibility to put out warnings for Southwest Florida and the North Gulf Coast, because we knew it was going to go out into the Gulf and continue to strengthen,"" recalled Sheets. ""Our primary thoughts were on continuing the forecast and warning process. There wasn't much we could do about this area at that  stage. We had already done as much as we could in terms of the forecasts and warnings that took place here."" It is ironic that the forecasters at the NHC can ""see"" over 8,000 miles of ocean and land, but during this night, they were only left to wonder what terrible devastation was occurring literally in their own back yards. ""I knew that my family had been evacuated out of the area to the west part of the county,"" said Sheets. ""I thought that they'd be reasonably safe there in a well constructed cinder block and stucco-type structure. But, I don't think any of us comprehended the degree of damage that had actually taken place until we got out into the community and saw what had happened."" In the rage of Andrew's winds, many NHC and NWS employees faced the terrible truth that they would never see their homes again. ""I did what I could, but quite frankly, I live closest to the water,"" explained Cline. ""I took pictures of my house and took my insurance papers with me. Although no employees were injured in the hurricane, many had no homes to come back to. ""There were ten whose homes were either destroyed or not livable after the hurricane,"" said Sheets. As Hurricane Andrew moved west, many at the NHC reflected on that long night spent battling the storm and the personal price they paid trying to help save lives. ""I was on the 4:00 pm to midnight Continued on Page 15   Hurricane Andrew1992 Hurricane Andrew Continued from Page 14 shift, and had to be back on at 7:00 am"" remembers Cline. ""So then, during the height of the storm I could help out, because there was no way I was going to get to sleep. Early in the evening, right after I did the classification of the system at 8:00 pm, I knew a good deal about the hurricane. I got kind of quiet and started thinking about things. I was looking out the window and it's overcast, but not ominous. One of my friends, who is a producer for a TV network, walked over and said, `What are you thinking about, Joel? What's going through your mind?'"" Cline replied, ""No matter what we did, no matter how many hours Bob sits in front of your TV cameras, no matter how  many interviews he gives, no matter how many times people call here, no matter how many police went out to beat on doors and evacuate people off barrier islands, no matter how many Spanish stations, Haitian radio stations broadcast everything, people are alive now that will not be alive at 8:00 in the morning."" ""It's a very sobering and a very true statement,"" said Cline. ""That makes me feel worse than saying goodbye to my house. In essence, you have no control over whether your house is there or not. That's what insurance money is for, to rebuild or whatever. You can't rebuild a human life. Our job is to warn people so they get can out. You're not going to control it and you're not going to stop it from damaging any property. We're not  here for that purpose. What we are here for is so people won't die. And you know that no matter what you do, or how good you do it, or how long you let people know, people will die. The next one that hits the United States, people will die. People in Galveston may remember, Mobile may remember Camille, people in Charleston remember Hugo, and people here will remember Andrew for a long time.""

The Category four hurricane blew out all the glass in the structure, and most of the weather equipment on this C-MAN station was either destroyed or damaged. The intense winds bent the 30 foot high trolley mast that held the sensor cross arm, wind speed sensors, and remote barometer port. The mast  I  was bent 90 degrees to the west about 5 feet above its base. The cross arm and sensor mounts from the trolley mast were found about 150 feet west of the lighthouse base in 10 feet of water. The GOES antenna was broken off and the outboard solar panel was impacted by debris, leaving only the aluminum frame intact. Although Fowey Rocks took the brunt of Hurricane Andrew, it measured wind speed and direc-  tion, peak winds, sea level pressure, and temperature until the station failed due to the intensity of the hurricane. Wind was measured at 140 mph (two-minute average) with a five-second peak of 169 mph. This data helped forecasters verify meteorological information gathered from radar, satellites, and reconnaissance aircraft, along with provided data for further research after the storm.h  December 1998 15   Hurricane Andr ew1992  16 Mariners Weather Log   Hurricane Andrew1992  Fowey Rocks C-MAN station before Hurricane Andrew.

Quick location, and the quick reaction of masters and crews, made the literal difference between life and death at sea.  I  Fishermen Fished Out! On August 15, 1998, the captain of an 80-foot fishing vessel, the SUN LION (Belize flag), radioed the U.S. Coast Guard in Juneau that his vessel had been adrift for 48 hours. The vessel then began taking on water in its engine room 375 miles south of Dutch Harbor, Alaska. Its Philippine crew of ten abandoned ship into a lifeboat in 10-foot seas and 20-knot winds. A Hercules C-130 aircraft was launched from USCG Air Station Kodiak. At the same time, a  Japanese specialized cargo ship, the SOLAR WING, was located by rescue coordinators using the AMVER system. The C-130 vectored the merchant ship three miles to the location of the survivors, where a boat-to-boat transfer was accomplished. The ship carried the survivors to its next port of call in Tokyo, where it was presented with a U.S. Coast Guard Public Service Commendation.  Coast Guard Command Center in San Diego, California, and a C-130 aircraft from the USCG Air Station in Sacramento, on a scheduled patrol nearby, was diverted. It located two persons in a life raft and dropped a radio to establish communications. Again, rescuers queried the AMVER system and located the American President Lines ship, M/V PRESIDENT HOOVER, only 12 miles away. The two sailors were recovered after only five hours in the raft as the 900foot ship maneuvered within six feet of the raft and dropped its accommodation ladder. The ship carried Rick Wempe, described as ""Captain Calm"" by his ""terrified"" partner Tim Anderson, to Long Beach, California, where they were met by news media and Continued on Page 20  Deliverers Delivered!

Captain Peter Arnstadt, Master of the PRESIDENT HOOVER, put his extraordinary ship handling role in perspective during a television interview when he said: ""that's what we get paid to do!"" The retired Navy Captain also commented that the crew of the Coast Guard C-130 could have won the Navy's aerial bombing competition with their precise radio drop!  Peruvians and possible contact with Pacific Islanders. The vessel encountered heavy weather which caused it to capsize and break up 1,400 nm south of Oahu. The crew scrambled into life rafts, which were secured together with the wreckage. Among contemporary safety equipment carried aboard were VHF and single sideband (SSB) radios, celestial navigation equipment, and a 406 MHz EPIRB. It was the EPIRB's satellite signal that alerted rescue officials to the catamaran's plight. Among the resources marshaled to assist were a U.S. Coast Guard C-130 from Air Station Barbers Point, Hawaii; elements of the U.S. Navy's Pacific fleet and Third Fleet (opportunely returning from deployment); and a French container ship participating in AMVER, the DIRECT FALCON, which diverted from a position 484 nm (or 28 steaming hours) away. An Urgent Marine Information Broadcast (UMIB) was also issued to all ships in the area. One of those ships, the M/V EVER VICTORY, a Taiwanese bulk carrier on its maiden voyage from its builder 's shipyard in Rio De Janeiro to Tokyo, responded to the UMIB and voluntarily diverted at best speed from its position only 195 nm away. The C-130 arrived on scene and dropped an additional life raft and  radio to the survivors. At dawn, the EVER VICTORY appeared and picked up the survivors, all in good condition. The expedition's leader is Gene Savoy, a 70-yearold, well-known explorer noted for the discovery of several ancient cities in the Peruvian rain forests since the 1950s. The Master of the EVER VICTORY, Captain D.M. Huang, normally participates in AMVER, but could not on the maiden voyage because reporting instructions had not yet been placed aboard.

Bruce Parker National Ocean Service  Bruce Parker is the Chief of the Coast Survey Development Laboratory, National Ocean Service, NOAA. ethods for precisely predicting the tide have been known for more than a 100 years, and cruder but still useful methods have been known for centuries, perhaps even back 2000 years. With only a few days of data from a tide gauge, the tide can be predicted at that location for years into the future. With six months of data, such predictions can be accurate to the nearest inch and the nearest couple of minutes. I should clarify here that by the tide I mean the astronomical tide, namely, the tide that is predicted in national Tide Tables. That may be obvious to most readers of this column, but changes in water level,  M  including the changes due to wind and atmospheric pressure, are sometimes still referred to as the tide. During storms and hurricanes, the term storm tide is often used by the media. Wind and barometric pressure are part of the weather and so their affect on water level can vary greatly. When a tide prediction does not exactly match the measured water level, it is because of the wind and pressure and, in some places, because of river discharge. But the astronomical tide is another story and the key to its predictability is, of course, the word astronomical. The tide is caused by the gravitational effects of the moon and the sun. The rotations, revolutions, and orbits involving the Earth, moon, and sun are all periodic motions with fixed and precisely known time periods. We will see that the predictability of the tide can be traced back to the predict-  ability of these astronomical motions. To answer the question in the title of this column, we first need to describe how the tides are caused. Let's look at the moon first, because, being much closer than the sun, it is the largest generator of the tides. The Earth and moon both actually revolve around a common point, which, because the Earth is much more massive than the moon, is inside the Earth, but not at the Earth's center (see Figure 1). At the center of the Earth, there is a balance between the gravitational attraction of the moon (trying to pull the Earth and moon together) and the centrifugal force of the revolving Earth (trying to push the Earth outward away from the moon--but see last issue's column for the real explanation of this fictitious force). At a Continued on Page 22  December 1998 21   Physical Oceanog raphy  Figure 1. The Ear th-Moon system (viewed from above the North Pole) revolving around a common axis (just inside the Earth). The Earth is shown with a hypothetical ocean covering the whole Earth (with no continents) and two bulges, resulting from the imbalances of gravitational and centrifugal forces.  Tides Continued from Page 21 location on the Earth's surface closest to the moon, the gravitational attraction of the moon is greater than the centrifugal force. On the opposite side of the Earth, facing away from the moon, the centrifugal force is greater than the moon's gravitational attraction. Figure 1 shows a hypothetical ocean (covering the whole Earth with no continents) with two bulges, one facing the moon and one facing away from the moon. These bulges result from the two imbalances of gravitational and centrifugal forces. However, if we look at the side facing the moon, the force vertically upward from the Earth toward the moon overhead (due to the gravitational force of the moon being greater than the centrifugal force of the Earth's revolution) is so small compared to the Earth's gravitational force as to be insignificant.  So what then actually causes the bulges? If we move away to another point on the Earth that is not directly under the moon, we see that the  attractive force is still pointing toward the moon, but is no longer perfectly vertical relative to the Earth. The further away we get from the point under the moon, the less vertical the force is (see Figure 2). At these other points we now have both a vertical component of the force and a horizontal component, the latter one being parallel to the Earth's surface. This horizontal force, though small, has nothing opposing it, and so it can move the water in the ocean. One can see from Figure 2 that all the horizontal components shown tend to move the water into a bulge centered around the point that is directly under the moon. Similarly, on the other side of the Earth (where the centrifugal force is greater than the moon's gravitational attraction) another bulge results. Continued on Page 23  Figure 2. The tide generating forces (the thick black arrows) on the Earth resulting from the difference between gravitational attraction (the open arrows) and centrifugal force (the hatched arrows). The small black arrows are the horizontal components of the tide generating forces, which tend to move the water into the two bulges shown in Figure 1.  22 Mariners Weather Log   Phy sical Oceanography Tides Continued from Page 22 One can envision the Earth rotating under these bulges in this hypothetical ocean that covers the entire Earth. In one complete rotation in one day, there will be two high tides (when under a bulge) and two low tides (when halfway between bulges), and thus one entire tidal cycle would be completed in half a day. However, this is still an extreme simplification. Not only are the continents left out, but this assumes that the oceans respond instantly to the tide-generating force. There is a lot more to explain. Let's add the continents in and look at one of the oceans, the Atlantic, for example. And lets also look at a bay connected to the Atlantic. The tide-generating force is extremely small, too small to cause a tide directly in the bay. Only in a large ocean are the cumulative effects of the tidegenerating force throughout the ocean large enough to produce a tide. What is actually generated is a very long wave with a fairly small amplitude, on the order of a foot or two (see Figure 3). However, when this wave reaches the reduced depths of the continental shelf, there is a partial reflection of the wave, and the part of the wave that continues toward the coast is increased in amplitude. At the coast, another reflection further increases the height of this tidal wave (NOT to be confused with the tsunami caused by an earthquake), now reaching at least a  Figure 3. The tide generating forces caused by the moon and sun produce in the ocean a very long wave of relatively small amplitude. When this long wave reaches the continental shelf, then the coast, and finally propagates up a bay, it is amplified by an amount that depends on the length and depth of each of the basins.  few feet or more along most coasts. When the wave moves up into a bay, there can be even more amplification, depending on the depth and length of the bay, with the highest tidal ranges seen in the Bay of Fundy (on the order of 50 feet). At this point I need to talk briefly about pendulums and coffee cups and bath tubs in order to explain what makes tides higher in some places than others, and ultimately to explain why tides are so predictable. There are two main parts in the study of tides, the part dealing with astronomy (which we will get back to in a minute) and the part dealing with the motion of water in a basin, namely, the hydrodynamics, which I will talk briefly about, as soon as we look at the pendulum. If we have a  simple pendulum, say a ball hanging on a string, and we hit the ball sideways just once, and then let it swing back and forth, it will always take the same amount of time to complete one oscillation back and forth. This period of oscillation depends only on the length of the string, a longer string producing a longer period of oscillation. If we have a basin of water and we push down once on the water to get its surface oscillating back and forth (like a seesaw, with the center point not moving and the ends moving up and down) it also will have a period of oscillation. This natural period of oscillation of a basin depends both on its length and its depth. The longer the basin, the larger the period of oscillation; Continued on Page 24  December 1998 23   Physical Oceanog raphy Tides Continued from Page 23 however, the deeper the basin, the smaller the period of oscillation. The length effect is more dominant. If, for example, we increase both the length and depth of a basin by say 100 times, the period of oscillation will increase by about 10 times (and the frequency of oscillation will decrease by 10 times). Thus, water in a tea cup will have a shorter period of oscillation (and will oscillate back and forth much faster) than water in a bath tub. The bathtub, in turn, has a much shorter of period of oscillation than the Atlantic Ocean (which has a natural period of about 19 hours). When we hit the pendulum once, and let it go, the resulting oscillation is called a free oscillation. But we could keep hitting the pendulum at a regular time interval. Suppose the natural period of a pendulum is 6 seconds, but we hit the pendulum every 4 seconds, namely, before it has time to do a complete oscillation we send it back in the opposite direction again. If we keep this up, the period of oscillation of the pendulum is 4 seconds, and this is called a forced oscillation. The same is true for water in a basin; if we push down on the water at a regular interval, we can cause the water to have a forced oscillation with a period that matches our interval of pushing. This is essentially what the tidegenerating forces do in the Atlantic Ocean, except that it is not a  single push downward; it is continuous horizontal pushing of the water everywhere over the entire ocean with the direction varying over a 12.42 hour period (why this is more than twelve hours will be explained below when we get back to the astronomy part of the story). The small arrows in Figure 2 show the horizontal tide generating forces at one instant in time. As the Earth rotates, and we follow one point on the Earth's surface around, we can see that the direction of the force will rotate completely around the compass. How large the tide range is depends on how close the natural period of the basin is to the period of the tide-generating force. Look again at the pendulum. If the pendulum does one complete oscillation from right to left and back again, and is just beginning to move to the left again as we hit it to the left, we impart the additional energy at just the right time and the pendulum swings higher than it would have. Likewise, if the natural period of the basin is the same as the period of the tidegenerating force, then the energy from the tidal forcing will be input just at the right time and the tide range will be larger. This is called resonance. The Atlantic Ocean is too wide for there to be resonance (its 19-hour natural period being much longer than 12.42 hours). [There may, however, have been a time in Earth's history, before continental drift got as far as is has today, when the Atlantic was smaller, and perhaps the tides  were larger.] The largest tide ranges in the world are in shallower basins with just the right length and depth combination, like the Bay of Fundy, or along ocean coasts with very wide continental shelves and the right depth, like off southern Argentina. There is not enough space in this column to explain all aspects of the hydrodynamics of the tides, but for the purposes of answering the question in the title of this column, we really don't need to know any more about the hydrodynamics. It doesn't matter how the hydrodynamics has affected the tide range or the times of high water and low water. All that matters is that, because this is a forced oscillating system, the tide will oscillate with the periods determined by the relative motions of the Earth, moon, and sun. Then all we need to do is to analyze a few days (or months) of water level data in order to accurately predict the tide at the location where the data were taken. However, we need to go back to the astronomy because there is not just a single tidal period to consider. There are many different periods involved due to the complex nature of the orbit of the moon around the Earth and of the orbit of the Earth around the sun. To accurately predict the tide, one must consider the most important of these periods. Let's start with the most important tidal period, the 12.42 hour period already mentioned. The Earth rotates on its axis, taking approxiContinued on Page 25  24 Mariners Weather Log   Phy sical Oceanography Tides Continued from Page 24 mately 24 hours to go through a complete day-night cycle. If the moon was standing still, then the two high water bulges on the Earth mentioned above (see Figure 1 again) would be 12 hours apart. However, the moon is moving around the Earth in the same direction that the Earth is rotating. By the time the Earth has made one complete rotation (in 24 hours) the moon has moved a little, so it actually takes 24.84 hours before that same point on the Earth is directly under the moon again. And thus the two high water bulges are really separated by 12.42 hours (the principal lunar period). The tidal constituent representing this lunar period is called M2 (for moon, twice a day). Another tidal period comes from the effect of the sun. Although the sun is much more massive than the moon, it is so far away that the tide generating force of the sun is less than half that of the moon. The principal solar constituent (called S2) has a period of exactly 12 hours, as one would expect. There are two times of the month when the moon and sun are in line with the Earth, at which time they both work together to produce higher tides, called spring tides (see Figure 4). This occurs when the sun and moon are on opposite sides of the Earth (full moon), or on the same side (new moon). When the moon is in first quarter or third quarter, the moon and sun work against each other and so the  Figure 4. The combined effect of the moon and sun varies throughout the month. When the moon and sun are working with each other (at Full Moon and New Moon), one sees the highest tides (spring tides). At First Quarter and Last Quarter, the moon and sun work against each other, resulting in smaller tides (neap tides).  result is tides that are not as high, called neap tides. Another tidal period comes from the fact that the moon's orbit  around the Earth is not a perfect circle, but is an ellipse. Thus the moon moves closest to the Earth (called perigee) and then to a point Continued on Page 26  December 1998 25   Physical Oceanog raphy Tides Continued from Page 25 farthest away (called apogee) and then to the closest point again in the orbit, the whole cycle taking 25.5 days. The tides will be larger when the moon is closest to the Earth (perigean tides) and smaller when the moon is farthest from the Earth (apogean tides). The period of this elliptical tidal constituent (called N2) is 12.66 hours, and it is a little trickier to understand where this number comes from. If two waves are added together, one with a larger amplitude and a period of 12.42 hours and one with a smaller amplitude and a period of 12.66 hours, the result will be a wave with a 12.42-hour period that slowly varies in amplitude over a 25.5-day period. In order words, one can represent the variation in tide range due to the changing distance of the moon from the Earth by simply adding a wave with 12.66-hour period to the  principal lunar wave with period of 12.42 hours. We can use Figure 4 to illustrate this, if, in that figure, we replace S2 with N2, spring tide with perigean tide, and neap tide with apogean tide. The difference is that with the M2 plus S2 case there really are two distinct effects being added, but in the case of the changing distance between the moon and Earth, this directly varies the amplitude of the tide; and N2 is merely a convenient way (in combination with M2) to represent this variation of amplitude. There are many other variations in the moon's orbit, the Earth's rotation, and the Earth's orbit about the sun, and these all can be represented by other tidal constituents with appropriate periods to represent the various affects on the tide's amplitude. I will mention only two others, because at some locations on the Earth they can lead to (with some help from hydrodynamics) only one high water per day instead of two. The moon is directly over the Earth's equator only two times a month. Half the time it moves north of the equator, and half the time it moves south of the equator. At the point when the moon is the farthest north of the equator (or farthest south) the bulge is shifted also. In Figure 5, one can see places north of 30N where the Earth would rotate under only one high water bulge. In the real world, the size of a particular basin would determine whether these diurnal tidal periods would dominate over the semidiurnal periods described above. In many places there are  still two high waters a day, but one is larger than the other (and likewise for the low waters); this is referred to as a mixed tide. Knowing the periods of these and other smaller tidal constituents, which are derived from the relative astronomical motions of the Earth, moon, and sun, one can analyze a data series of water level observations from a particular location. The result of such a harmonic analysis is an amplitude and phase for each of these tidal constituents, which represent how large each effect is at that particular location, and when in time the peak of each effect will take place [for example, relative to when the moon passes over (transits) that location]. The hydrodynamics affect both the amplitude and phase (timing) of each tidal constituent, but we really don't need to know the details of how it happened, only that it did happen. And, as long as the hydrodynamics stay the same, the tide predictions from these calculated harmonic constants (the amplitudes and phases) will be accurate. The hydrodynamics will stay the same as long as the length and depth of the basin stays the same. For small bays, shoaling or dredging can change the hydrodynamics and thus change the tide range and times of high and low waters. The method of harmonic analysis was first invented by Sir William Thomson (Lord Kelvin) in 1867 and later refined by George Continued on Page 27  Figure 5. When the moon is at maximum declination north or south of the equator, the tidal bulge also shifts north or south. When this happens, certain locations on the Earth would rotate under only one high water bulge.  26 Mariners Weather Log   Phy sical Oceanography Tides Continued from Page 26 Darwin (son of Charles Darwin). To carry out a tide prediction in that era, long before computers, machines were built with gears and pulleys connected by a wire to a pen. Each tidal constituent had a different size rotating gear and a pin and yoke system connected to a pulley (see Figure 6). The pin and yoke system turned the rotating motion of the gear into a vertical up and down motion of the pulley, which moved the wire over it and thus moved the pen up and down on a roll of moving paper. The wire ran over a number of pulleys so all the constituent effects could be added together. The first tide predicting machine was a wooden model built for Kelvin in 1872, but later models were huge brass machines with dozens of finely made gears and  pulleys. The first one built in the U.S. was by William Ferrel in 1885. Prior to the use of harmonic analysis, there were other less sophisticated methods based upon recognized relationships between the tides and the movements of the moon and sun. For example, for a particular place, high tide might occur a certain number of hours after the moon was directly overhead, and the highest (spring) tide might occur a certain number of days after full moon or after new moon. In many of the early maritime nations, tide prediction schemes were treasured family secrets passed on to the next generation. One of the earliest tide tables discovered was for London Bridge in the early 1200s. The earliest recognition of the connection between the tides and  Figure 6. A schematic of an early tide prediction machine. Each gear and pulley combination represented one tidal constituent. The wire running over every pulley summed the motions and moved a pen on a moving roll of paper to draw a tide curve.  the moon appears to be by a Greek geographer, Pytheas of Massilia, around 325 B.C. Pytheas had traveled from his home in the Mediterranean Sea, which does not have a noticeable tide, to the British Isles, where he observed significant tides and even tried to measure them. Other Greek and Roman thinkers went on to describe many patterns in the tides and their similarity to motions of the moon and sun. Yet no one could come up with an explanation of how the moon and sun actually caused the tide. They were especially confused by there being two high waters a day, one of those occurring in the day when the moon was nowhere to be seen. A variety of strange ideas were proposed. Some regarded the Earth as an animal and attributed the tides to its respiration or to its alternate drinking in and spouting out of water. Others attributed it to the heat of the sun or to river discharges or to winds caused by the sun or moon striking the water. Even those that believed that the moon had to be the cause did not know how. In 1609, Kepler proposed that the tides were due to the gravitational attraction of the moon, but he seemed to think that the second high tide was due to the waters rushing back after the moon had pulled them westward, where they had hit a continent and were freed from the moon's pull as it continued around to the other side of the Earth. It was not until 1687 that Newton, in his book Principia, finally explained the cause of the tides, including the reason for two high waters per day.h  December 1998 27   Fam Float  Marine Familiar ization Float on Board the S/S ARCO FAIRBANK SJanuar y 16-21, 1998 Dave Hefner, Marine Forecaster Fairbanks, Alaska  T  he S/S ARCO FAIRBANKS was built by Bethlehem Steel in 1974. The ship is 880 feet long, and on this trip was carrying about 800,000 barrels of oil. This was trip number 556 for the ship. A typical journey of this type from Valdez, Alaska, to Cherry Point, Washington, can be completed in about three and one-half days with good sea conditions. However, this trip took just over five days, as we encountered rough weather and sea conditions along the way. My trip began at 0400 from Valdez on Friday, January 16, 1998. The weather was beautiful with partly cloudy skies and plenty of stars out. The area was in a typical winter pattern of high pressure over the interior, providing some cold northeast winds. With a complement of escort vessels, and a harbor pilot on board, we headed out through the Valdez Narrows into Prince  William Sound. With the slower speed limits in the sound, we did not reach Hinchinbrook entrance to the Gulf of Alaska until noon on Friday. The S/S ARCO FAIRBANKS receives marine facsimile data from both Kodiak and Point Reyes. From Kodiak, they receive the surface analysis and a 36-hour surface forecast, both prepared by the Anchorage forecast office. From Point Reyes, they receive a North Pacific surface analysis (from Japan to California), and a 12- and 24-hour forecast of winds and seas. These charts are all prepared by the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP), Marine Prediction Center (MPC). They also have access to marine text forecasts via INMARSAT-C SafetyNET. Second Mate Statler spent quite a bit of time with me talking about weather. He has quite an interest in weather and considers himself  an amateur observer. He was quite knowledgeable of general weather conditions. He said the ship takes an 18Z observation everyday. Their observation equipment consists of a barometer, barograph, thermometers for both air temperature and wet-bulb temperature, and a weather vane and cup anemometer. Twenty-four hours into the trip, we started hitting swells of 10 to 15 feet. These were obviously swells generated by a distant storm, as we were under partly cloudy skies, with just a hint of layered clouds to the far south. Winds were only 15 to 20 kts. For a while, the swells were hitting us head on, with beautiful displays of water spraying high into the air off the bow. But soon the swells started to hit us at a bit of an angle and the water really started to wash over the main deck. By the time we reached about 55 north Continued on Page 29  28 Mariners Weather Log   Fam Float Fam Float Continued from Page 28 latitude, we hit the back side of a strong storm, and winds increased northwest to 50 kts. The seas became quite chaotic, increasing to about 15 to 20 feet. In addition to the seas washing across the  deck, we were receiving quite a bit of sea spray, even up to the windows on the bridge. The normal cruising speed for this tanker is around 15 kts. For most of Saturday and Sunday we had only been traveling between 5 and 10 kts, putting us quite a bit  behind schedule. By 1000 Sunday, we were only abreast of the northern Queen Charlotte Islands, which is a little short of half way to Cherry Point, Washington. The seas did begin to smooth out, though swells remained 10 to 15 feet. By Monday evening we were only about 150 miles from Port Angeles. We reached the Straits of Juan de Fuca Tuesday evening. We made a quick stop to pick up the harbor pilot near Port Angeles. We reached Cherry Point at 0600 Wednesday. Cherry Point is very remote, located on the Washington coast north of Bellingham, and only about 10 miles from the Canadian border. The facilities are located out from moderately sized cliffs, and pipes carry the oil to a refinery at least one-half mile inland. There are two other unloading piers in the area, both being about one-half mile apart. One pier was for unloading bulk cargo, and the other one was for unloading oil. It takes about 24 to 28 hours to unload one of these tankers. Some of the crew told me that the return trip back to Valdez becomes significantly rougher given the same sea conditions, due to riding so much higher out of the water. I truly enjoyed the trip as it was a real learning experience for me to see how marine conditions can vary on the open sea, especially the north Pacific. I appreciated the opportunity to sail with the crew of the S/S ARCO FAIRBANKS on this trip.h  Photo of inbound tanker in Prince William Sound heading for Valdez to pick up a load of crude oil.

Burdette National Data Buoy Center  nited States and Canadian forecasters are continually challenged in their efforts to prepare accurate forecasts for the coastal areas of the Northeast Pacific. The Gulf of Alaska and the North Pacific are well known as areas for development and intensification of major storm systems which pose a moderate to severe threat to the coastal and land areas of the U.S. and Canada. Although the Northeast Pacific is well served by U.S. and Canadian moored buoys and Voluntary Observing Ships, large expanses of ocean still exist where little meteorological information is available to forecasters. This noted lack of meteorological observations, along with the  U  associated risk, was severely felt on October 11, 1984, when an under-forecasted, rapidly deepening storm, a ""marine bomb,"" struck the West Coast of Canada, resulting in the loss of seven fishing vessels and five lives. Subsequent investigation into the incident, known as the ""Le Blonde Report,"" highlighted the importance of understanding the physics of rapidly deepening storms, and developing methods for early detection. One action addressing requirements identified in the report was to supplement the existing moored buoy networks on the west coast with drifting buoys that could measure needed parameters such as wind speed and direction, pressure, and sea state, as future developments allowed.  Since that time, Environment Canada has attempted to maintain a network of 10-12 drifting buoys in the Northeast Pacific as an early warning network. The National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) has also deployed a few drifters in the area for other unrelated projects. Over the years, however, it has been difficult for Environment Canada to maintain the network with little or no assistance. In 1997, the Atmospheric Environment Branch of Environment Canada contacted NDBC, recommending a joint effort to deploy and maintain a drifter array for three years. The resulting network would be larger, more reliable, and Continued on Page 31  30 Mariners Weather Log   National Data Buoy Center D rif ter Program Continued from Page 30 more valuable than either could support individually. In September 1998, the first six deployments were successfully made. Drifters measuring wind speed and direction, barometric pressure, air temperature, sea temperature, and location were placed along 160W longitude, at 40N, 41N, 43N, 46N, 49N, and 52N latitudes. The buoys are expected to slowly drift towards the west coast of the U.S. and  Canada over the next two years. They will report through the Polar Orbiting Environmental Satellites, with data being distributed through Service Argos to the Global Telecommunications System. Data will be available to all west coast forecasters on the SSVX08 header. Marine interests should note that the data will also be plotted on standard National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Surface Analysis Charts. One important point to be kept in mind when analyzing the data is that the winds are measured at one meter above the sea  surface and contain no adjustment to the standard 10-meter observation height. If not adjusted to 10meter height for use, the data will show a low wind speed bias. NDBC and Environment Canada are expecting to add additional buoys to the array over the next two years. As current buoys drift slowly towards the coastlines of the U.S. and Canada, additional buoys will be deployed behind them. The result will be a comprehensive buoy array stretching from 160W toward the coastlines in 1999 and 2000.h  Under the Northeast Pacific Cooperative Drifter Program, six drifting buoys were deployed in September 1998. This is a joint U.S. and Canadian effort. More buoys will be depoloyed over the next two years.

A series of frontal waves moved east or southeast from near the Canadian Maritimes, into the base of a mean upper low (trough) southeast of Greenland and amplified. The strongest of these became an intense storm in the eastern Atlantic, dropping 31 mb in 24 hours from 12Z April 1 to 12Z April 2, therefore qualifying as a meteorological ""bomb"" (see Figure 1). In the second panel or part of Figure 1, the storm has almost finished deepening, and actually bottomed out at 954 mb at 18Z April 2. This was the most intense storm in the North Atlantic during this April to July period. Note the 60 kt west wind southwest of the center. It is conceivable that this storm produced  L  hurricane force winds in the strongest portion of the storm. The third panel of Figure 1 shows the storm slowing. The system subsequently became stationary over Great Britain, increasing in size and dominating much of the eastern North Atlantic until April 8. This storm developed seas of 16 ft or higher from Great Britain south to near 40N in the eastern North Atlantic, with a maximum of 43 ft (13 meters) in the Bay of Biscay on April 3. Figure 1 also shows a change in the upper air pattern in the western Atlantic to a trough near the U.S. east coast which continued into June, supporting a series of lows moving off the east coast, while a ridge developed in the eastern North Atlantic. Split flow over the western North Atlantic and parts of North America was apparent  during this period, with separate northern and southern jet streams, perhaps the remnants of El Nio. This also led to cutoff lows at southern latitudes. Figure 2 is an example from this period, showing a separate 500 mb northern stream sending short wave troughs east and northeast toward the Greenland area, with associated surface development. A low is moving off the east coast and a cutoff low is shown forming near 33N 35W, with developing gale conditions. East coast low pressure developments beginning late in April remained below storm strength. However, one longlasting low, cut off at southern latitudes, off the Carolinas on May 11 remained for several days, resulting in a large area of north-  Continued on Page 35  32 Mariners Weather Log   Marine Weather Review  Figure 1.

Highest reported seas were 16 to 23 ft (5 to 7 meters). This sytem started to weaken on the 15th, but took until the 18th of May to move out and pass east of Newfoundland. By early June, a blocking area of higher pressure in the Greenland area resulted in slow moving systems out of the northeastern  U.S. to the Canadian Maritimes with winds of gale strength or less. One of these moved slowly from New England on June 3 as a complex gale, taking a week to reach Great Britain. The blocking receded north by the middle of June, allowing systems to turn north toward the Labrador Sea. The strongest of these moved off the New England coast on June 27 and intensified. Figure 4 depicts this development over a period of 30 hours to a mature system with strong gales reported around the  south, west, and north sides at 06Z June 29. This was the system closest to being a storm in MPC's portion of the North Atlantic during the June to July period, a time when cyclonic activity is approaching a minimum for the year.

April began with a weakening gale, formerly a storm, in the northern Bering Sea, with residual swells reported in the 20 to 32 ft range (6 to 10 meters) around the eastern Aleutians both on the North Pacific and Bering sides. The ships at 54N 170W and 54N 163W both reported 32 ft seas (10 meters) and west winds of 40 kt.

The second two panels of Figure 1 show intensification of a 500 mb low. Storm force winds were observed by 12Z April 1 ahead of the front south of the center near 50N 173E. Central pressure dropped from 995 mb at 00Z April 1 to 955 mb at 00Z April 2, bottoming out at 954 mb at 06Z April 2, with the center moving through the southern Bering Sea. A southwest wind of 60 kt was observed southeast of the center at 53N 176W along with 43 ft seas (13 meters). Note  the ship reports in the third panel of Figure 1 with 45 to 60 kt in the southern Bering Sea at 00Z April 3. The ship at 54N 174W reported west winds 60 kt and also reported the highest seas in this event, 56 ft (17 meters). At 00Z April 2, buoy 46035 56N 178W reported an 8minute average wind of NE 45 kt. By 00Z April 3, gale force winds and seas to 23 ft (7 meters) extended down to 42N south of the eastern Aleutians as this system started to weaken in the southeast Bering Sea. A similar rapid development in the western Pacific occurred on April 8-10 as depicted in Figure 2. A  storm developed 18 hours later near 50N 167E at 978 mb with a ship reporting NW 55 kt winds and 30 ft seas (9 meters) southwest of the center at 48N 163E (not shown). The storm center moved northeast and deepened to 958 mb by 18Z April 9. Winds of 45 to 60 kt and 33 to 50 ft seas (10 to 15 meters) were reported from ships around the central and eastern Aleutians and southwest Gulf of Alaska on April 9.

In mid-April the only storm of the month to move into the northeast Pacific and pass south of the eastern Aleutians developed from a frontal wave south of the western Aleutians on the 14th near 47N 174E. The storm developed rapidly by 18Z on the 15th near 47N 169W, with a pressure of 975 mb. Figure 3 shows this development. At 00Z April 17, ship reports show winds of 45 to 55 kt south of the center, and seas were 23 to 36 ft (7 to 11 meters). The lowest pressure was 958 mb six  hours before map time of the third panel of Figure 3. The center then drifted northeast into the Gulf of Alaska and weakened on the 18th, while secondary development on a front southwest of the old system subsequently spun up another storm near 48N 145W, although not as strong (976 mb at 06Z April 20). Subsequent storm development occurred in the northwest Pacific late in April and into May, with systems tracking northeast into the Bering Sea. The strongest of these is shown in Figure 4 as northern and southern systems combine to form a storm, unusually intense for May, in the southeast Bering Sea by 12Z on May 17. Ship reports showed 50 kt winds near  the eastern Aleutians at 00Z May 17 (not shown) and seas up to 25 ft (8 meters) in the eastern Bering Sea on May 17th and 18th. This was the last system of the 1997-98 fall-winter-spring period with storm force winds in MPC's North Pacific area. In June, lows tracked east along the latitude of Japan then turned northeast toward the eastern Aleutians and western Gulf of Alaska, blocked by an upper ridge over the eastern Pacific. The strongest of these intensified to 975 mb as it moved north to the Alaska Peninsula and developed winds of 35 to 45 kt and seas 20 to 25 ft (6 to 8 meters) on June 7-8. See Figure 5.

December 1998 41   Marine Weather Review Nor th Pacific Area Continued from Page 41 the upper ridge weakened in midJune, allowing lows to move into the eastern Gulf of Alaska. By June's end, cyclonic activity weakened and much of the North Pacific was dominated by high pressure. In July, the eastern Pacific ridge shifted west and allowed the westerlies to shift unusually far south for July off the west coast of North America. A series of lows moved from well west of northern California to the coast near Vancouver Island. The first panel of Figure 6 shows the pattern, a deep trough aloft over the northeast Pacific. The strong short wave trough approaching the coast is associated with the gale center approaching the British Columbia coast (second panel of Figure 6) with 40 kt south winds reported in the Vancouver Island and Washington offshore waters. Around this time, another deep upper trough was near Japan and supported the development of the deepest low of July on a front off Japan. The low deepened briefly to 984 mb when over the warm Kuroshio Current (third panel of Figure 6) before moving north toward the Kamchatka Peninsula and weakening.

Shashy Tropical Prediction Center Tropical Analysis and Forecast Branch Miami, Florida  I. Introduction A combination of a waning El Nio and the normal northward movement of the jet stream ended the series of strong winter storms in the TPC area. The Atlantic and Eastern Pacific Hurricane seasons both started slowly; however, by the end of August, both basins were showing near normal activity.  The greatest example of this occurred on 18 August 1927, when a ship measured an 887 mb pressure in a western Pacific typhoon. This is apparently a record low pressure measured by a ship. All lower pressures in tropical cyclones have been measured by reconnaissance aircraft. A more recent example was on 6-7 September 1995, when the TEAL ARROW sailed into the eye of Atlantic Hurricane Luis. The ship reported a minimum pressure of 942 mb at 1800 UTC 6 September, which was very close to that reported by aircraft. It estimated 125 kt wind gusts and 50 ft seas as it passed through the eyewall. Another example occurred on 25 August 1998, when the BRITISH HAWK sailed through the center of Hurricane Bonnie (Table 1).  The ship reported maximum sustained winds of 75 kt at 1200 UTC, with a minimum pressure of 965.8 mb three hours later. The data suggest the ship was inside Bonnie's large and poorly defined eye. However, no maximum wind or minimum pressure data is available between the observations. Maximum combined seas reported by the ship were 33 ft at 1800 UTC. If a ship does encounter the core of a tropical cyclone, the crew should try to document the encounter as best as possible. The TPC normally asks for three hourly ship reports within 300 nm of a tropical cyclone. However, a ship in the core should try to report every hour to provide the TPC (or other warning centers) with the best possible information. Peak conditions between reports Continued on Page 44 December 1998 43  II. Ship Encounters with Tropical Cyclones Ships generally avoid tropical cyclones, especially the central core region. Forecasts and warnings transmitted by radio facsimile and the International SafetyNET service usually enable ships to take evasive action long before encountering the storms. However, ships occasionally wind up in the core of a tropical cyclone.   Marine Weather Review Tropical Prediction Center Continued from Page 43 should be noted in plain language remarks whenever possible. If such observations are not possible, the ships' Captain or weather observer could mail the TPC (or other warning centers) a log of the observations after the fact. This would prove useful in the TPC's post-analysis of the storm. Continued on Page 45 Table 1.

However, ship FNPH (FORT DESAIX) reported 64 kt winds (believed to be convective gusts) north of the center at 1800 UTC 1 August. Ships ELLE9 (CAPE HORN), 3ENX9 (ROYAL STAR), and ELVV2 (name unknown) encountered Alex just as it was developing, and their observations were invaluable in determining that a depression had formed. Hurricane Bonnie: A large tropical wave gradually organized over the eastern and central tropical Atlantic in mid-July. It became Tropical Depression Two near 16N 51W on 19 August (Figure 1). Moving rapidly westnorthwest, the system reached tropical storm strength just northeast of the Leeward Islands on 20 August. Bonnie continued a slower west-northwest track on 21-22 August, with the storm reaching hurricane strength on 22 August (Figure 2). The hurricane slowed to an erratic northwest drift on 23-24 August while just east of the Bahama Islands. It reached its peak intensity of 100 kt on 24 August and maintained this intensity until it made landfall. A north-northwest motion developed on 25 August, with a turn to the north on 26 August. This brought Bonnie's center to the North Carolina coast at Cape Fear late on 26 August. Bonnie slowed again as it made landfall and turned northeast. It Continued on Page 46  Figure 2.

Atlantic Tropical Storm Alex: A tropical wave moved off the African coast on 26 July (Figure 1). It became Tropical Depression One near 12N 27W the next day. Moving generally west, the cyclone reached tropical storm strength early on 29 July. Alex continued generally west through 31 July, then turned west-northwest on 1 August. An unfavorable environment limited strengthening, and Alex reached a peak intensity of 45 kt during the 30 July-1 August period. Steady weakening then occurred, and Alex dissipated near 21N 60W late on 2 August.  III. Significant Weather of the Period A. Tropical Cyclones: The Atlantic produced two hurricanes and three other tropical storms during the May-August period, with the third storm (Earl) reaching hurricane strength in September. The Eastern Pacific produced eight named storms, of which five reached hurricane strength. There was also one Eastern Pacific tropical depression. All information on the storms is preliminary and all times are UTC.  December 1998 45   Marine Weather Review Tropical Prediction Center Continued from Page 45 was not until early on 28 August that the center moved back into the Atlantic near Manteo, North Carolina. Bonnie weakened to a tropical storm over land, but regained minimal hurricane strength as it moved offshore. Slow weakening occurred as Bonnie moved generally northeast, with the storm passing just south of Sable Island early on 30 August. Bonnie became extratropical later that day near 45N 52W. Bonnie's large circulation affected the Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, the Bahamas, and the eastern parts of North and South Carolina. It also affected many ships, buoys, and automated stations besides the BRITISH HAWK. The Coastal Marine Automated Network (C-MAN) station at Frying Pan Shoals, North Carolina, reported a 10minute average wind of 76 kt, with a gust to 90 kt between 20002100 UTC 26 August. The station reported a minimum pressure of 964.6 mb at 1700 UTC. The SABRINA reported 60 kt winds with 75 kt gusts on 26 August, along with 23-26 ft seas. An oil rig near Sable Island reported 65 kt winds above the surface at 0300 UTC 30 August. Finally, a reconnaissance plane reported a 954 mb central pressure at 0151 UTC 24 August. Bonnie is blamed for three deaths at this time. Damage figures are still incomplete, but may be in the hundreds of millions of dollars.  Bonnie was one of the most researched hurricanes in history. Five NOAA and NASA research planes flew experimental missions in and around the storm. They were aided by the NASA Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite. Tropical Storm Charley: A tropical wave accompanied by a broad area of low pressure moved into the southeast Gulf of Mexico on 19 August. The low moved west-northwest and organized into a tropical depression near 26N 95W on 21 August (Figure 3). The depression continued westnorthwest and became Tropical Storm Charley later that day. Charley steadily strengthened to a peak intensity of 50 kt as it made landfall on 22 August just north of Port Arkansas, Texas (Figure 2). The storm turned west and weak-  ened to a low pressure area over south Texas later that day. While this was the end of Charley as a tropical cyclone, the remnant low continued to spread heavy rain through south Texas, causing severe flooding in Del Rio and elsewhere along the Rio Grande. Oil Rig K7R8 reported 40 kt winds with gusts to 50 kt above the surface at 1647 UTC 21 August. Several additional reports of 40-60 kt gusts were received from the middle and upper Texas coast. Rockport, Texas, reported a 1000.7 mb pressure at 1053 UTC 22 August. There are no known ship reports of tropical stormforce winds. Charley is blamed for 21 deaths, mainly due to the severe flooding around Del Rio. Continued on Page 47  Figure 3. Preliminary track for Tropical Storm Charley.

Open symbols represent tropical storm phase.  46 Mariners Weather Log   Marine Weather Review Tropical Prediction Center Continued from Page 46 Hurricane Danielle: A tropical wave over the eastern Atlantic organized into Tropical Depression Four near 14N 37W on 24 August. The cyclone moved steadily west-northwest through 29 August. The depression reached tropical storm strength later on 24 August and hurricane strength the next day. A peak intensity of 90 kt was estimated from satellite imagery on 26 August. Danielle slowly weakened to a minimal hurricane by 30 August due to a combination of unfavorable upper level winds and cold water left in the wake of Bonnie. Later on 30-31 August, Danielle gradually turned from a west-northwest to north-northeast track and re-intensified. At this time the storm was between the southeast United States and Bermuda (Figure 4). Danielle was a smaller storm than its predecessor Bonnie, and ships generally avoided it during this period. The ship P3ZH4 (HYUNDAI TAKOMA) reported 35 kt winds at 0600 UTC 31 August. Hurricane Earl: A tropical wave that moved off the African coast in mid-August moved into the southwest Gulf of Mexico on 30 August. An associated broad low pressure system organized into Tropical Depression Five near 22N 94W on 31 August, and became Tropical Storm Earl later that day (Figure 4). Continued on Page 48  Figure 4.

This system slowly organized into Tropical Depression One-E near 12N 105W on 11 June (Figure 5). Further strengthening was slow, and the cyclone did not reach tropical storm strength until 13 June. Agatha reached a peak intensity of 55 kt on 14 June, then steadily weakened until it dissipated near 20N 123W on 16 June. Agatha was far from land, and no known ships encountered the storm. Tropical Depression Two-E: Tropical Depression Two-E formed near 15N 106W on 19 June (Figure 5). The cyclone followed a general west-northwest track until it dissipated near 19N 114W on 22 June. Maximum sustained winds were estimated at 30 kt. Hurricane Blas: A tropical wave caused increasing convection off the Pacific coast of Central America on 19 June. The activity gradually organized and became Tropical Depression Three-E near 8N 95W early on 22 June (Figure 5). Moving generally westnorthwest to northwest, the cyclone reached tropical storm strength later that day and hurricane strength the next day. Blas continued strengthening to a peak intensity of 120 kt on 25 June.  Weakening started on 26 June as Blas turned west, and Blas was downgraded to a tropical storm by 28 June. The cyclone dissipated near 18N 132W on 30 June, with the residual low cloud swirl continuing west to south of the Hawaiian Islands by 5 July. Ships avoided Blas, so there are no reports of tropical storm-force or greater winds. Blas may have indirectly enhanced rainfall over southern Mexico which led to mudslides that caused four deaths. Tropical Storm Celia: A tropical wave spawned a tropical disturbance south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec on 13 July. The disturbance tracked west-northwest with little development for the next three days. It became better organized on 17 July, and it became a tropical depression near 17N 105W early that day. The cyclone reached tropical storm strength later that day. Celia turned west on 19 July as it reached a peak intensity of 50 kt. Weakening occurred after that, and Celia dissipated near 23N 122W on 21 July. Several ships were caught between Celia and the Mexican coast. Ship KGTI (GREEN LAKE) reported 45 kt winds at 1200 UTC 17 July, which was the basis for naming Celia. Ship 4XGX (ZIK ISRAEL) reported 50 kt winds at 1700 UTC that day. Hurricane Darby: A tropical wave started showing increased organization south of Acapulco on  19 July. Further development was slow, with the disturbance becoming a tropical depression early on 23 July near 12N 111W. This system would follow a general west to west-northwest track during its lifetime. The cyclone reached tropical storm strength later on 23 July and hurricane strength on 24 July. Darby twice reached a peak intensity of 100 kt, first on 25 July then from 26-28 July. The hurricane weakened to a tropical storm as it crossed into the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area of responsibility on 29 July. Further weakening occurred, and Darby dissipated on 1 August near 24N 154W. Darby was far from land and no known ships encountered the storm. Hurricane Estelle: Tropical Depression Six-E formed near 15N 101W on 29 July. The depression moved west and reached tropical storm strength the next day. Estelle reached hurricane strength on 31 July while continuing west through 1 August. A peak intensity of 115 kt and a turn to the west-northwest occurred on 2 August. A turn back to the west took place on 4 August as Estelle weakened to a tropical storm. Estelle weakened to a depression the next day, and the system dissipated over the Central Pacific near 23N 149W on 8 August. Estelle remained far from land and there are no reports of damage or casualties. Continued on Page 49  48 Mariners Weather Log   Marine Weather Review Tropical Prediction Center Continued from Page 48 Tropical Storm Frank: A persistent area of disturbed weather associated with a tropical wave organized into a tropical depression near 17N 112W on 6 August. The depression moved generally north and reached tropical storm strength on 8 August. Frank reached a peak intensity of 40 kt early on 9 August just west of Baja California. The storm weakened and turned northwest later that day. It dissipated near 29N 117W on 10 August. Ship C6LF9 (DOMINICA) reported 30-35 kt winds on 8-9 August, which was the basis for upgrading the depression to a tropical storm. Frank affected southern and central Baja California and the adjacent Gulf of California with locally gusty winds and heavy rains. There are no reports of damage or casualties at this time. Hurricane Georgette: Tropical Depression Eight-E formed near 12N 110W on 11 August. Moving west-northwest, the cyclone reached tropical storm strength later that day. Georgette followed a general west-northwest to northwest track for the rest of its life. The storm reached hurricane strength on 12 August and a peak intensity of 100 kt on 14 August. Steady weakening then developed, with Georgette becoming a tropical storm and then a depression on 16 August. The system dissipated early on 17 August near 25N 127W.  Ship KGTI (GREEN LAKE) reported 35 kt winds at 0600 UTC 14 August. It and several other ships encountered large swells (up to 24 ft) generated by Georgette. There are no reports of damage or casualties at this time. Hurricane Howard: Tropical Depression Nine-E formed near 11N 97W on 20 August. Moving west-northwest, the cyclone reached both tropical storm and hurricane strength the next day. Howard continued west-northwest as it strengthened to a peak intensity of 130 kt on 23 August. After a slight weakening, Howard reached a secondary peak intensity of 115 kt while turning west on 25 August. The hurricane turned  west-northwest and weakened on 27 August. It fell to tropical storm status on 28 August and tropical depression status on 29 August. Howard dissipated on 30 August near 20N 134W. An unidentified ship reported 40 kt winds and a 1005 mb pressure at 0000 UTC 21 August. There are no reports of damage or casualties at this time. B. Other Significant Events: A complex low pressure system centered north of the TPC area of responsibility affected the Atlantic north of 25N and west of 50W between 9-16 May. The lows produced 20-30 kt winds and 8-13 ft seas across this region.h  Figure 6. Preliminary tracks for Hurricane Estelle, Tropical Storm Fran, Hurricane Georgette, and Hurricane Howard.

Baron National Weather Service Silver Spring, Maryland  NWS Obser ving Handbook No. 1 to be U pdated We are working to update the 1995 edition of NWS Observing Handbook No. 1, Marine Surface Weather Observations. The revised edition should be ready Fall 1999. While there have been no code changes since the 1995 edition was published, we are making some corrections and adding new material. As a result of GMDSS implementation, there have been many changes to Shipboard communication methods, so we have rewritten Chapter 3, ""Transmitting The Observation."" Here are highlights of the changes to be incorporated in the new edition. Pages 2-7 -- We have corrected a mistake here: iw is reported as 3 or 4, not as 03 or 04 as indicated in the August 1995 edition. Under How To Code, the new text will be: U.S. VOS Program vessels report wind speed in knots. Use 3 when estimating wind speed in knots, or 4 when measuring wind speed with an anemometer in knots. Some vessels in foreign VOS programs report wind speed in meters per second. These vessels should use 0 when estimating wind speed in meters per second, or 1 when measuring wind speed with an anemometer in meters per second. Code Figure 0 1 3 4  Wind Wind Wind Wind  speed speed Speed Speed  estimated in meters per second obtained from anemometer in meters per second estimated in knots obtained from anemometer in knots  Pages 2-40 -- We have added information on how Great Lakes vessels should report sea level pressure. The text being added is: For Great Lakes vessels: PMOs in Cleveland and Chicago calibrate your barometers to read sea level pressure using the elevation of Lake Erie in the correction factor. From other Great Lakes, to obtain sea level pressure Continued on Page 53 52 Mariners Weather Log   VOS Program VOS Program Continued from Page 52 you must know the difference in elevation between Lake Erie and the lake your on, and add or subtract a correction. From Lake Huron or Lake Michigan (both 10 feet above Lake Erie), please add .4 hp to your pressure reading before reporting. For Lake Superior (30 feet above Lake Erie), add 1.1 hp. For Lake Ontario (325 feet below Lake Erie), subtract 12 hp. Chapter 3, ""Transmitting The Observation"" -- We have rewritten the entire chapter. Highlights from the new chapter include: STATIONS ACCEPTING VOS WEATHER OBSERVATIONS Weather observations sent by ships participating in the VOS program are sent at no cost to the ship except as noted. The stations listed accept weather observations which enter an automated system at National Weather Service headquarters. This system is not intended for other types of messages. To communicate with NWS personnel, see phone numbers and e-mail addresses at the beginning of this manual. INMARSAT Follow the instructions with your INMARSAT terminal for sending a telex message. Use the special dialing code 41 (except when using the SEAS/AMVER software in compressed binary format with INMARSAT C), and do not request a confirmation. Here is a typical procedure for using an INMARSAT transceiver: 1 2 3 4 5 6 . . . . . . Select appropriate Land Earth Station Identity (LES-ID). See the table below. Select routine priority. Select duplex telex channel. Initiate the call. Wait for the GA+ signal. Select the dial code for meteorological reports, 41+. Upon receipt of our answerback, NWS OBS MHTS, transmit the weather message starting with BBXX and the ship's call sign. The message must be ended with 5 periods. Do not send any preamble. GA+ 41+ NWS OBS MHTS BBXX WLXX 29003 99131 70808 41998 60909 10250 2021/ 4011/ 52003 71611 85264 22234 00261 20201 31100 40803..... The 5 periods indicate the end of the message, and must be included after each report. Do not request a confirmation.

Do not request a confirmation If your ship's Inmarsat terminal does not contain a provision for using abbreviated dialing code 41, TELEX address 0023089406 may be used via COMSAT. Please note that the ship will incur telecommunication charges for any messages sent to TELEX address 0023089406 using any Inmarsat earth station other than COMSAT. Some common mistakes include: (1) failure to end the message with five periods when using INMARSAT A, (2) failure to include BBXX in the message preamble, (3) incorrectly coding the Date, Time, Latitude, Longitude, or quadrant of the globe, (4) requesting a confirmation (which increases cost to NWS). Using The SEAS/AMVER Software The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in cooperation with the U.S. Coast Guard Automated Mutual-assistance VEssel Rescue program (AMVER) and COMSAT, has developed a PC software package known as AMVER/SEAS which simplifies the creation of AMVER and meteorological (BBXX) reports. The U.S. Coast Guard is able to accept, at no cost to the ship, AMVER reports transmitted via Inmarsat-C in a compressed binary format, created using the AMVER/SEAS program. Typically, in the past, the cost of transmission for AMVER messages has been assumed by the vessel. When ships participate in both the SEAS and AMVER programs, the position of ship provided in the meteorological report is forwarded to the Coast Guard as a supplementary AMVER position report to maintain a more accurate plot. To obtain the AMVER/SEAS program contact your U.S. PMO or AMVER/SEAS representative listed at the beginning of this handbook. If using the NOAA AMVER/SEAS software, follow the instructions outlined in the AMVER/SEAS User 's Manual. When using Inmarsat-C, use the compressed binary format and 8-bit X.25 (PSDN) addressing (31102030798481), rather than TELEX if possible when reporting weather. Common errors when using the AMVER/SEAS include sending the compressed binary message via the code 41 or a plain text message via the X.25 address. Only COMSAT can accept messages in the compressed Continued on Page 55  54 Mariners Weather Log   VOS Program VOS Program Continued from Page 54 binary format. Text editors should not be utilized in sending the data in the compressed binary format as this will corrupt the message. Telephone (Landline, Cellular, Satphone, Etc.) The following stations will accept VOS weather observations via telephone. Please note that the ship will be responsible for the cost of the call in this case. GLOBE WIRELESS MARITEL WLO 650-726-6588 228-897-7700 334-666-5110  The National Weather Service is developing a dial-in bulletin board to accept weather observations using a simple PC program and modem. The ship will be responsible for the cost of the call when using this system.

New Recruits  May through August 1998 During the four-month period ending August 31, 1998, PMOs recruited 33 vessels as weather observers/ reporters in the National Weather Service (NWS) Voluntary Observing Ship (VOS) Program. Thank you for joining the program. All Voluntary Observing Ships are asked to follow the worldwide weather reporting schedule--by reporting weather four times daily at 0000, 0600, 1200, and 1800 UTC. The United States and Canada have a threehourly weather reporting schedule from coastal waters out 200 miles from shore, and from anywhere on the Great Lakes. From these coastal areas, please report weather at 0000, 0300, 0600, 0900, 1200, 1500, 1800, and 2100 ZULU or UTC, whenever possible. Continued on Page 65 64 Mariners Weather Log   VOS Program VOS Program Continued from Page 64  PMOs attend SEAS/AMVER Training National Weather Service PMOs attended one of two SEAS/AMVER training sessions held at COMSAT headquarters in Bethesda, Maryland, near Washington, D.C., September 15-16, 1998, and November 3-4, 1998. The purpose of the training was for the PMOs to become familiar with the software and help them provide training to ship's officers. Also present at the meetings were Vince Zegowitz (Marine Observations Program Leader), Martin Baron (Assistant Program Leader, Marine Observations), Tim Rulon (GMDSS Program Manager), Bill Woodward (head of the SEAS Program Office, who led the effort to develop the software), and SEAS Field Representatives Jim Farrington (Norfolk) and Warren Krug (Miami).

At most stations, air temperature, water temperature, wind speed and direction are sampled once per second during an 8.0-minute averaging period each hour (moored buoys) and a 2.0-minute averaging period for fixed stations (C-MAN). Contact NDBC Data Systems Division, Bldg. 1100, SSC, Mississippi 39529 or phone (601) 688-1720 for more details.

GX007-08-13827616	"Space     Science News home              Scientists Present 1998 Earth-Temperature Trends        Updated 20-year temperature record     unveiled at 1999 AMS Meeting                            January     12, 1999 : Since late1978, polar-orbiting satellites have     monitored the microwave emissions from oxygen in the Earth's     atmosphere. These emissions, measured with the Microwave Sounding     Unit (MSU) instruments aboard TIROS-N weather satellites, are     proportional to the temperature of the atmosphere, and have allowed     scientists to build a 20-year record of the temperature of the     Earth as measured from space.        Today at the 10th Symposium on Global Change Studies,  Dr. John Christy  of the     University of Alabama in Huntsville,  Dr.     Roy Spencer  of NASA/Marshall Space Flight Center, and Dr.     W. D. Braswell of Nichols Research Corp. will present and discuss     the addition of 1998 data to the two-decade global temperature     trend they have assembled. Each works at the  Global     Hydrology and Climate Center  in Huntsville, Alabama, and     their paper is part of the 79th annual meeting of the American     Meteorological Society in Dallas, TX.                        T he global satellite temperature measurements     are obtained from nine different satellites, and provide a record     of the temperature in two regions of the Earth's atmosphere:     the lower troposphere (the lowest 5 miles of the atmosphere)     and the lower stratosphere (covering an altitude range of about     9-12 miles).        The resulting time series shows the temperature trend in the     lower troposphere is zero for 1979-97. At the same time, the     temperature of the lower stratosphere has declined at a rate     of -0.6 degrees C per decade. The warm El-Niño/Southern     Oscillation of 1998 caused the warmest monthly temperature anomalies     of any observed to date, with April and May 1998 near +0.7 C     above the base period mean of 1982-91.                                                    Sign up for         our EXPRESS SCIENCE NEWS delivery                                          "" E very year, of course, we add     another 12 months to the temperature trend,"" said Christy.     ""But 1998 was particularly interesting. While two previous     strong El-Niños occurred in the past 20 years, this is     the first one that occurs without a simultaneous volcanic eruption.""     El-Niño warming events and the eruptions of Mt. Pinatubo     in 1991 and El Chichon in 1983 have been the most influential     events on the temperature trend to date.        ""Obviously, El Niños are part of the natural weather     cycle, and shouldn't be discounted,"" said Christy. ""When     we look at long-term trends, however, we shouldn't assign excess     importance to individual unusual or extreme short-term events,     such as this El Niño or the cooling that followed the     eruption of the Pinatubo volcano in 1991.""        The lower tropospheric data are often cited as evidence against     global warming, because they have as yet failed to show any significant     warming trend when averaged over the entire Earth. The lower     stratospheric data show a significant cooling trend, which is     consistent with ozone depletion. In addition to the recent cooling,     large temporary warming perturbations may be seen in the data     due to two major volcanic eruptions: El Chichon in March 1982,     and Mt. Pinatubo in June 1991.

Last August,     a paper published in the Journal  Nature  demonstrated that     these data required corrections to account for drift of the satellites'     orbits. ""When the need for some of the corrections was first     noticed, people applied them to the entire dataset. However,     this isn't correct, as the data are compiled from nine different     satellites, each with it's own necessary adjustments.""        Christy, Spencer, and Braswell have accounted for orbital     decay, diurnal drift, and instrument-body temperature feedback     individually from each of the nine spacecraft instruments, and     then merged the data sets to derive the twenty-year temperature     trend.                          "" W e can also check the satellite     data against other independent measurements of temperature, in     particular balloon-borne instrumentation that measure the temperature      in-situ ,"" noted Christy. The figure below compares     the MSU satellite temperature measurements (in red) against two     dataset in the tropics (between 20 degrees south latitude and     20 degrees north latitude). The first independent comparison     data set, compiled by the UK Meteorological Office and known     by the name ""HadRT2.1"" is shown in green, consisting     of independent balloon observations. The second comparison dataset     is from weather maps of temperature at about 5.8 km altitude,     from the National Center for Environmental Prediction, National     Weather Service, NOAA, and is shown in blue.               "" T he tropical region was the region     criticized in the past year as being the region of greatest errors     in the MSU. However, a direct comparison of the data shows that     the agreement is astounding between these different tropical     temperature data sets,"" Christy said.        S urface temperature measurements for     1998 show this to be the warmest year this century. In contrast     to the gradual warming of the surface over the past 20 years,     the tropospheric measurement from MSU showed no trend until the     major warm El Niño event of '98.

In       response to these, as well as other long-term climate concerns, NOAA has established       routine monitoring programs utilizing both ground-based and satellite measurement       techniques (OFCM, 1988).                Selected indicators of stratospheric climate are presented in each Summary from       information contributed by NOAA personnel. A Summary for the Northern Hemisphere is issued       each April, and for the Southern Hemisphere, each December. These Summaries are available       on the World- Wide-Web, at the site                 http:/ /www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov                with location:  products/stratosphere/winter_bulletins .

For 2001, the area covered by  extremely low total ozone values of less than 220 Dobson Units, defined as the Antarctic “ozone hole”,  was the third largest on record for October and November.  The ozone hole reached maximum size in September  and remained large through early October, then gradually decreased in size and ended in early December.   October anomalies of greater than  40 percent below the 1979-1986 base period were observed over Antarctica,  with negative anomalies of more than 10 percent also observed over southern South America.  Vertical  profiles of ozone amounts measured by balloons over the South Pole at the end of September and early  October 2001 showed essentially total destruction of ozone in the 15-20 km region, similar to observations  during other recent years. The minimum total ozone value of 101 Dobson Units, observed on October 4, 2001 at  the South Pole, was not as low as the record low value of 86 DU observed in 1993.  Lower stratosphere  temperatures over the Antarctic region in 2001 were again  low.  Temperatures below -78 C ( sufficiently low  for polar stratospheric cloud formation) occurred over a large region, thus promoting chemical  ozone loss.   At northern mid-latitudes, extensive ozone destruction was observed in the years following the massive  eruption of the Pinatubo volcano (approximately 1992-1996), with smaller losses observed in the past few years.   Uncertainties in the estimates of future ozone depletion include possible coupling to changes in water vapor  and carbon dioxide.  However, in the absence of further major eruptions, ozone depletion over much of the  globe is not expected to worsen substantially in the coming decade, because international actions have been  successful in reducing the release of ozone-depleting substances.          I.  DATA RESOURCES                  The data used for this report are listed below. This combination of complementary data,       from different platforms and sensors, provides a strong capability to monitor global ozone       and temperature.                  Method of Observation                                        Parameter               Ground-Based             Satellite/Instrument                                   Total Ozone             Dobson             NOAA/ SBUV/2                                                          Nimbus-7/SBUV                                  Ozone Profiles             Balloon-Ozonesonde              NOAA/ SBUV/2                                                          Nimbus-7/SBUV                                 Temperature Profiles             Balloon - Radiosonde             NOAA/TOVS                                         We have used total column ozone data from the NASA Nimbus-7  SBUV instrument from 1979 through February1985; NOAA-9 SBUV/2  from March 1985 to December 1989; NOAA-11 SBUV/2 from January 1989 to December 1993; NOAA-9 SBUV/2  from January 1994 to December 1995; NOAA-14 SBUV/2 from January 1996 to June 1998; NOAA-11 SBUV/2 from July 1998 to September 2000; and NOAA-16 SBUV/2 from October 2000.  Solar Backscatter Ultra-Violet (SBUV) instruments can produce data only for daylight-viewing conditions, so SBUV/2 data are not available at polar latitudes during winter darkness.  Increasing loss of NOAA-11 data at sub-polar latitudes from 1989 to1993 was caused by satellite precession, resulting in SBUV/2 viewing high latitudes only in darkness.  Recent NOAA-11 and NOAA-16 total ozone data have not yet been fully validated.  This impacts trends determined for the recent period.         II.  DISCUSSION             Figure 1  displays monthly average anomaly values (percent) of  zonal mean total ozone, as a function of latitude and time, from January 1979 to November 2001.  The anomalies are derived relative to each month's 1979-2001 average. Certain aspects of  long-term global ozone changes may be readily seen.  In the polar regions, ozone values have been substantially lower in the 1990s than in the 1980s.  Largest anomalies are shown for the polar regions in each hemisphere in winter-spring months, with positive anomalies of more than 10 percent in the earlier years changing to negative anomalies of greater than 10 percent for most recent years.  In September 2001, around 75 degrees south latitude, negative anomalies exceeded 26 percent (more than 52 percent lower than in earlier years), and were about 20 percent lower than average in October and November 2001.  At  midlatitudes, the anomalies also change from largely positive in the early years to negative in the 1990s.  Little or no significant trend is seen over the tropical region, but alternating years of positive and negative anomalies are seen, as part of a quasi-biennial oscillation.  At the end of  2001, positive anomalies were evident in the tropical region.       A map of monthly average  Southern Hemisphere SBUV/2 total ozone for October 2001 is  shown in  Figure 2 , with lowest ozone values displaced from the pole.   ""Ozone hole"" values  (defined as total ozone values less than 220) are shown over the South Atlantic sector of the Antarctic continent, with highest ozone over the Antarctic sector near the international dateline.   Figure 3  shows the difference in percent between the monthly mean total ozone for October 2001 and eight (1979-86) monthly means for October (Nagatani et al., 1988).  Negative anomalies in total ozone of up to 40 percent are shown over the South Atlantic sector of the Antarctic continent, and more than 10  percent below average values are also evident over southern South America.       Figure 4  compares for each year since 1979 the ozone hole area average for all days in October through November.   The growth in the ozone hole area  from the 1980s to the 1990s is quite apparent.  From a very small area in 1982, October-November average values increased dramatically to a maximum in 1998 of 16.2 million square kilometers. The October-November 2001 average ozone hole area value was 15.9 million square kilometers, much larger than the ozone hole area in 2000, and only a little smaller than the two previous  years.  September data for all years were not included for this calculation because SBUV/2 data over the South Polar region were not available in early September for years 1992, 1993, and 1995.      The center of the ozone hole, and associated lowest ozone, is often located close to the South Pole.   Figure 5  shows a time series during 2001 of ozone profiles  over the South Pole, measured using balloon-borne ozone instruments.  The appearance of anomalously low  ozone hole values is seen to begin in mid August, with extremely low values evident at the end of September  and in early October.  The  ozone destruction, especially in the 15 to 20 km region, is dramatic.    Figure 6  illustrates the change in ozone profiles measured  at the South Pole.  On 4 October 2001, 101 DU total column ozone amount was observed, the minimum value  for the year 2001.  This is compared with the profile on 8 July, with total ozone amount of 271 DU.  The decrease in total ozone between these two dates is 62 percent.  The 4 October profile shows nearly  complete destruction of ozone between 14 and 20 km.  The figure also shows the  region where temperatures  on 4 October were lower than -78 C.  In the region of low temperatures and chemical ozone depletion from  enhanced human produced chlorine and bromine, the 4 October profile shows markedly less ozone than the profile of 8 July.  This clearly demonstrates the value of vertical profile information in helping to understand the ozone depletion phenomenon and the processes responsible for changes in the total column amounts.         Figure 7  presents a time series at the South Pole of total column ozone, integrated from balloon-borne ozone measurements.  Minimum ozone amounts at the South Pole Station in 2001 are seen at the end of September and in early October.    Total ozone values were not as low during September as values for this time period for 2000, but values remained very low longer in 2001 than in 2000.  The extremely low total ozone values in early September likely reflected ozone depleted air which had previously been exposed to sunlight prior to moving over the South Pole.      Antarctic ozone depletion has occurred primarily between the altitudes of 12 and 20 km.  This is a region where polar stratospheric clouds form.   Figure 8  shows 12-20 km column ozone integrated from the balloon-borne ozone measurements at the South Pole. In 2001 the values were generally as low as in any previous year.  Large depletion rates are expected for the next decade or more, after which declining stratospheric chlorine amounts should result in slow recovery of stratospheric ozone.         Ozone amounts in the lower stratosphere are closely coupled to temperatures through dynamics and photochemistry.  Extremely low stratospheric temperatures (lower than -78 C) over the Antarctic region are believed to contribute to depletion of ozone, in that  low temperatures lead to the presence of polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs).  PSCs enhance the production and lifetime of reactive chlorine, leading to ozone depletion  (WMO, 1999).  Daily minimum temperatures over the polar region, 65S to 90S at 50 hPa (approximately 19 km) are shown in  Figure 9 .    For most of the southern hemisphere winter 2001, minimum temperatures in the polar region were low, but not near record low values.  However, minimum temperatures in late September, October and November were near record lows.  Minimum temperatures were sufficiently low (lower than -78 C) during May to November for polar stratospheric clouds to form and allow enhanced ozone depletion, in the presence of sunlight.   Figure 10  shows monthly average temperature anomalies at 50 hPa for three latitude regions, 25N-25S, 25S-65S, and 65S-90S.  For the polar region, temperatures for  October and November were 3 to 4 C  lower than the long-term average.  Negative temperature anomalies also predominated over the middle and tropical latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere.        Figure 11  presents time series of the area of the ozone hole, the size of the polar vortex, and the size of the polar area where lower stratosphere temperatures were below -78C.  The 2001 values are shown along with the average daily values and the maximum and minimum daily values for the most recent 10 years.  During 2001 the area for all three of these indicators was larger than average.  Indeed the ozone hole area and the polar vortex area were among the largest of recent years.      Figure 12  illustrates the direct relationship between the persistence of the ozone hole region and the persistence of the Antarctic polar vortex.  In years when the winter polar vortex persisted later in the season, the duration into the Spring season of the ozone hole also tended to be extended.  For the year 2001, the persistence of the ozone hole and the persistence of the Southern Hemisphere polar vortex were among the greatest for the years since 1982.  Indeed, 5 out of the most recent 7 years have had the longest duration of winter vortex and ozone hole.                            III.  CONCLUDING REMARKS           Very low ozone values were observed over Antarctica again in 2001.   Ozone depletion of 10 percent to more than 40 percent was observed over Antarctica compared to total ozone amounts observed in the early 1980's.  Vertical soundings over the South Pole during late September and early October 2001 again showed complete destruction of ozone at altitudes between 15 and 20 km.  Lower stratosphere temperatures in the winter and spring of 2001 over the Antarctic region were below average values, and were sufficiently low for ozone production of polar stratospheric clouds within the polar vortex.   The ozone hole area and the PSC area were again among the largest of all previous years.   For the year 2001, the ozone hole and Southern Hemisphere polar vortex persisted into December,  again among the longest duration of years since 1982.       Observations of chloroflourocarbons and of stratospheric hydrogen chloride support the view that international actions are reducing the use and release of ozone depleting substances (WMO, 1999; Anderson et al., 2000).  However, chemicals already in the atmosphere are expected to continue to deplete ozone for many decades to come.  Further, changing atmospheric conditions that modulate ozone can complicate the task of detecting the start of ozone layer recovery.  The eruption of the Pinatubo volcano provided an example of such a complication in the 1990s.  Based on an analysis of 10 years of South Pole ozone vertical profile measurements, Hofmann et al., (1997) estimated that recovery in the Antarctic ozone hole may be detected as early as the coming decade.  Indicators include: 1) an end to springtime ozone depletion at 22-24 km, 2) 12-20 km mid-September column ozone loss rate of less than 3 DU per day, and 3) a 12-20 km ozone column of more than 70 DU on September 15.  However, an intriguing aspect of recent observations of the Antarctic stratosphere is the apparent trend towards a later breakup of the vortex, as shown in Figure 12.  A full explanation of such meteorological anomalies is not yet available.  Continued monitoring and measurements, including total ozone and its vertical profile, are essential to achieving the understanding needed to identify ozone recovery.

GX005-51-14130809	"Screen readers:  Skip navigation                                                                                                                                                           1996 Features   Highs and Lows of Temperature   by Mike Meshek     Any assessment of global climate change requires substantial temperature records that researchers must build from the ground up. Historically, scientists assembled these from thermometer measurements made at the Earth's surface since the last century. Over the past six years, however, two scientists have constructed an 18-year atmospheric temperature record from satellite data.    ""Global warming is a huge puzzle, and we've got a very important piece of the puzzle,"" said Roy Spencer of NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center and the Global Hydrology and Climate Center. Spencer's puzzle piece is the new satellite record, which he compiled with the help of John Christy of the University of Alabama in Huntsville. The record, which suggests that the Earth's atmosphere is more complex than previously thought, is invaluable for its precision but controversial when compared with the surface record.    Over the past century, temperature measurements made at the Earth's surface indicate warming of about 1 degree Fahrenheit, a trend that has been increasing in rate over the last two decades. For 1979 through 1996 - the period covered by Spencer and Christy's satellite record - the surface and atmopheric records are not in agreement. For this period of overlap, the surface record indicates warming at about 0.24 degrees F (0.14 degrees Celsius) per decade, while the satellite record shows the atmosphere cooling at about 0.07 degrees F (0.04 degrees Celsius) per decade, according to Christy.    ""That decoupling between the surface and the troposphere above is a feature of the atmosphere that's very intriguing. We can't explain it yet, and certainly models haven't been able to reproduce it,"" said Christy. ""We don't expect the temperature trends to continue to diverge,"" added Spencer. ""We think that the amount of divergence so far is possibly real but we wouldn't expect it to go on indefinitely. At some point, it becomes physically unrealistic. We would expect them to be much closer to each other in another five or 10 years.""    Although they are complementary, historical thermometer measurements and the satellite record constitute fundamentally different ways of looking at the planet's temperature, Christy said. While the thermometer data are temporally extensive, the satellite data are evenly distributed and cover remote parts of the planet not covered by thermometers.    The two temperature records were the subject of much discussion in a special session on global warming at the American Meteorological Society's February 1997 meeting. The following month, two National Center for Atmospheric Research scientists added new dimension to the ongoing discussion by challenging the integrity of the satellite record itself.    The divergence of the surface and satellite records may not be resolved until this most recent challenge is answered. Nevertheless, in June 1996 the international entity charged by the World Meteorological Organization and the U.N. Environment Programme with assessing climate change concluded that the imprint of human activity on climate can be clearly seen. Citing trends observed in the surface record (and modeling observations), the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), said ""The balance of evidence suggests that there is a discernible human influence on global climate.""    However, because the satellite record does disagree with the temperature trends seen in the surface record, the satellite data have been widely covered by the popular press and discussed in policy circles. The data are often cited by those who dispute the 1996 IPCC statement or the veracity of global temperature increases shown by the surface record.    While waiting for the two temperature records to converge, climate change scientists are deliberating another interesting feature apparently revealed by the satellite record: the atmosphere's vertical complexity. The satellite record indicates warming in the upper troposphere (a region extending from approximately five to eight miles above the Earth's surface), but a slight cooling trend in the lower troposphere and a rather large cooling trend in the lower stratosphere.    Atmospheric temperatures may owe their vertical variation, in part, Christy said, to the forces that produce them. They are driven from below by sea surface temperatures, affected from above by aerosols from volcanoes, and influenced by other factors, including the loss of atmospheric ozone. Before Christy and Spencer compiled the satellite record, the only available atmospheric temperature measurements were  taken by thermometers sent aloft on weather balloons.    In 1990, Spencer and Christy developed the technique with which scientists were first able to glean accurate estimates of global atmospheric temperatures from satellite measurements. The technique derives temperatures from satellite measurements of microwave radiation emitted by molecular oxygen. The measurements have been made by Microwave Sounding Units (MSUs) flown on NOAA satellites since 1979. The temperature data sets that Spencer and Christy retrieved from MSU data consist of precise global monthly temperature determinations for the troposphere and lower stratosphere.    Although the global warming puzzle obviously can't be solved with a single piece, the satellite record is ""often used by others in an attempt to prove things we don't think can be proved [by the record],"" said Spencer. ""The record is short in the context of global warming, but it is the longest record we have from satellites. With it, we've been able to monitor changes in the climate system over very short time scales with high precision over the whole Earth, which thermometers can't do.""    With its precision, the MSU data also offer distinct modeling advantages. Because models can experimentally identify what causes, or ""forces"" temperature changes, ""a model that could reproduce a precise record like this would show us how the forcing worked on the atmosphere,"" said Christy.    Also, because the satellite data are precise, ""they are quite valuable in defining small changes and showing us small responses to small forcings - letting us judge how the entire globe might respond to changes in forcing,"" said Christy. (Such forcings include volcanic eruptions like that of Mount Pinatubo in 1991, which registers clearly in the satellite record as increased temperatures in the lower stratosphere.)    Finally, the satellite record will also assist models in understanding variability that occurs in places like the South Atlantic and South Pacific oceans, where temperatures have never been well-measured, Christy said.    Scientists assessing global climate change must consider that thermometer measurements historically made over land areas like the northern continents show more variability than temperature measurements made by either thermometers or satellites over the more stable oceans, Christy said. In the future, a complement of satellite and in-situ temperature measurements will address this concern. Satellite data provide accurate measures of temperature, but only for broad vertical layers. Because scientists need to know the temperature at as many levels as possible, the atmospheric record could be enhanced by thermometer measurements made from weather balloons in existing monitoring networks, said Christy.    In coming years, the MSU record will be extended by Advanced Microwave Sounding Units (AMSUs), to be launched on both the NASA Earth Observing System (EOS) PM satellite and NOAA-K satellites. In addition to monitoring the troposphere and lower stratosphere, the AMSU instrument will measure temperatures closer to the Earth's surface with more channels, less noise, and better spatial resolution, said Spencer.    Spencer and Christy will append AMSU data to the MSU record to make the world's longest satellite temperature record even longer. ""We've demonstrated the MSU system's ability to monitor the climate quite precisely,"" Christy said, ""and we expect only better information from the next generation of satellites. Our goal is to provide the most precise data possible, so that we can understand why this climate system does what it does.""       What's Up with the Atmosphere?  The record compiled by Spencer and Christy consists of precise temperature data derived from Microwave Sounding Units (MSUs) flown on different satellites. In a letter to  Nature  (March 13, 1997), James Hurrel and Kevin Trenberth argue that the MSU record is suspect precisely because ""there is no single satellite record,"" and thus, ""different tropospheric measures of temperature from the MSUs contain different trends and different error characteristics.""    Hurrel and Trenberth, of the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), concluded that although the MSU data are ""excellent for examining interannual variability of tropospheric temperature,"" the MSU record contains ""spurious trends"" produced by satellite measurement ""noise,"" orbit inconsistencies, and errors introduced during transitions from one satellite to the next. After analysis of the satellite record with these concerns in mind, the NCAR scientists said that the satellite record actually shows slight warming rather than cooling trends in the atmosphere.    Spencer and Christy remain confident of the satellite record's integrity, and argue that sufficient temporal overlap of instruments occurs during satellite transitions. Moreover, the atmospheric temperatures are validated, they said, by thermometer measurements made from weather balloons called radiosondes. ""A big strength of the MSU is that it's been independently validated by radiosondes. Wherever the MSU detected a radiosonde, a check of the two shows they're in substantial agreement,"" Christy said.    Spencer and Christy will soon respond to Hurrel and Trenberth's challenge.

GX003-60-1784100	November 19, 2003   Volcanic Eruptions May Affect El Niño Onset   A new study by scientists at the University of Virginia (UVa) in Charlottesville and the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in Boulder, Colorado, suggests that explosive volcanic eruptions in the tropics may increase the probability of an El Niño event occurring during the winter following the eruption. The research was funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF).    “The El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is the dominant mode of interannual climate variability on the planet,” says NCAR scientist Caspar Ammann. “When thinking about long-term climate, we must ask whether this system itself undergoes changes, perhaps in response to changes in radiative forcing or in the background climate itself. Our findings, based on two reconstructions, suggest that it indeed might.”    When a volcano erupts in the tropics, its aerosol emissions spread into the stratosphere across the northern and southern hemispheres, reflecting some of the sun’s heat back toward space and thereby cooling the Earth’s atmosphere. This cooling alters the interaction between the oceans and atmosphere, possibly encouraging a warming response in the Pacific Ocean as the massive body of water attempts to restore an initial equilibrium.    “Our results suggest that the atmospheric cooling from an eruption may help nudge the climate system towards producing an El Niño event,” said Michael Mann, an environmental scientist at the University of Virginia. The study results will appear in the November 20 issue of the journal Nature.    “This research illustrates the value of paleoclimate studies that draw on research from disparate fields to uncover connections,” said David Verardo, director of NSF’s paleoclimate program, which funded the research. “Studies of modern climate conditions gleaned from thermometers and barometers can only get you so far. Challenging the conventional wisdom, as this research does, is necessary to achieve a comprehensive understanding of Earth’s climate,” he said.    Some scientists had previously noted that during the 20th century, El Niño eventsthe periodic warming of sea surface temperatures in the equatorial Pacifictended to follow the eruption of volcanoes in the tropics. But that 100-year period, the only time span for which reliable instrumental records were kept, was considered too short a duration to substantiate a link between the two phenomena. The connection was thought to be coincidental. “So we turned to the paleoarchives for a longer history,” Mann said. “We actually didn’t expect the relationship to hold up in the long run.”    The scientists instead found that, when looking back over a 350-year period, as far back as paleorecords allow, there was credible evidence that volcanic activity in the tropics may play a significant role in the occurrence of El Niño events. “We now have a long record showing that the relationship between volcanic eruptions and an increased probability of El Niño events continues to hold up over several centuries,” Mann said. “It’s probably not just a fluke.”    Mann, Ammann, and UVa scientist Brad Adams used the paleoclimate records stored in ice cores, corals, and tree ring records to reconstruct El Niño events. They used independent ice-core volcanic dust evidence to reconstruct volcanic activity back to the early 1700s.    The paleoclimate records are called ‘proxy records’ because they are not direct measurements of current climate and ocean conditions, but instead are reconstructions of past conditions gleaned from the physical, biological, or chemical records or, “signatures,” stored in natural archives in the environment. Using these records, the scientists were able to precisely identify the years when eruptions occurred and the years when El Niño events occurred.    When they counted, year by year, the separate events and brought them together for comparison, they found that there was a nearly one-in-two chance that an El Niño event will occur after a volcanic eruption in the tropical zone, roughly double the normal probability. “I wouldn’t call this a tight connection  it’s not a one-to-one relationship,” Mann said, “but it appears that the eruption of a tropical volcano nudges the climate towards a more El Niño-like state.”    El Niño is a prominent altering factor on world climate, affecting weather patterns for months and years, often causing drought and severe weather in different parts of the world. “We seek to understand how El Niño responds to changes in natural factors such as volcanic activity in part, so we can potentially better understand how El Niño might respond to more recent human influences on climate,” Mann said.    Adams added that the findings might help oceanographers and atmospheric scientists to make better probabilistic forecasts of El Niño activity. “This is not a strictly predictive tool, but it may help in anticipating the odds that an El Niño event might occur in a given period,” Adams said.    ###   Contact:   Cheryl Dybas   National Science Foundation   703-292-7734    cdybas@nsf.gov This text derived from  http://www.eurekalert.org/bysubject/atmospheric.php     Recommend this Article to a Friend    Back to:   News                              Subscribe to the Earth Observatory   About the Earth Observatory   Please send comments or questions to:  eobmail@eodomo.gsfc.nasa.gov    Responsible NASA official: Yoram Kaufman  NASA/GSFC Security and Privacy Statement

These events can also provide a useful test of climatic response          to short-term forcing. Building on earlier work ( Angell,          1993 ), we have recently used radiosonde data to investigate effects          of eruptions on the vertical temperature profile, showing the detailed          structure of stratospheric cooling and tropospheric warming from the Agung,          El Chichon and Pinatubo eruptions. The tropospheric warming differs at          different levels, potentially affecting differential trends at those levels.           These results  can be          compared with the effects predicted by climate models for these eruptions.         Group members          have also studied volcanic effects on surface temperature over longer          time periods. To understand these effects it is useful to have a measure          of past climatically-significant volcanic activity. Measurements of sulfate          ions and electroconductivity in ice cores provide one source of such information.          Collaborative work is underway to develop an improved index of past volcanic          forcing from ice core data, which will then be used at NCAR to model the          effects of volcanoes over the past several hundred years.

GX003-30-2598576	"Scientists Present 1998 Earth-Temperature Trends    Updated 20-year temperature record unveiled at 1999 AMS Meeting    Originally Published: 1/12/99    Since late1978, polar-orbiting satellites have monitored the microwave emissions from oxygen in the Earth's atmosphere. These emissions, measured with the Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU) instruments aboard TIROS-N weather satellites, are proportional to the temperature of the atmosphere, and have allowed scientists to build a 20-year record of the temperature of the Earth as measured from space.    Today at the 10th Symposium on Global Change Studies,  Dr. John Christy  of the University of Alabama in Huntsville,  Dr. Roy Spencer  of NASA/Marshall Space Flight Center, and Dr. W. D. Braswell of Nichols Research Corp. will present and discuss the addition of 1998 data to the two-decade global temperature trend they have assembled. Each works at the  Global Hydrology and Climate Center  in Huntsville, Alabama, and their paper is part of the 79th annual meeting of the American Meteorological Society in Dallas, TX.    The global satellite temperature measurements are obtained from nine different satellites, and provide a record of the temperature in two regions of the Earth's atmosphere: the lower troposphere (the lowest 5 miles of the atmosphere) and the lower stratosphere (covering an altitude range of about 9-12 miles).    The resulting time series shows the temperature trend in the lower troposphere is zero for 1979-97. At the same time, the temperature of the lower stratosphere has declined at a rate of -0.6 degrees C per decade. The warm El-Niño/Southern Oscillation of 1998 caused the warmest monthly temperature anomalies of any observed to date, with April and May 1998 near +0.7 C above the base period mean of 1982-91.       ""Every year, of course, we add another 12 months to the temperature trend,"" said Christy. ""But 1998 was particularly interesting. While two previous strong El-Niños occurred in the past 20 years, this is the first one that occurs without a simultaneous volcanic eruption."" El-Niño warming events and the eruptions of Mt. Pinatubo in 1991 and El Chichon in 1983 have been the most influential events on the temperature trend to date.    ""Obviously, El Niños are part of the natural weather cycle, and shouldn't be discounted,"" said Christy. ""When we look at long-term trends, however, we shouldn't assign excess importance to individual unusual or extreme short-term events, such as this El Niño or the cooling that followed the eruption of the Pinatubo volcano in 1991.""    The lower tropospheric data are often cited as evidence against global warming, because they have as yet failed to show any significant warming trend when averaged over the entire Earth. The lower stratospheric data show a significant cooling trend, which is consistent with ozone depletion. In addition to the recent cooling, large temporary warming perturbations may be seen in the data due to two major volcanic eruptions: El Chichon in March 1982, and Mt. Pinatubo in June 1991.       ""We've incorporated some essential corrections to the data,"" noted Roy Spencer. Last August, a paper published in the Journal  Nature  demonstrated that these data required corrections to account for drift of the satellites' orbits. ""When the need for some of the corrections was first noticed, people applied them to the entire dataset. However, this isn't correct, as the data are compiled from nine different satellites, each with it's own necessary adjustments.""    Christy, Spencer, and Braswell have accounted for orbital decay, diurnal drift, and instrument-body temperature feedback individually from each of the nine spacecraft instruments, and then merged the data sets to derive the twenty-year temperature trend.    ""We can also check the satellite data against other independent measurements of temperature, in particular balloon-borne instrumentation that measure the temperature  in-situ ,"" noted Christy. The figure below compares the MSU satellite temperature measurements (in red) against two dataset in the tropics (between 20 degrees south latitude and 20 degrees north latitude). The first independent comparison data set, compiled by the UK Meteorological Office and known by the name ""HadRT2.1"" is shown in green, consisting of independent balloon observations. The second comparison dataset is from weather maps of temperature at about 5.8 km altitude, from the National Center for Environmental Prediction, National Weather Service, NOAA, and is shown in blue.

Few                phrases elicit so much controversy today. But is our climate truly                changing? And if it is, do we know why it is changing?                 At the United Nations, the                Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) certainly thinks                the world is getting warmer and puts much of the blame on human                activity. In its 2001 Third Assessment Report, the IPCC projects                that average global temperature will increase by 1.6° to 6°C                by 2100.                  The report indicates that,                globally, the 1990s were the warmest decade on record, with 1998                the single warmest year. Accompanying this global-scale temperature                increase were changes in other climate variables, such as precipitation,                snow cover, glacier extent, and sea level. The changes in these                variables are broadly consistent with the IPCC’s estimate that                Earth’s surface warmed by roughly 0.6°C over the 20th century.                The 2001 IPCC report concluded that “there is new and stronger                evidence that most of the warming observed over the last 50 years                is attributable to human activity.”                 Atmospheric carbon dioxide                and other trace gases help keep our planet warm by absorbing some                of the Sun’s heat that the Earth would otherwise emit back                into space. This natural greenhouse effect makes Earth’s surface                about 34°C warmer than it would be without greenhouse gases.                But human activities, such as the burning of fossil fuels, have                added greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. Atmospheric carbon dioxide                levels, for example, have increased by about 30 percent since the                beginning of the Industrial Revolution. This human-caused enhancement                of the natural greenhouse effect has contributed to the warming                of the planet over the last century.                 Climate change can occur                even in the absence of human activities. The climate system is like                a bell that rings in a certain way. One form of “ringing”                is the ocean warming phenomenon known as El Niño or its cooling                sister, La Niña. Such changes are thought to be due to the                internal variability of the climate system. But external events                can also cause natural climate changes. Large volcanic eruptions                can pump massive quantities of dust into the upper atmosphere (the                stratosphere). The dust may remain in the stratosphere for years,                cooling Earth’s surface by absorbing and reflecting some of                the incoming sunlight. Natural changes in the Sun’s energy                output and slow changes in Earth’s orbit can also influence                climate.                 Carbon dioxide and other                greenhouse gases get the most press, but there are other human influences                as well. Changes in land use can be a concern. For example, Livermore                scientists recently showed that human-caused changes in land-use                patterns (especially conversion of forests to farm land) may have                caused a gradual global cooling of approximately 0.25°C, mostly                before the 20th century.                                                                                         Globally                      averaged temperatures have changed at different levels in                      Earth’s atmosphere. This profile is from close to Earth’s                      surface through to the stratosphere. Temperatures are in the                      form of departures (anomalies) from long-term monthly means                      computed from 1979 to 1999 and are in degrees Celsius. The                      stratospheric warming caused by the El Chichón and                      Mount Pinatubo volcanic eruptions is clearly evident, as is                      the cooling of the lower atmosphere after Pinatubo. Results                      are from the so-called reanalysis project jointly performed                      by the National Center for Environmental Prediction and the                      National Center for Atmospheric Research.                                                                               Large-scale burning of rain                forests sends particulate matter into the lower atmosphere, warming                us. At the same time, with fewer trees, less carbon dioxide can                be absorbed from the atmosphere, which warms us further. Land surface                changes also affect Earth’s reflectivity, or albedo.                  If Earth is getting warmer,                is it possible to expose individual factors causing climate change?                And what will global warming mean on a regional level? Two Livermore                research teams are searching for—and finding—answers.                 Atmospheric scientist Ben                Santer, a 1998 John A. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation Fellow,                has used sophisticated climate models to separate the effects of                recent major volcanic eruptions and El Niños from other causes                of climate change. The motivation for this research was to shed                light on one of the outstanding puzzles in climate science: why                Earth’s surface has apparently warmed faster than the lower                atmosphere.                  At the same time, a team                led by physicist Philip Duffy has brought the highest resolution                yet to global climate modeling, revealing a wealth of regional effects                for the first time. Instead of a 300-kilometer grid—the previous                state of the art—Duffy’s team has been able to perform                global simulations using models with grid cell sizes of 75 and even                50 kilometers. These are the finest-resolution global climate simulations                performed to date. The figure below compares these resolutions.                                 Duffy’s work would not                be possible without Livermore’s massively parallel supercomputers,                which can quickly perform the computationally demanding calculations                inherent in global climate modeling. The first simulations using                the 50-kilometer grid ran on the Advanced Simulation and Computing                (ASCI) White computer during its initial, unclassified testing period                in December 2000. Because the ASCI White computer is now used exclusively                for classified computations, models used by Duffy’s group are                being run on other supercomputers at Livermore and at Lawrence Berkeley                National Laboratory.                  A 1-year simulation of global                climate using the 300-kilometer grid can now be accomplished in                4 or 5 hours. Five years ago, it would have taken over a day to                complete a comparable simulation. For the 50-kilometer grid, “At                best, we can do about a month of simulated climate in a day,”                says Duffy. A 50-kilometer grid for climate modeling was the stuff                of dreams 5 years ago.                                                                                         The                      topography of California and Nevada is simulated in models                      with (a) 300-kilometer and (b) 50-kilometer grids. Models                      that use the 300-kilometer grid have been the state of the                      art, but Livermore has developed a 50-kilometer-grid model.                      Even with 50-kilometer grids, the topography of California                      and Nevada is not represented. The Coast Range mountains are                      not visible in (b), and the data smoothing process lowers                      the elevation of the Sierra Nevada mountains.                                                                               Why                the Controversy?                 Much                of the controversy about global warming results from two apparent                contradictions. One relates to observed temperature data and the                other to the issue of how well computer models of the global climate                system can represent such observations.                 While Earth’s surface                has warmed by about 0.15° to 0.2°C per decade since 1979,                temperatures in the troposphere (the layer of the atmosphere extending                from Earth’s surface to 8 to 16 kilometers above it) have shown                little warming, and even a slight cooling.                 The apparent lack of tropospheric                warming from 1979 to the present has been used to cast doubt on                the reality of strong surface warming. It is important to understand                whether this difference between surface and tropospheric warming                rates is real or is an artifact of data problems. If this difference                is real, what factors might be causing it?                 The second puzzle relates                to the inability of many climate models to simulate the apparent                difference in surface and tropospheric warming rates. This inconsistency                is sometimes used to bolster arguments that models are inappropriate                tools for making projections of future climate change.                 Recent work by Santer and                his colleagues has addressed both of these puzzles. They have learned                that at least some of the differential warming of Earth’s surface                and lower troposphere is real and attributable to the combined effects                of stratospheric ozone depletion, volcanic eruptions, and natural                climate variability. Differences in the geographic regions sampled                by the surface thermometer network and the satellite-based tropospheric                temperature measurements also explain some of the divergent temperature                changes of the surface and troposphere.                 “But,” Santer concedes,                “accounting for these effects still does not fully explain                the different rates of temperature change. Nor does it explain why                models don’t reproduce this differential behavior accurately.”                                                                                                     Geographic                    patterns of annually averaged temperature anomalies in (a) the                    lower troposphere and (b) at Earth’s surface. Tropospheric                    temperature measurements are from polar-orbiting satellites,                    and surface measurements were made by thermometers. White areas                    denote missing data. Although the satellites have near-global                    coverage, the surface data have large gaps. Comparing satellite                    and surface data over areas of common coverage helps to explain                    some of the differential warming of the surface and troposphere.                    Anomalies are expressed relative to annual mean temperatures                    averaged over 1979 to 1998.                                                             A Search for Resolution                 For                several years, Santer has been working with other investigators                at Livermore and research institutions around the world to reconcile                the apparent contradictions in actual data and global climate models.                In one study of climate between 1979 and 1998, they discovered that                a model including anthropogenic (human-caused) factors and volcanic                aerosols produced surface–troposphere temperature differences                that were the closest yet to actual observed data.                  As a follow-up, they wanted                to examine the influence of volcanoes alone. But, says Santer, “We                had a bit of bad luck. Nature made our lives difficult. There was                a major El Niño in 1982, at the same time as the eruption                of El Chichón in Mexico. A smaller El Niño coincided                with the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines. This                made it tough to disentangle the effects that volcanoes and El Niños                had on surface and tropospheric temperatures.”                  Santer and his Livermore                colleagues had been doing similar work for the past 10 years. For                the first half of that time, they were trying to identify human-caused                climate signals in observed temperature records. This involved using                both model and observational climate data to understand the characteristic                fingerprints of the many natural and anthropogenic influences on                climate. (See the figure below.)                 Previous researchers had                attempted to remove the effects of explosive volcanic eruptions                and El Niños from surface and tropospheric temperatures so                they could obtain better estimates of the underlying human component                of climate change. But Santer’s team was the first to deal                fully with the correlation of volcanic eruptions and El Niños,                known in statistical problems as collinearity.                  The team’s observational                data were land and ocean surface temperatures compiled at the Climatic                Research Unit in Norwich, England, together with satellite-based                tropospheric temperature measurements. Their model data came from                a number of different sources: the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology                in Hamburg, Germany, the Goddard Institute for Space Studies in                New York, and the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder,                Colorado. Researchers from all of these organizations participated                in the team. Other team members were with Livermore’s Program                for Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison, which routinely                develops methods and tools for the diagnosis, validation, and intercomparison                of global climate models.                                                                                                     (a)                    Atmospheric temperature changes predicted to occur in response                    to a doubling of preindustrial levels of carbon dioxide. (b)                    Projected temperature response to a 2-percent increase in the                    Sun’s energy output. Each factor that influences our climate                    has a characteristic “fingerprint.” Scientists typically                    use computer models of the climate system to gain information                    on these fingerprints. In a model, it is possible to study the                    climatic effects of a single influence only, such as changes                    in atmospheric carbon dioxide. This is not feasible in the real                    world, where multiple factors that influence climate are changing                    simultaneously. Both (a) and (b), which are clearly dissimilar,                    show annual mean changes (in degrees Celsius) as a function                    of latitude and altitude.                                                              The team first dealt with                observed data. They found that removing El Niño and volcanic                effects always led to larger warming trends in the residual surface                and lower tropospheric data than in the raw observational data (where                these effects were left in). Although El Niños caused a small                net warming from 1979 to 1999, the El Chichón and Mount Pinatubo                volcanic eruptions caused a larger net cooling during the same period.                Removing both El Niños and volcanoes more clearly revealed                the underlying warming trend in surface and tropospheric temperatures.                It also helped to explain some of the differential warming of the                surface and troposphere.                   “It’s clear that                if the Mount Pinatubo and El Chichón eruptions had not occurred,                the lower troposphere would have experienced more pronounced warming,”                says Santer.                  The team then removed volcanic                and El Niño effects from model output and compared the results                with observations. It is important to do this because even in a                model with “perfect” representation of El Niño                variability, the simulated El Niños would not necessarily                occur at the same time that they happened in the real world. Also,                some model experiments include the effects of well-observed volcanoes                (such as Mount Pinatubo) but exclude other eruptions where less                is known about the properties of the volcanic aerosols. Removing                volcano and El Niño effects from both models and observations                allows a fairer comparison of the underlying simulated and observed                responses to human-caused changes in greenhouse gases.                  The general conclusion from                such comparisons was that removing volcano and El Niño effects                from atmospheric temperature data improves the correspondence of                the modeled and observed differential warming of the surface and                troposphere over the last several decades. It does not, however,                fully reconcile models and reality. The remaining differences are                probably caused by problems with the observational temperature data;                missing or inaccurately specified “forcings” in the climate                model experiments, such as the neglect of land use changes or aerosol                particles from biomass burning; and errors in the climate responses                that the models predict.                  Santer and his colleagues                are actively investigating these possibilities. “We hope we’ve                showed that this is a complex scientific issue,” says Santer.                “It can’t be reduced to a one-minute sound bite. This                issue is important, because it relates to our ability to evaluate                climate models and to determine whether these models are useful                tools for predicting climate change over the next century.”                                                                                                     Some                    of the problems involved in removing the effects of El Niño                    variability and explosive volcanic eruptions from tropospheric                    temperature data. (a) In the original satellite-based temperature                    data, the cooling signal of the 1983 El Chichón eruption                    is masked by (b) one of the strongest El Niño events                    of the 20th century. After using an iterative method to successively                    refine estimates of El Niño and La Niña effects                    on tropospheric temperatures, these effects are removed from                    the original temperature data in (a). The cooling effects of                    the El Chichón and Mount Pinatubo eruptions are now more                    easily seen in (c). It is clear in (d) that removing both volcanoes                    and El Niño effects yields a pronounced warming trend                    that was not apparent in the original temperature data.                                             An                Up-Close Look                 The IPCC’s prediction                that mean global temperatures will increase from 1.6° to 6°C                by the end of this century isn’t especially useful for farmers                and others whose livelihoods depend on the weather. They need more                specific information on temperature increases expected in their                area, whether it be Kansas or Kenya. They also need to know about                changes in temperature extremes and in other important quantities                such as precipitation. By providing improved simulations of climate                change on regional scales, Livermore’s high-resolution climate                simulations should allow for more accurate assessments of the effects                of climate change on society.                 Grids of 50 kilometers and                less are already used in numerical weather prediction, which is                much less computationally intensive than climate modeling because                it requires much shorter forecasts (days rather than decades). For                long-term climate modeling with resolution this fine, scientists                had to await the arrival of huge computers with hundreds of processors                operating simultaneously.                 Duffy’s                team is using the Community Climate Model 3, or CCM3, an atmospheric                model developed by the National Center for Atmospheric Research                (NCAR) in Boulder, Colorado. CCM3, the fourth-generation CCM model,                is used at coarse resolutions in climate modeling centers around                the world.                 “For every change in                horizontal resolution, there’s the problem of retuning the                model,” says Duffy. Several physical processes such as convection,                cloudiness, and precipitation are too small to be represented explicitly                in climate models and are therefore treated using semiempirical                parameterizations.                 For example, although clouds                may be too small to be represented directly in a grid cell, they                must be accounted for because cloud cover affects the flow of radiation                in the atmosphere. “So we parameterize their effects by modifying                the optical properties of that layer of the atmosphere,” says                Duffy.                 Because these parameterizations                are not based on first-principles physics, they must be tuned carefully                at each resolution. Tuning is done by adjusting parameter values                to make the model’s results agree as closely as possible with                observations. The 300-kilometer model has already been carefully                tuned at NCAR to optimize results at that resolution. In collaboration                with researchers at NCAR, Livermore researchers retuned their 75-kilometer                model. Thus far, tuning done for the 75-kilometer model has also                worked reasonably well with the 50-kilometer grid.                 The team’s proof of                principle with the 50- and 75-kilometer models was to compare their                modeling results to observed data. Although, as Duffy notes, “the                50-kilometer model actually has better resolution than most of our                observational data.” Perhaps not surprisingly, simulations                using the 50-kilometer model agreed better with observed data than                either a 75- or                 300-kilometer grid. In some cases, there were substantial improvements.                When the team examined results in more localized regions of interest,                the results were striking. The upper figure below shows simulated                precipitation over the U.S. in December, January, and February using                50-, 75-, and 300-kilometer grids and compares all three to observed                data. As the grid size shrinks, both small-scale and large-scale                simulated precipitation features converge toward observations. This                example shows that as spatial resolution becomes finer, not only                is fine-scale detail added to the model results, but the large-scale                aspects of the solution also become more realistic.                                                                                                     The                    representation of December, January, and February precipitation                    over the U.S. improves as the resolution increases. Simulations                    using (a) 300-kilometer, (b) 75-kilometer, and (c) 50-kilometer                    resolution are compared with (d) actual observed data. Both                    fine- and large-scale aspects of the simulation improve as spatial                    resolution shrinks.                                                                                                                                                 A                    comparison of elevations in California, as represented in models                    having (a) 300-kilometer, (b) 75-kilometer, and (c) 50-kilometer                    resolution, with (d) actual elevations at 50-kilometer resolution.                    Elevations in the models are lightly smoothed—evened out—to                    prevent sudden changes that cause numerical noise and contaminate                    the results. Even at 50-kilometer resolution, California’s                    Coast Range mountains and the Central Valley are not well represented.                                                             Simulations of California                climate are a real test of climate models because of the great variability                in climate that occurs within the state’s relatively small                area. Much of this variability results directly or indirectly from                the state’s major topographic features: the Coast Range, the                Central Valley, and the Sierra Nevada. The figure above compares                actual elevations at 50-kilometer resolution with topography as                represented in models having 300-, 75-, and 50-kilometer resolutions.                Although the topography is more realistic as the model resolution                becomes finer, neither the coastal mountains nor the Central Valley                are adequately represented in even the 50-kilometer model.                 In part because of improved                representations of topography, the model’s ability to simulate                precipitation in California improves dramatically as the resolution                becomes finer. Nonetheless, 50-kilometer resolution is still not                adequate to represent the state’s Coast Range and Central Valley;                even at this resolution, the simulation of precipitation differs                noticeably from observations.                 Simulations of Arctic climate                similarly improve dramatically with finer resolution, but further                improvements are nonetheless needed. Most coarse-resolution ocean–atmosphere–sea                ice climate models produce poor simulations of the pattern of sea-level                pressure in the Arctic region. Poor data for sea-level pressure                result in unrealistic simulated atmospheric circulation, which in                turn produces unrealistic distributions of sea ice thickness and                concentrations and other problems. Accurate predictions of sea ice                and of changes in sea ice because of global warming are essential.                Sea ice strongly affects the climate not only in polar regions but                also in far-flung regions through influences on the large-scale                ocean circulation and on Earth’s radiation balance.                 In addition to these simulations                of the present climate, Duffy’s team has simulated the effects                of increased greenhouse gases (that is, global warming) with the                75-kilometer-resolution model. This is the finest-resolution simulation                of global warming performed to date and shows very different results                from comparable simulations performed at coarser resolutions. Although                the globally averaged responses of temperature and other variables                to increased greenhouse gases are quite similar in the 75-kilometer                model and in coarser-resolution models, the regional responses can                be very different. For example, the figure at the bottom of the                page shows predicted wintertime temperature changes between 2000                and 2100 in the U.S. The finer-resolution model shows regions of                strong warming in the western U.S. and southeastern Canada, which                are not predicted by the coarser-resolution model. In at least some                cases, it seems clear that the results of the finer-resolution model                are more believable.                 Duffy’s group has already                fielded inquiries from experts interested in the effects of localized                climate change on crop diseases, human health, water resources,                and the like. Although the finer-resolution models are far from                perfect, they may represent the best tools available today for assessing                the regional effects of global warming.                                                                    A                    comparison of precipitation over California, as represented                    in models at (a) 300-kilometer, (b) 75-kilometer, and (c) 50-kilometer                    resolution, with (d) actual precipitation at 50-kilometer resolution.                                                                                                                                    Predicted                    temperature increases from 2000 to 2100 for December, January,                    and February at resolutions of (a) 300 kilometers and (b) 75                    kilometers. The predicted data from the model with finer resolution                    are much more specific and useful.                                                             Getting                It Right                 A few months ago, a chunk                of ice larger than Rhode Island collapsed on the east side of Antarctica.                It was the largest single event in a series of ice shelf retreats                there extending back 30 years. Temperatures at the Antarctic Peninsula                have increased by 2.5°C over the last 50 years, much faster                than the global average. Getting Arctic and Antarctic models right                is crucial for determining what may happen to sea levels around                the world as temperatures continue to rise.                 Closing in on how much humans                are responsible for the changes in our planet’s climate is                equally important. Getting it right matters to us all.                 —Katie Walter                Key Words: climate                modeling, Community Climate Model 3 (CCM3), global warming, National                Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR).

In winter these                      winds pull more warm air from oceans to continents causing                      winter warming, and like a top spinning very fast, they hold                      a tight pattern over the North Pole and keep frigid air from                      moving south.

Pinatubo in Philippines in June 1991, inject millions of ton                      of sulfur dioxide gas at the altitudes of about 15 miles where                      it interacts with water vapor producing a volcanic aerosol                      layer that consists of tiny droplets of highly concentrated                      sulfuric acid.                       As a result of the Pinatubo eruption, globally averaged surface                      temperature decreased by about 0.3 Kelvin (0.3 Celsius) for                      two years after the eruption and the temperature in the tropical                      lower stratosphere increased by about 2-3 Kelvin (2-3 Celsius).                      The tropospheric response over most land areas in the Northern                      Hemisphere is characterized by summer cooling and winter warming.

PINATUBO ERUPTION PROVIDES A NATURAL TEST FOR THE                      INFLUENCE OF ARCTIC CIRCULATION ON CLIMATE                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Image                            1                                                                                                                                                                A                      recent NASA-funded study has linked the 1991 eruption of the                      Mount Pinatubo to a strengthening of a climate pattern called                      the Arctic Oscillation. For two years following the volcanic                      eruption, the Arctic Oscillation caused winter warming over                      land areas in the high and middle latitudes of the Northern                      Hemisphere, despite a cooling effect from volcanic particles                      that blocked sunlight.                     One                      mission of NASA’s Earth Science Enterprise, which funded                      this research, is to better understand how the Earth system                      responds to human and naturally-induced changes, such as large                      volcanic eruptions.                     “This                      study clarifies the effect of strong volcanic eruptions on                      climate, important by itself, and helps to better predict                      possible weather and short-term climate variations after strong                      volcanic eruptions,” said Georgiy Stenchikov, a researcher                      at Rutgers University’s Department of Environmental Sciences,                      New Brunswick, N.J., and lead author on a paper that appeared                      in a recent issue of the Journal of Geophysical Research.                     A                      positive phase of the Arctic Oscillation has slowly strengthened                      over the few last decades and has been associated in prior                      research with observed climate warming.                     “The                      study has important implications to climate change because                      it provides a test for mechanisms of the Arctic Oscillation,”                      Stenchikov said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Image                            2                                                                                                                                                               A                      positive phase of the Arctic Oscillation is associated with                      strengthening of winds circulating counterclockwise around                      the North Pole north of 55°N, that is, roughly in line                      with Moscow, Belfast, and Ketchikan, Alaska. In winter these                      winds pull more warm air from oceans to continents causing                      winter warming, and like a top spinning very fast, they hold                      a tight pattern over the North Pole and keep frigid air from                      moving south.                      According                      to this research, temperature changes caused by a radiative                      effect of volcanic aerosols in two lower layers of the atmosphere,                      the troposphere and the stratosphere, can lead to a positive                      Arctic Oscillation phase. The troposphere extends from Earth’s                      surface to an altitude of 7 miles in the polar regions and                      expands to 13 miles in the tropics. The stratosphere is the                      next layer up with the top at an altitude of about 30 miles.                     The                      study uses a general circulation model developed at the National                      Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Geophysical                      Fluid Dynamics Laboratory to simulate how volcanic aerosols                      following the Pinatubo eruption impacted the climate.                     In                      the troposphere, volcanic aerosols reflect solar radiation                      and cool the Earth’s surface, decreasing temperature                      differences between the equator and the North Pole in the                      bottom atmospheric layer. These changes end up inhibiting                      processes that slow counterclockwise winds that blow around                      the North Pole mostly in the stratosphere. This in turn strengthens                      a positive phase of the Arctic Oscillation.                     In                      the stratosphere, volcanic aerosols absorb solar radiation,                      warm the lower stratosphere (about 15 miles above the Earth’s                      surface) and increase stratospheric temperature differences                      between the equator and the North Pole. These changes strengthen                      westerly winds in the lower stratosphere and help to create                      a positive phase of the Arctic Oscillation.                      In                      previous research, an observed positive Arctic Oscillation                      trend has been attributed to greenhouse warming that led to                      an increase of stratospheric temperature differences between                      equator and pole. But this study finds that tropospheric temperature                      change in the course of climate warming may play an even greater                      role.                     In                      one type of computer simulation, Stenchikov and colleagues                      isolated the contribution of a decreased temperature difference                      in the troposphere, and found that it could produce a positive                      phase of the Arctic Oscillation by itself. That’s because                      greenhouse heating near the North Pole melts reflective sea                      ice and snow, and reveals more water and land surfaces. These                      surfaces absorb the Sun’s rays and increasingly warm                      the Earth’s polar regions. Polar heating at the Earth’s                      surface lessens the temperature differences between the equator                      and North Pole in the troposphere, which ultimately strengthens                      a positive phase of the Arctic Oscillation.                     The                      study also finds that when aerosols get into the stratosphere,                      very rapid reactions that destroy ozone (especially in high                      latitudes) take place on the surfaces of aerosol particles.                      When ozone gets depleted, less UV radiation is absorbed in                      the stratosphere. This cools the polar stratosphere, and increases                      the stratospheric equator-to-pole temperature difference,                      creating a positive phase of the Arctic Oscillation.

The Earth System Sciences Committee commissioned by NASA (ESSC 1988) provided the intellectual framework for an integrated research approach designed to address these critical issues. The report called for sustained long-term measurements of global variables to record the vital signs of the Earth system and the observations required to provide a fundamental description of the Earth and its component parts. The report urged that, as part of an integrated research approach, these observations must be intimately coupled to focused process studies, the development of Earth system models, and an information system that ensures open access to consistent, long-term observations of the Earth system. A consistent view is obtained from the broad suite of National Research Council (NRC) (1985; 1986; 1988; 1990; 1992) reports that also call for an observing strategy that strengthens the base of knowledge in all the sciences that deal with the Earth, quantifies the magnitude of the driving forces for global change, and monitors the state of the Earth system and its ""vital"" signs. These reports call for an observing strategy that focuses on the highest priority measurements needed for each of the major disciplines of the Earth sciences and on the importance of simultaneity, calibration, and continuity of measurements to establish how the Earth is changing, and to develop and validate global predictive models. The role of satellite systems in developing this research strategy is unique because of the capability to provide a long-term, consistent, calibrated, global set of observations. NASA's EOS was designed specifically in response to the recommendations of the ESSC and the NRC, and was instituted as an integral element of the U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP). The U.S. Global Change Research Program outlined an accelerated, focused research strategy designed to reduce key scientific uncertainties and to develop morereliable predictions. The research priorities of the USGCRP are based on a series of policy-relevant questions that reflect areas of substantial uncertainty (Table 1.1). The evolution of the USGCRP has continued to sharpen the set of questions as a result of discovery and debate. EOS objectives, and associated critical measurements, encompass many of the priorities outlined by the USGCRP and include contributions in seven disciplinary areas, each of which is the subject of a chapter in this Science Plan:  NASA's Earth Observing System (EOS) was designed to initiate a new era of integrated global observations intended to advance our understanding of the entire Earth system on a global scale through developing a deeper understanding of the components of that system, their interactions, and how the Earth is changing. EOS plays a critical role in addressing a key challenge--to develop the capability to predict the changes that will occur in the next decade to century, both naturally and in response to human activity. The EOS program was founded in response to a compelling scientific vision driven by recognition of the societal importance of the natural variability on our planet and realization that humans are no longer passive participants in the evolution of the Earth system. In 1979, the World Climate Research Program (WCRP) initiated an international effort to understand the physical basis of climate in response to droughts and floods that revealed societal vulnerability to climate variability. In 1982, a NASA workshop led by Richard Goody described the need for a scientific program designed to ""ensure continuing habitability"" of our planet in the face of the expansion of the human population and its activities. Then in 1986, the International Geosphere-Biosphere Program (IGBP) was initiated with the objective ""to describe and understand the interactive physical, chemical, and biological processes that regulate the Earth's unique environment for life, the changes that are occurring in this system, and the manner in which they are influenced by human actions."" A new view, based on an integrated programmatic framework, emerged as the central paradigm of both national and international programs. The foundation for this paradigm was a recognition that: 1) the Earth can be understood only as an integrated system; 2) each decade will likely bring a new specific environmental crisis for which the solutions must draw on years of accumulated understanding; and 3) science is a partner in decision-making, guided by the potential to benefit society and to enhance our economic security. There is little doubt that an integrated Earth systems view would have eventually emerged as a product of the maturity of the Earth science disciplines and the powerful global and synoptic tools of study that have been developed over the last decades. However, a sense of urgency developed in direct response to the observations of ozone depletion over Antarctica, evidence of widespread tropical deforestation, and the record of increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide measured at Mauna Loa   8  EOS SCIENCE PLAN - C  HAPTER  1   Radiation, Clouds, Water Vapor, Precipitation, and Atmospheric Circulation;  Ocean Circulation, Productivity, and Exchange with the Atmosphere;  Atmospheric Chemistry and Greenhouse Gases;  Land Ecosystems and Hydrology;  Cryospheric Systems;  Ozone and Stratospheric Chemistry; and  Volcanoes and Climate Effects of Aerosols The scientific challenges within each of these major research areas define an observation strategy in which simultaneity, calibration, and continuity are critical ingredients. The evolution of the USGCRP has also resulted in a clearer call to address the implications of global change  through assessments of impacts, and a greater focus on the most policy-relevant themes. Four key USGCRP global change issues are: 1) seasonal-to-interannual climate variability, 2) climate change over decades to centuries, 3) changes in ozone, ultraviolet radiation, and atmospheric chemistry, and 4) changes in land cover and in terrestrial and aquatic systems. In addition to these areas of particular scientific and practical importance, USGCRP has defined an overarching objective (often referred to as ""human dimensions"") to identify, understand, and analyze how human activities contribute to changes in natural systems, how the consequences of natural and humaninduced change affect the health and well-being of humans and their institutions, and how humans could respond to problems associated with environmental change.  1.2 EOS science contributions The EOS science contributions begin with a commitment to measuring 24 critical variables (Table 1.2). These 24 measurements are a foundation for a coordinated research program addressing the highest priority elements of the USGCRP. 1.2.1 Radiation, clouds, water vapor, precipita tion, and atmospheric circulation The temperature near the surface of the Earth is in thermodynamic equilibrium when the absorption of radiant energy from the sun is in approximate balance with the emission of radiant energy to space from the Earth. Thus, the energy output of the sun provides a critical control on the Earth's climate. The amount of the solar energy that is absorbed by the Earth depends on Earth's reflectivity, and the reflectivity is strongly dependent on the fractional coverage and optical properties of clouds in the atmosphere, the amount and optical properties of aerosol particles in the atmosphere, the atmospheric humidity, and the condition of the surface. The surface temperature of the Earth depends not only on the absorbed solar radiation but also on the rate at which energy is re-radiated to space from the Earth. The rate of re-radiation is controlled by both the amount and the vertical distribution of not only the clouds and aerosol particles but also the atmospheric greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, of which the most important is water vapor. The water vapor distribution interacts strongly with convection in the atmosphere and the associated clouds, precipitation, and large-scale circulations and also interacts strongly with the thermal structure of the atmosphere. Understanding the interactions among the various elements mentioned above and incorporating this understanding into appropriate models constitutes a critical step in predicting future climate changes and their regional and global impacts. Likewise, improved understanding in these areas will help in the prediction of seasonal and interannual climate variability. Beyond the confines of the atmosphere there are also interactions with the oceans to be considered, and these are strongly modulated by clouds, water vapor, and large-scale circulations. 1.2.1.1 Total Solar Irradiance (TSI) Long-term solar monitoring from space began with the Earth Radiation Budget (ERB) experiment in late 1978 and has continued into the present time frame with measurements from the Active Cavity Radiometer Irradiance Monitor II (ACRIM II) on NASA's Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS). Consistent measurements by ACRIM instruments I and II have shown variations in TSI running from a low of about 1367 Wm-2 at a solar cycle minimum in 1986 to a high of about 1369 Wm-2 in 1992 at a solar cycle peak. Although these changes appear small, sustained changes in TSI of as little as a few tenths of one percent could be causal factors for significant climate change on time scales ranging from decades to centuries.   O  VERVIEW  9  TABLE 1.1 What is the role of clouds in the Ear th's radiation and heat budgets?

The EOS instruments listed in bold font are primary sensors, bold italics represent secondary instruments, and roman fonts are contributing instruments for critical measurements.   O  VERVIEW  11  NASA's EOS directly addresses this critical issue:  EOS has the potential to determine TSI with 0.001% relative precision by using overlapping flights of the ACRIM instrument with 0.1% absolute accuracy. This precision is sufficient to detect climatically-significant changes. 1.2.1.2 The role of radiation fluxes in the climate system The climate system is a heat engine that is driven by the spatial and temporal distribution of the entry and exit of broadband radiant energy. Radiation is the primary forcing element in climate change. Modern climate models have consistently indicated that CO2 and other anthropogenic trace gases will change the vertical distribution of radiative fluxes in the atmospheric column so as to warm the troposphere and cool the stratosphere. Radiation is important for climate feedback. Clouds are second only to greenhouse gases in terms of their effect on climate. However, there is great uncertainty about cloud radiative forcing and feedback, posing the most formidable obstacle to climate prediction by general circulation models (GCMs). We cannot reliably predict the climate response to a given radiative forcing because of the uncertainty in the cloud/climate feedback to changes in radiation at the Top of the Atmosphere (TOA). Estimating the radiative effects of clouds and retrieving cloud properties from space both require a detailed understanding of the scattering and absorption properties of clouds. The direct and indirect radiative effects of aerosols constitute the largest uncertainties in the anthropogenic radiative forcing of climate. Anthropogenic sulfate aerosols mostly scatter shortwave radiation and cool the climate. Smoke from biomass burning may have a global cooling effect of 0.2-2 Wm-2. Although there have been fairly good simulations of transient temperature variations to the radiative forcing due to the aerosol plumes that resulted from the 1991 Mt. Pinatubo eruption, our knowledge of the global distribution of aerosols is inadequate to assess their role in future climate. The surface of the Earth absorbs about twice as much solar radiation as does the atmosphere. The amount of solar radiation that is absorbed by the surface is modulated by a surface solar albedo that ranges from 0.06 for diffuse radiation striking the ocean to approximately 0.90 for some of the freshest snow. The Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment (GEWEX) Surface Radiation Budget (SRB) Project has found that errors in both shortwave and longwave radiation measurements over snow and ice surfaces and for longwave radiation in persistently  cloudy regions are larger than those in other regions. Surface albedos and radiative fluxes over snow-free land are also not known to sufficient accuracy. Until surface albedo of all land surfaces is known to greater accuracy, it will not be possible to quantify adequately the radiative forcing to climate that is associated with changes in land use. Despite their importance, TO A shortwave and longwave radiative flux measurements currently available from the Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) seem to have an error of about 5 Wm-2 , which presumably contributes to even larger errors in surface radiative fluxes. The surface energy budget also provides a key forcing to ocean circulation so that more-accurate information is needed in this aspect of radiation studies as well. NASA's EOS directly addresses many of these critical issues:  EOS will contribute to improved understanding of the effects of the atmospheric trace gases by producing more-accurate vertical profiles and time histories of water vapor and radiatively active gases and by validating the radiative transfer physics for both the natural and anthropogenic gases in the atmosphere. The EOS instrument Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES), along with other EOS instruments such as the Multi-angle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR) and the Earth Observing Scanning Polarimeter (EOSP), is expected to provide significant advances in the estimate of radiative forcing by clouds. EOS will begin to resolve problems caused by cloud overlap and cloud geometrical thickness through use of both passive and active sensors. The long homogeneous record of clouds and radiation fluxes to be provided by EOS in the course of 15-to-18 years of observations will allow seasonal and interannual variability to be sampled adequately and will be used to understand connections within the climate system that only appear on longer time scales. EOS instruments MISR and EOSP will significantly advance our understanding of the distribution and radiative character of atmospheric aerosols. EOS will determine the surface albedo of all land surfaces to a greater accuracy, providing the possibility to better quantify the radiative forcing due to land use and land-cover changes.           12  EOS SCIENCE PLA  N  - CHAPTER 1   The retrieval of longwave radiation be improved by combining satellite data from ocean-based monitoring provide both SRB and cloud-base  measurements will measurements with stations that would heights.  focus on a range of efforts that range from 100-year integrations (global), to 10-day integrations (regional), to 1-day (cloud resolving).  The Lightning Imaging Sensor (LIS), whose lightning occurrence record will serve as an index of convection intensity, and AIRS, whose temperature and moisture profiles will yield estimates of convective available potential energy, will address key questions regarding cloud characteristics that are faced by climate modelers.  Several EOS interdisciplinary investigations are pursuing improved understanding of cloud-climate feedbacks. The higher spatial resolution, availability of new cloud variables, and greater accuracy of EOS cloud observations will enable better validation of regional cloud simulations.  TOA radiative flux measurements from space will enter their fourth generation with the CERES instruments on the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and on the EOS AM-1 and PM-1 spacecraft. The most recent ERBE measurements provide the standard of comparison for global radiation data sets. The CERES measurement errors are expected to be a factor of 2-to-4 lower than the ERBE errors.  In the EOS time frame, calculated shortwave surface flux accuracies should increase greatly as more-accurate cloud (Visible Infrared Scanner [VIRS], Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer [MODIS]), atmospheric (AIRS), and surface (MISR, MODIS) properties become available.  In the EOS time frame, improved tropospheric water vapor determinations will help better determine downward longwave fluxes. The water vapor determinations will be available from the AIRS/Humidity Sounder from Brazil (HSB) instruments and, over land, from MODIS.  Active systems such as the Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) lidar from EOS and a proposed 94-GHz cloud radar may offer the best solution to the large uncertainty in the calculations of downward longwave flux at the surface due to uncertainties in cloud overlap.  The EOS MODIS instrument has design capabilities specifically directed toward cloud-property determinations. Very-high-spatial-resolution measurements  1.2.1.3 The role of convection and clouds in climate Clouds not only affect the radiative energy fluxes in the atmosphere through scattering, absorption, and re-radiation, but vertical motions associated with them produce important convective transports of energy and moisture. Clouds produce a redistribution of energy between the surface and the atmosphere that may be larger than the net effect of clouds on the energy balance at the TOA. Convection associated with clouds also affects the exchange of heat between the surface and the atmosphere. The cloud type that appears to exert the greatest effect on climate sensitivity in state-of-the-art global GCMs is the tropical mesoscale anvil cloud that accompanies cumulus convection. The central question is how to represent such features as the detrainment of ice from cumulus updrafts into anvil clouds. Scale is also a critical issue in understanding and predicting atmospheric circulation systems. Mesoscale models (MMs) have become powerful tools for understanding and forecasting regional atmospheric circulations, taking into account such features as severe midlatitude cyclones, hurricanes, orographically-forced flow, fronts, and thermally-forced flows such as land/sea breezes. Development and validation of these models and their parameterizations are important objectives in atmospheric sciences. Radiative flux determinations are the highest priority measurements that are needed to understand the role of cloud feedback mechanisms in the climate system. At this time net radiative energy flux determinations at the TOA need to be supplemented by the more-difficult determinations of the net radiative energy flux at the Earth's surface. The vertical distribution of radiative cooling/heating inside the atmosphere is also very important. In order of priority are the TOA radiative flux, the surface radiative flux, and the radiative flux at the tropopause. In order to improve simulations of cloud forcing and its effect on climate sensitivity, more-detailed measurements of cloud properties are needed to provide understanding and model validation. NASA's EOS directly addresses many of these critical issues:  EOS observations will provide data for validation on three scales (global, regional, and cloud-resolving), and EOS interdisciplinary modeling investigations   O  VERVIEW  13  from the EOS Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER), multi-angle EOS MISR data, polarization of cloud particles determinations from EOS EOSP, all will contribute to the validation of the MODIS data. The final step in cloud remote sensing during the EOS era will be the combination of data from the passive sensors just cited with data from EOS GLAS (the active laser sensor) and the proposed cloud radar.  Other cloud properties that will be the subject of investigation in the EOS era include cloud fraction, cloud visible optical depth and thermal infrared emittance, cloud particle size, cloud liquid/ice water path, and cloud mesoscale organization and structure. Improved spectral resolution (including solar, terrestrial infrared, and microwave coverage) and spatial resolution, multi-angle coverage, and the use of both passive and active sensors will lead to improvements in the determinations of these cloud properties. 1.2.1.4 Water vapor and climate Most of the water in the atmosphere is in the form of vapor, and water vapor plays a critical role in many key processes in the hydrologic and energy cycles. Water vapor is the most important greenhouse gas, both in terms of its role in maintaining the current climate and in terms of its role in sensitivity through the water vapor feedback process. The abundance and vertical distribution of water vapor in the atmosphere interact very strongly with convection and cloudiness, thereby influencing the albedo of the planet as well as the infrared opacity of the atmosphere. Climate feedbacks are sensitive to the vertical distribution of both water vapor and temperature. In every respect, the water vapor data sets available to date are inadequate for climate studies. Radiosondes are limited in their geographic coverage, and satellite retrievals suffer from poor vertical resolution and accuracy. NASA's EOS directly addresses many of these critical issues:  Data from EOS instruments will improve the quality of global measurements of the water vapor distribution. In particular, the EOS instruments, AIRS, Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU), and HSB, working in combination, will provide more-precise simultaneous measurements of temperature and humidity in the troposphere, with better vertical resolution than is currently available.    EOS cloud and moisture measurements, when combined with wind estimates from data assimilation techniques and with in situ measurements from field programs, will provide a much better understanding of the mechanisms whereby the moisture balance of the troposphere is maintained. EOS data will play an important role in validating the new generation of climate models that account explicitly for cloud water and ice, their transport, and their evaporation to provide a source of water vapor in the free atmosphere. AIRS/AMSU/HSB, and the EOS instruments HighResolution Dynamics Limb Sounder (HIRDLS) and Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) will supply improved horizontal and vertical resolution temperature and moisture measurements. Also, the EOS Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment III (SAGE III) instrument will provide very accurate monitoring of water vapor trends in the stratosphere.      1.2.1.5 Precipitation Rainfall plays a central role in governing the climate of the Earth. The latent heat release in convection is a major source of energy that drives the general circulation of the atmosphere. Much of the solar radiation absorbed by the Earth is used to evaporate water, which later condenses to release latent heat in the atmosphere during precipitation. Latent heat release in tropical convection forces atmospheric motions that disperse heat and moisture into the extratropics, diverting subtropical jet streams, and altering rainfall patterns in midlatitudes. Precipitation is also of critical importance to human systems and the distribution and character of life. The distribution of precipitation is highly inhomogeneous in space and time. Because of the wide range of variability in both time (minutes to years) and space (less than a kilometer to thousands of kilometers) the long-term accurate mapping of global precipitation is a daunting task. Atmospheric models have been shown to be able to produce a global precipitation rate to within 10-20% of that observed, but they have many serious faults otherwise. They differ particularly in their ability to estimate regional and subcontinental rainfall variability, and they also underestimate the frequency of occurrence of the light-rain category. Satellite rainfall retrieval algorithms play a vital role in producing realistic global rainfall distributions because it is impossible to set up uniform networks of rain gauges over the entire globe.   14  EOS SCIENCE PLA  N  - CHAPTER 1  NASA's Earth Science Enterprise directly addresses many of these critical issues:  TRMM employs a suite of sensors including one microwave (TRMM Microwave Imager [TMI]), one visible (VIS)/infrared (IR) (VIRS), and one active precipitation radar (PR) with the objective of producing the best rainfall estimates from space, especially for the world's tropics and subtropics. Within the EOS measurement system, the key instruments for precipitation measurement are the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-EOS (AMSR-E) and HSB on the EOS PM-1 platform. 1.2.1.6 Atmospheric circulation, hydrologic processes, and climate The presence of clouds, water vapor, and precipitation in the atmosphere significantly alters the Earth's radiation budget and causes differential heating between the tropics and the polar regions, between the oceans and the land, and between clear and cloudy regions. This differential heating is the main driver of the atmospheric large-scale circulation, and the essential component of the circulation is the wind. The consideration of the atmospheric wind circulation is indispensable in order to understand the role of the global hydrologic cycle, clouds, water, and precipitation on regional and global climate fluctuations. While radiative forcings such as that due to doubling of CO2 may be small, feedback processes in the climate system may amplify the initial response to the radiative forcing. Especially for climate changes on seasonal and interannual time scales, the lar ge-scale circulation plays a fundamental role. NASA's EOS makes a number of important contributions in addition to those described above:  The EOS QuikSCAT, followed by the SeaWinds instrument on the Japanese Advanced Earth Observing System II (ADEOS II) spacecraft, will provide surface wind speed and direction over the oceans from scatterometry, and EOS passive microwave radiometry, using AMSR-E, will contribute to wind determinations over the ocean as well. 1.2.2 Ocean circulation, productivity, and exchange with the atmosphere The oceans of the world play a key role in modulating climate. The ocean is a major agent in the equator-to-pole redistribution of heat. The positions of major current systems such as the Gulf Stream, the Kuroshio, and the Antarctic circumpolar current are major factors in gov-  erning temperature patterns and the transport of nutrients, chemicals, and biota. Models of ocean circulation are welldeveloped, although coupled models of ocean physics and biogeochemistry are in the initial stages of development. The exchange of gases and, in particular, carbon dioxide, between air and sea is a crucial part of the climate perturbation equation and as such is a critical area of research for the EOS program (methyl bromide exchange is also of interest). Among questions that need to be resolved are: how do changes in surface forcing of heat, momentum, and nutrient fluxes affect carbon cycling in the upper oceans; what are the amounts of the fluxes of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and dimethyl sulfide across the air-sea interface; and what are the factors affecting the productivity of the oceans. Global estimates of the mean and time-varying components of ocean photosynthetic carbon production and its relation to nutrient cycles differ widely and will not be resolved without sophisticated analyses and models involving both satellite and in situ data. Large uncertainties exist in the estimates of the carbon dioxide flux across the ocean-atmosphere interface. The oceans are a sink for carbon dioxide, and hence play a key role in moderating the effects of increased carbon dioxide on global warming. The ability to forecast well in advance the timing and geographic extent of season-to-interannual climate anomalies is predicated on the thermal inertia of the climate system, which is based on the slow response to forcings of the oceans as compared to the more-rapid forcings of the atmosphere. Air-sea momentum fluxes and near-surface winds modulate the coupling between the atmosphere and the ocean. Wind stress is the largest single source of momentum in the upper ocean, and air-sea momentum fluxes substantially influence large-scale upper-ocean circulation, smaller-scale mixing, and the detailed shape of the sea surface on all scales. Decadal-to-centennial variations in the thermohaline circulation of the ocean depend on exchanges of heat and water with the atmosphere. Simple atmospheric boundary layer models can explain much of the observed pattern of sensible and latent heat fluxes over the global oceans. However, observations in the data-sparse areas of the southern and tropical oceans are insufficient to provide reliable estimates of the surface turbulent and radiative fluxes. Freshwater forcing is an important aspect of the global water balance. Local freshwater at the ocean surface limits exchanges of heat and moisture with the atmosphere. In the atmosphere, fluxes of heat and moisture drive tropospheric vertical convection, horizontal   O  VERVIEW  15  advection, and precipitation patterns. Notably, surface freshwater forcing is believed to play a primary role in setting the background state and timing of the El Nio Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon. Major climate-related factors that contribute to sealevel rise are thermal expansion in the oceans as well as ablating mountain glaciers and polar ice sheets. Major uncertainties exist in the contributions of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets to recent changes in sea level as well as predicted future changes. Ocean tides cause a larger sea-level signal than temporal changes in ocean circulation and sea level so that an accurate tidal model is required to remove the tidal signal for studies of ocean circulation. NASA's EOS directly addresses many of these critical issues:  The EOS Jason-1 radar altimeter (Poseidon 2) will serve to determine multi-decadal global sea-level variations and their long-term trends; and the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-EOS Version (AMSR-E) and SeaWinds measurements will contribute wind-stress information as above.  The EOS MODIS instrument will provide sea-surface temperature (SST) measurements, based on infrared emissions from the oceans, for cloud-free conditions to the level of a few tenths kelvin. EOS AMSR-E will provide SST measurements with an accuracy of 1-to-1.5 K in all weather conditions, providing substantial additional information on the role of the oceans in the Earth's heat and hydrologic cycles.  The EOS MODIS instrument will also be key for the measurement of ocean color. These data will be used to estimate phytoplankton abundance and productivity, as well as the amount of dissolved organic material and suspended particulate material. MODIS will also measure sun-stimulated fluorescence from chlorophyll, which will greatly improve estimates of upper ocean productivity.  Several EOS interdisciplinary science investigations (IDS) focus on the interactions between the atmosphere and ocean across the sea surface. EOS worldwide observations of ocean surface wind stress by the SeaWinds scatterometer instruments, with accuracies of 10-to-12% in speed, will be critical to achieving these objectives. In addition, the EOS AMSR-E passive microwave instrument will provide complementary continual observations of wind speeds and stress magnitudes over the oceans.    IDS studies of the ocean's biological system and its interplay with the ocean circulation and the global carbon cycle will be the focus of several EOS science teams. Long-term, well-calibrated measurements of ocean color from the EOS MODIS sensors and from the NASA Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-View Sensor (SeaWiFS) are essential for these studies. These data will be combined with physical measurements (such as scatterometer winds and radar altimetry) in numerical models to study both open ocean and coastal ocean processes.  1.2.3 Atmospheric chemistry and g reenhouse g ases The interaction of biological, geochemical, and photochemical processes, the so-called biogeochemical processes, affect the global carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and ozone budgets. Six major factors drive global change, and therefore, EOS research. First, changes of land cover/land use constitute one of the most potent forces affecting global greenhouse gases. Whereas fossil fuel burning and cement production add 5.5 Gt C/yr to the atmosphere, land-cover change adds another 1-2 Gt C/yr. Land-cover changes also affect nitrous oxide and nitric oxide emissions. Second, interannual variability in climate has been shown to lead to substantial interannual variability in terrestrial ecology and atmospheric chemistry. Remote sensing from satellites is the best means for understanding the geographic distribution of climate anomalies and the spatial response of the oceans and land ecosystems. Third, changes in global hydrology and patterns of soil moisture in wetlands strongly affect the methane budget. New improved regional and global data sets on wetland extent and seasonality are needed. Fourth, the spatial distribution and budget of tropospheric ozone are caused by changing sources of precursors arising from fossil fuel burning, biomass burning, and, possibly, changing biogenic sources in soils and vegetation. Fifth, the vertical distribution of tropospheric ozone influences the integrated radiative effect of ozone, and, hence, its effects on climate. The vertical profile will change as the geography of sources changes, as atmospheric convection and mixing change, and as further anthropogenic sources are introduced. Accurate predictive models will be extremely difficult to develop and evaluate without strong constraints from global observations. Sixth, the processes that interact to control ocean carbon uptake are physical, chemical, and biological. The kinetics of carbon dioxide gas transfer across the ocean-   16  EOS SCIENCE PLA  N  - CHAPTER 1  atmosphere interface is slow, on the order of a year, much slower than biological processes leading to carbon uptake. What determines the partitioning of anthropogenic carbon dioxide among the atmosphere, the oceans, and the terrestrial biosphere is still the subject of research. NASA's EOS provides many key data products and analyses:  EOS products will encompass many aspects of the carbon cycle, including provision of a global database of high-resolution analyses of land-cover change, estimates of the contribution of biomass burning to atmospheric CO2, and trends in carbon fixation by terrestrial vegetation determined from observed changes in leaf-area index (LAI) and fraction of photosynthetically-active radiation.  EOS will provide estimates of the extent and duration of inundation of wetlands and land cover, important elements in assessing methane production and oxidation.  The EOS Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES) will provide measurements related to nitrous and nitric oxide production and abundance.  Ozone and related species will be monitored using EOS instruments, particularly those on the CHEM-1 mission. The Measurements of Pollution in the Troposphere (MOPITT) will make measurements of carbon monoxide and methane. MODIS observations of fire will lead to estimates of biomass burning contributions of hydrocarbons, methane, oxides of nitrogen, and nonmethane hydrocarbons to ozone production. 1.2.4 Land ecosystems and hydrology Changes in land-surface processes and properties interact with, and cause changes in, both regional and global climate. The land-surface models that are utilized to assess these interactions generally contain formulations for surface radiation fluxes, turbulent and mass fluxes, liquid water fluxes, and control of water vapor and CO2 fluxes by vegetation. However, these models still exhibit major differences in their predictions, and current models still do a poor job of representing water and energy exchanges between the land and the atmosphere that must be known in order to predict correctly the temporal and spatial fields of precipitation and surface radiation. Landsurface properties such as type of cover, LAI, roughness length, and albedo are essential variables to address these  limitations. Realistic representations of land-surface cover and moisture characteristics are likely to improve both climate and weather forecasting capabilities. There are also important questions regarding the interactions and feedbacks between the atmosphere and the surface in cases where the biosphere changes in response to elevated levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide. Changing climate and land-surface characteristics may combine to change precipitation patterns, surfacewater partitioning and storage, and river flows. Of further concern are the land processes that may alter water quality: erosion, sedimentation, and river biogeochemistry. One of the major objectives of research must be to improve hydrologic understanding at critical human scales. Thus key science issues for land-hydrology are to identify and quantify key hydrologic variables across a range of scales, and to develop or modify hydrologic process models to take advantage of operational and realistic data sources. The hydrologic variables that require more study include precipitation, runoff, evapotranspiration, near-surface soil moisture, infiltration and deep percolation, radiation, and near-surface meteorology. Information is also needed for the estimation of the land-surface water balance and the estimation of the possibilities for extreme hydrologic events such as severe storms, floods, and droughts. The role of river biogeochemistry in affecting water quality and the functioning of aquatic ecosystems must also be examined. The primary concern regarding land-vegetation interactions is with how biome distribution is influenced by, and in turn influences, changes in land cover and climate. There are serious questions relating to how the regional distribution and magnitude of crop, range, and forest productivity will change with climate and land-use change. NASA's EOS contributes substantially to addressing these issues:  EOS vegetation measurements will range from interannual variability in spring phenology to seasonal changes in daily terrestrial surface CO2 balance to annual and interannual changes in net primary production (NPP).  Direct measurements from EOS will include aspects of land cover and land-cover change. Other biophysical variables such as LAI, fraction of photosynthetically-active radiation that is absorbed, albedo, and vegetation indices are derived from direct measurements. A key derived product is net primary production (NPP), and the EOS MODIS instrument   O  VERVIEW  17  was specifically designed, in part, to calculate this parameter. MODIS will produce values of NPP on a weekly basis to be available globally at 1-km resolution.  ASTER, operating in the visible, shortwave infrared, and thermal infrared, will provide surface reflectances and radiative (brightness) temperatures with 15-to-90-m resolution depending on wavelength. The thermal infrared radiances can be used to derive surface kinetic temperatures and spectral emissivities. The kinetic temperatures can then be used to determine sensible and latent heat fluxes and ground heat conduction. Still other parameters can be derived from the surface kinetic temperatures as well.  The Enhanced Thematic Mapper+ (ETM+) on the Landsat 7 platform, operating in the visible, near and shortwave infrared, and thermal infrared, will be used primarily to characterize and monitor changes in land cover and land-surface processes. It will have a panchromatic band with 15-m resolution, and will have 30-m resolution in the visible and near-infrared channels, and 60-m resolution in the thermal infrared. The characteristics of ETM+ are such that it will provide data sufficiently consistent with previous Landsat data to meet requirements for global-change research.  MISR, operating in the visible, and viewing the Earth at nine discrete angles, will provide measurements that lead to determination of surface albedo and vegetation canopy structural parameters, thereby leading to derivations of photosynthetically-active radiation and improved values of canopy photosynthesis and transpiration rates.  MODIS, operating in the visible and infrared with spatial resolution from 250 m to 1 km at nadir, will be the primary sensor for providing data on terrestrial biospheric dynamics and vegetation process activity. Land products from MODIS include spectral albedo, land cover, spectral vegetation indices, snow and ice cover, surface temperature and fire, plus biophysical variables such as LAI and fraction of photosyntheticallyactive radiation. 1.2.5 Cryospheric Systems The cryosphere is an integral part of the global climate system, with important linkages and feedbacks generated through its influence on surface energy and moisture fluxes, clouds, precipitation, hydrology, and atmospheric  and oceanic circulation. Because of the sensitivity of the cryosphere to temperature changes, accurate information on the rate and magnitude of changes in cryospheric elements (ice sheets, sea ice, snow cover, lake ice, permafrost) is essential. In particular, the potential for ice-sheet melting and associated sea-level rise under conditions of global warming is a central concern. High-latitude regions exhibit the greatest warming in response to higher levels of greenhouse gases in many GCM experiments. Unfortunately, climate models do not yet provide accurate meteorological simulations over the polar regions. Further, significant improvements in the representation of cryospheric processes and in understanding cryosphereclimate linkages and feedbacks are required to reduce uncertainties in the prediction of high-latitude climate change. Realistic simulation of snow cover in climate models is essential for correct representation of the surface energy balance, as well as for understanding winter water storage and predicting year-round runoff. The lack of meteorological and snow-cover data to execute, calibrate, and validate snow-cover models is a major obstacle to improved simulations. Positive feedbacks involving sea ice and climate change have also been treated rather simply in global climate models although studies have shown that this important feedback is dependent on lead fraction, melt ponds, ice-thickness distribution, snow cover, and sea-ice extent. Glacier mass balance, and the potential for rapid ice-sheet thinning and sea-level rise, represents one of the most significant issues in assessing the impact of future climate change. Several issues limit our knowledge: large uncertainties in current ice-sheet mass balance estimates, questions of how climate change will be manifested and amplified in polar regions, the difficulty of predicting how atmospheric circulation and precipitation will change at high latitudes, uncertainties in the ""fast physics"" of ice flow, and questions concerning the characteristics of ""triggers"" for rapid change in ice flow (e.g., ice-shelf basal melting). The major scientific challenges are: 1) to quantify the exchanges of freshwater between the hydrosphere and cryosphere, 2) to understand the role of such exchanges in climate variability and change, and 3) to improve the ability to simulate the important geophysical properties and processes controlling energy exchanges in the cryosphere. Long-term, consistent data sets are required to document changes in the cryosphere and to validate transient simulations using global climate models. Without a more thorough analysis of ice-sheet, snow-cover and sea-ice mass balance, it will be difficult to develop more-comprehensive models of the cryosphere.   18  EOS SCIENCE PLA  N  - CHAPTER 1  NASA's EOS directly addresses many of these critical issues:  MODIS will provide near-daily global coverage of snow-covered versus snow-free areas, and with MODIS' on-board visible/near-infrared calibrators, radiances of snow can be calculated. AMSR-E will provide a weekly snow extent product that will extend the long-term time series of passive microwave-derived snow extent started in 1978. The higher spatial resolution of AMSR-E compared to the Scanning Multispectral Microwave Radiometer (SMMR) and the Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) will improve the ability to map snow cover in forested regions. Combined, MODIS, AMSR-E, MISR, and ASTER will provide detailed, multi-sensor information on snow-cover extent, albedo, and surface temperature.  EOS scientists are developing and validating algorithms that will use AMSR-E data to determine snow-water equivalent, an important parameter for weather forecasting and climate model validation.  AMSR-E will provide data for deriving estimates of sea-ice concentration and sea-ice type, extending time series of ice extent in both polar regions and adding to the information on seasonal and interannual variability in the fraction of open water.  ASTER and ETM+ provide the opportunity to monitor and detect changes in permafrost through measures of land cover, snow cover, snow depth, soil moisture, surface reflectance, surface temperature, and surfacedisplacement features.  ASTER and ETM+ provide opportunities for increasing spatial and spectral resolution and repeat imaging capability of surface ice-sheet features.  The Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS), by accurately measuring ice-sheet topography, will enable improved ice-flow models to be developed. With repeated measurements GLAS will reveal changes in surface elevation and hence mass balance of the ice sheets. 1.2.6 Ozone and Stratospheric Chemistry Ozone influences climate. For instance, removal of ozone from the stratosphere causes cooling of the stratosphere and a small, but non-negligible, offset to the greenhouse  forcing from CO2, N2O, CH4, and CFCs. The size of the radiative forcing due to stratospheric ozone loss is very sensitive to the profile of the ozone loss. Seasonal changes are determined by the winter-summer changes in the stratospheric circulation. Interannual changes are linked to the eleven-year solar cycle in ultraviolet (UV) input from the sun and to the amount of volcanic aerosols in the stratosphere. Superimposed on these variations are anthropogenic changes related to the release into the atmosphere of human-made chemicals containing chlorine. The most significant departures from normal have been changes in Antarctic polar ozone, leading to the phenomenon known as the ozone hole. Not until 1996 had changes in Arctic polar ozone been detected that are comparable to the changes in the Antarctic polar ozone. In recent decades it has become clear that there are also significant decreases in stratospheric ozone in midlatitudes as well. The basic outline of the chemical processes that control stratospheric ozone appears to have been established, and changes in stratospheric ozone distribution have been accounted for in terms of chemical processes, transport, interactions with aerosols and polar stratospheric clouds, and interactions with solar ultraviolet radiation and energetic particles. However, a number of issues remain. 2D ozone models are not able to provide accurate representations of the ozone trends that were observed in middle and high latitudes over the 1980-to-1990 time period, while the 3D models suffer from unrealistic temperature fields which, in turn, alter the photochemistry. Variability in ultraviolet radiation reaching the Earth leads to changes in global total ozone. Energetic particle flux variations from the sun may also drive natural ozone variations. Both natural changes and human-made changes must be understood and separated if we are to have a firm understanding of how stratospheric chemistry will evolve. Required measurements must satisfy the need for meteorological information; the need for chemical information including both chemical and dynamical measurements in both the stratosphere and troposphere; the need for stratospheric aerosol and polar stratospheric cloud information; and the need for solar-ultraviolet flux determinations. In addition there must be a concerted effort at validating the satellite measurements. NASA's EOS provides many key contributions:  EOS limb sounders (MLS and HIRDLS) will greatly improve the accuracy, precision, and resolution of temperature measurements in the tropopause region. HIRDLS will provide higher horizontal resolution tem-   O  VERVIEW  19  perature profiles than have been available heretofore. MLS will provide OH measurements that were not previously available.  The SAGE III instrument will provide many advances including the first satellite measurements of the size distribution of polar stratospheric clouds.  Fully interactive chemical dynamical models are being developed especially for interpretation of EOS data.  Wind fields provided by the NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) Data Assimilation Office (DAO) are of sufficient quality to remove the dynamical uncertainty from tracer observations. 1.2.7 Volcanoes and climate effects of aer osols Volcanic emissions can cause significant variations of climate on a variety of time scales--just one very large eruption can cause a measurable change in the Earth's weather with a time scale of a few years. Sulfur dioxide released from the magma may be oxidized to sulfuric acid aerosols in the stratosphere, where they may reside for a year or more, generally producing cooling at the Earth's surface. The amount of stratospheric aerosols and their effects on climate depend on the ability of the eruption to inject material into the stratosphere and on the sulfur content of the emissions. However, microphysical properties of the aerosol particles must be taken into account in reckoning whether their infrared absorptivity, which acts to warm the Earth, or their albedo effect, which acts to cool the Earth, will be dominant. Stratospheric aerosols produced by volcanic eruptions can influence stratospheric chemistry both through chemical reactions that take place on the surface of the aerosols and through temperature changes induced by their presence in the stratosphere. The presence of volcanic aerosols in the stratosphere has recently been tied to depletion of stratospheric ozone in temperate latitudes. The concept is that sulfate aerosols serve as sites for heterogeneous chemical reactions which have the effect of destroying ozone. Aerosols contributed by humans have been increasing, particularly those associated with SO 2 from combustion of fossil fuels and from biomass burning. The primary effect of these anthropogenic aerosols on the Earth's energy balance is a cooling of about -0.5 Wm-2 compared to the forcing associated with the change in greenhouse gases during the industrial age of about +2 Wm-2. Subsonic aircraft flying in the lower stratosphere  are also a source of aerosol particles. The direct radiative effects on climate of tropospheric aerosols are hard to assess because of the wide range of chemical compositions, time and spatial distributions, range of particle sizes and shapes, interactions with water vapor and clouds, and overall global variability that are dependent on both natural sources and human activities. Assessments of the indirect effects of tropospheric aerosols are even more difficult to make, yet they may be as significant as the direct effects. Volcanoes pose significant hazards for people and property on the ground, and the major challenge to satellite-based observations of volcanic hazards is the development of techniques that can be used in a predictive manner to detect an evolving volcanic crisis and to provide timely information to the relevant authorities on the ground. The hazards associated with eruptions are diverse and numerous, and include the health hazards associated with low-altitude volcanic gases and loss of life and property by inundation by lava flows, pyroclastic flows, and mud flows. There is also an increasingly frequent potential for unexpected aircraft encounters with volcanic plumes or clouds, with the potential catastrophic loss of life due to a major air crash. NASA's EOS directly addresses many of these critical issues:  MODIS, MISR, ASTER, and ETM+ will be used to characterize the number, location, type, and duration of both lava-producing and explosive eruptions. Plume-top altitudes and topography provided by MODIS, ASTER, HIRDLS, and MISR will allow testing of physical models of plume rise and dispersal. Volcano topography will be derived from ASTER, Vegetation Canopy Lidar (VCL), and foreign-partner radars. Measurements of different aspects of sulfur dioxide abundance will be made by the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS), the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI), TES, MLS, and ASTER. Several EOS instruments, SAGE III, EOSP, MISR, OMI, GLAS, and HIRDLS, will monitor stratospheric and tropospheric aerosols. Continuous measurements made by MODIS, CERES, and SAGE III will provide an important record of the effects of volcanic aerosols on the Earth's radiation budget and on global vertical profiles of atmospheric temperature and com-         20  EOS SCIENCE PLA  N  - CHAPTER 1  position. GLAS on the EOS ICESat-1 spacecraft and the Vegetation Canopy Lidar (VCL) will provide valuable information on the vertical and spatial extent of significant stratospheric and tropospheric aerosol layers.  EOS measurements will also enable the first truly global inventory of volcanic eruptions, as well as the high-temporal-resolution study of surface flows and eruption plumes in the stratosphere. Through a combination of multiple EOS instrument measurements, volcano hazard mitigation will also be improved because of the dramatic increase in the quantitative measurement of lava temperatures, gas emissions, surface topography, eruption plume tracking, and ground deformation. 1.2.8 N a tional and international contributions to major field campaigns EOS observations and studies described above also support considerable surface observation efforts and major field campaigns. Examples of major programs include:  FIRE (the First ISCCP Regional Experiment) is an ongoing multi-agency international program to support the development of improved cloud radiation parameterization schemes.  GEWEX (Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment) focuses on observing and modeling the hydrologic cycle and energy fluxes in the atmosphere, at the land surface, and in the upper layers of the oceans. GCIP (GEWEX Continental-Scale International Project) focuses on determination of the variability of the Earth's hydrological cycle and energy exchange budget over a continental scale.  CLIVAR (for climate variability), a major project of the World Climate Research Program (WCRP), seeks to understand and predict climate variability on interannual-to-centennial time scales.  GOALS (Global Ocean, Atmosphere, Land System), a major element of CLIVAR, directed to the study of seasonal-to-interannual variability.  DEC-CEN (for decadal-to-century variability), a major element of CLIVAR, directed to the study of decadal-to-century time-scale natural variability and the role of human activities in modifying climate.   JGOFS (Joint Global Ocean Flux Study), dedicated to satisfying critical elements of the IGBP, designed to study biogeochemical processes in the ocean and their role in climate change.  GLOBEC (U.S. and International Global Ocean Ecosystem Dynamics program) with the goal of determining how marine animal populations respond to climate variability and long-term climate change.  ARM (Atmospheric Radiation Measurement) Program, the largest contribution of the Department of Energy (DoE) to the USGCRP. It is a sophisticated measurement program using ground-based facilities as well as remotely-piloted aircraft to characterize the broadband and spectral components of both longwave and shortwave radiation reaching the Earth's surface, and to measure water vapor, temperature, and wind profiles throughout the lower atmosphere.  BSRN (Baseline Surface Radiation Network), an international program of the WCRP designed to improve the accuracy and sampling rate of surface-measured shortwave and especially longwave radiative fluxes.  ECLIPS (Experimental Cloud Lidar Pilot Study), will obtain observations of cloud-backscattering profiles from about 10 ground-based lidar sites around the world. It will provide cloud base altitudes for all cloud types including cirrus, and, in addition, will provide cloud top altitudes for optically-thin clouds.  ACSYS (Arctic Climate System Study), a WCRP project aimed at improved understanding of the role of the Arctic in the climate system, and studying global climate change and variability in the Arctic.  SHEBA (Surface Heat Budget of the Arctic Ocean), a multi-national project whose goals are to develop and test models of Arctic ocean-atmosphere interactions and to improve the interpretation of satellite remotesensing data in the Arctic.  BOREAS (Boreal Ecosystems Atmosphere Study), a large-scale international field experiment, with the objective of improving our understanding of the exchanges of radiative energy, heat, water, carbon dioxide, and trace gases between the boreal forest and the lower atmosphere.   O  VERVIEW  21  1.3 Measurement strategy EOS and follow-on missions serve a unique and valuable role in meeting global change objectives, including: repetitive, synoptic coverage of the Earth-atmosphere-ocean system; observations in spectral bands from the ultraviolet to the microwave, depending on application; problem-appropriate spatial resolution; and absolute radiometric calibration. No other current or planned remote-sensing system matches this combination of capabilities. In order to accomplish the measurement objectives of EOS, together with an awareness of multiagency and multi-national satellite observing systems, EOS has developed a measurement strategy that includes: 1) Simultaneous observations with a group of sensors on the same platform (satellite) that, taken together, improve either the accuracy or the scientific content of observations in comparison with measurements from a single instrument. This strategy depends on a close coordination in space and time, and is generally easier, if not absolutely required, on a single satellite. 2) An overlap strategy such that sensors can be intercompared and intercalibrated in order to construct long-term climate records. This strategy depends on using similar or identical sensors in orbit at the same time, but not necessarily in the same orbit or observing the same locations at the same time. 3) A diurnal sampling strategy for rapidly varying systems or ones with significant temporal variation (most notably clouds) in which more than one satellite is in orbit at the same time (preferably one sun-synchronous and one precessing). 4) A calibration strategy required to perform intra-system and intersystem data comparisons for global change research and monitoring. 5) A data continuity strategy that does not mandate the cloning of the existing satellite systems but retains the scientifically essential capabilities of the EOS systems. 1.3.1 Simultaneous observations Specific examples where simultaneous observations are vitally important to meeting the measurement objectives, or are necessary to have sufficient accuracy to enable health and property impacts to be accurately assessed are: 1) Cloud properties (amount, optical properties, height) derived from MODIS (or comparable well-calibrated multi-spectral imager) must be coincident in space and time with radiative energy fluxes (top of atmosphere, surface) derived from CERES. Due to the high temporal variability of cloud systems and the spatial variability of clouds at spatial resolutions as small as several hundred kilometers, it is necessary for a broadband sensor (like CERES) to be on the same platform or have simultaneity between three and six minutes with a multi-spectral visible-infrared imager (like MODIS). If MODIS were to fail and CERES continue to operate, the radiation budget at the TOA (cloud radiative forcing) could still be derived, analogous to what was done with the Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) between 1984 and 1989, but the cloud feedback could not. In this way, one could see what clouds en masse were doing to the Earth's atmosphere, but it would not be possible to determine whether the cloud forcing was due to changes in cloud type, vertical distribution, or amount. If CERES were to fail but MODIS continue to operate, the cloud radiative and micro-physical properties (cloud phase, particle size, vertical distribution, etc.) could be determined, but not their radiative effect on climate either at the TOA or at the Earth's surface. The strategy that EOS has adopted to date is to baseline CERES and MODIS on the same platform (AM-1 and PM-1) to enable the enhanced science of cloud forcing and cloud feedback (response) to be performed. 2) Atmospheric temperature and humidity determinations require, at present, a combination of sensors. The EOS PM-1 satellite will include an advanced sounder system (AIRS, AMSU, and HSB). The three instruments together are necessary to obtain both temperature and moisture profiles in the Earth's atmosphere using both infrared and microwave sensors. The current National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) operational sounding system (TIROS Operational Vertical Sounder [TOVS]) also includes a suite of three sensors measuring both infrared (High-Resolution Infrared Radiation Sounder [HIRS]) and microwave (AMSU, MHS) radiation. NOAA depends on this full system for weather forecasting and currently launches a replacement satellite if one of these sensors fails.   22  EOS SCIENCE PLA  N  - CHAPTER 1  This is therefore, as currently implemented, a simultaneity requirement involving three sensors. 3) Ocean surface topography, as demonstrated on the Ocean Topography Experiment (TOPEX)/Poseidon and later this century on the joint U.S.-France Jason-1 satellite, involves a dual frequency altimeter, ranging system, and microwave radiometer. Once again, this suite of sensor capabilities can be flown together on a single satellite (as TOPEX/Poseidon and Jason-1) but a combination of 3 sensors is required to achieve an accuracy requirement of 3 cm at the ocean surface. The microwave radiometer is used to make water vapor (pathlength) corrections to the radar altimeter measurements, thereby improving their accuracy. Other examples where simultaneity is desirable, but not absolutely required, or where the accuracy would be severely degraded without simultaneity, include: a) Tropospheric chemistry (precursors--the accuracy of methane (CH4) and carbon monoxide (CO) measurements to be obtained from the Canadian-built MOPITT instrument, scheduled to be flown on EOS AM-1 in late 1998, is enormously enhanced by the ability to use MODIS to derive a cloud mask at a 1-km spatial resolution. Without the ability to have nearly simultaneous high-spatial-resolution measurements of cloud cover, the much coarser resolution MOPITT (22-km pixels) would have partially-filled fields of view that would contaminate the signal and degrade the accuracy of the CH4 abundance and CO concentration determinations. It is not possible to quantitatively estimate the accuracy loss that would result without the presence of a high-resolution multispectral imager onboard the same spacecraft. b) Measurements of fire occurrence and volcanic effects over the land are aided by having a global surveyor with moderate-to-high spatial resolution (e.g., MODIS) that can determine the presence and location of fires, molten lava from volcanic eruptions, and burning oil wells, and then be used to schedule the acquisition of high spatial resolution, limited coverage sensors such as Landsat-7/ETM+ or AM-1/ ASTER, each of which is able to obtain only about 100 scenes globally per day. This telescoping ability to find a hot thermal anomaly and subsequently to acquire high resolution imagery of the affected area, is exceedingly valuable. On the other hand, there is no requirement whatsoever that these measurements  be made simultaneously in space or time, only that both capabilities exist in orbit at the same time (different satellites and orbits permissible). c) Total solar irradiance (TSI) and ultraviolet spectral irradiance are complementary. When one sees a variation in the total irradiance from the sun, much of that variation occurs in the ultraviolet. Hence, monitoring both the spectral and total distribution of solar radiation is valuable, one for energy input to the climate system, and the other for its impact on the absorption within the atmosphere and subsequent role in ozone production. There is, however, no requirement that these measurements be made from the same satellite or in the same orbit, but that they be in orbit at the same time. If the Solar Stellar Irradiance Comparison Experiment (SOLSTICE) is lost, it has no impact on the total solar irradiance to be derived from ACRIM, for measurements from SOLSTICE are not required to interpret ACRIM observations. 1.3.2 Overlap str ategy The vast majority of EOS sensors, those that are used for long-term monitoring of climate parameters, require observations over a long period of time (e.g., 15+ years). This is generally beyond the scope of a single satellite/ sensor system, thereby requiring multiple launches. The EOS observing strategy includes subsequent launches of similar sensors of potentially different optical and electronic design, and hence the long-term continuity of science results requires a minimum of a six-month period of overlap between subsequent launches of similar sensors. This overlap strategy assures an ability to intercompare the absolute calibration, performance, and idiosyncratic characteristics of subsequent observing systems. In most cases, this observing strategy is highly desired in order to assure a long-term, high-quality, data set. For ACRIM measurements of TSI, however, it is an absolute requirement, since technology is beyond the capability of measuring absolute TSI to the required accuracy. Hence, in order to obtain a long-term data set over one or more solar cycles (11 years), it is necessary to have more than one TSI instrument, such as ACRIM, in orbit at the same time. Again, this does not require that they be on the same satellite or in the same orbit, but that a new satellite, with a replacement sensor, be launched before the failure of the replaced sensor.   O  VERVIEW  23  1.3.3 Diurnal sampling For ocean color and SST characterization, it is essential that well-calibrated data be available globally in order to quantify changes in the carbon uptake of the oceans during both El Nio and non-El Nio years. It is widely accepted by the Earth science community that uncertainties in cloud properties, especially their changes in response to a build up of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the Earth s atmosphere, are the largest source of uncertainty in current climate-model predictions of future climate response. Recent observations that the nighttime minimum temperature around the globe is increasing more rapidly than daytime maximum temperature seems to suggest changes are now occurring in global cloud cover, as other greenhouse gas explanations are unable to account for this behavior. A quantitative assessment of cloud properties (cloud droplet size, cloud height, etc.) requires a well-calibrated and continuous observing capability, coupled with advances in model development. Quantitative global observations are the greatest constraint on model parameterization and assumptions. Unlike the ocean and atmosphere, the land surface is distinguished by high-spatial-frequency processes that require a high-spatial resolution to characterize. In particular, man-made changes (e.g., deforestation) are often initiated at scales requiring high resolution for early detection. The EOS satellites potentially offer the unique capability to seasonally monitor important small-scale processes on a global scale, viz, the inter- and intra-annual cycles of vegetation growth; deforestation; agricultural land use; erosion and other forms of land degradation; snow accumulation and melt and the associated freshwater reservoir replenishment; urbanization. The other systems affording global coverage do not provide the resolution to observe these processes in detail, and only the Landsat component of the EOS system provides a 20-year retrospective record of these processes. To achieve a measurement strategy for highly-variable systems, most notably clouds and associated precipitation, EOS and partnering international space programs, include multiple satellites in orbit at one time or sometimes single spacecraft that are in mid-inclination and hence precessing orbits. An example of the latter is the TRMM satellite, launched in November 1997, that is in a 35-inclination orbit covering primarily tropical latitudes. The orbit of this satellite precesses in time so that a single area on the Earth's surface is observed at different times of day on subsequent days. This diurnal sampling strategy is also important for severe weather, such as hurricanes, floods, lightning, and tornadoes, and is a primary focus of geosynchronous observing systems. The loss of  key observing capability or an entire satellite during the prime hurricane season in the fall has incalculable social costs. 1.3.4 Calibration requirements Calibration is perhaps the most difficult EOS data continuity requirement to appreciate. The critical need to perform intra-system and intersystem data comparisons for global change research and monitoring justifies this requirement. In the future, EOS data will complement and add to the observations provided by systems of other agencies (e.g., NOAA, European Space Agency [ESA], National Space Development Agency of Japan [NASDA]) and will be compared to retrospective data acquired by earlier satellites, such as Landsat, the Earth Radiation Budget Satellite (ERBS), TOPEX/Poseidon, the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS), the Solar Maximum Mission (SMM), and Nimbus-7. A lack of calibration would limit substantially the value of these comparisons. The situation is analogous to recording the height of a child with different sticks at different ages. If the different sticks are not calibrated in absolute units (e.g., in or cm), then we cannot infer the interannual growth rate of the child from stick-based measurements. Likewise, the reflected energy recorded by EOS sensors requires calibration in absolute units of energy. Otherwise, detecting and characterizing land-surface changes by comparing data from different sensors (e.g., MODIS to Landsat-7 data) becomes difficult, if not impossible. Similar examples can be found in such basic measurements as the energy output of the sun, Sea Surface Temperature (SST), total ozone content, energy balance of the Earth, ocean circulation, and global cloud cover. Calibration will help prevent ""apples-to-oranges"" intercomparisons and analyses. Calibration will greatly enhance the role of EOS data to global-change research in the late 1990s and beyond. Without well-calibrated instruments it would not be possible to determine whether the ozone content of the Earth's atmosphere was decreasing over North America and Europe with any certainty, since it would also be possible that the satellite sensor had simply degraded. Without the ability to quantify such changes in the instrumentation, it would otherwise be impossible to ascribe changes to the global environment, whether due to humans or nature. 1.3.5 Continuity The data continuity requirement does not mandate the cloning of the existing satellite systems. Only the scientifically essential capabilities of the EOS systems must be retained: i.e., the aforementioned repetitive, synoptic   24  EOS SCIENCE PLA  N  - CHAPTER 1  coverage, spectral coverage, appropriate spatial resolution, and calibration. These capabilities should be achieved by the most cost-effective and reliable technological approach available. Further, data continuity must not serve as a constraint on scientific and technologic advancements at any given time (i.e., not frozen in 1970s technology). System advancements that advance the role of EOS and enhance the value of the data (e.g., the addition of certain spectral bands that facilitate atmospheric correction) should be fostered and encouraged. Data continuity is not an excuse for technologic and scientific stagnation. The requirement is set forth only to ensure that the unique and critical role of EOS, as afforded by its scientifically essential capabilities, continues into the late 1990s and beyond. Specific examples where calibration, validation, and continuity are vitally important are: 1) Radar altimetry of the oceans from Jason-1 will be used to assess seasonal-to-interdecadal changes of the ocean circulation. At these time scales the ocean is thought to play a major role in climate change through the transport of heat and exchange of heat with the atmosphere. Radar altimetry is the only way to obtain global measurements of the upper-ocean circulation to determine how and where the heat is moved. This information is required to improve forecasts of seasonal-to-interdecadal climate change. 2) Jason-1, AM-1, and PM-1 measurements will provide crucial information for modeling the ocean ecosystems, since ocean ecosystems are strongly influenced by the advection of nutrients and plankton communities. Understanding how these ecosystems change on seasonal-to-interdecadal time scales is a goal of EOS and can only be done with continuous observations of the ocean circulation. 3) At time scales less than a century, the ocean circulation is primarily driven by the force of the wind stress on the ocean surface. The lack of long-term accurate observations of the wind stress at the ocean surface has been a primary deterrent to improved forecasts of ocean-atmosphere climate phenomena, such as the El Nio. EOS will address this issue by providing long-term observations of the global wind stress on the ocean surface with SeaWinds, to be flown on QuikSCAT and the Japanese ADEOS II spacecraft. 4) The direct observation of global sea-level rise on seasonal-to-interdecadal time scales is a goal of Jason-1. This unique parameter provides a means to monitor  changes in the global climate, such as global warming or cooling, changes in the water cycle, or tectonic changes in the shape of the Earth's surface. This measurement requires accuracy of 1 part in 10 9 ; long-term calibration of the altimeter system is essential to sort out instrument drift from geophysical signal. 5) The observations of the ocean circulation provided by Jason-1 will be used in global ocean models through data assimilation to improve our ability to forecast climate change. Data assimilation improves a model forecast through the use of direct observations. Assimilation requires knowledge of both the uncertainty in the observations and the model physics. Calibration of Jason-1 instruments is essential to quantify the error budget of the altimeter system for model assimilation and prediction. The goals of Jason-1 cannot be achieved without careful calibration of the instrument throughout the lifetime of the mission. 6) Satellite altimetry provides the only means of measuring the global ocean in a synoptic fashion, in order to understand the physics of ocean circulation. Calibrated, long-term measurements of the ocean circulation are needed to develop and validate climate prediction models with practical benefits for society that could be measured in trillions of dollars over the next century. 7) Long-term observations of the ocean circulation from Jason-1 are crucial for understanding the seasonal, interannual, and decade-to-century fluctuations in ocean circulation that are both responsible for, and indicative of, climate change. Thus, both climate prediction and climate monitoring are at stake. 8) A long-term fluctuation in global heat transport, such as into the N. Atlantic via a conveyor-belt circulation, would manifest itself in subtle changes of the time-mean-height differences across the Gulf Stream and connecting currents, as well as in changes in the eddy variability along the entire path of the great conveyor. Model simulations combined with longterm ocean-height measurements could lead to an advanced warning of the regional aspects of global warming. 9) The primary purpose of the GLAS laser altimeter is to determine on-going changes in ice-sheet volume and interannual and decadal changes in ice elevations that may be caused by changes in melting and pre-   O  VERVIEW  25  cipitation in polar regions. The data are needed to predict sea-level rise during the next century. About five years of GLAS observations are required to determine the present-day rate of ice growth or shrinkage. Longer-term observations are needed to determine how the melting and precipitation forcings are changing as climate warming occurs, in order to confirm or revise predictions. 10) Sea ice is a major variable affecting the predicted amplification of the greenhouse warming in polar regions and the moisture available for changes in snowfall and ice-sheet mass balance. While twenty years of satellite passive microwave observations of sea-ice area have demonstrated that significant decadal-scale changes occur regionally, the overall hemispheric and global changes have been small. Nevertheless, problems remain in producing a uniform time series due to changes in the sensors, inadequate calibrations, and data gaps. For example, a new data gap would be assured if recorders on the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) satellite carrying SSM/I were to fail. With the data sets available, it has been very difficult to assess whether the overall sea-ice changes observed during the last twenty years are associated with changes in polar climate or are instrumental. AMSR-E on EOS PM-1 will provide a well-calibrated long-term data set of sea-ice extent and open water within the ice pack, as well as snow cover on land and the extent and duration of snow melting. 11) Clouds and changes in cloud cover have an enormous impact on climate change, since the longwave greenhouse effect of clouds is approximately seven times larger than that of doubling carbon dioxide. Thus a small change in cloud-top altitude, cloud thickness, cloud-droplet size or phase, or extent, can have a dramatic impact on the nighttime minimum and daytime maximum temperature at the Earth's surface under changing climate forcing conditions. Hence, a longterm, well-calibrated multispectral data set (such as  that to be provided by MODIS on EOS AM-1 and PM-1) is necessary to quantify cloud properties in the Earth's atmosphere. In addition, the radiation response at the TOA and at the surface, to be provided by CERES, are necessary to constrain climate models and hence improve our confidence in their predictions. 12) SST can be monitored from space provided the calibration of the thermal infrared channels is well determined and stable. Stability is necessary to be able to ascribe long-term changes to the ocean surface rather than to the instrument. Quantitative radiometry is also required to make atmospheric corrections, whereby the effects of the intervening atmosphere (aerosols, water vapor) are removed from the spacecraft signal to infer the color and hence chlorophyll content of the oceans. 13) Long-term ozone trends, and atmospheric constituent changes that lead to ozone loss, can most readily be monitored from space using well-calibrated sensors. TOMS ozone measurements over many years (and now to be supplemented by OMI on the Chemistry mission) have been extremely valuable for long-term ozone-trend measurements. In addition, SAGE II (and later SAGE III) has been really vital in quantifying ozone trends due to its self-calibrating capability. The MLS sensor on EOS Chemistry will continue very exciting results obtained from UARS that show a high correlation between enhanced chlorine monoxide (ClO) levels and reduced ozone in the Antarctic polar vortex. Of perhaps more relevance to the public at large is the very large signature of high ClO in the Northern latitudes over North America and Europe. Monitoring ozone degradation, and subsequent recovery (following implementation of the Montreal protocol) requires continued measurements of both ozone and chemical species that affect ozone concentration, using well-calibrated sensors.   26  EOS SCIENCE PLA  N  - CHAPTER 1  1.4 EOS contributions to national goals and needs The USGCRP is placing increased emphasis on policy relevance in defining the breadth and focus of the national research efforts. End-to-end assessments (from the human and natural forcing factors to the human mitigation and adaptation response) are key requirements for national policy development. This refocusing of the USGCRP is prompting an examination of existing programs to determine if they are sufficiently policy-relevant and if they are responsive to national needs. Consequently, the USGCRP office and leading global change agencies developed a preliminary set of questions and products to assess the policy relevance of major USGCRP efforts. Much of the research underway and planned as part of NASA's EOS is directed toward the highest priority elements of the USGCRP. EOS directly addresses national policy requirements for atmospheric ozone, natural variability and enhanced climate prediction, and long-term climate change. EOS also provides fundamental measures related to ecosystem change and aids in biodiversity research. Much of EOS research is a prerequisite for significant elements of the human dimensions research plan. 1.4.1 Atmospheric oz one and UV-B radiation 1.4.1.1 The national interest The development of the Antarctic ozone hole and the global depletion of stratospheric ozone is well documented from satellite (Nimbus 7 SBUV, TOMS, Meteor TOMS, ADEOS TOMS, and NOAA SBUV) and in situ measurements. Ozone is a primary shield from harmful ultraviolet radiation and is a significant element of the global energy balance. The depletion of stratospheric ozone has been tied to two major causes. First, ozone depletion is clearly associated with a six-fold increase in stratospheric chlorine above natural levels, in large part due to the human emission of industrial chemicals such as chlorofluorocarbons. Second, volcanic emission of sulfur dioxide can lead to ozone depletion and increased annual variability. For example, the eruption of Mt. Pinatubo is correlated with a 35% reduction in stratospheric ozone at low Northern Hemisphere latitudes. Three additional factors may influence ozone chemistry: 1) ozone depletion can be caused by other radical species that are products of industrial emissions, 2) global warming may be a significant factor in ozone depletion because greenhouse gas warming leads to stratospheric cooling, enhancing the formation of polar stratospheric clouds that in turn trigger ozone-destroying chemical reactions, and 3) the emissions from high-altitude aircraft may also perturb stratospheric chemistry. 1.4.1.2 National policy requirements The detection, causes, and impacts of significant changes in stratospheric ozone. 1.4.1.3 EOS policy-relevant contributions EOS addresses the most important policy-relevant questions including the detection and prediction of ozone depletion, the isolation of human versus natural factors forcing changes in atmospheric ozone, the response of atmospheric ozone to human forcing, and an understanding of the uncertainties associated with ozone depletion and UV-B radiation. 1) What are the human and natural forcing agents in stratospheric ozone?  HIRDLS, MLS, and SAGE III will monitor anthropogenic Cl and additional known threats from industrial chemicals including CFCs, other halogens (brominecontaining compounds), nitrogen compounds used both in agriculture and emitted directly by high-flying aircraft, and sulfur from stratospheric aircraft (leading to increased aerosols with resulting heterogeneous chemistry detrimental to ozone).  The injected SO2 from volcanic eruptions leads to more sulfate aerosols in the stratosphere, allowing enhanced heterogeneous chemistry (involving the industrial chlorine already in the stratosphere) detrimental to ozone. EOS will assess the role of volcanism in stratospheric chemistry through multiple measurements including: sulfate aerosols mapped and monitored by HIRDLS and SAGE III; total column abundance of aerosols measured with MODIS and MISR; volcanic gas (SO2 and HCL) contributions measured with TES and MLS; and stratospheric sulfur dioxide monitored with TOMS and OMI. The chemical imprint of volcanoes will be directly tied to the latitude, season, and eruption characteristics of the volcanic eruptions.  MOPITT will measure the concentration of CO, which is related to the tropospheric concentration of OH, and thus the indirect control of the amount of CH4 and HCFCs that reach the stratosphere.  AIRS and HIRDLS will provide an accurate record of natural temperature variations for the study of chemi-   O  VERVIEW  27  cal reactions. SAGE III and HIRDLS will measure polar stratospheric clouds and temperatures (e.g., stratospheric warmings). These measurements will provide an understanding of the role of natural temperature changes in producing ozone variability and the potential determination of the role of global warming.  MLS will contribute measurements that are not degraded by clouds or volcanic aerosols, allowing critical observations of important extreme events such as volcanic eruptions and that can be made in the presence of polar stratospheric clouds.    MODIS will measure total column ozone twice daily with 10-20% accuracy, which can provide backup for the more-accurate TOMS and OMI instruments. EOS investigators will produce long-term calibrated data sets based on intercomparison studies including earlier Nimbus 7 SBUV, TOMS, Meteor TOMS, ADEOS TOMS, and NOAA SBUV/2 measurements. The ozone-mapping instruments on the European Remote-Sensing Satellite-2 (ERS-2) and the Environmental Satellite, ESA (ENVISAT) will provide additional calibrated data sets. EOS global vertical sounding capability of the primary radicals, reservoirs, and source gases in the stratospheric chemical cycle and EOS aerosol measurements, in conjunction with existing capabilities with TOMS, provide considerable opportunity to develop predictive and diagnostic models for ozone depletion and UV-B radiation. EOS investigators will develop 3-dimensional chemical transport models of the stratosphere, in predictive and diagnostic modes, which can be utilized to calculate radical trace-gas concentrations, estimate ozone losses, and calculate the UV-B flux.      The long-term measurements of ozone and other critical gases, temperatures, and aerosols provided by EOS and other sources is critical to separate natural variations and human-induced ozone depletion. 2) What has been and will be the response of atmospheric ozone and UV-B radiation to human forcing?  HIRDLS and MLS data products make essential contributions to detecting ozone depletion agents including: ClO, BrO, OH, NO, NO2 (chemical radicals); H 2 O 5 , CLONO 2 , HCl, HNO 3 (chemical reservoirs); H2O, N2O, CH4, F11, F12 (source gases); SO2 (volcanic injections). These species define the chemical cycles that destroy ozone. The measurements will be continuously made from the upper troposphere through the mesosphere at high horizontal and vertical resolution. The instruments are sufficiently stable to detect 1% changes. Daily three-dimensional fields of all parameters are produced.  SAGE III and HIRDLS will measure stratospheric ozone, as well as NO2, NO3, OClO, H2O, polar stratospheric clouds, temperature, and aerosols. EOS will provide 1-km vertical resolution, with excellent longterm precision, providing critical profile data needed to understand processes required to develop predictive models.  AIRS/AMSU will measure the vertical distribution of ozone in the troposphere and the stratosphere in five layers twice daily globally with an accuracy of 10% and will determine the total column with an accuracy of 3%, which can provide a backup for the TOMS and OMI instruments.  3) What are the uncertainties and what is the potential for change?  EOS vertical profiles (MLS, HIRDLS and SAGE III) address major uncertainties in understanding stratospheric chemistry. HIRDLS will provide daily measurements of the location and extent of polar stratospheric clouds on which chlorine is transformed into active forms. Ozone decreases that may occur in response to the unprecedented high chlorine abundances expected during the next decade and to additional trace gases emitted by humans are not known. MLS and HIRDLS, by continuously monitoring the key radicals that destroy ozone, provide a capability for the earliest-possible detection of potential ozone depletion even by yet undiscovered processes for enhancing the role of human-produced chemical radicals. EOS measurements, including stratospheric temperatures (AIRS, HIRDLS, MLS, and SAGE III) will increase our understanding of the potential ozone de-         28  EOS SCIENCE PLA  N  - CHAPTER 1  crease in response to the stratospheric cooling caused by increasing atmospheric CO2.  EOS monitoring of clouds and the radiant energy budget will provide a diagnostic measure of the UV-B transmission that is cloud dependent. CERES, AIRS, MODIS, and MISR will produce cloud-forcing products and cloud-radiative properties useful for UV-B analysis.  EOS will monitor volcanic eruptions and their impact as a major cause of natural variability in ozone chemistry and enhancement of the human forcing on ozone depletion.  EOS will be able to contribute to the assessment of the impact of ozone depletion and associated increases in UV-B through comparisons with MODIS primary productivity measurements. 1.4.2 Natural variability and enhanced climate prediction 1.4.2.1 The national interest The skillful prediction, months to years in advance, of precipitation and temperature can yield increased agricultural and forestry production and distribution, improved hydroelectric power planning and utilization, and moreeffective responses to floods and droughts and better management planning. The goal is the utilization of shortterm (seasonal and interannual) climate forecasting for social and economic benefit. Predictability has already been demonstrated for some aspects of the climate system, particularly for El Nio. Further, short-term climate forecasting, which requires a comprehensive knowledge of the atmospheric circulation and its interaction with the ocean and the land surface, contributes substantially to the predictions of long-term greenhouse warming. Shortterm climate forecasts can be validated and verified and the economic benefits can be directly proven. Many of the challenges inherent to long-term prediction can be met on seasonal-to-interannual time scales. Finally, detection of long-term human-induced climate change requires an understanding of natural variability. 1.4.2.2 National policy requirements 1) Operational predictions one year ahead of interannual climate fluctuations. 2) Detection, causes, and impacts of natural decadal climate variations.  1.4.2.3 EOS policy-relevant contributions EOS will help define the natural and human factors that influence seasonal-to-interannual climate. A significant fraction of natural climate variability is governed by modification of the atmosphere by global SST, by variations in land moisture, vegetation, and snow- and sea-ice cover globally. Additional variability is introduced from solar variability, longer-term anomalies, and volcanic eruptions. Human-induced modifications of atmospheric chemistry may alter the nature of seasonal-to-interannual variability. The EOS contributions to understanding climate variability will enhance the ability to predict climatic change and variability from seasons to decades in advance. 1) What are the natural and human factors that affect the seasonal-to-interannual climate and its anomalies?  EOS investigators will contribute substantially to the understanding of ocean-atmosphere interactions. Investigators will be able to combine altimetry (TOPEX/ Poseidon, ERS-1, ERS-2, Jason-1), scatterometry (NSCAT, SeaWinds), ocean color (MODIS, SeaWiFS), and SST measurements (MODIS, AIRS, AMSR-E), assimilate these observations into forecasting models and resolve major characteristics of the surface oceans responsible for natural variability. These observations, with the temperature and humidity measurements of AIRS/AMSU and the cloud-radiation budgets from CERES, will allow investigators to connect SST variations with the large-scale and mesoscale circulation and improve boundary layer models that describe airsea interaction. Global assimilation schemes will provide operational products necessary for predictions of interannual fluctuations and will also contribute to our understanding of the coupled ocean-atmosphere interactions and the prediction of phenomena such as El Nio.  EOS measurements of snow cover, sea ice, surface temperature, land cover, vegetation characteristics and related parameters (e.g., fraction of photosyntheticallyabsorbed radiation), surface albedo, atmospheric temperature and humidity and radiative fluxes (ASTER, MODIS, MISR, CERES, AIRS, AMSR-E) will be essential to initialize, validate, and verify climate models designed to assess the role of the land surface in governing seasonal-to-interannual variability at regional-to-global scales. EOS measurements will provide substantial improvements in comparison with existing capabilities (e.g., the Advanced Very HighResolution Radiometer [AVHRR]). Measurements of   O  VERVIEW  29  polar surface temperature, albedo, and sea-ice concentration will test climate model predictions of accelerated ""greenhouse"" warming in polar regions.  EOS will be able to track and characterize emissions from volcanic eruptions that produce climatic variability on time scales of seasons to years. MISR and ASTER can track the height of plumes, MODIS and MISR the dispersal of the particulates, TOMS, OMI, TES, and MLS the dispersal of SO2, and MISR, HIRDLS, and SAGE III the dispersal of stratospheric sulfate aerosols and the evolution of their vertical profiles. MODIS and MISR can provide a high-resolution view of the spatial distribution of stratospheric aerosols, and data from SAGE III, MODIS, and MISR can be used to monitor the evolution of the size of these aerosols.  EOS will be able to characterize the abundance and properties of natural and human-made tropospheric aerosols that may change the effect of greenhouse gases on climate. MODIS, MISR, and EOSP will detect regional and global changes of aerosol distribution and variability of their size. They will be able to track several sources of aerosol (e.g., MODIS observations of fires as a source of biomass burning aerosol). EOSP will also determine the aerosol refractive index, a measure of the aerosol composition. Wind-blown dust from arid regions will be monitored for major source regions. SAGE III will increase our understanding of aerosol loading and removal.  EOS (CERES, MODIS, AIRS, AMSR-E, and MISR) will provide a strong basis for monitoring variability in cloud properties (amount, type, liquid water content) which can both regulate climatic variability and define trends. Even 1-to-2% changes in cloud properties may be significant.  ACRIM will provide systematic monitoring of TSI variations, which are essential to separate anthropogenic forcing from natural variations.  SAGE III, HIRDLS, and MLS contribute observations to assess the interannual variability of radiatively-active gases (ozone, CH4, F11, F12, nitrous oxides, water vapor) which may impact climate variability.  The ability of EOS to monitor land-surface energy and moisture fluxes (particularly soil moisture) using a new generation of spatially-distributed hydrologic models   (based on MODIS, ASTER, AIRS, AMSR-E, and other satellite data) will help us to better understand landatmosphere climate interactions. EOS regional assessments provide baselines for determining changes in variability through monitoring of hydrologic parameters (precipitation, evaporation, water vapor, stream flows, glaciers, and snow cover) sensitive to climate change and through incorporation of historical observations.  2) What is the ability to predict climatic anomalies a season in adv ance and w h at is the mechanism fo r verifying, distributing, and using these results? Oneto-two years in advance?  EOS may not directly provide operational products that are predictions for a season or one-to-two years in advance; however, the entire suite of observations that define the characteristics of the surface (SSTs, land cover, (including snow), and sea ice) will provide important boundary conditions for predictions. The accuracy of these forecasts will likely depend on the accuracy with which we can measure the global state of the Earth system. Global-scale, near-real-time documentation of anomalies in regional precipitation-evaporation, snow cover, sea ice, and cloud cover will be of major value in climate forecasting. EOS will provide critical process information on airsea interaction and cloud-climate interactions, which are major limitations in current climate forecasts and coupled atmosphere-ocean-land-ice climate models. EOS observations from the full suite of surface and sounding sensors (particularly for temperature, humidity, clouds, and radiation) and 4-D assimilation efforts will contribute to forecast validation. EOS monitoring of volcanic eruptions and their characteristics (aerosol loading and release of gases) will provide significant data for determination of climate anomalies. MODIS, through its capability to monitor the extent and vigor of vegetation, will provide short-term predictive capability for drought monitoring in semi-arid environments.             30  EOS SCIENCE PLA  N  - CHAPTER 1   EOS altimeter and scatterometer measurements, coupled with in situ measurements from the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) campaigns, will allow an improved understanding of the threedimensional general ocean circulation and its influences on global change. These data and the associated understanding will aid the development of requisite models for making long-term predictions. 1.4.3 Long-term climate change including global warming 1.4.3.1 The national interest Human activities are leading to changes in the land surface and the composition of the atmosphere with significant potential to cause decadal climate change. The alteration of the land surface modifies the energy-watervegetation interaction at the land-atmosphere interface. Physically-based models indicate that changes in the surface energy and moisture budgets can have a significant impact on regional climates. Increases in carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases influence the global energy budget promoting global warming and related climate changes. The detection of global warming is the subject of considerable debate, as the observing system in place over the last 100 years is inadequate to isolate long-term natural variability from human-induced change and lacks the capability to determine small changes in global temperature. Consequently, an assessment of global warming is dependent on the predictions of climate models. Stateof-the-art general circulation models (GCMs) predict a global warming of between 1.5 and 4.5C and substantial changes in precipitation and evaporation for a doubling of the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration over its pre-industrial value. Improved estimates of mean sea-level change, on both local and global scales, as a means of detecting the consequences of greenhouse gas-induced global warming, is an important adjunct requirement. A climate change of this magnitude will have significant impact on energy utilization, agriculture (drought and floods), natural ecosystems, water resource availability, water quality, and potentially, sea level. However, the potential impact is very different for a 1.5C warming as opposed to a 4.5C warming. The magnitude and rate of global climate change control the potential impact on society. 1.4.3.2 National policy requirements 1) Plausible scenarios for regional climate and ecosystem change, suitable for impact analysis.  2) Improved estimates of the relative global-warming potential for various gases and aerosols, including their interactions and indirect effects of other chemical species. 3) Improved ability to determine the regional sources and sinks for atmospheric carbon dioxide, as part of the monitoring system for greenhouse-gas emissions-reduction agreement. 4) Reduction in the range of predictions of the rate and magnitude of global warming over the next century (through reductions in the uncertainties of cloud-climate interactions and ocean heat storage). 5) Predictions of anthropogenic interdecadal changes in regional climate, in the context of natural variability. 6) Detection, beyond reasonable doubt, of greenhousegas-induced global warming, and documentation of other climatically-significant changes in the global environment. 7) Improved understanding of the interactions of human societies with the global environment, enabling quantitative analyses of existing and anticipated patterns of change. 1.4.3.3 EOS policy-relevant contributions The detection of climate change, the reduction in the uncertainty associated with climate change, the improvement of estimates of global warming potential and sources and sinks of greenhouse gases, and improved prediction of regional change, including natural variability, depend on: 1) an adequate monitoring capability, 2) improved knowledge of the forcing factors, 3) improved predictive capability to determine the response of the climate system, and 4) an assessment of the uncertainties. EOS contributes to each of these fundamental components required to serve national policy requirements. The synergy between many observations and many investigators will allow EOS to contribute to the understanding of the morecomplex, yet essential, Earth processes, such as the hydrologic cycle. 1) What are the human-induced and natural forcing changes in the global system and climate?  MODIS, ASTER, and MISR will characterize changes in land-surface cover and surface vegetation, with the capability of providing long-term monitoring. EOS   O  VERVIEW  31  will provide surface fluxes of energy and carbon with unprecedented accuracy and spatial resolution. In conjunction with historical observations, the human alteration of the landscape can be mapped and utilized to determine the potential impact on climate.  AIRS/AMSU/HSB will determine the three-dimensional structure of moisture in the troposphere and stratosphere and will measure the spectral changes in the longwave radiation going to space, which are needed to monitor the effects of trace gases on global warming.  EOS will assess the role of volcanism as a natural forcing factor in the global system. Sulfate aerosols will be mapped and monitored with SAGE III; total column abundance of aerosols will be measured with MODIS and MISR; volcanic gases can be measured with TES, OMI, and MLS. The role of volcanism versus human-induced aerosol loading can be deciphered based on the chemical imprint of volcanoes, monitoring of volcanic eruptions, and examining trends in aerosol loading.  MODIS, MISR, and EOSP will detect regional and global changes in tropospheric aerosols.  Jason-1 and other precursor altimeter missions will provide a well-calibrated long-term measurement of absolute sea level. The accurate monitoring and prediction of the mean sea level on a global basis provides a means of detecting the effects of greenhouse-gasinduced global warming. The accurate prediction of sea-level rise could have significant economic and societal impacts.  MOPITT and TES will measure CO and CH4, and TES will measure H2O, O3, and N2O, all of which are needed to begin to separate human and natural greenhouse forcing.  MODIS measures of biomass burning will contribute to knowledge of trace-gas emissions.  ACRIM will measure total solar irradiance, a fundamental measure of solar variability, which is needed to separate human and natural greenhouse forcing. SOLSTICE will measure the total variation of UV and its contribution to the natural variability of ozone.  EOS measures of ozone depletion will define the abundances and trends of this radiatively-important gas.    EOS investigators will complete extensive model experimentation aimed at quantitative comparison of the different human-induced and natural forcing changes. These sensitivity experiments will be completed at both regional and global scales.  2) What has been and will be the response of the climate system to human forcing?  The response of the climate system will be defined by modeling efforts of EOS investigators based on a quantitative understanding of the natural and anthropogenic forcing from aerosols (MISR, SAGE III, EOSP, MODIS, HIRDLS), solar irradiance variations (ACRIM TSI), land-surface changes (MISR, MODIS, ASTER), and radiatively-important gases measured by EOS (H2O, CH4, O3, CH4, N2O, F11, F12), and from other sources (CO2). EOS provides an unprecedented opportunity to assess the response of the climate system based on the full spectrum of forcing factors. The characterization of clouds (CERES, MODIS, ASTER, MISR, AIRS), the radiation balance (CERES), temperature and humidity (MODIS, AIRS/ AMSU/HSB), winds (SeaWinds, Jason-1), and ice and snow cover (AMSR-E, MISR, MODIS) provide a unique capability to validate model predictions. EOS will provide significant opportunities to document surface fluxes of energy and moisture over the land surface and the oceans, to document regional and global radiation budgets required to understand cloudclimate feedbacks, and to determine ocean heat transport. EOS will provide the first satellite-based opportunity to examine ice-sheet mass balance. These elements encompass major limitations in current climate models, and thus EOS will contribute substantially to the improved prediction of regional and global climate change in the next generation of climate models. EOS investigators will utilize improved measurements of surface fluxes and clouds and radiation to develop high-resolution model predictions suitable for regional prediction of climate change.        3) How do human-induced changes compare to variations and changes in the natural system? Can these changes be detected and modeled?  Natural variability of the climate system will be better defined through EOS observations of the temporal   32  EOS SCIENCE PLA  N  - CHAPTER 1  and spatial variability of aerosols, vegetation, sea ice, snow cover, temperature, water vapor, ozone, and clouds. EOS will assess variability due to cloud interactions, vegetation and other surface changes, carbon/ trace-gas perturbations, and the major climate forcing factors. MISR bi-directional reflectance measurements will distinguish between natural or human-induced land-surface cover and surface albedo variations, related to desertification, irrigation, deforestation, and urbanization. Characterization of aerosol characteristics (abundance, particle sizes, albedo, optical thickness) with MISR, MODIS, and EOSP, in conjunction with cloud measures, can be used to determine the indirect effect of aerosols as cloud-condensation nuclei to define the climate impact of aerosols, including their interactions. Measures of CO and CH4 assist in the direct measurement of potential global warming.  EOS 4-D assimilation models will provide a physically-consistent global measure of climate change.  EOS investigators will apply these satellite observations to assess the role of aerosol loading of the atmosphere in possible mitigation of global warming due to increased greenhouse-gas concentrations. The monitoring of aerosols, cloud properties, ozone, and water vapor will provide a basis for improved estimates of the relative global-warming potential of various gases and aerosols, including interactions and indirect effects.  The determination of the carbon balance of terrestrial ecosystems from satellites for different regions and resolutions will yield scenarios for fluxes under different climate conditions or land-management conditions. Terrestrial vegetation characteristics and ocean productivity measures will aid in the determination of regional sources and sinks for atmospheric CO2, N2O, and CH4.  Multi-decadal regional historical studies will provide an important perspective on the impact of human-induced-versus-natural variations.  Improvements to climate models based on EOS observations and study will contribute to the development of more-realistic simulations of future climate. These model predictions can be verified by long-term observations or can provide estimates of the statistical likelihood of change.   Measurement of the major climate forcing factors by EOS is a prerequisite for detection of human-induced global change beyond reasonable doubt.  The long-term measurements of water vapor, atmospheric temperature, cloud properties, and SST (AIRS/ AMSU/HSB, MODIS, CERES) are essential to detection of global change.  HIRDLS will measure stratospheric cooling, a major expected signal of greenhouse warming. 4) What are the uncertainties and what is the potential for surprises, including sudden changes in the frequency and intensity of extreme events?  Uncertainties in cloud-climate feedbacks are regarded as one of the most important limitations of current models. The unparalleled measurements of clouds, cloud radiation, and water vapor will allow EOS investigators to incorporate much-improved parameterizations in climate models.  EOS observations of surface temperatures, atmospheric temperatures and moisture, surface characteristics, and winds will provide major opportunities to address the uncertainties associated with the fluxes of moisture and energy at the land-atmosphere and ocean-atmosphere interfaces and their parameterization in climate models.  Synergistic measurements of temperature and humidity with ocean altimetry and scatterometry will provide a unique opportunity to improve estimates of ocean heat transport, a major uncertainty in our knowledge of the climate system.  Current observations are inadequate to determine if the major ice sheets are growing or shrinking. The GLAS instrument will provide the first satellite-based opportunity to address this major uncertainty.  EOS monitoring of key climate quantities (e.g., SSTs, atmospheric temperature and moisture, clouds, radiation, and sea level) will be utilized to improve climate models and examine climate trends.  EOS plans to monitor the major climatic forcing factors (aerosols, radiatively active gases, solar irradiance, land cover change), which are critical to limiting the uncertainties in climate predictions.   O  VERVIEW  33   The location, duration, and type of activity associated with large volcanic eruptions, a major source of uncertainty, will be monitored by EOS.  Models developed by EOS investigators provide one of the few opportunities to address the potential of changes in the frequency and magnitude of extreme events, and will also contribute to understanding of the frequency and intensity of other phenomena such as El Nio.  Historical and pre-historical examinations of specific regions by EOS investigators will provide information on the frequency of extreme events and potential thresholds for their occurrence. 1.4.4 Ecosystem change and biodiversity  will provide a foundation for ecosystem response models based on habitat scale and patchiness. EOS investigators will help produce better climate-change predictions which can be utilized to investigate ecosystem response in both terrestrial and oceanic realms. EOS models of carbon and nitrogen balance will aid in the assessment of the impact of land use and global-change-induced habitat changes. EOS instruments will provide the basis for detecting trends in ecosystems as a function of changes in atmospheric chemistry. EOS will also monitor volcanic eruptions as a natural disruptive force for ecosystems. 1) What have been and will be the impacts of global change on terrestrial systems and their wildlife, including forests, grasslands, arid lands, the tropics, and high latitudes?  MODIS, ASTER, MISR and Landsat will map changes in land-cover patterns, including expansion and contraction of farmland, urban growth, deforestation, and forest regrowth. These changes in pattern can be related to land use or environmental change. EOS will provide essential databases on grasslands, tundra, forests, and tropical deforestation which will be a basis for ecosystem response studies. MODIS and MISR will produce measures of leaf area index (LAI) and the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically-active radiation, which can provide estimates of changes in net primary productivity. EOS instruments and models will be able to examine changes in carbon, NPP, and nitrogen balances and will be able to assess the impact of ecosystem disturbances on the carbon pool. EOS models will examine the potential of increased sequestration of CO2 through forest management and practices. EOS will provide the basis to detect trends related to increased carbon dioxide and ozone depletion. EOS will produce climate predictions at global and regional scales in response to the full spectrum of climatic forcing factors (including land use) and will work to substantially improve climate models by addressing their major limitations with EOS observations. These predictions will be the basis to assess climate impacts on ecosystems, including potential biome shifts in response to global climate change.  1.4.4.1 The national interest The prevention of dramatic human-induced loss of species is a major responsibility, both from the view of species as natural resources and from our obligations for global stewardship. The loss of biodiversity will influence ecosystem function, including predation and dominance. Land use introduces patchiness or large-scale changes in habitats, modifying ecosystem function, including extinction, migration pathways, and survival. Land-use management may also be guided by the potential impact of utilization on carbon and nitrogen budgets. The record from Earth history indicates dramatic expansion and contraction of habitats in response to past global climate changes. Today, human activities play a considerable role in aiding or hindering habitat response to global change. Climate change will influence both the distribution of habitats and the patterns of land use. Changes in atmospheric chemistry will also influence ecosystem response. Ozone depletion and increased UV-B introduce the potential for ecosystem damage as well as human health issues. Sealevel increases in response to global warming will introduce considerable dislocations of estuaries, marshes, and near-shore ecosystems. 1.4.4.2 National policy requirements The detection of significant changes in ecosystems and biodiversity, and determination of the response of ecosystems and biodiversity to the changes in atmospheric composition, UV-B, land use, climate, and sea level. 1.4.4.3 EOS Policy-Relevant Contributions The EOS will specifically map changes in land-use patterns, vegetation type, and photosynthetic activity, which           34  EOS SCIENCE PLA  N  - CHAPTER 1   EOS investigators will use regional studies to examine past interdecadal variations in climate and biome distribution to analyze ecosystem response to climate change.  MODIS, ASTER, MISR, and Landsat will monitor the role of volcanism in ecosystem impact.  MODIS observation of fires adds an important capability to assess biomass burning, an agent of ecosystem change. 2) What have been and will be the impacts of global change on coastal and marine ecosystems?  EOS investigators will develop biophysical models of the ocean circulation and productivity that can be utilized to examine the response to forcing factors such as changing wind stress, air/sea fluxes, and incident solar energy.   EOS will provide extensive climate-model-sensitivity experiments for the full host of climate forcing factors at global-to-regional scales. These climate predictions are a prerequisite for assessing uncertainties and potential for surprises associated with ecosystem response to climate change. 1.4.5 Human dimensions and economics 1.4.5.1 The national interest The potential magnitude of global change introduces the need to define strategies for mitigation or adaptation. The strategies for mitigation and adaptation may have widely different economic and societal impact involving health, standard of living, and quality of life. Knowledge of the rate and magnitude of global change and its impact at global and regional scales is essential to assess social and economic impact. Even moderate climate change may result in significant changes in the distribution and availability of critical resources such as water. We must be able to understand the nature of the human forcing of global change, particularly land and energy use. Human behavior, including valuation of the environment, issues of intergenerational equity, global-change decision making and the role of institutions become essential elements of assessing the human dimension of global change. Without these foundations, the strategies for mitigation or adaptation may be misguided, resulting in either inadequate or unnecessary policies. 1.4.5.2 National policy requirements Definition of the interactions of global change with the major areas of societal activity and development of rational adaptation and mitigation strategies. 1.4.5.3 EOS policy-relevant contributions EOS addresses natural hazards such as volcanism, but most importantly provides a realistic basis for understanding the potential rate and magnitude of global change. EOS studies will define the vulnerabilities of water resources, agriculture, and ecosystems to climate change. EOS will provide fundamental data sets on land-cover change, clearly addressing the need to understand one of the most significant human forcing factors of global change. EOS will also provide fundamental measures of sea-level change, a major factor in coastal regions. 1) What are the interactions with agriculture?   MODIS will examine coastal and marine ocean color, providing data on the impact of global change on ecosystems, and providing fundamental information on natural variability.  GLAS and Jason-1 will assess the mass balance of the ice sheets and mean sea-level change, providing key observations for potential impacts in coastal regions.  EOS observations in conjunction with models of the ocean circulation will examine the impact of wind forcing on coastal circulation, including the impact on fisheries. 3) What have been and will be the impacts of global change on biodiversity?  Through maps of vegetation-cover change and habitat type and extent, EOS observations can be utilized to assess potential changes in biodiversity through the use of ecosystem models. 4) What are the uncertainties and the potential for surpr ises and une xpected c hang es in the global ecosystem?  Through data-constrained simulation models of the carbon and nitrogen balance, EOS investigators will be able to examine the sensitivity of ecosystems to global change.   MISR, ASTER, and MODIS will assess changes in land cover, surface albedo, biomass burning, and pro-   O  VERVIEW  35  ductivity as a basis to assess human activity and to define the interactions between climate and agriculture.  EOS temperature and humidity observations (AIRS/ AMSU/HSB) and regional and global climate change predictions from EOS investigators will be the basis for determining potential changes in agricultural yields, agricultural management practices, and implications for land use.  The EOS focus on radiatively-important gases from agriculture may influence management practice.  A determination of the potential for volcanic eruptions may lead to agricultural risk evaluation. 2) What are the interactions with freshwater resources?    MLS, HIRDLS, and SAGE III will provide diagnostic information on ozone depletion by monitoring enhancements in precursor chemical radicals. This gives the capability for providing early warning potentials for increased UV-B. TES and MOPITT will provide a large number of measurements (O3, CO, CH4, NO, NO2, and HNO3) which will greatly aid our understanding of the chemistry of the troposphere.    5) What are the interactions with land use, including soils and erosion?  EOS instruments will provide unprecedented measurements of the scale and magnitude of changes in land cover associated with land-use change.  6) What are the interactions with business and commerce?  EOS monitoring of snow cover and glaciers at a regional and hemispheric level (MODIS, AMSR-E) provides a basis for short-term assessment of a significant water-resource component. GLAS will measure global ice-sheet mass balance.  EOS climate predictions at global and regional scales will emphasize the water balance and its sensitivity to global change, meeting a major requirement to assess water-resource vulnerability to global change. 3) What are the interactions in the coastal zone and marginal sea-ice zone, including fisheries?  High-resolution coastal-circulation studies, including biology, will provide important data on primary productivity, a key element in fisheries. 4) What are the interactions with human health, including disease vectors, air quality, and UV-B radiation?  TES, MISR, ASTER, and MODIS will monitor volcanic gas hazards in association with major eruptions, which have the potential of human impact.  MODIS, ASTER, MISR, and Landsat will assess volcanic hazards, both on the ground and in the air, with implications for the destruction of regional commerce and disruption of aircraft flight patterns. EOS predictions of climate change at global-to-regional scales will have substantial impacts on business and commerce through implications of climate change for agriculture and water-resource availability.    7) What are the uncertainties and what is the potential for surprises?  Without a full examination of the potential impact of climate change and human-induced modifications to land cover, we will be unable to determine important potential societal impacts of global change.   36  EOS SCIENCE PLA  N  - CHAPTER 1  1.5 Summary NASA's EOS was designed to initiate a new era of integrated global observations intended to advance our understanding of the entire Earth System on a global scale through developing a deeper understanding of the components of that system, their interactions, and how the Earth is changing. The global homogeneous long-term measurements of the Earth system to be provided by EOS will result in enhanced assessment of global change and ultimately result in improved ability to predict seasonal and interannual climate variability. Through EOS we can expect significant enhancements in our ability to understand and predict global changes and their effects on human activities. EOS will provide an unparalleled opportunity for long-term observation and monitoring of key variables such as total solar irradiance, radiative energy fluxes, cloud properties, aerosols, atmospheric chemistry, ice-sheet mass balance, land-surface characteristics, and precipitation. It will also provide improved understanding of the processes that relate different components of the Earth system. For example, EOS will address key priorities of the USGCRP, such as the relationship between clouds and water vapor to global climate and their effects on climate sensitivity, while also providing a more-accurate treatment of clouds and water vapor and their radiative effects in global climate models. There will be better measurements of surface characteristics, energy fluxes, and precipitation, and consequent improved understanding of the processes that connect atmospheric and surface processes and hence more-accurate parameterizations in global-climate models. Improvements in observational knowledge and understanding of the processes that couple the atmosphere-land-vegetation systems and the atmosphere-ocean system will result in substantial improvements in our understanding and simulation of land surface and oceanic processes, and in the development of global climate models. In this manner, EOS plays a critical role in addressing the key challenge--to develop the capability to predict the changes that will occur in the next decade to century, both naturally and in response to human activity.   O  VERVIEW  37  Chapter 1 Index 24 key variables 10 ACRIM 8, 11, 22 ACSYS 20 ADEOS 14, 24-27 aerosols 19, 27, 29, 31 agriculture 26, 30, 34-35 aircraft exhaust 26 AIRS/AMSU/HSB 12-13, 21, 26-29, 31-32, 35 AMSR-E 14-15, 18, 28-29, 35 ARM 20 ASTER 10, 17-19, 22, 29-31 atmospheric chemistry 15-16 atmospheric circulation 14 atmospheric temperature 21 AVHRR 28 biomass burning 11, 15-16, 19, 29, 31, 34 BOREAS 20 bromine 9 BSRN 20 calibration 7-8, 21-25 carbon cycle 16 carbon dioxide (CO2) 7, 9, 11, 14-16, 18, 20, 23, 25, 28, 30-33 carbon monoxide (CO) 14-16, 22, 26, 31-35 CERES 11, 13, 19, 21, 25, 28-29, 3132 CHEM-1 16 chemistry, stratospheric (see CHEM-1) chemistry, tropospheric 22 chlorine 9, 18, 25-27 climate change 30-33 CLIVAR 20 clouds 12, 21, 25 coastal zone 35 continuity 23-25 convection 12-13 cryosphere 17-18 DAO 19 DAS 79 DEC-CEN 20 diurnal sampling 21, 23 DMSP 25 DoE 20 ECLIPS 20 ecosystem 20, 26, 30, 33-34 El Nio 15, 23-24, 28, 33 ENSO 15 EOS AM 12, 22, 25 EOS PM 14 EOSP 11, 13, 19, 29, 31-32 ERB 8 ERBE 11-12, 21 ERS 27-28, 30 ESA 23, 27 ESSC 7 ETM+ 17-19, 22 field campaigns 20 FIRE 20 fires 22 freshwater resources 35 GCIP 20 GEWEX 11, 20 GLAS 12-13, 18-20, 24-25, 32-35 GLOBEC 20 GOALS 20 greenhouse gases 15-16 HIRDLS 13, 18-19, 26-27, 29, 31-32, 35 HSB 12-14, 21, 31-32, 35 human dimensions 7, 8, 26, 34-35 human health 33, 35 humidity 8, 12, 21 hydrology 16-17 ice sheets 15, 17-18, 32, 34 IDS 15 IGBP 7, 20 infiltration and deep percolation 16 interannual variability 11, 15-18, 20, 28-29 Jason-1 15, 22, 24, 31, 34 JGOFS 20 LAI 16-17, 33 lake ice 17 land ecosystems 16-17, 30, 33-34 land hydrology 16 Landsat-7 23 lightning 12, 23 LIS 12 measurement strategy 21-25 methane (CH4) 18, 22, 26-27, 29, 3132, 35 METEOR-3 26-27 MHS 21 MISR 11-13, 17-19, 26-35 MLS 13, 18-19, 25-27, 29, 31, 35 MMS 12 modeling 12, 20, 24, 31 MODIS 12, 15-19, 21-23, 25, 28-31 MOPITT 16, 22, 26, 31, 35 NASA 7, 15, 19 NASDA 23 natural variability 28-31 nitric oxide (NO) 16 nitrous oxide (N2O) 9, 15-16, 29 NOAA 21, 23, 26-27 NPP 16-17, 33 NRC 7 NSCAT 28 ocean circulation 14-15, 24 ocean color 15, 23, 28, 34 OMI 19, 25 overlap strategy 21-22 ozone 18-19, 25-28 policy-relevant questions 9 PR 14, 86, 207, 212, 18, 21 precipitation 13-14 QuikSCAT 14, 24 radiation fluxes 11-12 SAGE III 19, 26-27, 31 sea ice 25 sea level 24, 31 SeaWiFs 15, 28 SeaWinds 14-15, 24, 28, 31 SHEBA 20 SMM 23 snow cover 17-18, 25-35 SOLSTICE 22, 31 SRB 11-12 SSM/I 25 SST 15, 23-25, 28, 32 sulfate 11, 19, 26, 29, 31   38  EOS SCIENCE PLA  N  - CHAPTER 1  sulfur 19, 26 sulfur dioxide (SO2) 19, 26-29 TMI 14 TOA 11-12, 21, 25 TOMS 19, 25-27 TOPEX/Poseidon 22-23, 28 topography 22 TOVS 21 trace gases 11, 20, 27, 31 TRMM 12, 14, 23 TSI 8, 11, 22, 29, 31 USGCRP 7-9, 20, 26, 26 validation 12-13, 18, 24, 29 validation strategy 24 VCL 19-20 vegetation indices 16-17 VIS 14 volcanoes 18-20, 22, 26, 29, 31 water vapor 8, 11-16, 19-22, 25, 29, 32, 36 WCRP 20 wind 13-15, 19-24, 29, 34 WOCE 30"

We have made                 significant progress in our proposed activity, including the implementation                 of CLM into the NCAR CCSM2; the development of various land surface                 datasets; the development of various packages for model output analysis;                 and the development of softwares for data mapping.                Our excellent progress can be demonstrated by 12 peer-reviewed                 papers at various stages of publication:                 3 papers (published)                 5 papers (in press)                 1 paper (conditionally accepted)                 3 papers (submitted)                (a) Global Vegetation Root Distribution (Zeng 2001)                Using a comprehensive global field survey dataset, vegetation root                 distribution (including rooting depth) has been developed here for                 three of the most widely used land cover classifications [i.e.,                 BATS, IGBP, and SiB2] for direct use by any land model with any                 number of soil layers.                So far, the vegetation root distribution data have been implemented                 into the ECMWF operational model. It has also been implemented into                 the NCAR Community Climate System Model (CCSM2).                This dataset has also been provided to NCEP (Ken Mitchell) for                 their possible use.                (b) Coupling of the Common Land Model to the NCAR CCM3 (Zeng et                 al. 2002a; Bonan et al. 2002; Dai et al. 2002)                The Common Land Model (CLM) has been coupled with the NCAR CCM3.                 Two 15-year simulations of CCM3 coupled with CLM and the NCAR Land                 Surface Model (LSM) respectively are used to document the relative                 impact of CLM versus LSM on land surface climate.                It is found that CLM significantly reduces the summer cold bias                 of surface air temperature in LSM, which is associated with higher                 sensible heat fluxes and lower latent heat fluxes in CLM, and the                 winter warm bias over seasonally snow-covered regions, especially                 in Eurasia. CLM also significantly improves the simulation of the                 annual cycle of runoff in LSM. In addition, CLM simulates the snow                 mass better than LSM during the snow accumulation stage.                CLM has been implemented as the land surface biophysical component                 of the next version of the NCAR CCSM2                (c) Interannual variability of global vegetation data [fractional                 vegetation cover (FVC) and leaf-area index (LAI)] (Zeng et al. 2002b;                 Buermann et al. 2002)                Fractional vegetation cover (FVC) and leaf-area index (LAI) are                 both needed to characterize vegetation for land modeling and land                 cover/ land use change study. They have been derived using the NOAA/NASA                 land pathfinder normalized difference vegetation index data. The                 confidence in the datasets is provided through their evaluation                 using a variety of in-situ data and high-resolution aircraft and                 satellite data.                Significant interannual variability of FVC and LAI is found over                 various parts of the world.                These data will be used to study the impact of observed interannual                 variability of vegetation on climate modeling in year 3.                (d) Globally unified monsoon onset and retreat indexes (Zeng and                 Lu 2002)                Different criteria have been used to define the monsoon onset and                 retreat over different monsoon regions and even over different parts                 of the same monsoon region, which make it very difficult to intercompare                 and understand the short-term and intraseasonal variability of the                 global monsoon system.                Here we propose an objective criterion to define, for the first                 time, globally unified summer monsoon onset (or retreat) dates using                 the global daily 1 deg by 1 deg precipitable water data with the                 threshold value being the Golden Ratio (0.618). Over different monsoon                 regions, our onset and retreat dates are consistent with those determined                 using local criteria.                The use of a single criterion globally also enables us to suggest                 the existence of two branches of the North American monsoon system,                 just like its counterpart in Asia. Our monsoon onset and retreat                 (and hence monsoon duration) dates also help quantify the geographical                 extent of global monsoon systems.                (e) Other progresses                The albedo of snow and desert is evaluated using the new MODIS                 data in Jin et al. (2002) and Tsvetsinskaya et al. (2002), while                 the satellite albedo data are used to evaluate those from climate                 models in Xue et al. (2001).                Based on these data analysis, the PI (X. Zeng) has revised the                 soil and vegetation albedo data in CLM, as implemented in the NCAR                 CCSM2.                The impact of satellite LAI data on climate modeling is evaluated                 in Buermann et al. (2001), while a new approach is proposed to treat                 subgrid land surface heterogeneity and the computation of surface                 air temperature in climate models in Dickinson et al. (2002).                (f) Peer-reviewed publications                 (Published or in press)                (1) Zeng, X., 2001: Global vegetation root distribution for land                 modeling.

For centuries, t he only infor mation on ocean sur face currents came from mariners. W it h the introduction of satellites, a view of ocean currents can be seen on a daily basis.   Mariners Weather Log  Mariners Weather Log  From the Editorial Super visor As the 20th century ends and we enter the new millennium, now, as never before, the topics of weather and climate are at the forefront of speculation and study. In the past, predictions about humanity's future did not take account of changing climate, disappearing forests, spreading deserts, rising sea levels, and the like. Now, as we are all aware, changes like these are likely to affect our future profoundly. In light of this, the cover of this issue was chosen to recognize the impact that ocean currents such as the Gulf Stream have on weather and climate. The Gulf Stream impacts weather both in the United States and Europe. Along the United States east coast, a class of storms, referred to as ""Nor 'Easters"" can form in winter near or over the Gulf Stream as cold air from the North American continent meets the Gulf Stream warm air. Development of these storms can sometimes be explosive, with central pressures dropping 18 mb (0.5 inches) or more in less than 24 hours (called ""bombs"" in our North Atlantic Marine Weather Reviews). Further east, the Gulf Stream has a major moderating impact on the weather of Iceland, Western Europe, the Azores, and the Canary Islands. It is widely believed that ocean currents, along with phenomena such as El Nio and La Nia are key to understanding and predicting weather and climate change. They will be at the forefront of climate research throughout the 21st century. We will continue to run articles on these subjects as they become available.h  U.S. Department of Commerce William M.

A fully developed category 5 hurricane (on the SaffirSimpson Hurricane Scale), the highest classification a hurricane can attain, will have winds in excess of 135 knots and will control over one million cubic miles of atmosphere. Hurricanes can also create waves over 50 feet high in the open ocean. Further, the low pressure at  I  the center of one of these hurricanes can cause the ocean's surface to rise and produce a coastal surge that can be 20 feet or more above the normal high water mark. While it is hard to grasp the power of a typical hurricane, if the energy from one were converted to electricity, it could supply the United States power demand for six months. Although the subject of how hurricanes form is complex there are some general constants. All hurricanes originate near the equator and sustain themselves by capturing and condensing the warm moist air that is present at these latitudes. A hurricane begins to form when there is a buildup of equatorial heat and this heat is unable to move away to the earth's polar regions quickly enough to  keep the earth's atmosphere in balance. Because a hurricane expedites removal of heat from equatorial regions to cooler polar areas it is similar to a circuit breaker in an electrical system or a relief valve on a radiator. It quickly transfers heat from hot equatorial regions to cool polar areas. Hurricanes are so good at removing heat that water temperatures behind a hurricane are often reduced several degrees. Avoidance is an essential ship routing tactic in dealing with hurricanes and, though recognized limits do exist in both hurricane track and intensity forecasting, there are two reliable rules that should be used by mariners. These are the ""34-knot wind radius"" and the ""1-2-3"" rules. Continued on Page 5  4 Mariners Weather Log   Hurricane Avoidance Hurricane Avoidance Continued from Page 4 Using this information, a chart can be constructed showing the area to be avoided, and this area should be compared with National Weather Service, Marine prediction Center sea-state and windwave analysis and forecasts. Subsequent forecasts should be used to validate and update conditions, which are then used to update a ship's route.  Thirty-Four-Knot Wind Radius Rule The 34-knot wind radius rule states that ships should stay outside the area of a hurricane where winds of 34 knots or greater are analyzed or predicted. Often this area is not symmetrical around a hurricane, varying within semi-circles or quadrants. Thirty-four knots is chosen as the critical wind speed because as wind speed doubles its generated force increases by a factor of four (see side bar on wind force), and when 34 knots is reached, sea state development significantly limits ship maneuverability. When ship maneuverability is limited, then course options are also significantly reduced. Hurricane advisory messages produced by the National Weather Service, National Hurricane Center provide 34-knot wind radius analysis and forecast. For example; advisory #30 for Hurricane Bonnie, produced on August 26, 1998, provided the following information on location of 34-knot winds: 0900Z Wed 26 Aug 1999: 34 knot winds..........200NE 150SE 125SW 150NW (Thirty-four knot winds found out to 200 miles from center in NE quadrant, 150 miles of center in SE quadrant, 125 miles of center in SW quadrant, and 150 miles of center in NW quadrant.) Forecast for 27 Aug 1999: 34 knot winds..........200NE 150SE 50SW 75NW  Averaging errors in track deviation from predicted path for the period 1988-1997 substantiates this rule of thumb: Forecast Interval (Hours) Avg. Error (nm) Avg. Error (nm) (left & right (left & right of track) of track) Atlantic Ocean Pacific Ocean  The 1-2-3 Rule: Constructing an Area to be Avoided Around a Tropical Cyclones Track The 1-2-3 rule states that track error forecasting for a hurricane is 100 miles either side of a predicted track for each 24-hour forecast period. Thus, for a 24hour period, an error of 100 miles (1 day x 100 miles) to the left or right of an official predicted track is applicable. For 48 hours the error is 200 miles (2 x 100), and for 72 hours the error is 300 miles (3 x 100).  24 48 72  88 166 248  71 137 195  Therefore, when a hurricane's track is plotted, a 100-mile error for each 24-hour period must be applied and a vessel within this adjusted area must take action as if a hurricane were bearing directly toward them, which may become the case. Combining both the ""34-knot wind radius"" and ""1-2-3"" rules allows calculation of the area to avoid when a hurricane- or a hurricane-force mid-latitude low Continued on Page 6  Wind Force Force per square foot experienced when wind is blowing perpendicular to a surface is calculated using this formula: F = 0.004V(squared) F = wind force measured in pounds per square inch V = wind velocity in knots Wind Speed 10 15 20 25 30 34 Force (lbs./square foot) 0.4 0.9 1.6 2.5 3.6 4.6  Source: U.S. Navy Sailors Handbook August 1999 5   Hurricane Avoidance Hurricane Avoidance Continued from Page 5 pressure system is detected.

Jodrey Skip Gillham Vineland, Ontario, Canada  t has been twenty-five years since the Roy A. Jodrey went to the bottom of the St. Lawrence River. The ship was lost off Wellesley Island on November 21, 1974. This was a modern member of the Algoma Central Marine fleet. It was barely nine years old, having been launched at Collingwood, Ontario, on September 9, l965. The ship sailed to load the first cargo, a shipment of limestone, on November 11, l965. The 640-foot, 6-inch long bulk carrier was constructed with onboard systems and a 250-foot selfunloading boom that allowed the discharge of a wide variety of cargoes without the need for shore-based personnel or equipment. Roy A. Jodrey operated throughout the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence Seaway and was carrying 20,450 tons of taconite ore pellets from Sept Iles, Quebec, to Detroit when it went down. The upbound vessel struck Pullman Shoal in the American Narrows section of the St. Lawrence east of the entrance to  I  Lake Ontario. There were three bumps and the ship sheered to port and took on a starboard list. The vessel was intentionally grounded adjacent to the Coast Guard station near Alexandria Bay, New York, some 1600 feet upstream from Pullman Shoal. The forward area was badly holed and a quick investigation revealed the seriousness of the damage. The crew abandoned ship via lifeboat and around midnight the Captain and Chief Engineer were removed.  Shortly afterwards the hull slipped off the precarious perch on the ledge, rolled on its side and sank. Due to the depth and location, salvage of the ship or cargo proved unfeasible. The Roy A. Jodrey remains on the bottom as proof that even the most modern ships are not exempt from disaster. Note: Skip Gillham is the author of 18 books, most related to Great Lakes ships and shipping.h  The Roy A. Jodrey above Lock 1 of the Welland Canal on February 25, 197l.

The ship's engine had been going at full pressure, moving her at 5 knots, when the speed suddenly dropped to1 knot, and stayed that way. The ship's progress was greatly slowed, and Dr. Fridtjof Nansen, the leader of the expedition, wrote in his journal, ""It was such slow work that I thought I would row ahead to shoot seal."" The Fram had encountered what Norwegian seaman called ""ddvand"" or ""dead water"". This strange phenomenon caused a ship to lose her speed and to refuse to answer her helm. The only clue to its cause was that dead water always occurred at locations where the sea was covered with fresh or brackish water. And this was indeed the case in the sound north of Taimur Island, where the ice cover had been melting rapidly. August 30th brought more  O  slow going. Nansen wrote: ""We could hardly get on at all for the dead water, and we swept the whole sea along with us."" ""We made loops in our course, turned sometimes right round, tried all sorts of antics to get clear of it, but to little purpose. The moment the engine stopped, it seemed as if the ship was sucked back."" The Fram encountered dead water on several other occasions during its voyage. In November 1898, two years after his expedition's end, Nansen sent a letter to Professor Vilhelm Bjerknes, an old classmate, asking for his opinion as to the cause of this phenomenon. Bjerknes hypothesized correctly that, when there is a layer of fresh water on top of saltwater, a moving ship will not only generate visible waves at the boundary between water and air, but will also generate invisible waves beneath the sea along the boundary between the freshwater layer and the saltwater layer below it. The energy that normally would have propelled the ship forward was instead going into generating these ""internal waves,"" with the  result that the ship hardly moved at all (see Figure 1). Bjerknes then turned the problem over to his student Vagn Walfrid Ekman, who proceeded to confirm Bjerknes' theory with mathematics and with experiments. In these experiments he used a glass tank containing a freshwater layer on top of a salt-water layer that had been dyed a dark color to make the interface clearer. Ekman pulled a model boat along the surface and was able to generate clearly observable internal waves propagating along the interface between the two water layers. This was the first demonstration and explanation of internal waves in the ocean. Internal waves, however, had been observed earlier in a totally different setting. Benjamin Franklin may have been the first to write about them, in a letter dated December 1, 1762, while he was in Madeira, Spain. He had made what he referred to as an Italian lamp, by filling the bottom third of a glass tumbler Continued on Page 12 August 1999 11   Physical Oceanog raphy  Figure 1. A model of the Nor wegian ship Fram generating an internal wave at the interface between an upper layer of freshwater and a lower layer of saltwater.  Waves Beneath the Sea Continued from Page 11 with water, and the next third with oil. He noticed times when the surface of the oil (with air above it) was motionless, but the surface of the water under the oil could be ""in great commotion, rising and falling in irregular waves"". He repeated this experiment many times when he returned to America. Today one often sees toys where a layer of blue-dyed water is covered with a layer of clear oil to make the waves along the interface look like waves at sea. These waves, however, look like they're moving in slow motion, and they become larger and break more easily than would water waves covered with a layer of air. (As we shall see, this is due the small difference in the densities of water and oil, which is much smaller than the difference in the densities of water and air). When one looks at the details of the wave motion along the inter12 Mariners Weather Log  face between two liquids (whether water and oil or saltwater and freshwater) there are many similarities with the wave motion along the surface of the ocean (described in our last Physical Oceanography column). When the two layers are motionless, with the lighter fluid resting on the heavier one, and the interface is a horizontal straight line, the entire system is in equilibrium. At every point the weight of the fluid is exactly balanced by the pressure exerted on it by neighboring fluid. If something disturbs the interface, for example by pushing the interface up at some point, heavier water from the lower layer will be moved higher up in the water column into a layer of lighter water. Gravity will then pull the heavier water back down. Without any appreciable friction to stop this downward movement the inertia of the heavier water will keep it moving downward, overshooting its original at-rest equilibrium position and moving deeper than it originally was. The  lighter water in the top layer follows after, flowing down into the depression. This lighter water moves downward in the water column into a layer of heavier water. The buoyancy of the lighter water (being surrounded now by heavier water) eventually starts it moving upward again. This oscillation of the interface between the two layers also moves horizontally, because the individual water particles do not just move up and down; they also move to the left and right. In fact, water particles in both layers trace out circular orbits (rotating in opposite directions on opposite sides of the interface). Energy is transferred horizontally to surrounding water particles, and so the wave (i.e., the shape of the distorted interface) propagates along the interface (see Figure 2). Due to the small density difference between the two water Continued on Page 13   Phy sical Oceanography Waves Beneath the Sea Continued from Page 12 layers, the gravitational restoring force is reduced, and is much smaller than the restoring force for waves on the ocean's surface. The heavier water particles raised up in the crest of an internal wave are not that much heavier than the surrounding water, so it takes longer for these water particles to slow up and start falling again. Likewise, lighter water particles lowered into the trough of an internal wave are not that much lighter than surrounding water. They are, therefore, only slightly buoyant and so they also take longer to slow up and then to starting moving upward. This makes for larger wave heights (they move farther up or down before slowing down) and for slower propagating wave forms (it takes longer for the restoring force to return water particles to their average position). Internal wave periods vary from 10 minutes to several hours, compared with several seconds to minutes for surface waves. Internal waves can reach heights of several hundred feet in the ocean, much larger than their surface wave counterparts. For a ship to be caught in dead water, first, its draft must be close to the thickness of the fresh water surface layer, so it can generate an internal wave, and second, it must be traveling at the same speed (or slower) than the speed of propagation of the internal wave created. The speed of the internal wave is determined by the density difference between the two layers, and by the thickness of the layers. The  drag on the ship reaches a maximum when the ship's speed is very close to the internal wave speed. If the ship has enough power to go faster than the speed of the internal wave (usually speeds greater than 5 knots will be enough), it can break away from the dead water. Dead water is thus less of a problem today with the power of modern ships. However, there have been cases where a ship has slowed down and then suddenly come to a dead stop (sometimes with extreme vibrations). In such cases, the initial reaction is usually that the ship has run aground. In some instances ships have even been dry-docked to assess the damage from the ""grounding,"" only to find that there was none. Back when ships had less power than today, incidents of dead water were reported at many locations  around the world where there was a fresh or brackish water layer on top of a saltwater layer. Dead water was especially common in the fjords of Scandinavia. A fjord is a hollowed-out glacial valley with a sill at the ocean end. Cold dense saltwater fills the bottom of the fjord to the depth of the sill. The surface water is lighter due to the freshwater from streams running into the fjord. The sill at the entrance tends to act like a filter, keeping a major portion of the energy in the ocean from getting into the fjord, so that there is little vertical mixing and the two layers are maintained. Thus, a fjord is an ideal location for the generation of internal waves. Dead water was less common in rivers because, even with strong runoff, the water column can be well mixed from top to bottom if the currents are strong enough (espeContinued on Page 14  Figure 2. An idealized internal wave propagating along the interface between an upper layer of freshwater and a lower layer of saltwater. The streamlines show the direction of flow for a particular moment in time. The particle orbits are the motion of specific water particles over one complete cycle of the internal wave as it propagates from left to right. August 1999 13   Physical Oceanog raphy Waves Beneath the Sea Continued from Page 13 cially if there are strong tidal currents). When dead water was reported in rivers (with slow currents), it occurred at different locations at different times of the year because of differing amounts of runoff, since the thickness of the upper layer had to be comparable to the ship draft. Dead water occurred upriver during dry seasons, and outside the river entrance in the sea during periods of heavy runoff. Dead water also tended to be more prevalent during sea breezes and flood tides (which helped maintain the thickness of the freshwater surface layer). Internal waves are not limited to rivers and fjords where fresh water flows out over saltwater. Most internal waves, in fact, occur offshore and in the open ocean, but there the density differences are primarily due to differences in water temperature. The upper layer is lighter because the water is warmer than in the lower layer. Heat from the sun warms the surface waters of the ocean, and that heat slowly propagates  downward into the ocean depths. The action of surface waves often mixes the water to a particular depth, so that the entire upper layer is the same warmer temperature. In this case there is a sudden change in temperature as one crosses the interface between this warm upper layer and the cooler layer below. This interface is called a thermocline (the interface between fresher water and saltier water is called a halocline). It is along the thermocline that internal waves in the ocean propagate. When water density increases with depth (due to decreasing temperature or to increasing salinity) the water is said to be ""stratified"". Wherever water is stratified, internal waves are possible. Because the density difference between an upper warm layer and a lower cool layer in the ocean is smaller than that between freshwater and saltwater layers, and because the thickness of these layers is larger, the amplitudes of the internal waves in the ocean can be much larger than those in fjords and rivers. Ocean internal waves are often 160 feet high, but have been measured at heights of 600 feet. These internal waves  also produce currents (see below) that can reach speeds of 6 knots. The largest internal waves tend to occur where the thermocline is deep and where the local generation mechanisms are energetic enough (places like the Strait of Gibralter, where current speeds are increased by the sudden narrow width of the strait). When two fluid layers are close in density it does not take much of a disturbance to move water vertically and to generate an internal wave. As we have seen, this disturbance can be a moving ship, but it can also be a change in wind stress or pressure at the ocean surface. When stratified water flows over a bump in the river bottom (or over an ocean ridge or shelf break, or over any irregular underwater topography) the fluid particles will be displaced vertically upward. Being heavier than their surroundings, those water particles are acted upon by gravity to move them downward again, thus starting the internal wave (see Figure 3). The internal waves that result can vary significantly, having periods from a few minutes Continued on Page 15  Figure 3. Internal wave generated by two-layered flow over a topographic feature on the bottom.  14 Mariners Weather Log   Phy sical Oceanography  year. During some months these packets arrive every 12 hours. These waves can be 165 feet high and accompanied by currents on the order of 3 knots or higher. Although internal waves beneath the surface of the water are not directly visible, they do have an effect on the water's surface that is clearly observable. Figure 4 illustrates the circulation pattern produced by propagating internal waves. Water in the upper layer moves down toward the trough of the internal wave as the interface moves deeper, and water in the upper layer over the crest is pushed aside as the crest of the internal wave moves upward. At the ocean's surface, therefore, the motion of the surface water is away from the crests and toward the troughs; the water tends to converge over the troughs and diverge over the crests. This causes any floating surface debris to collect over the troughs. This debris dampens the small surface ripples, making the surface smooth and glassy. The result is long parallel slicks of smooth water on the ocean surface, alternating with long rows of rougher water. Such surface patterns were observable by Nansen and many others who described the surface waters during incidents of dead water. Nansen's comment that ""we swept the whole sea along with us"" was a typical description of dead water and was a reference to the smooth slick area (over the unseen trough of the internal wave Continued on Page 16 August 1999 15  Figure 4. The circulation pattern produced by a propagating internal wave. At the water's surface, long slicks of smooth water alternate with bands of rougher water. Surface debris tends to collect in the convergence zones over the troughs of the internal wave, as does plankton.  Waves Beneath the Sea Continued from Page 14 to many days. Internal tidal waves, with the thermocline or halocline moving up and down at tidal frequencies, are probably the most common variety. An earthquake can produce internal tsunamis at the same time that it is producing the much faster and more destructive tsunami on the ocean's surface. Sudden disturbances can generate ""solitary"" internal waves. A solitary wave (also called a soliton) is a single peak or trough that moves along the thermocline. Such waves can maintain their shape as they travel for hundreds of miles. Disturbances at a shelf break or in a strait can produce packets of solitons, which always travel with the tallest soliton at the front of the packet. A typical situation is that strong tidal  currents oscillate stratified water over continental shelf topography or through a strait, which generates long internal tidal waves, which become unstable as they propagate onto the sloping shelf (much like a wave breaking on a beach). This breaking of the internal tidal wave generates packets of solitons with even larger heights and stronger currents. For example, packets of internal solitons have been observed in oil fields in the northern South China Sea that were generated 350 miles to the east, and two to four days earlier, by tidal forcing at the shallow sill in the Luzon Strait (halfway between Taiwan and the Philippines). These waves had traveled at speeds of 4 to 8 knots and had been refracted around an island creating a complex interference pattern of wave fronts. Packets of solitons are very common in this area, observable throughout the   Physical Oceanog raphy Waves Beneath the Sea Continued from Page 15 just behind and below the stern of the ship) that moved with the ship. His comment that ""The moment the engine stopped, it seemed as if the ship was sucked back,"" was a reaction to the slick area (and succeeding surface pattern) moving past the ship as the internal wave below propagated forward leaving the ship behind. For the larger internal waves offshore and in the open ocean, the parallel rows of smooth slicks and rougher water can each be 60 miles long. The difference in the surface roughness can be seen from satellites with Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) or with ordinary photography (if the sun is at the right angle). With packets of internal solitons, each soliton is preceded by a very long band of rough water (called ""rips"") and followed by an equally long band of calm water. Most of the interest in internal waves today is not because of dead water, but because of the damage that the large internal waves in the ocean can do, especially to oil drilling operations. Large amplitude internal waves (especially packets of internal solitons), with their associated strong currents, can create enormous bending moments in offshore structures, and have been reported to displace oil platforms hundreds of feet in the horizontal as well as tens of feet in the vertical direction. Drillships appear to be especially susceptible to the effect of internal waves. Self-propelled and designed to 16 Mariners Weather Log  drill for oil in water over 7000 feet deep, they use dynamic positioning and propulsion to maintain a constant position while drilling. Studies in the Andaman Sea (west of Burma) have shown increases in mooring line tensions that correlate directly with independently measured packets of 200foot high internal solitons propagating past the drillship. Internal waves are capable of causing large integrated forces on vertical elements such as risers and tethers. Because of the real possibility of riser failure or other problems, internal soliton prediction systems have been developed. Internal waves have also been cited as the possible cause for a few unexplained submarine losses. Perhaps the most famous was the loss of the USS Thresher on April 10, 1963, in the Gulf of Maine. The most probable cause of the tragedy was determined by the Navy to be a leak in an engine room seawater system which shorted electrical circuits causing a loss of propulsion power. At some point she sank below her crush depth and then plunged to the bottom. Two days before, however, a large storm crossed the Gulf of Maine creating a subsurface eddy and (it was speculated) possibly a 300-foot-high internal wave. A submarine traveling through an internal wave could very quickly cross from dense to less dense water and suddenly become heavier and start to sink. Without prompt pumping of ballast overboard and enough propulsion power to propel it toward the surface, the submarine could continue to head deeper.  Whether an internal wave played a role in the Thresher tragedy will never be known, but internal waves are certainly important in submarine operations. They can affect sound transmission and a submarine can trim its buoyancy so that it can ""rest"" on a density layer, move slowly, and remain undetected by surface craft. Internal waves observed with satellite Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) may also be used to locate moving ships, by analyzing patterns at the surface produced by the internal waves generated by the ship. Internal waves also have a variety of other as yet not fully appreciated effects. The slicks above the troughs have been shown to be associated with higher concentrations of plankton. This has been seen not just at the surface, but throughout the water column over the troughs. Porpoises have been observed feeding in these surface slicks. The porpoises also ride internal waves, much as a surfer rides a wave on the surface of the ocean. Porpoises learn to tilt themselves at a slope that matches the slope of the internal waves, so that in effect they're on a perpetual downhill ride. We have only talked about internal waves traveling horizontally along an interface between two layers of water, such as a thermocline. However, water temperature can become cooler with depth in a smooth and continuous manner, rather than in a sudden change Continued on Page 17   Phy sical Oceanography Waves Beneath the Sea Continued from Page 16 when crossing a thermocline. In such cases, internal waves are no longer restricted to traveling horizontally. Although the largest still travel horizontally, some also travel vertically. Thus, internal waves can travel to all depths of the ocean if the stratification is right. They are, therefore, an important mechanism for transporting energy from the ocean's surface to the ocean bottom. If vertical propagation is impeded by the bottom or by a sudden change in stratification at some depth, these internal waves can also be reflected. Internal waves also occur in the atmosphere, traveling on the interface between warm and cold air. They can produce patterns of clouds organized into bands, with the clouds over the crests of the internal wave. They are often found downwind of mountain ranges, the so-called lee waves in which sailplane pilots soar to great heights. In the report that Ekman wrote describing his experiments and his mathematical treatment of internal waves, he also provided a section of collected historical anecdotes about the occurrences of dead water recorded as far back as the Roman Empire. Since dead water would very suddenly hold back a ship, as if by a mysterious force, it was attributed to a whole host of causes. Seamen blamed it on the gods or other supernatural forces, on magnetic rocks, and on molluscs that suddenly grew on the  ship's hull. They also imagined very large remora fish (the normal size remora attach themselves to sharks and other fish) that could attach onto the hull of a ship and hold it in place even during a strong wind. The slick that follows a ship in dead water led some mariners to believe that something had made the water stick to the vessel and the ship had to drag it along it, thus greatly reducing its speed. Over the years mariners have tried a variety of ways to escape dead water, including shearing off course, running the whole crew forward and aft on the deck, scooping up quantities of water on deck, pouring oil on the water ahead of the ship, working the rudder rapidly, firing guns into the water, and hitting the water with oars. Tugboats with a vessel in tow were usually more successful in escaping. Typically the vessel they towed had a deeper draft and was the vessel actually caught in the dead water. When this happened one course of action was to shorten the rope between the tugboat and the towed vessel as much as possible. Unknowing to the tug captain, this allowed the tug's propeller to mix the water around the vessel being pulled, destroying the interface on which the internal wave traveled. Of all the stories collected by Ekman, to which he attributed a role to internal waves, the most famous was the Battle of Actium, the naval battle on September 2, 31 BC, where the fleets of Marc Antony and Cleopatra were  defeated by Octavian. Ekman cites an account by Pliny the Naturalist, who said that during that sea battle a remora fish grabbed onto Antony's ship and held it so fast that he was obliged to board another vessel. Although it will never be known for sure, Ekman's guess that an internal wave was involved may be correct. The Battle of Actium took place on the Adriatic Sea along the coast of Dalmatia (near where Croatia is today). The Adriatic Sea receives large amounts of freshwater river runoff. Antony's fleet was trapped close to shore by Octavian's fleet. Octavian had lighter shallowerdraft vessels, whereas Antony's vessels were heavy deeper-draft Roman warships equipped with stone throwing catapults. Historians have mentioned how the lighter ships of Octavian were more maneuverable. But if on that day there was a layer of brackish water on the surface, Antony's deeper draft vessels would have been more likely to be captured by dead water, and Pliny's description of Antony's vessel being held fast may have been accurate. The battle ultimately ended when Cleopatra decided to flee with her 60 ships and Antony abandoned his legions and chased after her. It was a sea battle that changed history, and it is possible that internal waves may have played a role in Octavian's victory, which led to his subsequent crowning as Rome's first emperor, Augustus.

At Mr. Kenney's invitation, Captain Shen Jugen, former Master of the AMVER rescue ship Gao He, and Mr. Lachun Liu, Chief of Ship Operations, from the offices of COSCO North America in Secaucus, New Jersey, were invited to participate as technical interpreters. 18 Mariner s Weather Log  A  The Chinese group was headed by Mr. Wang Zhi Yi, Director of the Shanghai Maritime Safety Agency (SMSA). It included Mr. Zhai Jiugang, Director of the Navigation Safety Division of the Maritime Safety Agency (MSA) of China; Mr. Chang Fu Zhi, Director of the Navigation Safety Division of SMSA; Mr. Chen Zhen Wei, Director of the Aids To Navigation District of SMSA; Mr. Gao Hui, an Engineer from the Ministry of Communication; and Mr. Hu Ming, an Investments Engineer from the Shipping Bureau of the Ministry of Communication. The group had previously visited the USCG's Pacific Area Headquarters in Alameda, California; Vessel Traffic Service facilities  San Francisco; and a USCG small boat Group and Air Station in Los Angeles. In a meeting with Vice Admiral Collins, the U.S. Coast Guard's Pacific Area Commander, discussions centered on developing a ""partnership"" between the MSA and USCG on such matters as search and rescue, port state control, and oil pollution response programs. The purpose of their New York visit was to brief AMVER officials on the establishment of a new China Ship Reporting System (CHISREP) for any vessels, foreign and domestic, that enter the Chinese sea area (9 degrees N northward, 130 degrees E, westward, excluding other countries' Continued on Page 19   AMVER Hands Ac ross the Water! Continued from page 18 territorial seas). Participation in CHISREP is mandatory for all Chinese-registered ships over 300 GT engaged in international routes, and 1600 GT engaged in domestic coastal routes. All ships not registered in China must report when they arrive or depart from Chinese harbors. The reporting scheme follows the IMO-prescribed format. The main functions of CHISREP are to provide assistance for search and rescue, marine safety and pollution prevention, utilizing information from the system. CHISREP is an active system, which means once a ship joins CHISREP and begins sending daily position reports, if a report is missed, the CHISREP Center will perform a pre-alarm and consult the ship's company, operator or related departments to ensure that the ship is in no distress. Reports fall into two categories: General Reports (Sail Plan, Position Report, Deviation Report, and Final Report), and Special Reports (Dangerous Goods, Harmful Substances, and Marine Pollutant Reports). Reports can be sent via NBDP, Morse, wireless phone, or Inmarsat. Coast Radio Stations in Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Dalian are prescribed report-receiving stations. The CHISREP computer center is located in the Shanghai Maritime Safety Administration. There was an exchange of information on the operation of both systems.

It is a ""passive"" system that does not initiate action unless a ship is unreported or overdue. The only reports required are the Sail Plan, Position Reports, Deviation Report, and Arrival Report. The Coast Guard representatives took advantage of the opportunity to promote increased AMVER participation by the COSCO fleet. Captain Shen was called upon to relate his experience in carrying out an AMVER rescue of a yachtsman in a remote area of the Pacific Ocean during a storm to illustrate the value of AMVER reporting.  Discussions also centered around other search and rescue issues of mutual interest, such as GMDSS implementation, and the planned COSPAS-SARSAT termination of 121.5 MHz beacon processing. A bilateral agreement between the two nations, signed in 1987, was seen as a good blueprint for future close cooperation in training, communications, and even joint search and rescue exercises. Both sides considered this dialogue valuable to understanding the role of both the AMVER and CHISREP systems, and the benefits of maximum participation by ships in both. It was agreed that discussions would continue on broader issues of search and rescue so that, by joint cooperation, the two nations could enhance safety of life at sea.h  August 1999 19   National Data Buoy Center  Some Freq uently Asked Ques tions About NDBC Buoys David B. Gilhousen National Data Buoy Center Bay St. Louis, Mississippi  Are weather buoy s relatively new? Actually, no. The U.S. Navy first developed experimental buoys to acquire weather data in the 1950s. Approximately 50 individual data buoy programs were conducted by many agencies and research laboratories in the 1960s. The National Data Buoy Center  (NDBC) was founded in 1970 as a joint National Weather Service (NWS)U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) project, and deployed its first experimental buoy southeast of Norfolk, Virginia, in 1972. By 1979, NDBC had moored 26 buoys in the Pacific, Atlantic, and Gulf of Mexico. There are presently 67 buoy stations supported by NWS and other agencies.  What is relatively new are the web sites that help to disseminate the observations. NDBC's web site, http://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/ receives approximately 2 million hits each month, and the NWS's Interactive Marine Observation page, http://www.nws.fsu.edu/ buoy/, which also contains Canadian and British buoys, Continued on Page 21  20 Mariners Weather Log   National Data Buoy Center Questions About NDBC Buoys Continued from Page 20 receives approximately 3.5 million hits each month.  the wave measurements would be severely affected at many of these sites by shallow water and would not be representative of nearby deeper water.  Why arent waves measured at more stations? Sea state is not an easy measurement to make. Between the two major types of NDBC stations (floating moored buoys and fixed platforms), it is more difficult to measure waves from a platform. If the station identifier is alphanumeric instead of numeric, the station is a fixed platform in the Coastal-Marine Automated Network (C-MAN). For example;  Who determines where buoy s and C-MAN stations are located? No one person or agency determines the locations. The number of buoy locations grew and evolved in response to the changing needs of the NWS, other government agencies, and nonfederal reimbursable customers. The first group of buoys was placed 200 to 300 miles offshore for NWS support in the 1970s. The NWS chose these locations because they wanted advance indication of storms and wave conditions before they affected the coastal areas. Then, after 1979, eight buoys were deployed in the Great Lakes in response to the sinking of the Edmund Fitzgerald. When the USCG announced plans to automate lighthouses, Congress funded the NWS for the C-MAN program in the 1980s. Although the C-MAN program did include several offshore platforms and (originally) a few coastal buoys, most coastal buoys were funded through reimbursable agreements with  government agencies other than NWS. Some of these agencies support data collection for experiments that could last from a few months to several years. Once the experiment is complete, the station is no longer continued unless Congress supplies funding. Several years ago, Congress supplied permanent funding for 36 buoy and C-MAN stations that had been funded originally by other government agencies.  Can cameras t hat relay live photos be added to NDBC buoys? Yes, but several significant problems would have to be solved. First, a method of keeping salt spray off the lenses would have to be developed. NDBC tries to operate stations one to two years without servicing them. Second, the communications capability of the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) system that NDBC uses is far too limited to relay photos. Other satellites could be used, but they would be very expensive to operate.

What is it? Marine debris comes from a myriad of sources, land-based activities and ship-based activities alike. Whatever the source, however, the effects of this disposal are the same. Trash in our oceans and coastal waters diminishes aesthetics, harms natural resources, and costs everyone in clean up expenses. It's often difficult to pinpoint the sources of most debris, as the nature of the oceans transport these materials sometimes thousands of miles from their origin, and trash usually doesn't come with an identification tag. Likewise the vast nature of the oceans makes it easy to forget or overlook the tonnage of debris that enters the waters. Once out to sea, our interaction or exposure to the problem is minimal to nonexistent. And what we don't see, we tend less to worry over. Through the ages, dumping of trash into the oceans seemed only natural, as the waters appeared able to accommodate our debris indefinitely. Once the trash disappeared from sight as it settled beneath the surface, problems  seemed nonexistent, effects appeared nil, and any concerns drifted away with the ocean currents. Only relatively recently did we begin to notice the results of the years of misuse. Animals entangled in nets, shipboard wastes spread across the shores, miscellaneous debris afloat in the waters we use more and more for recreation. With our growing dependence upon the coasts and coastal waters for sport as well as economic gain, our awareness of these impacts has heightened. We are finally understanding the effects of our early mistakes. It's now our job to take steps to stop ongoing impacts and clean up the effects from past wrongs. This article discusses the impacts, sources, and solutions to marine debris.  forage space to tragic deaths. Marine mammals, seabirds, and sea turtles all are at significant risk to entanglement. Studies estimate that at least 135 species of vertebrates and eight invertebrates have been reported through surveys as entangled in marine debris. These animals often seem to ""play"" with items they encounter, inadvertently exposing themselves to greater risk of becoming ensnared. The effects of entanglement can be quite severe. The most likely result is death due to drowning, often over an extended period, as animals respond to the stressor by twisting and worsening the clutch of the debris. Some impacts may extend even longer, such as lowgrade suffocation from plastic bands that restrict airways as the animals grow. The global biological effects of debris tend to vary with the health of a particular species' population. When entanglement occurs within strong populations such as sea lions, herring gulls, or northern elephant seals, losses may have limited effects on the population. Continued on Page 23  What are the impacts? Once debris enters the marine environment, its biological effects may be considered in three primary areas: entanglement, consumption, or habitat degradation. These produce immediate to residual impacts, from loss of  22 Mariners Weather Log   Marine Biology Marine Debris Continued from Page 22 While individual animals are lost, the populations are able to sustain themselves. For other populations that are no longer at sustainable levels, risk to entanglement may have a significant effect on the population's continued existence. Hawaiian monk seals, green sea turtles, and northern right whales are examples of such species. Losses of even limited numbers of these individuals may drastically reduce that group's ability to continue existence. How much of an effect this impact has on a population depends on the level of interaction between the stressor and the species. For example, birds tend to use plastics in nest building, picking up odds and ends throughout their daily excursions. Bits of net, bags, or line may stand out as a valuable commodity to an efficient builder. The dangers in collecting this debris include risk of entanglement as fishing nets are hauled on board or lines are shuttled off back decks. Birds may attempt to land on cast off net that is afloat on the surface, then become entangled, and eventually drown. Curiosity of young animals results in increased entanglements of juvenile seals and other mammals. Turtles and sea lions may swim through netting or ringed bands, resulting in the plastic encircling a neck or fin. Over time, this debris may constrict growth, ultimately strangle, promote infection in an open wound, or amputate a limb. Yet another risk comes from future entanglement, as a piece of rope or  filament may drag behind an ensnared animal, eventually snagging on rocks, kelps, or corals, or even tethering an animal from swimming free. These and many other methods are indicative of the devastating effects marine debris may have on many marine animals. In the marine environment, animals generally rely less on vision in determining food sources. Dark waters and continuous wave action tend to make man-made items indistinguishable from food. Plastic pellets often resemble prey items for seabirds seeking a young crab afloat in surface waters. The adverse effects of plastics ingestion may even be passed through a colony by simple rearing characteristics. For example, adult birds may pass plastic pellets to their young as they feed by regurgitation. Juvenile fledglings may accumulate sufficient materials that their food becomes toxic. Jellyfish are a favorite meal for many species, however its appearance underwater is quite similar to a discarded plastic bag. Ingested by a sea turtle, whale or other animal, the effects are devastating. Plastics may obstruct airways and digestive tracts. A pygmy whale made international news when bags upon bags were removed from her gut. The plastics, twisted with air pockets throughout, inhibited her ability to dive, keeping her buoyant above critical food sources. Starving and unable to navigate, she was near death when luck came her way and she was rescued. To her good fortune,  veterinarians were able to remove the debris and nurse her to health before returning her to her natural environment. These effects are examples with potentially lethal results. Sublethal effects have been found as well, including reduced growth and feeding desire. Impacts to the biological environment such as these touch our emotions. We hate to think of sad sea lions succumbing to a slow and tragic end. Other emotions are rallied at the thought of our beaches being littered with medical waste or toxic materials, our human environment likewise succumbing to tragic impacts. Our lives are affected, in terms of ability to enjoy recreation, fish for our livelihoods, or move freely across the marine environment. We expect our shorelines to be clear of trash, so that we can enjoy the outdoors with our families, without worry of exposure to empty bottles or used syringes. Increasingly, however, visits to the beaches bring us face to face with the problem. Plastics wash ashore from distant cargo vessels, medical and industrial wastes float from trash barges or sewer overflows, and the disinterested neighbors up the beach leave leftover picnic utensils for the next recreationer to pick that spot in the sun. By any path it takes, marine debris on the shoreline is an alarm to us. It's visually unappealing, as well as a potential health risk. And while the aesthetics may have a significant connection to our economy, the greater Continued on Page 24 August 1999 23   Marine Biology Marine Debris Continued from Page 23 disturbance is to the delicate balance that keeps the coastal environment running in check. When this balance slides one way or the other, tourism dollars may likewise wane from the coastal communities so closely tied to the environment. Without picturesque estuaries, healthy tidal pools and clean sandy shores, the draw to the beach is not as strong. Vacation dollars that previously supported coastal enterprises may be redirected to support a timberline lodge or non-coastal adventure. These impacts affect the shoreward side of the coastal environment, yet the problems with marine debris don't stop there. Out at sea, boaters and commercial fishers also feel the effects of trash in the waters. Fishermen may feel economic impacts as their target catches are caught by other means. For example, lost gear from one fishery may entrap species of another fishery. When a fishery is large, the effects may be minimal. Yet when a fishery consists of a handful of captains, any lost catch is a factor in the sustainability of the resource and the associated income. Economic impacts also come to those fishers that lose their gear. Nets, lines, and traps can cost tens of thousands of dollars to a fisherman each year. Gear lost at sea not only costs the fishery in terms of environmental costs, but in replacement costs as well. Yet another aspect involves the effects  of marine debris on the boats themselves. Propellors may become entangled in drifting net or lines, floating trash may damage props, and large scale objects may even impart damage to hulls. Typically these impacts are the result of another boat's carelessness with trash. The responsibility is on each vessel so that it's trash doesn't adversely affect the livelihood or recreational enjoyment of others.  Where does it come from? Marine debris can take several forms and evolve from many sources. The most common debris is plastics, in a myriad of forms. Other debris include contaminants such as oil spillage and toxic discharge, as well as point source pollution from sewage outfalls. Some debris is just plain random, such as tires, crates, or galley wastes, all of which affect the marine environment. The effects vary between degrading to debilitating, depending on where in the ocean environment the debris resides. For example, food wastes discharged from a ship may be consumed by marine species, yet the plastic bag in which it was contained may suffocate a sea turtle. Ice bags and bait boxes may entrap other organisms or suffocate important fauna once they settle on the sea floor. Vessel debris is a visible focus in the discussion of marine debris. Ships have sailed the seas for hundreds of years, and only recently (such as the 1970s) has  the practice of overboard disposal become a globally recognized concern. In beginning to remedy the problem, many of the solutions are wrapped with issues more difficult than simply ordering ships to return all wastes to port. The costs involved in retaining wastes can be significant, as can costs for dockside disposal. Determining who pays for disposal also is a factor. These are just some of the issues that limit developing countries from ratifying MARPOL Annex V*. A final source of debris comes from land-based sources. Urban areas inland of waterways are culprits in the degradation of our coastal zone as a result of sewer overflows or industrial wastes. Not only are these sources for threats to the coastal resources, but threats to human health as well. Visibility was high when surgical wastes began to appear on public beaches in the 1980s. In an instant, public concern was raised sufficient to noticeably reduce beach visitors for some time. When rains cause waste treatment plants to operate above capacity, human waste and other debris may be diverted directly to adjacent rivers or coastal waters. Storm water also washes debris from roadways into storm drains, which eventually reach the same waters. Flowing underground, these types of pollution travel out of the public's sight and often mind. Nevertheless, the impacts occur, thus education is necessary to reduce the impacts from their start. Continued on Page 25  24 Mariners Weather Log   Marine Biology Marine Debris Continued from Page 24  Whats the Answer? Studies show there is a significant value placed on clean beaches, even by the public that does not necessarily visit a beach. Just knowing that our coastal zone is clean is of value to many. Given this value, how do we reduce the debris and impacts on the resources? This requires actions at several stages, from product development to public education. A good example of improvement comes from our beverages. A sizable source of impact and risk to marine resources came from plastic six-pack rings. Thousands of animals become entangled when these rings find their way to oceans and beaches and thousands of rings are retrieved in annual beach clean ups. One manufacturer recognized the problems this product caused and sought a remedy. With the assistance of design teams, plastic rings were improved in production to increase degradation rates of the plastic in sunlight and to include pull tabs to break individual rings apart after use. The U.S. ratified Annex V more than ten years ago, yet implementation is still a challenge. By 1993, 69 nations had ratified Annex V. Difficulties include the magnitude of coverage (the world's oceans) and limited resources for surveillance, lack of prosecution for foreign fleets by flag states, and economic disincentives. Despite these hurdles, there have been remarkable gains made in some  areas. Annual numbers of vessels off-loading garbage has increased significantly and steadily, a reflection of increasing compliance. Beach clean ups of plastics, which may be an indicator for Annex V compliance, are reporting decreasing percentages of such wastes among the trash removed from the shoreline. Education is a strong step in influencing change, particularly among the public that uses its beaches, for fishing, diving, and general enjoyment of the coastal environment. Where do we go from here? A few strategies for improved implementation may include:  Work with recreational boaters to fully comply with zero-discharge of debris. Because this group generally remains close to shore and trips are short, storage of all trash for disposal portside should be a reasonable mandate. Reduction in disposable materials will reduce the amount of trash to be stored. Educating boaters will also assist in reaching full compliance. Commercial fishing vessels operating shorter trips should also reach full compliance. Initiatives to recycle fishing gear would reduce that left at sea and new technology may be available to reduce the amounts of gear lost. Annex V enforcement must also be increased, perhaps via labeling gear as well as reporting of lost gear for accountability.    Shipping vessels should implement improved onboard garbage handling methodologies and ports should provide adequate trash reception facilities.  A clean ocean is integral to healthy resources. The public desires a clean coastal environment and our marine resources depend on clean waters to exist. Given these fundamental requirements, it is clear that we all must work together to support the resources. By keeping our beaches clean, returning all trash from vessels to the dockside, and stopping discharge of pollutants and debris from stormwater flows, we will all contribute to a healthy marine environment.  Footnote * The 1973 International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships is known as MARPOL. It went into effect in 1983 with the intent to end the ""deliberate, negligent, or accidental release of harmful substances from ships"" and to work toward the elimination of international pollution of the marine environment. It focuses on the wastes generated during the normal operations of vessels. MARPOL falls under the umbrella of the International Maritime Organization. Within the United States, the Coast Guard has the implementing authority. MARPOL includes several annexes. Annex V addressed ship-generated garbage, including a prohibition on disposal of plastics in the ocean. Annex V took effect December 31, 1988.h August 1999 25     Marine Weather Review  Marine Weather Review North Atlantic Area December 1998 through March 1999 George P. Bancroft Meteorologist Marine Prediction Center  ecember began with a strong upper level ridge of high pressure over the eastern Atlantic which forced developing lows exiting the U.S. East Coast or the Canadian Maritimes northward toward Greenland and Iceland. Later in December the ridge broke down, leading to more unstable zonal (westerly) flow across the Atlantic steering the cyclones more east into the Great Britain area. This was the most active part of the winter in the North Atlantic, which lasted through January. The strong ridge re-appeared in the eastern Atlantic by February which led to a series of slow moving lows developing off the southeast U.S. coast, making late winter the most active period off the entire East Coast.  D  December 1998 began with Hurricane Nicole moving north along 35W in the high seas waters and becoming an extratropical storm by 00Z 02 December (Figure 1). The two 500 mb analysis charts in Figure 1 (corresponding to the first and third panels of the surface analysis) show a weak 500 mb low near 34N 40W associated with Nicole which re-intensified as an extratropical storm. Note the 60 kt ship report west of the center at 00Z 02 December. This system later merged with the storm center moving off the Labrador coast leading to a 964 mb storm over the Labrador Sea by 00Z 04 December (not shown).  Stor m of December 22-24, 1998 This system strengthened explosively while still over land, from 989 mb at 12Z 22 December to 949 mb at 12Z 23 December when the center was just off the Labra-  Hurricane Nicole The tropical cyclone season normally runs through November in the North Atlantic.

At 500 mb the development is supported by a strong short wave trough and jet of more than 100 kt (Figure 2). The storm, southeast of Cape Farewell at 12Z 24 December, reached maximum intensity by that time and was the second most intense North Atlantic storm of the winter, second only to the 926 mb storm described below. Surface data was sparse, but there was a ship report that reported 951.3 mb pressure, southwest wind of 35 kt, and 9 meter seas (30 ft), just southeast of the center shown in the second surface analysis of Figure 2. Gale to storm force winds occurred as far south as 45N south of the center. This system then drifted east and weakened.

It was picked up by a strong short wave trough and underwent explosive strengthening shown in Figure 3. Much of the intensification shown in Figure 3 occurred in the 6 hour period from 06Z to 12Z December 26 when the central pressure dropped 22 mb. The 500 mb analysis in Figure 3 is valid between the two surface analysis times and shows a short wave trough with negative tilt approaching Ireland (a trough which tilts to the left northward along its axis), supported by a very strong 120 kt jet. These conditions were favorable for rapid strengthening. The second surface panel of Figure 3 shows the storm at maximum intensity slamming into the British Isles. A wind of 50 kt was reported by a ship near the coast of Ireland. At 12Z 26 December, between the valid times of the two surface analyses in Figure 3, buoy 62081 just southwest of Ireland near 51N 13W reported 11 meter seas (36 ft). To the southwest of the buoy, ship PJRN (name not known) near 50N 15W reported a west wind of 55 kt. Seas were 6 meters (20 ft) or higher south of the storm center down to 40N and west to 30W at that time. Figure 4 is a METEOSAT7 infrared satellite image of the storm near maximum intensity. The center is clearly evident and  marked by a ""ring cloud"", a signature of a very intense cyclone.  December 27-28 Storm This system formed off the southeast U.S. coast like its predecessor, but moved east along 47-48N before turning more north upon approaching 20W. It was moving at more than 50 kt while passing east of Newfoundland and rapidly intensifying. Figure 5 shows this system absorbing an arctic front moving off the Canadian Maritimes. It would appear that the arctic air drawn into the circulation and the fast eastward motion could account for the reported winds. In Figure 5, ship the MSC Sicily (DDPH) reported a northwest wind of 90 kt at 18Z 28 December. Twelve hours prior to this, the Galveston Bay (WPKD) reported northwest winds 75 kt. These reports were the highest reported winds in either oceanic area during the four-month period. At 18Z 28 December the cluster of ships (on the analysis in Figure 5) southwest of the center, between 36N and 40N, reported northwest winds 50 to 55 kt and seas 8 to 13 meters (26 to 43 ft). The ships with south to southwest winds 45 to 55 kt southeast of the center at that time reported seas 9 to 10 meters (30 to 33 ft).  January (Figure 6). The central pressure dropped 50 mb in the 24hour period ending at 00Z 15 January and another 35 mb in the following 24 hours, leading to a large 926 mb storm just south of Iceland at 00Z 16 January. This was the most intense storm of the season in either ocean. Figure 7 is a METEOSAT7 infrared satellite image showing the storm near maximum intensity just southeast of Iceland. The appearance of a ring of cold-topped clouds around the center along with the dry slot wrapping around the center are characteristic of a very deep, intense low (see Figure 7). A study done for mid-latitude storms showed a relationship between cloud patterns, stages of storm development, and central pressures. Storms that undergo an intensification below 960 mb develop ""ring cloud"" features. (Reference: Frank J. Smigielski and H. Michael Mogil, Use of Satellite Information For Improved Oceanic Surface Analysis, First International Winter Storm Symposium American. Meteorological. Society, New Orleans, LA January 1991). At 21Z 15 January ship Dettifos (P3BK4) reported a south wind of 60 kt and a 928 mb pressure. The highest reported wind was from the ship V2XO (name not available) which reported from 60N 10W at 21Z 15 January with a southwest wind of 68 kt.

To the south, ship Maersk Colorado (WCX5081) reported from 47N 21W with a northwest wind 55 kt and 9 meter seas (30 ft).  Stor m off Eas t Coast Februar y 4-6 A persistent upper level trough near the U.S. East Coast in February and March led to frequent cyclogenesis (storm development). Unlike storms that  formed earlier in the winter and moved out rapidly, these were slower-moving and developed gale- and sometimes storm-force winds. One of the strongest of these East Coast lows strengthened 32 mb after moving off the southeast Virginia coast at 18Z 04 February, to become a 976 mb storm 39N 63W 24 hours later (Figure 8). North to northwest winds of 45 to 60 kt were on the back side of the storm west to 73W over the northern midAtlantic offshore waters. Seas were up to 11 to 13 meters (32 to 43 ft). The system then slowed and began to weaken and turn more north as it encountered a building ridge of high pressure over the central Atlantic.  Stor m March 11 Several storms formed during the period over the south central waters and off the coast of Portugal. The strongest of these is depicted in Figure 9 near 41N 18W with winds of 50 to 60 kt reported west of the center. Reported seas were 5 to 9 meters (16 to 30 ft) in this area. The storm, near maximum intensity at this time, subsequently drifted southeast and weakened.

Bancroft Meteorologist Marine Prediction Center  he winter of 1998/1999 was dominated by La Nia, with a strong jet stream extending from near Japan east northeast toward the Gulf of Alaska. Also a series of strong upper lows moving east from Siberia to the Kamchatka Peninsula area helped fuel significant developments. This led to frequent storm development east of Japan, with the lows then tracking east northeast to the Gulf of Alaska, with some of the lows moving more north into the Aleutians and Bering Sea and redeveloping in the Gulf of Alaska or looping back toward the Kamchatka Peninsula to be ""captured"" by the upper low in that area. Beginning late in January 1999, an upper low developed over Alaska and the Gulf of Alaska. This forced the jet stream south into the U.S. Pacific Northwest and Vancouver Island area and led to more storminess in that area. This set the stage for the 36 Mariners Weather Log  T  major storm in early March off the Washington and Oregon coasts that is covered in this article.  indicates. (Note the two 50 kt ship reports in the first surface panel.) The second surface analysis in Figure 1 shows the storm near maximum intensity at 955 mb crossing the dateline, unusually intense for that far south. There were ship reports with 55 to 60 kt east and southeast of the center at 12Z 05 January (between surface analysis times). Also note the 35 kt report with 958 mb pressure near the center. The system then drifted northeast and began to weaken by 7 January. The second 500 mb chart for 00Z 08 January (two days later) shows that the Kamchatka upper low has reformed to the southeast over the storm center. The storm was slowly weakening and drifting east at that time. Continued on Page 42  Stor m Near Dateline Januar y 4-8 The two panels of Figure 1 show the storm developing east of Japan and strengthening 33 mb during the 24-hour period between surface analyses. This development would therefore qualify as a meteorological ""bomb"" labeled on the analysis as ""RAPIDLY INTENSIFYING."" The first 500 mb chart in the Figure shows a 105 kt jet, an upper low near the Kamchatka Peninsula and a pair of short wave troughs (troughs of shorter wavelength and amplitude embedded in large upper lows) supporting this development.

The system slowed with the lowest pressure at 954 mb near 50N 150E at 06Z 28 February as shown in the second surface analysis in Figure 2. The most rapid strengthening was the drop from 1000 mb at 18Z 26 February (when the center was moving off the coast) to 962 mb at 18Z 27 February. The accompanying 500 mb charts show that the development is supported by a disturbance (strong short wave trough) and 100 kt jet moving  northeast from Japan (first panel). Then in the second panel the system has strengthened into an intense upper low nearly vertically stacked (from lower to higher levels in the atmosphere). As the system reached maximum intensity, gale- to storm-force winds appear behind the front down to 35N. The maximum reported wind was a west wind of 60 kt from a ship (name and call sign not available) at 46N 152E at 12Z 28 February (six hours later). Maximum seas were around 9 meters (30 ft) near 43N 149E.  Pacific Nor thwest Storm of March 2-3 This storm was a classic ""bomb,"" forming out of a low near 30N  which strengthened by 43 mb in 24 hours after it was picked up by a short wave disturbance coming from the northwest. Figure 3 illustrates this development. The southern disturbances (short wave troughs) consolidate and begin to close off (intensify to develop a detached revolving circulation) at 500 mb by 00Z 03 March. Figure 4 is an enhanced infrared satellite photo of the storm at 00Z 03 March showing the meteorologist a classic signature of a mature intense cyclone. The center is quite evident. The bands of relatively dry air spiraling around to the north and west sides of the center are indicative that the system is near maximum intensity.  Continued on Page 43  Figure 7.

The highest winds from any of the coastal buoys were a gust of 62 kt at buoy 46050 moored 15 miles west of Newport, Oregon. The CMAN station at Destruction Island a few miles off the northwest tip of the Olymic Peninsula reported gusts to 69 kt at 10Z on 3 March, and Tatoosh Island (15 miles south of destruction island) later had gusts to 77 kt from the west at 16Z on 3 March after the storm center had passed. Farther offshore a ship, the Veracruz (ELFO9) reported a northwest wind of 60 kt at 00Z 03 March (Figure 3). Other reports around the center of the storm were in the 40 to 50 kt range. Perhaps the most notable feature of this storm was the phenomenal seas it generated in the coastal waters and also the rapid building of the seas as the storm approached. Maximum seas exceeded 40 ft just off the northwest Oregon and southwest Washington coasts. The highest reported sea was 14 meters (46 ft) at buoy 46050 at 07Z 03 March. This was more than double the 6.5 meter sea (21 ft) reported six hours prior to this at 01Z 03 March. From a historical perspective, the NWS Portland, Oregon, office noted that the central pressure of this storm was likely equal to that of the 1962 Columbus Day storm. Also, seas at the buoy 46050 were  the highest in memory at that location.  Twin Super-Storms, Aleutians Area, March 15-22 Besides the storminess associated with the upper level trough off the West Coast, there was an active track of cyclones from Japan to the Aleutians and southern Bering Sea and then east. This made March perhaps the most active period of the winter. The strongest of these developed in mid to late March with central pressures below 950 mb. Figure 5 shows the first of these two storms with similar tracks and intensities. It is shown near maximum intensity at 946 mb in the central Aleutians at 06Z 18 March in the upper panel of Figure 5, while the lower panel is a sea state analysis valid 18 hours later when seas were fully developed. Note the 16 meter (50 feet) maximum analyzed south of the center, which was the highest of all the daily sea state analyses done by the National Weather Service, Marine Prediction Center (MPC) for either ocean in this four-month period. There was a 60 kt ship report (vessel name unknown) in the Bering Sea northwest of the center (Figure 5), but winds were likely hurricane force south of the center where there were no ship reports. The second storm formed near Japan at 00Z 20 March and reached a maximum intensity of 940 mb near the western Aleutians at 18Z 21 March (Figure 6). Much  of the intensification occurred in the 24-hour period from 12Z 20 March to 12Z 21 March when the central pressure dropped 50 mb, from 992 mb to 942 mb. The Sealand Liberator (KHRP) at 12Z 21 March reported 20 knot southeast wind, pressure 943.5 mb and seas 6 meters (20 ft) near the center of the storm. After passage of the center six hours later, the pressure jumped to 968 mb; wind increased to northwest 68 kt and seas built to 9.5 meters (31 ft). The Polar Eagle (ELPT3) reported from near 54N 180W at 12Z 21 March with a southeast wind of 60 kt and seas 7 meters (23 ft). In the central Bering Sea, Buoy 46035 reported a peak wind of 43 knots with gusts to 52 knots (maximum 60 kt) ahead of the front at 21Z 21 March. Sea state at this buoy increased from 2 meters (7 ft) at 12Z 21 March to 9 meters (30 ft) 10 hours later. This storm, like its predecessor, then slowed and turned east and began to weaken. Figure 7 is an infrared satellite image of the fully mature storm, still with pressure around 940 mb, with the cold, dry air wrapping completely around a center which is clearly evident near 55N 178W in this picture. Both storms reached maximum intensity in a relatively data-sparse area and there were no ship reports where maximum winds and seas are likely to have occurred, south of the centers. However, remote sensing through radar altimetry indicated maximum seas in the 18 to 20 meter (59 to 65 ft) range (Sienkiewicz, MPC, personal communication).h  August 1999 43   Marine Weather Review  Marine Weather Review Tropical Atlantic and Tropical Eas t Pacif ic Areas Januar y through April 1999 Dr. Jack Beven National Hurricane Center Daniel Brown Christopher Burr Tropical Analysis and Forecast Branch Tropical Prediction Center  I. Introduction La Nia conditions continued through the period in the tropical Eastern Pacific. This contributed to different weather patterns compared with this time in 1998, which in turn led to considerably calmer conditions in the Tropical Prediction Center (TPC) forecast areas compared with this time last year.  The reverse phenomenon, La Nia, occurs when these waters become colder than normal. Figure 1 shows the Eastern Pacific sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies for the week of 24-30 January 1999. Notice the dark stripe along the Equator west of 110W. This is an area of below normal SSTs associated with La Nia, with some temperatures greater than 2.5oC below normal. While strong El Nio events produce significant and somewhat predictable changes in weather patterns, changes associated with La Nia are less clear. Generally, strong La Nia events see above normal numbers of Atlantic hurricanes and normal to below normal numbers of Eastern Pacific  hurricanes. However, there are exceptions, such as in 1973. While Eastern Pacific SSTs were below normal that year, only eight tropical storms and hurricanes occurred in the Atlantic compared with the long term average of ten. La Nia also affects winter weather patterns. Normally, the Gulf of Mexico and adjacent Atlantic are less stormy during La Nia events than during El Nio events, with smaller numbers of strong low pressure areas. This results from differences in the jet stream patterns between the two types of events. However, strong winter storms can occur in these areas during La Nia events, as shown by the Florida coastal storm of 10-12 March 1996. Continued on Page 45  II. La Nia and Weather Events The El Nio phenomenon is an abnormal warming of ocean temperatures in the tropical Pacific west of South America. As seen in 1998, it causes major changes in world weather patterns.  44 Mariners Weather Log   Marine Weather Review Tropical Prediction Center Continued from Page 44 As of this writing, the La Nia might be weakening, as the cold SST anomalies are slowly warmimg and the associated tropical air pressure patterns are weakening. Is another El Nio on the horizon? Only time will tell.  III. Start of the 1999 Hurricane Season May 15 marked the start of the Eastern Pacific hurricane season while June 1 is the start of the Atlantic hurricane season.  Figure 1. Eastern Pacific sea surface temperature anomalies for the week of 24-30 January 1999.  IV. Signif icant Weather A. Tropical Cyclones: No tropical cyclones occurred in the Tropical Atlantic or Tropical Eastern Pacific during the January - April period. This is normal, as only four tropical or subtropical cyclones are known to have occurred during this time of year in these areas since 1886. B. Other Significant Events: As mentioned earlier, the first four months of 1999 were calmer compared with the El Nio winter and early spring of 1998. Most gale events were associated with strong cold fronts trailing from gale or storm centers located in more northerly latitudes. However, two significant gale centers did develop. The first was in the far eastern portion of the tropical Atlantic area in late January. The second developed along the Gulf of Mexico coast in mid-March and  produced gale conditions in the Gulf and Western Atlantic. 1. Atlantic, Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico Central Atlantic Gale of 24-27 January: A gale center developed on 24 January in the central Atlantic. By 0000 UTC 25 January, the center was analyzed near 31N 34W with a central pressure of 1012 mb. Although the central pressure was rather high, a 1034 mb high pressure system located northwest of the gale center combined with it to create a strong pressure gradient and a large area of gale force winds. The first ship report of gale force winds was at 0000 UTC 25 January from the Chiquita Bremen,which reported 40 kt north winds near 30N 43W. By 1200 UTC 25 January the gale had drifted to near 29N 35W (Figure 2). At that time, the  Robert E. Lee, located near 31N 45W, reported 39 kt northeast winds and 18 ft combined seas. The system continued to strengthen slowly while moving southwest. By 0000 UTC 26 January (Figure 3) it was located near 27N 38W with a 1006 mb central pressure. Because the area of strong winds remained nearly stationary for about 36 hours,large swells were propagated. The ship V2HL (name not available) reported 20 foot swells at both 0000 UTC and 1200 UTC 26 January, as did the Chiquita Rostock near 31N 46W at 1200 UTC. Late on 26 January the high pressure system began to weaken. The central pressure dropped to 1004 MB by 0600 UTC 27 January. Although gales ended about that time, large swells which had been generated by the gale Continued on Page 46 August 1999 45   Marine Weather Review Tropical Prediction Center Continued from Page 45 affected the area for the next few days. Atlantic Gale of 31 January - 2 February: On 31 January a low formed near 34N 61W. As the system developed, a strong high pressure center located over the northeast United States combined with it to produce strong northeast winds over a large area of the western Atlantic. At 0000 UTC 1 February the 1000 mb gale was centered near 33N 57W. At that time, the ship C6JS (name not available) reported 40 kt northwest winds while the Nolizwe reported 34 kt winds. Both ships were near 30N 63W. The Primo (V7AV6), located closer to the gale center, reported 41 kt winds. At 1200 UTC 1 February, the C6JS near 32N 60W reported 40 kt winds with 26 ft combined seas. Primo near 29N 36W reported 36 kt. By 1800 UTC 1 February there was a 996 mb low located near 33N 50W. After 1800 UTC the gale center turned northeast and rapidly moved away from the area. Cold Front and Gale of 16-18 February: Starting at 0000 UTC 16 February, gale conditions developed north of 29N between 57W and 67W. This occurred along and to the west of a cold front trailing from a mid-latitude gale center. The area of gales spread east and by 1200 UTC 16 February were north of 28N between 50W and 61W. At 0000 UTC 17 February the ship C6JS Continued on Page 47  Figure 2. GOES-8 visible image at 1815 UTC 25 January 1999. Image courtesy of the National Climatic Data Center.  Figure 3.

Several ships reported 10 to 16 ft seas on 17 February. Gale conditions continued spreading east and by 0000 UTC 18 February were north of 29N between 45W and 60W. The Gale Force winds ended in this area by 0600 UTC 18 February. However, large swells affected the area through the remainder of the day. Cold Front and Gale of 8-10 March: A strong cold front and associated 20-30 kt winds moved across the U.S. east coast and the western Atlantic on 7-8 March, reaching a 31N 62W to central Cuba line by 1800 UTC 8 March. At that time, a developing storm center produced an area of gales north of 28N within 300 nm west of the cold front. The front continued to move rapidly southeast and by 1800 UTC 9 March was analyzed from 31N 50W to near Puerto Rico. At that time the ship ELTN6 (name not available) reported 34 kt west winds near 28N 54W. The Hood Island reported 34 kt westerly winds at 0000 UTC 10 March west of the cold front. Gales had moved further north by 0600 UTC 10 March, although 20-30 kt winds continued for another 12 hours. Gulf of Mexico-Atlantic Gale of 12-16 March: A low pressure center developed over southeast Texas on 12 March and moved northeast into southern Louisiana on 13 March. By 0000 UTC 14 March, the 1000 MB low pressure  Figure 4. GOES-8 visible image at 1815 UTC 14 March 1999. Image courtesy of the National Climatic Data Center.  was centered just north of New Orleans moving slowly east. An associated cold front extended southwest across the Gulf to near Veracruz, Mexico. The C-MAN site at Southwest Pass, Louisiana, reported 40 kt south winds just ahead of the cold front. Six hours later, the Chevron Arizona near 29N 87W reported 38 kt westerly winds just west of the cold front. By 1800 UTC 14 March, the low was centered over north Georgia. The cold front trailed southward into north Florida and extended across the Gulf of Mexico from Cedar Key to the northeast tip of the Yucatan Peninsula (Figure 4). Winds in the Gulf of Mexico had decreased below gale force.  However, several buoys still reported 10 to 12 ft seas. As the front approached the western Atlantic, the winds again increased. Ship YJWZ7 (name not available) reported 40 kt southwest winds at 0000 UTC 15 March near 32N 80W. At 0600 UTC 15 March, the low pressure system moved off the North Carolina coast and rapidly developed into a storm center. The cold front extended south across the southern tip of Florida into western Cuba. Buoy 41002 near 32N 75W reported 40 kt southsoutheast winds with 15 ft seas at this time. Later on 15 March the Continued on Page 48 August 1999 47   Marine Weather Review Tropical Prediction Center Continued from Page 47 storm center moved rapidly northeast. Caribbean Wind Surge of 17-19 April: From 17-19 April, low surface pressures over northern South America, in combination with a strong high pressure ridge across the Atlantic, created a strong pressure gradient across the central and eastern Caribbean. A strong easterly wind surge developed over the southern Caribbean along and just north of the coast of Colombia. At 1800 UTC 17 April the Lincoln Universal near 17N 76W and the Caribic near 13N 75W reported 34 kt and 36 kt easterly winds respectively. At nearly the same time, a satellite scatterometer overpass (Figure 5)  indicated an area 30 to 35 kt winds over the south-central Caribbean, confirming the ship observations. This was a difficult forecast situation, as numerical model guidance underestimated the pressure gradient and wind speeds. The surge continued on 18 April, with the Caribic reporting 34 kt easterly winds near 14N 77W at 0600 UTC and 33 kt near 11N 79W six hours later. By 0600 UTC 19 April, the pressure gradient decreased slightly across the Caribbean and the winds decreased below gale force. However, 20-25 kt easterly winds continued across the area for several more days. During this event, ship observations and scatterometer satellite wind estimates were a very valuable forecast tool, as they helped  pinpoint the strength and area of the strongest winds. 2. Eastern Pacific The East Pacific area was affected by six gale events in the Gulf of Tehuantepec (and surrounding waters) and one gale center that moved rapidly eastward across the northern boundary of the forecast area in early March. Gulf of Tehuantepec: All the Gulf of Tehuantepec events resulted from north to northeast winds passing through the Isthmus of Tehuantepec behind strong cold fronts that moved rapidly eastward across the Gulf of Mexico. The gale events were verified by satellite Special Sensor MicroContinued on Page 49  Figure 5. ERS-2 Scatterometer data for 17 April 1999.

Each event lasted for two to four days with the gale conditions confined to within 240 nautical miles of the coast although SSM/I data in some cases indicated wind speeds in the 20 to 30 kt range extending southward and southwestward to 9N (approximately 420 nautical miles from the coast). The fourth (12-14 February) and fifth (15-16 March) events were the strongest of the six. The fourth  event was marked by a strong pressure gradient between a cold front and a 1037 mb high that moved eastward across Texas and the southeast United States. Gale conditions began approximately 1800 UTC 12 February and continued until 1800 UTC 14 February. The Centur y Highway No. 3 reported 45 kt northeast winds and 18 ft combined seas near 12N 96W at 1200 UTC 14 February. Figure 6 depicts the daily average SSM/I wind speeds on 14 February. The fifth event began approximately 0000 UTC 15 March and  was marked by an elongated ridge of high pressure that extended across the central United States through east Texas and into the western Gulf of Mexico (the cold front at this time was along a line extending from the Georgia coast across the west tip of Cuba into the Gulf of Honduras). This front/ ridge pattern progressed eastward 20 to 25 kt and gale conditions ended at approximately 1200 UTC 16 March. A ship (name or call sign not available) reported 39 kt north winds and 11 ft combined seas near 15N 94W at 1200 UTC Continued on Page 50  Figure 6. SSM/I average surface winds for 14 February 1999.

The same ship reported 34 kt northeast winds (seas not reported) six hours earlier. Figure 8 depicts the daily average SSM/I wind speeds on 15 March. Cold Front and Gale of 6-7 March: A strong cold front entered the forecast area from the north between 1200 UTC 6 March and 1800 UTC 6 March. By 0000 UTC 7 March the cold front extended southwest from 30N 126W through 24N 140W. Gale conditions were confined to the area west of the cold front with the ship DXQC (name not available) reporting 33 kt north winds and 10 ft combined seas near 30N 132W. Six hours later the ship VRUY4 (name not available) reported 33 kt north winds and 12 ft combined seas near 24N 131W. By 1200 UTC 7 March, the gale center associated with the cold front moved southeast near 30N 121W with a central pressure of 1010 mb (the gale strengthened only slightly over the preceding 24 to 36 hours). The ship DXQC (moving southeast about 15 kt) encountered 34 kt north winds and 17 ft combined seas near 29N 129W. The gale center then tracked eastward (Figure 9) and weakened as it crossed the northern Baja peninsula and into northwest Mexico between 0000 UTC and 0600 UTC 8 March. The cold front continued to move southeast and gradually weakened. The DXQC encountered 33 kt north winds and 14 ft combined seas near 28N 127W at 1800 UTC 8 March.h 50 Mariners Weather Log  Figure 8. SSM/I average surface winds for 15 March 1999.

Beeghl y May 6-7, 1999 Eric Stevens National Weather Service Marquette, Michigan  T  he 800-foot Charles M. Beeghly reached the Sault Ste Marie locks on the evening of May 6 as it headed for Superior, Wisconsin, with a load of limestone. John Machowski and I, both meteorologists with the National Weather Service in Marquette, Michigan, rode the comparatively tiny motor launch, Ojibway, from the ""Soo Store"" warehouse out to meet the Beeghly. John and I were guests of the Interlake Steamship Company and the crew of the Beeghly for just over 24 hours as the Beeghly completed its journey to Superior. Our goal was to observe the operations aboard a Great Lakes ore carrier and to learn what impact the weather has on the Great Lakes' largest ships. Upon leaving Sault Ste Marie, the wind blew from the southeast at 10 to 20 knots and waves were only 2 to 3 feet (.5 to 1 meter) while we were still in Whitefish Bay. By the time we had reached the western half of Lake Superior, the wind had picked up to northeast 20 to 30 knots, and waves had built to 4 to 6 feet (1 to 2 meters). The Beeghly hardly seemed to notice such waves. The last time I  had been on Lake Superior was in September 1998, when I took the Royale Queen III to Isle Royale. Waves reached 6 feet that day, and the Queen was soon filled with seasick passengers. This contrast illustrates how different boats handle similar conditions differently, such as wave height, structural icing, or fog, to name a few weather elements. Captain Russ Brohl of the Beeghly mentioned that 8- to 12-foot (2.5- to 4meter) waves are more noticeable and sometimes break over the deck, but the ship and cargo can handle these conditions. Waves begin to be more of an issue when they reach the 13 to 15 foot (4 to 4.5 meter) range, as they will then frequently break over the deck and all the hatches must be secured. The wind in the immediate Duluth/Superior area was quite gusty. The topography at the western tip of Lake Superior can sometimes focus the wind and produce significant differences between the weather on the open lake and the weather right along shore at Duluth/Superior.  While many smaller boats rely exclusively on radio broadcasts for their weather information, the Beeghly's communications equipment allows the wheelhouse crew to read copies of the National Weather Service open lake, Coded Marine Forecast (MAFOR), and nearshore forecasts themselves. They also download graphical forecasts via DMAWDS (Digital MArine Weather Dissemination System). These graphical forecasts depict the positions of high and low pressure centers and fronts on the Great Lakes and help the crew interpret the weather forecast. Captain Bruhl and the crew of the Beeghly showed John and I the warmest hospitality throughout the trip. John and I truly appreciated the opportunity to sail aboard the Beeghly, and we are already using the knowledge gained during the voyage to assist in forecasting the weather for Lake Superior.h  August 1999 53   Coas tal F orecast Of fice New s  Coastal Forecast Of fice NewsNorth Carolina Area Laura Furgione Warning Coordination Meteorologist National Weather Service Office Newport, North Carolina  T  he first four months of 1999 were quite active along the North Carolina coast. Although there were no major storms, numerous cold frontal passages produced many gale force wind episodes. The main storm track this winter ran from the southern plains northeast toward the Ohio Valley region. Coastal North Carolina was to the south of most of the low pressure systems, and this produced several events where strong south to southeast winds developed. Gale force south to southeast wind events occurred during the following periods: January 3rd and 24th, February 12th and 28th, and March 13th. Sustained winds of 30 to 40 knots produced seas of 10 to 15 feet along the coast, with the worst conditions mainly from Cape Hatteras south. These strong winds and large seas produced significant beach erosion along the south coast, mainly from Emerald Isle to North Topsail Beach. A low pressure system that developed off the South Carolina  coast during late April, moved very slowly northeast and produced a prolonged period of strong northeast winds along the coast. Winds of 35 to 45 knots with gusts to 50 knots were common the 29th and 30th. These strong winds produced very rough seas of 4 to 5 meters (12 to 16 feet), with the worst conditions from Cape Hatteras south. Beach erosion was reported along the Outer Banks, with some flooding along the southern Pamlico sound. The National Weather service in Newport anticipated all the above events and issued Marine Weather Statements well in advance to give mariners a heads-up of the hazardous conditions. In addition to the Coastal Waters Forecast, statements were issued during each event to give additional information to mariners and coastal residents. The National Weather Service in Newport transmits numerous products for the marine user. One of our most popular forecast products is the Coastal Marine  Forecast, which covers South of Currituck Beach Light to Surf City and out to 20 nm. For those interested in forecasts beyond 48 hours, an extended three- to fiveday forecast is also compiled. Included in the extended forecast is wind speed, wind direction, and wave height. Special Marine Warnings are issued on an asneeded basis. These include severe thunderstorms, waterspouts, and wind speeds that are forecast to exceed 35 knots. All the forecasts can be obtained via the NOAA Weather Radio. The transmitter in New Bern is 162.40 Mhz, while the Hatteras transmission can be heard over 162.475 Mhz. An Offshore Forecast from Baltimore Canyon to Hatteras Canyon then southward to Blake Ridge can be found on either channel. During hurricane season, June 1 through November 30, Tropical Marine Advisories are also broadcast.

As a result of the tight pressure gradient between the strengthening low pressure offshore and a ridge of high pressure east of the Appalachian Mountains, the Carolina coastal waters from Surf City, North Carolina, to South Santee River, South Carolina, were pounded with gale- to stormforce winds for nearly four days. The meteorological conditions which lead to the development of this system more typically occur during the winter season. A cold front pushed southward through the Carolinas during the late night and early morning hours of April 27 and 28 and stalled off the South Carolina coast. Weak low pressure (1010 mb) developed along the front Thursday morning as a 500 mb trough swung into the MidAtlantic region (500 mb troughs observed on the 500 mb analyses frequently result in the formation of surface low pressure areas). The 500 mb trough evolved into a closed low Thursday evening before moving off the South Carolina coast early Friday. The surface low deepened to 1004 mb  by Saturday morning as the surface and upper-level systems became vertically stacked. A Gale Warning was issued by the National Weather Service in Wilmington, North Carolina, at 4:08 am EDT Thursday, April 29 for the coastal waters between Surf City and South Santee River. The Gale Warning was upgraded to a Storm Warning at 8:18 am EDT Friday, April 30, for the waters between Surf City and Murrells Inlet. The Storm Warning remained in effect for nearly 44 continuous hours. The storm coincided with a full moon on Friday, causing higher than normal high tides. Beach erosion was reported along the shores of Pender and New Hanover counties, including Topsail and Wrightsville beaches. Because winds remained generally out of the northeast, the south-facing beaches of Brunswick county were spared significant damage. Heavy rain, which began falling on Tuesday, continued into Sunday. More than 13 inches fell across portions of New Hanover county, leaving up to a foot of water standing on flood prone roads. By Saturday afternoon, numerous roads across New  Hanover, Pender, and Brunswick counties were blocked by flood waters. The New Hanover County town of Carolina Beach was hit particularly hard, as several feet of water blocked roads in the northern part of town. US 421, the main artery between Carolina Beach and the rest of New Hanover County, was severed. The Oak Island Coast Guard Station recorded a wind gust of 70 knots on Friday afternoon. The tower at Frying Pan Shoals, North Carolina, approximately 30 nm southeast of Cape Fear, recorded sustained winds to 61 knots and seas of 5 meters (17 feet) at the peak of the storm. Wind gauges in the coastal communities of Surf City, Kure Beach, and Southport recorded gusts up to 43 knots on Saturday. One mariner lost his life when a shrimp boat capsized near the mouth of the Cape Fear River Thursday morning. Storm Warnings were lowered to Gale Warnings at 4:00 am EDT on Sunday, May 2nd. Winds and seas subsided throughout the afternoon as the low pressure system weakened and moved northeast of the area. Gale Warnings were lowered at 4:00 pm Sunday.h August 1999 55   VOS Program  Voluntar y Obser ving Ship Program Martin S.

This new Windows version features on-screen drop-down windows with code tables, sea state and cloud photographs, and help menus. The entire ships code card is available as a tutorial onscreen. To create your coded weather message, you either click on code values drawn directly from the on-screen tables, or you type-in the value from your computer keyboard. Like earlier SEAS/AMVER software, this software is ""paperless."" Your completed weather observations are stored in the computer and transferred to Archive Diskettes for mailing to your PMO (special postage paid diskette mailers are now available, see below). Recording of observations on Ships Weather Observa-  tions Form B-81 is still appropriate for ships not using this software or incapable of using this software due to equipment limitations. SEAS 2000 will also support AMVER position reporting requirements when the report is transmitted through COMSAT affiliated stations. We expect this new software to be available in late 2000. A version to operate with shipboard Expendible Bathythermographs (XBTs) is also being developed. Prior to release of this new software, we recommend use of SEAS version 4.52 (available from Port Meteorological Officers (PMOs), SEAS Field Representatives, or the SEAS webpage at http://seas.nos.noaa.gov/seas/ Three NOAA line offices are collaborating in the SEAS 2000 development effort. It's being lead by the Office of Atmospheric  Research, Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS) Operations Center, with the office of NOAA Corps Operations writing the software in cooperation with the National Weather Service (NWS). System requirements for new SEAS/AMVER software will be Pentium 133 MHz or greater, VGA monitor, Windows 95, 98, or NT, 3.5 inch floppy drive, and a compact disk reader (CD).  New SEAS Archive Diskette Mailers Special SEAS Archive Diskette mailers are now available from PMOs. These are for mailing your SEAS formatted weather observation records to your PMO.

If not reporting any significant weather, ix is coded as 2 and group 7wwW1W2 is omitted from the weather message. 4. Many sea states are composed of a mixture of sea and swell which can be difficult to unravel. Swell waves are due to the action of strong winds in some distant area and may travel thousands of miles from their origin before dissipating. Swell waves have longer wavelengths in comparison to sea waves and also have longer periods. To help distinguish sea from swell, use (1) your observed wind speed, and (2) wave direction of movement. A succession of waves with long wavelength with height of 3 meters or more, when the wind has not exceeded 10 knots, would have to be classified as swell because the local wind is not strong enough to be responsible. Waves not moving with the local wind must be described as swell. With stronger winds, when there is a considerable sea, distinguishing between sea and swell can be difficult if there is not much difference between their direction of motion. In such cases, waves with noticeably longer periods are swell. If period differences cannot be distinguished, and the waves are moving in the same direction, it is best to regard the combined motion as being due to sea waves.  Updated Obser ving Handbook Now Available The revised edition of NWS Observing Handbook No.1 is now in print. (The cover of the revised edition is the same as the old edition; the April 1999 revision date appears on the title page next to the inside front cover.) This new edition replaces the August 1995 edition. Copies were mailed to all NWS Voluntary Observing Ships. Additional copies are available from PMOs. The most notable change has been a complete rewrite of Chapter 3, Transmitting the Observation.  Some Reminders 1. Complete the transmission of your INMARSAT weather report in 30 seconds or less. This helps reduce communications costs paid by the NWS. 2. Take special care to accurately code your day, time, and position information (section 0 of the Ships Synoptic Code). Meteorological reports received with section 0 coding errors can seldom be used, and are usually discarded. Section 0 consists of the first five groups of the weather message -- BBXX D....D YYGGiw 99LaLaLa QcLoLoLoLo. 3. Remember the relationship between ix in group iri xhVV and group 7wwW1W2.

The U.S. Coast Guard is able to accept, at no cost to the ship, AMVER reports transmitted via Inmarsat-C in a compressed binary format, created using the AMVER/SEAS program. Typically, in the past, the cost of transmission for AMVER messages has been assumed by the vessel. When ships participate in both the SEAS and AMVER programs, the position of ship provided in the meteorological report is forwarded to the Coast Guard as a supplementary AMVER position report to maintain a more accurate plot. To obtain the AMVER/SEAS program contact your U.S. PMO or AMVER/SEAS representative listed at the back of this publication. If using the NOAA AMVER/SEAS software, follow the instructions outlined in the AMVER/SEAS User 's Manual. When using Inmarsat-C, use the compressed binary format and 8-bit X.25 (PSDN) addressing (31102030798481), rather than TELEX if possible when reporting weather. Common errors when using the AMVER/SEAS include sending the compressed binary message via the code 41 or a plain text message via the X.25 address. Only COMSAT can accept messages in the compressed binary format. Text editors should normally not be utilized in sending the data in the compressed binary format as this may corrupt the message.

The significant wave height is defined as the average height of the highest one-third of the waves during the average period each hour. The maximum significant wave height is the highest of those values for that month. At most stations, air temperature, water temperature, wind speed and direction are sampled once per second during an 8.0-minute averaging period each hour (moored buoys) and a 2.0-minute averaging period for fixed stations (C-MAN).

GX027-48-1650936	"Introduction  |  II. Is the Warming Special?   |  IV. What We Can Expect in the 21st Century                III. How Well Can We Model the Warming?          Introduction and Overview           The first two sections        have served to establish that we are observing a large and rather abrupt        warming unlike anything in at least the past 1,000 yrs. But is it natural        or does it contain elements of human influence as the IPCC said? The answer        so far is that it contains both. In the first half of the century the natural        seems to have dominated over anthropogenic greenhouse gases (AGHG) forcing.        The second half seems to be increasingly forced by human pollution, both        AGHG and aerosol pollution, with elements of interannual and interdecadal        ocean cycles, solar cycle variations, and sporadic volcanic eruptions.               To a large extent we        are able to sort out the presence and relative importance of these different        forcings through energy balance considerations and, increasingly, with computer        modeling of the entire ocean/atmosphere/land global circulation, called        ""Coupled General Circulation Models"" (CGCMs).         Briefly, these models        follow the motions in the ocean and atmosphere by dividing the space into        small, interconnecting three-dimensional boxes. Each box has its own temperature,        pressure, density, chemical constituents, clouds, dust, ice, rain, amounts        of radiation and other heat transport, etc. all with their own velocities.        Thus, material, following the rules of physics, chemistry, motion, etc.        moves from box to box in quite complex, chaotic ways. The computer code        keeps track of all these interactions as the ocean and air currents move        around on the surface of a spherical, rotating (coriolis forces) planet.        In addition, models now include interactions with the land surface and sea        ice.         If the boxes are small        enough so that important processes aren't impossible to take into account,        and if the physical/chemical sub-models are good enough, the computer codes        should represent the actual behavior of the Earth's ocean/atmosphere system.                 The history of attempts        to use such models to understand the complex warming signature is one of        successive approximations. At first only AGHGs (anthropogenic greenhouse        gases--not only carbon dioxide, but also methane, CFCs, nitrous oxide, and        others) were included, then sulfate aerosols which scatter sunlight back        into space, then estimates of solar forcing, stratospheric and tropospheric        ozone changes, and most recently, forcings due to a variety of other aerosols--wind-blown        dust, biomass burning smoke, soot, and effects of large-scale land use.        Some critics suggest that this is a vain attempt to keep adding new elements        until the models look like the observations. Modelers counter, and justifiably        so, that we know all these elements affect the radiation and heat budgets        of the ocean/atmosphere/land system.          Thus, to the extent        that they are important players, they all must be included or else we are        not simulating the real climate. But, due to the complexity and the computer        time needed to run these models, climate scientists have attempted to keep        things simple, adding additional forcings only as needed and when well enough        understood.         In addition, there        are cloud feedbacks that can alter climate much more than AGHGs. As CO 2         forcing warms the climate, the ocean (and to a lesser extent the land surface)        attempts to cool itself by evaporation. This increases atmospheric water        vapor, itself a strong (and the dominant natural) GHG. This is an important        positive feedback, further increasing the warming. But, it is not certain        how much of this increased water vapor will turn into clouds, and at what        altitudes these new clouds might form (low ones cool the system while very        high ones warm it). This is a crucial part of the picture since clouds are        capable of large radiative forcings that could either greatly reduce or        increase the GHG warming. More than anything else, it is this cloud-feedback        uncertainty that prevents climate researchers from confidently discussing        global warming.         This section will first        look at how well our codes simulate climate, and then take up the more difficult        questions of both postdicting the 20th Century temperature record and predicting        the 21st Century warming.       Simulating the Present Climate                While significant aspects        of the physics of weather and climate processes are still in need of inclusion        or improvement, scientists think they pretty much have the basics worked        out. (The 1995 IPCC Science Report discusses the accuracy of climate models        for nearly 60 pages.) For example, the evening news weather person is doing        quite a good job of predicting temperatures, winds, and precipitation several        days in advance. But the detailed simulations needed to accomplish this        for a few days prediction over a limited geographical region are well beyond        even the most powerful computers when decades of global weather must be        simulated. Thus, the global codes must have much simpler physics (little        more than recipes in some instances) done on much coarser spatial grids.        Where the local weather is simulated on grids 5 to 25 km on a side, global        climate simulation grids are usually 150-400 km on a side. Even so, with        proper averaging and by combining results from different codes, the Earth's        global temperature and precipitation is fairly well simulated ( Figure 17 ).   Figure 18   shows        similarly impressive agreement between a recent climate code driven by sea        surface temperatures and satellite observations of the atmosphere above.                                           Figure 17. The geographical distribution        of December to February surface temperature (a) and June to August precipitation        (c) compared to that simulated by comprehensive coupled models of the type        used for climate projection (b) and (d).                                                Coupled ocean/atmosphere        climate codes are simulating observed variability from years to decades.          Figure 19   shows such an example where sea        surface temperatures (SST) across the north Pacific vary with a 20-year        cycle. The literature is full of increasingly realistic simulations. Such        codes are routinely predicting both the occurrence and climate response        to El Niños nearly a year in advance.          The most recent versions        of these codes are truly impressive.  Figures 20 and        21   show comparisons between satellite observations and an extremely        high-resolution ocean code developed at Los Alamos National Laboratory in        collaboration with several ocean modeling efforts. The first shows sea surface        temperatures for the Atlantic Ocean in the vicinity of the Gulf Stream (nearly        all features are simulated extremely well). The second is a similar comparison,        but for sea surface height variation, an extremely sensitive feature of        ocean circulation. Again the agreement is extremely good.         These impressive results        (especially in the atmospheric models) are in part due to careful tuning        of the codes' parameterizations for heat fluxes (not ""flux corrections""        between ocean and atmosphere, which are no longer needed), clouds, and precipitation        amount.         The question remains,        how well can ""tuned"" codes be relied on to predict changes for which the        tuning may be incorrect? This question was answered partially when these        codes were used to actually predict the global response to the reduction        in sunlight caused by the eruption of Mt. Pinatubo in 1991.                                                          Figure 18 shows similarly impressive        agreement between a recent climate code driven by sea surface temperatures        and satellite observations of the atmosphere above. Coupled ocean/atmosphere        climate codes are simulating observed variability from years to decades.                                                                         This volcano put considerable        sunlight-scattering aerosols into the stratosphere. Unlike aerosols put        into the troposphere, which are rained out in a matter of weeks, stratospheric        dust takes several years to completely dissipate. In 1991 a climate code        was used to predict the amount of global cooling and subsequent warming        (as the aerosols settled out) vs time.  Figure 22  shows        the predictions compared with the observations. The agreement is remarkable,        showing that the codes were accurate over a global temperature range of        0.5 o C. But would they do as well over the 2-4 o C predicted        for tripling of atmospheric CO 2  in the next century? One test        would be to ""postdict"" the observed warming of the 20th Century.                                                              Fig. 19.

The comparison is only qualitative because        the color scale used in the satellite image is not available and therefore        could not be reproduced in the model image. However, important points of        comparison are the narrowness of the core of the GS, separation of the GS        at Cape Hatteras, the scale of meanders downstream of the separation, and        the formation of cold (warm) core eddies south (north) of the GS. A notable        discrepancy is the appearance in the model of cold water along the coastline        from Cape Hatteras to southern Florida, instead of the relatively warm water        seen in the observations.

Simulating Global Warming         Simulating a global        temperature record such as that for the last century requires including        processes that ""force"" the climate to change. These can be anything from        changes in sunlight, ""solar forcing"" to human air pollution, which both        scatters light (cooling) and absorbs it (heating). The approach climate        modelers use (largely due to the inadequate computer power) is to add these        forcings one at a time.  Figure 23   shows the        major forcings under consideration and their estimated magnitudes.                            Figure 23. Major sources of climate forcing.                        Cooling Effects of Aerosols      The first attempts at modeling the 20th century warming included only GHG forcing. This overly simple approach showed that indeed the warming from the known rise in anthropogenic GHGs (AGHG) was commensurate with the general rise in temperature, but the resulting smooth rise was larger than observed, and it did not look like the observations (Figure 2), which showed an early very rapid rise (1920-1940) followed by a later actual decline in temperatures (1940-1975), followed by another rapid rise. Since other forcings were known to exist, modelers began adding them. First, they realized that massive industrialization, started in the '40s and greatly accelerated in the post-war economic boom, led to legendary air pollution which continued until clean air reforms in the middle '70s. The sulfate aerosols produced in that period were certainly scattering some sunlight back into space, and this effect could have been large enough to cool the planet. That the observed cooling was greater in the Northern Hemisphere than in the South provided strength for this reasoning.   Figure 24 shows warming (pink) and cooling (blue) trends for this century. Major coolings occur regionally where industrial pollution has been the worst. Computer models were then adjusted to approximate the radiative scattering effects of estimates of sulfate aerosol loading as functions of location and time. The resulting global temperatures were found to be in much closer agreement with the observations than GHGs alone.           Figure 24. Temperature trends in the last century (red is positive, blue-negative).                          Solar Forcings Explain Early Temperature Rise      While sulfate aerosols could give a better explanation of cooling in the 1960s, they actually made the temperature rise less than observed. It was time to look at possible warming due to the observed increase in solar activity in the first half of the century. Solar activity varies roughly in an eleven-year cycle, but the maxima of these cycles themselves vary.    During Europe's so-called ""Little Ice Age"" in the 1600s, solar activity was quite low. It was also low throughout much of the 19th Century, but beginning around 1920, successive maximums were increasingly energetic. This continued until the great solar maximum of 1957. Thereafter, solar activity declined--the 1970 maximum being much lower. However, maxima in 1980 and 1990 returned to nearly the same levels as 1957. It was noticed that global temperatures, at least in the NH, seemed to follow these ups and downs in activity and efforts were made to determine accurate proxies for solar activity and for global temperatures back to 1600.  Figure 25   shows one such attempt. It plots proxy temperatures and reconstructed total solar irradiance adding instrumental temperatures in the mid-1800s. Temperatures are for the NH only since the sparse records we have from the SH do not show this variation. Regardless, when this variation in solar irradiance was put into the models, it made a dramatic improvement in the agreement with the observed temperatures.              Fig. 25. Attempt to reconstruct solar influence on climate.                             Thus, it seemed that in order to reproduce the observed temperature rise in this century, the models would have to include forcings from not only AGHGs, but also aerosols and solar variability. Figure 26 summarizes these results. Using a simplified version of a global climate model (so-called energy balance model), it is possible to artificially add or subtract forcings and to change the feedback response to temperature changes. In  Figure 26a   is plotted the observed global surface temperature plus results from models which included AGHG forcing only. The three curves are for different assumed climate feedback sensitivities to doubling CO 2  in the atmosphere: a low sensitivity that would lead to a 1.5 o C rise, medium-2.5 o C rise and high-4.5 o  rise. This shows clearly that AGHG forcing only overestimates the warming. In  Figure 26b   the effects of sulfate aerosols have been added. The temperature is now too low. Figure 26c combines solar with aerosols and AGHGs. The resulting fit approximates the data quite well for a climate sensitivity in which a temperature rise of 2.5 o C would be expected for doubling carbon dioxide, a value close to what more complex climate models are getting.    Since the Debate, a paper has been published (Bengtsson et al. 1999) which models global climate from 1880 thru 1997. In addition to comparing results for GHG only, GHG plus direct effects of aerosols, and GHG plus both direct and indirect (additional clouds formed due to aerosols), it goes on to include cooling due to stratospheric ozone depletion and aerosols lofted into the stratosphere due to the volcanic eruption of Mt. Pinatubo. These simulations show that the entire surface record can be explained by inclusion of GHG plus aerosols, but the more dramatic finding is that stratospheric ozone depletion cools not only the stratosphere but the upper               Fig. 26. Upwelling Diffusion Energy Balance Models of Global Climate Sensitivity. (a) GHG forcing only, (b)  GHG + aerosols, (c) GHG + aerosols + Ozone Depletion and Volcanic Eruptions                         and middle troposphere. When the Mt. Pinatubo eruption is added the simulation agrees extremely well with the satellite record ( Figure 27  ). This is the first time a computer model has both reproduced the surface warming and the satellite (mid-tropospheric) record at the same time. The disagreements in 1980 and 1996 represent work still to be done and/or call for corrections to the observations. But the ability of a global climate model to obtain such overall agreement between surface and satellite records is encouraging, and gives promise that modelers are gradually including the important sources of climate change.     The Feedback Problem     Fred Singer is correct when he points to uncertainties in clouds and water vapor as the biggest problem for climate modelers. As the climate warms, more water vapor enters the atmosphere. Because it is itself a GHG, this represents a positive feedback that will produce additional warming. In addition warming reduces snow and ice cover also a positive feedback. Finally, increased water in the atmosphere could lead to increased cloudiness. Low clouds tend to cool the system (by both radiating away energy and reflecting incoming sunlight), while high clouds tend to warm it by (passing most of the incoming sunlight, but trapping outgoing longwave radiation).                   Fig. 27. Observed microwave sounding unit (MSU) temperature, shown as  dashed line, for channel 2LT for the period 1979-97 and the equivalent for the simulations with Mount Pinatubo and stratospheric ozone. The mean value obtained from the six realizations is denoted by the solid line, whereas the shaded area represents this value plus and minus one standard deviation of the individual simulations, respectively.                  Thus, there is the opportunity for both positive and negative feedbacks to either amplify or reduce the original warming. However, it is exactly these physical processes that are most uncertain in the climate codes. Warming due to doubling of CO 2  leads to a temperature increase of about 1.2 o      C. The best computer  models predict a net positive feedback due the above processes of from 60 to 100%. Critics suggest that the codes treat these processes in such a rudimentary fashion that the net feedback could easily be much smaller or even negative. In such a situation warming in the 21st century would modest. Various methods have been used to test whether the codes adequately simulate these processes. The example given above in Figure 22 of cooling and subsequent warming due to the Mt. Pinatubo eruption is a modest test that was successful. In addition both seasonal and latitudinal change, which are adequately simulated require correct modeling of these processes. On the other hand, one failing of most climate models is that they produce an upper troposphere in the tropics that is both too moist and too warm. This deficiency, if it is amplified by warming, would cause over estimation of the positive feedback due to water vapor. Cloudiness is also of concern. At present it is estimated that a GHG warmed climate will not strongly change the relative cloud feedback. Still only small differences in cloudiness can have a strong influence on the Earth's energy budget. Thus, while these processes are thought to be adequately simulated, our inability to handle them more precisely remains the primary source of uncertainty in attributing the observed warming to human influence.                             LANL       The Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics (IGPP), LANL        Go to top of page"

Over the last century, the average surface temperature of   the Earth has increased by about 1.0 o  F. The eleven warmest years   this century have all occurred since 1980, with 1995 the warmest on record. The   higher latitudes have warmed more than the equatorial regions.       Beginning in 1979, satellites have been used to measure the temperature   of the atmosphere up to a height of 30,000 feet. The long-term surface record   and the recent satellite observations differ, but that fact is not surprising:   the two techniques measure the temperature of different parts of the Earth   system (the surface, and various layers of the atmosphere). In addition to   this, a variety of factors, such as the presence of airborne materials from the   1991 eruption of the volcano Mt. Pinatubo, affect each record in a different   way. Satellite observations were initially interpreted as showing a slight   cooling, but more recent analyses accounting for natural, short-term   fluctuations imply warming, just as the ground-based measurements have   indicated over a longer time period. As more data from the satellite record   become available, and as the quality of measurements is improved, comparison of   these two records should yield additional insights.         What does warming do? A warmer Earth speeds up the global water   cycle: the exchange of water among the oceans, atmosphere, and land. Higher   temperatures cause more evaporation, and soils will tend to dry out faster.   Increased amounts of water in the atmosphere will mean more rain or snow   overall. We may be seeing the first signs of changes in the water cycle. Since   the beginning of the century, precipitation in the United States has increased   by about 6 percent, while the frequency of intense precipitation events (heavy   downpours of more than two inches per day) has increased by 20 percent. Such   events can cause flooding, soil erosion, and even loss of life. In some   midcontinental areas, increased evaporation has led to drought because the   heavy rains fell elsewhere.        There is also evidence that ecosystems are reacting to warming. Between   1981 and 1991, the length of the growing season in the northern high latitudes   (between 45 o and 70 o  N) increased by a total of up to   twelve days, as documented by satellite imagery. Greening in spring and summer   occurred up to eight days earlier, and vegetation continued to photosynthesize   an estimated four days longer.       Global mean sea level has risen 4 to 10 inches over the last 100 years,   mainly because water expands when heated. The melting of glaciers, which has   occurred worldwide over the last century, also contributes to the rise.   Formerly frozen soils (permafrost) in the Alaskan and Siberian arctic have also   begun to melt, damaging both ecosystems and infrastructure. Melting and tundra   warming will also lead to decay of organic matter and the release of trapped   carbon and methane, creating an additional source of greenhouse gases.                 Table of Contents           President and First Lady  |  Vice President and Mrs. Gore Record of Progress  |  The Briefing Room Gateway to Government  |  Contacting the White House White House for Kids  |  White House History White House Tours  |  Help  |  Text Only Privacy Statement

The only warmer year was 1998 in which a strong El Nio contributed to higher global temperatures. Land temperatures are projected to be 0.77°C (1.39°F) above average and ocean temperatures 0.41°C (0.74°F) above the 1880-2000 mean. This ranks them as 2nd and 3rd warmest on record respectively.    A weak La Nia persisted into early 2001 in the tropical Pacific but neutral ENSO conditions developed and were maintained throughout the latter half of the year. Near-normal or weak positive anomalies (El Nio) conditions are  expected to persist  through the early part of 2002.    The projected Northern Hemisphere temperature continues to average near record levels in 2001 at 0.61°C above the long-term average. The Southern Hemisphere also reflects the globally warmer conditions, with a positive anomaly of 0.41°C.    Annual anomalies in excess of 1.0°C (1.8°F) were widespread across North America and much of Europe and the Middle East.    *Values for 2001 include an estimate of global temperatures for December. Updated values for 2001 will be available in mid January 2002.       **The 1880-2000 average combined land and ocean annual temperature is 13.9°C (56.9°F), the annually averaged land temperature for the same period is 8.5°C (47.3°F), and the long-term annually averaged sea surface temperature is 16.1°C (60.9°F).                  Temperature Trends          During the past century, global surface temperatures have increased at a rate near 0.6°C/century (1.1°F/century), but this trend has dramatically increased to a rate approaching 2.0°C/century (3.6°F/century) during the past 25 years. There have been two sustained periods of warming, one beginning around 1910 and ending around 1945, and the most recent beginning about 1976. Temperatures during the latter period of warming have increased at a rate comparable to the rates of warming projected to occur during the next century with continued increases of  anthropogenic greenhouse gases.                   Satellite measurements of lower tropospheric temperatures (the lowest 8 kilometers of the Earth's atmosphere) collected since 1979 also indicate warming, but not to the extent shown by surface observations. The adjacent figure shows annual anomalies for both the surface and lower tropospheric temperatures from 1979 to 2001 (excluding Dec of 2001). (Satellite measurements of lower tropospheric temperatures are collected by NOAA's TIROS-N polar-orbiting satellites via the Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU) and adjusted for time-dependent biases by NASA and the  Global Hydrology and Climate Center  at the University of Alabama in Huntsville).        larger image                      larger image       While lower tropospheric temperatures as measured by the MSU indicate increasing temperature over the last 2 decades, stratospheric (14 to 22 km / 9 to 14 miles) temperatures have been decreasing. This is thought to be consistent with the depletion of ozone in the lower stratosphere. The large increase in 1982 was caused by the volcanic eruption of El Chichon, and the increase in 1991 was caused by the eruption of Mt. Pinatubo in the Philippines.             * The annual values for both MSU graphs were calculated by averaging monthly anomaly  values. For all years, 12 monthly anomalies were averaged, except for 2001, where only 11 months of data exist. The full 12 months will be used in the final annual report in mid-January.                Regional Temperatures             larger image      Despite pre-existing La Nia conditions,  global temperatures were above average during 2001. The adjacent figure depicts the warmer than average temperatures that were widespread across much of the United States as well as most of Europe. Temperatures in these regions were 1-3°C (1.8-5.4°F) above the 1961-1990 average. The only widespread area of negative anomalies was across Australia, where temperatures were between 1 and 3°C (1.8-5.4°F) cooler than average.                 Notable temperature extremes during 2001 included one of the harshest winters in decades across Siberia and Mongolia. Extreme minimum temperatures as low as -70°C (-94°F) were observed in the Kemerovo region of Russia during mid-January. High heat affected drought-plagued areas of the Middle East, with maximum temperatures reaching as high as 50°C (122°F) in parts of Pakistan during early May, resulting in dozens of deaths.                 Global Precipitation             larger image      Global precipitation is expected to be below the 1961-1990 average in 2001. A drought which has persisted for nearly 3 years continued in 2001 across Afghanistan, Pakistan and neighboring countries. In Iran alone, estimated agricultural losses approached $2.6 billion (USD). Much of Central America experienced drought during the middle part of the year, which is traditionally the rainy season. Late season tropical activity eased drought in these areas, although drought in Honduras and neighboring regions continued through the latter part of 2001. In Africa, drought in Kenya persisted during 2001, despite one of the wettest Januaries in 40 years. In Australia, drought affected much of Western Australia and parts of Queensland.                 Several typhoons brought excessive rains to parts of southeast Asia, including the southeast coast of China, Taiwan, the Philippines and Vietnam. Monsoon rains in southeast Asia promoted extensive flooding along the Mekong Delta with at least several hundred deaths between August and October. Across Siberia, spring rains and a rapid thaw brought flooding across a vast area from the Ural Mountains to the Russian Far East, with some of the worst flooding in the Sakha region along the Lena River. A third consecutive year of spring flooding along the Tisza River in Hungary displaced tens of thousands of people from their homes, with the Tisza rising to its highest level in 100 years by early March.

Abstract: During the NOAA OGP-funded project ""Homogeneous blended wind data over the contiguous United States"" we (NCDC) compiled an hourly wind data set from 1655 stations over the lower 48 states for the period of record (up to year 2000), collected and digitized the station metadata related to the history of the anemometer elevation at most of these stations, and blended the station records with historical snow on the ground information. All this has allowed us to generate homogeneous time series of wind speed at the 10-meter height above the ground/surface for the entire period of digital record (usually, since 1948 for the First Order Stations, since early 1970s for other sites with complete metadata, and since the ASOS implementation at the sites without metadata). We noted that anemometer elevations throughout the U.S. stations varied widely with time. During the past 60 years, there were up to 12 significant anemometer height changes at some of these stations, and on average there was one change per decade at any station with more than 10 years of record. For example, at Los Angeles International Airport the anemometer height changed 4 times during the past sixty years, varying from 59 ft to 20 ft, while at Edwards Air Force Base, the anemometer height was changed 10 times and varied from 13 to 75 ft. Therefore, the elevation homogenization of the near-surface wind time series is a necessary pre-requisite for any climatological assessments. In this process we were using the formulae: U U 10g 10s  = =  Ua log[(10-Hsnod)/z0]/log[(Ha  Hsnod)/z0], and Ua log[10/z0]/log[(Ha  Hsnod)/z0],  where z0 is the surface roughness (a function of the presence of snow cover at the site); Hsnod is the snow depth; Ha is the anemometer height above the ground; Ua is the wind speed at the anemometer height, U10g is the speed at 10 meters above the ground, and U10s is the speed at 10 meters above the surface. The left panel of Figure 1 shows the map of those stations for which we were able to perform the homogenization for the period of record. The right panel of Figure 1 shows the stations for which the homogenization for the pre-ASOS era was impossible due to the absence of metadata (blue dots), and those stations for which any instrument metadata are absent in the NCDC archives. Figure 2 provides general information about the data availability in the archive.

Annual variations of the number of stations with valid data in the archive and the mean percent of valid hourly data available at these stations. A station was considered present in a given year when it has at least 300 valid hourly wind speed values. Stations that do not have at least 1000 valid hourly records during the entire 1931-2000 period were skipped in this graph (90 of them, including 37 stations with metadata). 2. Element Names and Definitions:  The first group of files contains station metadata: ""US_1657stns.lst"" ""US_1657stns.lst_expanded"" ""metadata_NCDC_stn.lst"" ""exist-metadata_files"" ""anem_elev_inf"". The original list of stations with hourly information is collected in files ""US_1657stns.lst"" and ""US_1657stns.lst_expanded"". The format of these two files is similar except: File ""US_1657stns.lst"" contains supplementary text information in lines after 1662 and in positions after 70 that identify composite stations and provides some additional information on how these stations were handled. The first four lines in ""US_1657stns.lst"" have clarification information about the column meanings, and the last lines (after line 1662) have comments related to different merging steps that were made to several station files during their pre-processing. File ""US_1657stns.lst_expanded"" does not contain this information and has strictly 1657 lines with information (line per station). It (a) has an additional bit of information in the end of each line (blank, or '1') that indicates if the station was in DSI-3280 for at least part of the period ('1' stays for ""yes"" in this inquiry) (b) shows first and last years with the data for a given station, (c) shows a regional partition of the station within the contiguous U.S. (1 through 9) used in Groisman et al.

File ""elev_NCDC_stns"" contains information about the dates of the anemometer elevation changes for all stations with complete metadata digitized at NCDC. The same structure of the anemometer elevation information files was generated for the 260 U.S. first order stations of contiguous U.S. and Alaska [file ""elev_1st_order_stns""] and for USAF and Navy stations metadata files ""elev_air_force_stns"" and ""elev_navy_stns"". Finally, all this elevation information was combined into the file ""merge_anem_elev_inf.OUT"" in the order of preference (trustworthiness): First are ""elev_1st_order_stns"", then are ""elev_NCDC_stns"", then ""elev_navy_stns"" and ""elev_air_force_stns"". A separate file with duplicate information ""metadata_files_duplicates"" was generated and was used to verify the metadata information about the anemometer elevation that comes from different sources. The discrepancies in this information were analyzed and corrected. Variables included are as follows: For each station a line of information contains: The extended (six-character) WMO station number; The number of changes at the station; Up to 30 groups of changes: Date of change: Year, month, day A new anemometer elevation in feet. If the anemometer elevation is not known then it is indicated to be 999.0. If it is known that the AWOS installation was implemented but the anemometer elevation was not reported, then it was assumed to be 10 m (or 33 ft). Complete information about the anemometer elevation at all U.S. ASOS sites was kindly provided by Richard Parry (NOAA/NESDIS). When unknown elevation or day of change were found within the station history record when valid wind speed data exist, the following assumptions were used: (1) If the day of change is If the station became an Automatic Weather Observing station (AWOS, usually around 1990) and later was converted to an ASOS site, then only ASOS type is indicated by a four-character abbreviation ""ASOS"" or ""ASOs"".  : :  6:   not known, it is set to the 15th of the month. (2) During the processing of the metadata file for each station, we assumed that the anemometer elevation prior to the first and after the last record of its changes remain the same as indicated in these first and last records respectively. (3) When adjusting wind speed values for the period with unknown anemometer elevation (999.0), it was assumed to be typical for the year when the change to this unknown elevation was documented: 50 feet (year<1951), 20 feet (1959< year <1995), and 30 feet otherwise.

Known Uncorrected Problems:  We found that the data with several WMO identifiers can be merged together because they are from the same location or from a site that had a small  : :  7:   relocation. The merging has been performed and all composite stations are listed in file ""US_1657stns.lst"" at the last lines (those after 1664). The same file has alternative IDs with the word ""merging"" in the line with composite stations starting from 70th position. The presence of merged time series should not be considered as a problem per se. But, we sometimes could not trace any logic in partition of data from single station between different WMO station IDs: in some cases originally, different hours of the same day were found in different files. Several stations with different WMO IDs have the same WBAN numbers, which indicates that they also could be merged. We found that all but three of these stations have data from different periods of time often with a lengthy interval of ""no data"" between these periods. Only one pair represents a distinctively different neighbor locations. The list of these stations (grouped in pairs with the same WBAN numbers) is below. This list was retrieved from file ""US_1657stns.lst_expanded"", preserves its structure, and is followed with a short line with commentaries when it is appropriate. 1 690070 FORT ORD/FRITZSCHE& CA -121.77 36.68 41 93217 043186 1 724916 FORT ORD/FRITZSCHE CA -121.77 36.68 41 93217 043186 OVERLAP.

The user is strongly recommended not to neglect these flags. ASOS issues. An important homogeneity issue, which has not yet been resolved, was an assessment of the changes in extreme wind speeds with transition to ASOS. This issue is additionally complicated with an algorithm change (socalled firmware 3.0 introduction). This firmware was gradually introduced since 1995. Both ASOS implementation and firmware replacement directly affect the averaging period used in the hourly wind speed evaluation and, while being irrelevant for mean wind speeds (McKee et al. 2000), changes extreme wind speed estimates. We found that the frequencies of calm weather and extreme wind speed were significantly affected after the ASOS implementation. We also found that the ASOS stations prior to the firmware change (the exact date of which is not always well known) behave quite differently compared to the postfirmware change period as well as with the same period but at the non-ASOS stations. Thus we recommend excluding these data from any possible change assessments that involve extreme and low wind analyses. Prior to winter 1948-1949, the cooperative stations is sparse therefore, we often had to use (described in Abstract) instead derive the 10-meter wind speed snow on the ground information from U.S. everywhere except the Midwestern U.S. and, long-term snow climatology in our formulae of actual daily snow depth information to (variables Sp10 and Sp_surf).  When the day of the anemometer height change was not known (but month and year were shown), it was assumed to be the 15th of this month. Furthermore, in each day of the anemometer height change at each station, we assumed that the change has occurred at 00 LST and used the new height in adjustments of the wind speed to 10 m above the ground/surface. 10. Quality Statement: This data set has undergone extensive quality checks on all parameters, including range checks for wind direction and extreme winds assessment. Questionable data have been flagged. For each state we were originally determined to find at least 10 highest wind speed hourly values that could be used as a benchmark for further quality control of these and forthcoming data as well as for practical use. For this purpose for each state, we selected the ten maximum wind speed values (at the anemometer height) and carefully analyzed them by comparing with the entire suite of weather information during the entire day at the neighboring stations including the wind extreme location. Trajectories of Atlantic hurricanes were also used during this analysis. When we saw that the extreme value is unbelievably high compared to those during the neighboring hours, at the neighboring sites, and under the weather conditions in the area (atmospheric pressure and temperature gradients, cloudiness, weather codes, and presence of hurricane/tropical storm/depression nearby were considered), we flagged this value as ""questionable"" (flag ""Q"") and continued our search for extremes. Quite often during this analysis, we found that the value most probably has a wrong scale (i.e., multiplied by 10) and scaling back will return it to a proper value similar to those in the neighborhood. We flagged these values as  : :  9:   ""with scale-error"" (flag ""S"") and also continued our search for extremes. During this analysis we also looked for pattern of errors and tried to reveal them within the entire station (group of stations) records. It appears that no one among the first ""extremes"" was a true value but a result of some or another type of error. We intended to identify at least 490 extreme wind speed values (10 for each state within the contiguous U.S. but 20 for New Hampshire, where Mt. Washington station represents a group of its own with extremely high winds throughout the entire period of observation) and assign them one of two flags: (1) valid extreme well supported by the neighbor information ""E"" and (2) valid extreme somewhat supported by the neighbor and weather information ""U"". But, prior to identification, we found approximately 7,000 individual wind speed values that were flagged as ""Q"" or ""questionable"" and/or ""S"" or ""with scale-error"". Furthermore, we checked all wind speed values that were above 30 m sec-1 throughout this process because we believe that whatever the maximum is, the speeds above 30 m sec-1 are too damaging and should be also checked. We also had to exclude 16 pieces of hourly information (from week to up to three years of data) from the station data that have multiple errors of unknown origin (e.g., every second day some of hourly records were replaced with very high wind speed, let say, 30 m/sec, from a given direction (always the same) that is accompanied with negative temperatures (even in summer). These types of errors were discovered mostly on unmanned stations. About eighty wrong extreme wind speed values were discovered in the data originated from DSI-3280, while the bulk of others came from the DATSAV3 data stream. This was expected because of the highest standards of quality assessment used in the DSI-3280 data stream. However, it also should be noted that DSI-3280 represent only ~15% of the stations (also they provide the longest time series) in our data collection. Quality flags are an integral part of each individual wind speed value in the archive. 11. Essential Companion Datasets: None. But, acquaintance with documentation in DSI-3280 and DSI-3505 would be helpful. 12. References:  Court, A. 1953: Wind extremes as design factors. J. Franklin. Inst., 256, No.1, 39-55.

Chou                 Finding the Missing Piece          in the Climate Change Puzzle                 An Elusive Transformation—The          Mystery of Oscillating Neutrinos                 Toward a Common Data Model          for Supercomputing         Into          the Vortex—New Insights into the Behavior of Dynamic Fluids                 Patents                 Awards                                                                                                                             ONE  of                the most controversial scientific issues is determining the causes                of the gradual warming of Earth’s atmosphere over the past                century, especially the last 50 years. Lawrence Livermore scientists                have been among the leaders in modeling global climate change to                better understand the nature of the warming, to predict the probable                climate in the coming decades, and to determine the role of anthropogenic                (human) activity in climate change.                 Until                recently, the most important factor in global climate change appeared                to be the steady accumulation of greenhouse gases, mainly produced                by the burning of fossil fuels in cars, factories, and power plants.                These greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, are                known to trap sunlight and thereby warm the atmosphere.                 Close                observations of global temperature records over the past 50 years                have shown less global warming than predicted by computer models                that include only accumulations of greenhouse gases. The explanation                for this apparent discrepancy is that increasing concentrations                of anthropogenic aerosols in the atmosphere may be cooling the planet                and so partially counteracting the effects from the greenhouse gases.                 In the                past 10 to 15 years, scientists have also begun to consider how                aerosols, microscopic particles directly suspended in the atmosphere                or trapped in clouds, may be changing the planet’s climate.                Beginning in the early 1990s, calculations showed that aerosols                composed of sulfates (a form of sulfuric acid and a main component                of air pollution) could be cooling the atmosphere by backscattering                incoming solar radiation. The process works in much the same manner                as volcanic eruptions, which spew many tons of sulfates into the                higher atmosphere that eventually result in the cooling of Earth’s                climate. (See the box below.)                                                                                                                                                 Aerosols:                            A Short Primer                                                                                                                                                     Aerosols are concentrations of exceedingly minute particles                            suspended in the atmosphere. Aerosol particles range                            in size from 0.01 micrometer (millionth of a meter)                            to several tens of micrometers in diameter. Particles                            generated by pollution tend to be less than a millimeter                            in diameter.                             The particles                            enter the atmosphere from many different natural and                            anthropogenic (human activity–related) sources.                            For example, nature generates sulfate aerosols from                            volcanoes, salt aerosols from sea spray, dust aerosols                            from desert areas, and carbonaceous aerosols formed                            from volatile organic compounds emitted by plants.                             A growing fraction                            of aerosols are byproducts of human activities, as seen                            in the ubiquitous hazes that persist in the industrialized                            regions of the world. Anthropogenic aerosols include                            sulfuric acid, soot and smoke from the burning of fossil                            fuels in factories, vehicles, power plants, cookstoves,                            and fireplaces. The burning of forests and grasslands                            to clear them for farming is another source of carbonaceous                            aerosols. (Although dust is typically considered a natural                            source of aerosols, human activities such as farming                            or erosion caused by changing land use also kick large                            amounts of dust into the atmosphere.)                             Aerosols have                            a significant effect on climate. Whereas greenhouse                            gases trap the Sun’s heat, thereby warming Earth’s                            atmosphere and surface, aerosols mainly reflect solar                            radiation, a phenomenon called the aerosol direct effect.                            By reducing the amount of solar energy reaching the                            Earth’s surface, aerosols serve as agents of climate                            cooling.                             Aerosols also                            cool the climate indirectly, by changing the properties                            of clouds, which cool Earth by reflecting solar radiation                            back to space. (Of the daily average of about 340 watts                            per square meter of solar radiation that reaches the                            atmosphere, clouds reflect about 45 watts per square                            meter.) Although commonly thought of as pristine sources                            of water, clouds could not form without aerosol particles                            (natural or anthropogenic) acting as cloud condensation                            nuclei, which are sites on which water droplets can                            condense.                           Reflecting                            Sunlight, Modifying Rainfall                             Higher concentrations                            of aerosols in the atmosphere lead to the formation                            of clouds with water content spread over many more particles.                            Clouds with smaller, more numerous droplets have a larger                            surface area and therefore reflect up to 30 percent                            more sunlight, a phenomenon called aerosols’ first                            indirect effect. What’s more, the smaller water                            droplets in the cloud fall more slowly, thereby prolonging                            the lifespan of the cloud and strengthening its cooling                            effect. This second indirect effect is believed to be                            changing rainfall patterns in populated regions worldwide.                             Complicating                            the scientific understanding of aerosols’ climatic                            effects are recent satellite observations revealing                            that aerosols of black carbon from biomass and fossil                            fuel burning can absorb sunlight in the atmosphere,                            thereby increasing the warming                                                                                                         effect opf greenhouse gases. Satellite observations                            have also revealed that the absorption of heat by soot                            can evaporate cloud droplets and thus reduce the presence                            of clouds. This phenomenon, called the aerosol semidirect                            effect, is particularly prevalent over heavily polluted                            areas.                              Taken together,                            all of the direct and indirect effects of aerosols are                            believed to increase Earth’s albedo (percentage                            of sunlight reflected), thereby cooling the surface                            and offsetting the warming effects of greenhouse gases                            by 25 to 50 percent globally (and even much more in                            some areas).                              However, aerosols’                            climatic effects cannot be simply compared to those                            of greenhouse gases because they are distributed in                            time and space far differently. For example, greenhouse                            gases are well mixed in the atmosphere and have a lifetime                            of up to 100 years. In contrast, aerosols suspended                            in the troposphere (lower atmosphere) last only about                            a week before they are removed by winds and rain. (The                            exception is the injection of sulfates into the stratosphere,                            or upper atmosphere, where they can remain for a few                            years. The global cooling observed following large volcanic                            eruptions, such as that of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines                            in 1991, provides dramatic evidence for the climatic                            influence of aerosols.)                              Also, many anthropogenic                            aerosols are localized and occur near or downwind from                            their sources, such as power plants, factories, and                            large urban populations. As a result, most aerosols                            are found in the Northern Hemisphere, where most industrialized                            nations are located.                           Instrument                            Data, Models Aid Understanding                              To accurately                            study aerosol distribution and composition requires                            continuous observations from instruments located on                            satellites and aircraft as well as ground-based field                            stations. Data from these instruments, combined with                            numerical models that mimic the formation of aerosols                            and their interactions with clouds, have led to a much                            greater understanding of how and to what degree aerosols                            influence climate. Lawrence Livermore scientists have                            been among the leaders in developing these models.                              Aerosol research                            marked a turning point in January 2002, when more than                            50 leading American atmospheric scientists (including                            Livermore’s Catherine Chuang), together with representatives                            from federal agencies, met to explore ways to achieve                            breakthroughs in understanding and modeling aerosols’                            role in climate change. The meeting led to the formation                            of a national Aerosol Climate Interactions Program supported                            by several federal agencies. The program’s goals                            are to more accurately measure the sources, distribution,                            and properties of aerosols and their influence on climate;                            to more completely model the processes that govern aerosols’                            distributions and climatic effects; and to better quantify                            the relative importance of aerosols and greenhouse gases                            in global warming, including the effects on regional                            climates.                                                                                                                                                                                               Clouds                          could not form without aerosol particles (natural or anthropogenic)                          acting as cloud condensation nuclei or sites on which                          water droplets can condense. Anthropogenic emissions increase                          aerosol concentrations and result in clouds with smaller                          and more numerous droplets. These clouds have a larger                          albedo (percentage of reflected sunlight) and a longer                          lifetime, and thus they reflect more sunlight back into                          space.                                                                                                                         Spotlight on Aerosols                 In the past few years, intriguing data from ground                stations and satellites, together with insight gained from computer                models, have made aerosols a major focus of atmospheric research.                “Ten years ago, the focus was on greenhouse gases. Now aerosols                are getting the attention,” says Livermore atmospheric scientist                Catherine Chuang.                  Chuang notes, however, that                large variations in aerosol concentrations have made it difficult                to confidently assess the magnitude of their effects on climate.                Aerosol chemistry and physics, especially in clouds, are complex                and not completely understood. Particles typically remain aloft                in the troposphere (lower atmosphere) for a week or less, in contrast                to greenhouse gases, which can persist for about a century.                 Because they are short-lived,                aerosols do not mix homogeneously around the planet’s atmosphere,                and so concentrations differ greatly from one region to the next.                What’s more, aerosols come in a wide range of particle sizes,                with particles smaller than a micrometer exerting comparatively                greater climatic effects. As a result, says Chuang, one of the greatest                uncertainties in climatic change is the role played by anthropogenic                aerosols. To reduce these uncertainties, scientists are turning                to sophisticated computer simulations in an attempt to gain insight                into aerosols’ climatic effects.                  During the past few years,                Chuang and colleagues including Joyce Penner (now at the University                of Michigan), Keith Grant, Jane Dignon, Peter Connell, Daniel Bergman,                and Douglas Rotman have used Livermore’s TeraCluster2000 multiparallel                supercomputer and the resources of the National Energy Research                Scientific Computing Center at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory                to model how anthropogenic aerosols affect global and regional climate.                The researchers’ simulations show in unprecedented detail how                aerosols are partially offsetting the effect of global warming and                changing the properties of clouds. In some industrial regions, the                generation of aerosols from fossil fuel combustion and biomass (forest                and grassland) burning may be as important to climate change as                greenhouse gases. Also, climate changes caused by aerosols vary                significantly by season and by region.                 The research team belongs                to the Atmospheric Chemistry and Aerosols Group, part of the Atmospheric                Science Division of Livermore’s Energy and Environment Directorate.                The team’s advanced simulations, whose findings have been corroborated                by field measurements at different geographical locations, build                on Livermore’s expertise in aerosols, climate, chemistry, and                supercomputer simulations. The research has received funding from                the Department of Energy, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,                National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and Laboratory Directed                Research and Development. The work also contributes to fulfilling                the goals of the federal government’s National Aerosol Climate                Interactions Program, an interagency effort created last year.                 Chuang explains that aerosol                concentrations from natural sources, such as volcanoes, sea spray,                and desert dust storms, are believed to have remained generally                steady over the past century. However, like greenhouse gases, anthropogenic                aerosols have increased markedly since 1950. Based on satellite                data, models, and information on urban and agricultural activities,                scientists believe anthropogenic aerosols currently contribute about                half of the total submicrometer-size aerosols in the atmosphere.                Most of the anthropogenic aerosols are sulfates and carbonaceous                compounds produced by the burning of fossil fuels and biomass.                                                                                                                          Global climate change by greenhouse                      gases and aerosols since 1750. Factors above zero have a warming                      effect; those below zero have a cooling effect. A vertical                      line between two data points indicates scientific uncertainty                      regarding the estimated contribution of a particular factor .                                                                               Solar                Reflection Means Cooling                 When directly suspended in                the atmosphere, most aerosol particles exert a direct cooling effect                on the global climate by scattering sunlight back into space. Aerosols                also exert a significant indirect effect by serving as cloud condensation                nuclei (CCN) for raindrops to form. Increases in CCN result in clouds                with more but smaller droplets, thereby increasing the cloud’s                reflectivity of solar radiation, or albedo. Clouds with numerous                small droplets tend to last longer and so prolong the cooling effect.                 Complicating matters is the                recently discovered influence of black carbon aerosols, such as                soot (incompletely burned carbon), that absorb heat instead of reflecting                it back into space. Black carbon aerosols are particularly prevalent                over parts of Europe, eastern China, and India, where much coal                is burned.                 Beginning in the early 1990s,                Chuang focused first on modeling the direct effects of anthropogenic                sulfate aerosols because they were thought to be the most important                compound involved in pollution over China, Europe, and the eastern                coast of the United States. She then added the contribution from                carbonaceous compounds because of their sizable emission from many                industrialized regions of the Northern Hemisphere and tropical regions                where agricultural burning is prevalent. The simulations also took                into account the solar absorptive properties of black carbon, the                first time this effect had been modeled.                  The simulations showed that                biomass aerosols suspended in the clear sky cool the climate by                between 0.16 and 0.23 watts per square meter, while black carbon                from fossil fuels heats the climate by between 0.16 and 0.20 watts                per square meter. Also, sulfate aerosols cool the atmosphere by                between 0.53 to 0.81 watts per square meter. The sum of the cooling                effects ranges between 0.35 and 0.65 watts per square meter. (To                place these figures in perspective, about 340 watts per square meter                of solar radiation reaches Earth’s atmosphere daily.)                 Chuang’s research then                moved to the vastly more complex task of modeling the indirect effects                of anthropogenic sulfate and carbonaceous aerosols through their                interaction with clouds. These simulations indicated that the indirect                effects of aerosols are greater than the direct effects. The simulations                also showed that aerosols can mask the warming effects of greenhouse                gases, at least in regions with high pollution levels.                                                                                                                                            Aerosols vary greatly from                    region to region. These are predicted annual surface concentrations                    of aerosols (natural and anthropogenic) composed of (a) sulfate,                    (b) organic carbon (in terms of organic matter), (c) black carbon                    from soot, (d) sea salt, and (e) dust particles. The red areas                    indicate maximum concentrations of each type of aerosol.                                                                                                                                                                                          Simulations show the direct                    (that is, without interactions with clouds) climate effects                    of (a) carbonaceous aerosols from biomass burning, (b) carbonaceous                    aerosols from fossil fuel burning, (c) anthropogenic sulfate                    aerosols, and (d) all anthropogenic sources. Note that both                    the fossil fuel and biomass burning release sulfur dioxide,                    which later oxidates to sulfate.                                             Aerosol-Cloud                Interactions                 The                simulations estimated that aerosols acting as CCN cool Earth by                about 1.85 watts per square meter, with 0.30 watts per square meter                associated with anthropogenic sulfate, 1.16 watts per square meter                associated with carbonaceous aerosols from biomass burning, and                0.52 watts per square meter associated with carbonaceous aerosols                from fossil fuel combustion. While concentrations of anthropogenic                carbonaceous aerosols are about equal in the Northern and Southern                hemispheres, aerosols of anthropogenic sulfates are more prominent                in the Northern Hemisphere.                 Also, the simulations showed                that concentrations of aerosols vary with the seasons. The global                average of indirect effects by anthropogenic aerosols is greatest                in April through June, a period when biomass of savanna and forested                areas is burned in the topics. The indirect cooling effect is highest                in May, with 2.4 watts per square meter.                  Chuang also addressed how                black carbon absorption affects solar energy in clouds. She found                that including this absorption does not decrease the overall cooling                effect by more than 0.07 watts per square meter on a global scale,                but that locally, it can decrease the cooling effect by as much                as 0.7 watts per square meter in regions that have significant black                carbon emissions. The model shows that if the effect of black carbon                absorption in clouds is not included, the indirect cooling effect                by carbonaceous aerosols may be overestimated by up to 25 percent                in regions where black carbon emissions are significant.                 The Livermore assessments                were based on a three-dimensional general circulation model called                Community Climate Model-1 (CCM-1), which was developed by the National                Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado. General circulation                models predict global changes that result from changing concentration                of gases by dividing the global atmosphere into tens of thousands                of boxes and using the equations describing motion, energy, and                mass to predict the changes in climate. Chuang linked CCM-1 to GRANTOUR,                a three-dimensional global chemistry code for the troposphere, which                was first developed at Livermore in the late 1980s to simulate the                concentration and distribution of aerosols and their gaseous precursors.                 “Both GRANTOUR and CCM-1                were developed more than a decade ago,” notes Chuang. “They                lack advanced physics and modeling techniques that prevent us from                exploring in greater detail the interrelationship between aerosols,                clouds, and climate variation. We believe this interrelationship                is the leading source of uncertainty in predicting future climate                change.”                                                                                                                                            Monthly averages of the indirect                    climatic effect (interactions with clouds) caused by anthropogenic                    (a) carbonaceous aerosols, (b) sulfate aerosols, and (c) total                    carbonaceous and sulfate aerosols. The simulations show the                    wide variation between January and July .                                             New                Era of Modeling                 The research team’s                goal is to move to what Chuang describes as a “new era of modeling”                that will link the most advanced atmospheric chemistry and climate                codes. To that end, last year Chuang and her colleagues added improvements                to Livermore’s integrated, massively parallel atmospheric chemical                transport (IMPACT) code so that it better represents aerosol chemistry                and runs faster on multiparallel supercomputers. IMPACT, which was                previously applied by Livermore researchers to global ozone calculations,                includes both the stratosphere and troposphere and uses databases                of monthly averaged emissions compiled by scientists and government                agencies worldwide to treat global chemistry processes.                  With the recent revisions,                IMPACT can simulate the complicated reactions involving sulfate                aerosols that are formed from sulfur dioxide generated by power                plants and biomass burning. The code can also account for other                sources of sulfates, including the production of dimethylsulfide                by plankton, sulfur dioxide by volcanoes, and hydrogen sulfide by                soils, forests, and crops. The new version of IMPACT also predicts                the concentrations of black carbon and other carbonaceous compounds,                dust, and sea salt as well as their seasonal variations.                 To better represent the ever-changing                size distribution of aerosol particles, Chuang is adapting an aerosol                microphysics module developed at Brookhaven National Laboratory.                The module simulates aerosol dynamics through complicated nucleation,                growth, and transport processes by tracking the lower order moments                of an aerosol size distribution in space and time.                 Chuang plans to link IMPACT                and the new microphysics module with the Community Climate Model-3,                or CCM-3, the fourth-generation model developed by the National                Center for Atmospheric Research. This climate model allows more                realistic and higher resolution simulations of aerosol effects on                regional climate. For example, it can show how aerosols are transported                to different regions by strong winds and removed by rainfall.                 Chuang notes that CCM-3 is                typically used by research centers at 300-kilometer resolution.                Such coarse resolution limits the code’s usefulness because                it does not adequately represent topographic features that strongly                influence surface temperature and precipitation. Much finer resolutions                are required to examine regional climate change and the transport                of aerosols through the atmosphere. Chuang notes that a Livermore                team headed by Philip Duffy has simulated the effects of increased                greenhouse gases by using CCM-3 at 50-kilometer resolution to obtain                the finest resolution of global warming performed to date.

This simulation, using IMPACT,                      shows the percentage of concentrations (averaged on an annual                      basis) from all anthropogenic sources of aerosol .                                                                               Putting              Everything Together               With              all the modeling elements in place, Livermore atmospheric scientists              will be able to simulate early next year the global and regional climate              changes caused by both aerosols and major greenhouse gases. “With              more complete chemistry and physics in our models, we hope to have              more accurate answers about how human activities are affecting our              climate,” Chuang says.               Ultimately, she says, realistic              climate models—augmented by other data—provide the only              viable approach for determining how aerosols are changing the planet’s              climate and for assessing the effects of future emissions. “Models              are the only tools for making predictions about climate change so              that we can help policymakers arrive at the most informed decisions              for responding to changes in the environment.”               She notes that at first glance,              it might seem that aerosols are a positive element because they tend              to counter the effects of global warming. However, purposely allowing              a greater buildup of aerosols to offset global warming would lead              to greater health and ecological damage. Aerosols that affect climate              are associated with air pollution and acid rain, lower visibility,              and decreased agricultural production.               The results from the advanced              Livermore simulations will surely help society as it decides to manage              air pollution, global warming, changing rainfall patterns, and the              unavoidable effects on human health and society.               —Arnie Heller                   Key Words:                aerosols, biomass, black carbon, cloud condensation nuclei (CCN),                Community Climate Model (CCM), dimethylsulfide, global warming,                GRANTOUR, IMPACT, National Center for Atmospheric Research, soot,                sulfate.

PINATUBO ERUPTION PROVIDES A NATURAL TEST FOR THE INFLUENCE OF ARCTIC          CIRCULATION ON CLIMATE         A recent          NASA-funded study has linked the 1991 eruption of the Mount Pinatubo to          a strengthening of a climate pattern called the Arctic Oscillation. For          two years following the volcanic eruption, the Arctic Oscillation caused          winter warming over land areas in the high and middle latitudes of the          Northern Hemisphere, despite a cooling effect from volcanic particles          that blocked sunlight.         One          mission of NASA’s Earth Science Enterprise, which funded this research,          is to better understand how the Earth system responds to human and naturally-induced          changes, such as large volcanic eruptions.         “This          study clarifies the effect of strong volcanic eruptions on climate, important          by itself, and helps to better predict possible weather and short-term          climate variations after strong volcanic eruptions,” said Georgiy          Stenchikov, a researcher at Rutgers University’s Department of Environmental          Sciences, New Brunswick, N.J., and lead author on a paper that appeared          in a recent issue of the Journal of Geophysical Research.         A positive          phase of the Arctic Oscillation has slowly strengthened over the few last          decades and has been associated in prior research with observed climate          warming.         “The          study has important implications to climate change because it provides          a test for mechanisms of the Arctic Oscillation,” Stenchikov said.         A positive          phase of the Arctic Oscillation is associated with strengthening of winds          circulating counterclockwise around the North Pole north of 55°N,          that is, roughly in line with Moscow, Belfast, and Ketchikan, Alaska.          In winter these winds pull more warm air from oceans to continents causing          winter warming, and like a top spinning very fast, they hold a tight pattern          over the North Pole and keep frigid air from moving south.          According          to this research, temperature changes caused by a radiative effect of          volcanic aerosols in two lower layers of the atmosphere, the troposphere          and the stratosphere, can lead to a positive Arctic Oscillation phase.          The troposphere extends from Earth’s surface to an altitude of 7          miles in the polar regions and expands to 13 miles in the tropics. The          stratosphere is the next layer up with the top at an altitude of about          30 miles.         The          study uses a general circulation model developed at the National Oceanic          and Atmospheric Administration’s Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory          to simulate how volcanic aerosols following the Pinatubo eruption impacted          the climate.         In          the troposphere, volcanic aerosols reflect solar radiation and cool the          Earth’s surface, decreasing temperature differences between the equator          and the North Pole in the bottom atmospheric layer. These changes end          up inhibiting processes that slow counterclockwise winds that blow around          the North Pole mostly in the stratosphere. This in turn strengthens a          positive phase of the Arctic Oscillation.         In          the stratosphere, volcanic aerosols absorb solar radiation, warm the lower          stratosphere (about 15 miles above the Earth’s surface) and increase          stratospheric temperature differences between the equator and the North          Pole. These changes strengthen westerly winds in the lower stratosphere          and help to create a positive phase of the Arctic Oscillation.          In          previous research, an observed positive Arctic Oscillation trend has been          attributed to greenhouse warming that led to an increase of stratospheric          temperature differences between equator and pole. But this study finds          that tropospheric temperature change in the course of climate warming          may play an even greater role.         In          one type of computer simulation, Stenchikov and colleagues isolated the          contribution of a decreased temperature difference in the troposphere,          and found that it could produce a positive phase of the Arctic Oscillation          by itself. That’s because greenhouse heating near the North Pole          melts reflective sea ice and snow, and reveals more water and land surfaces.          These surfaces absorb the Sun’s rays and increasingly warm the Earth’s          polar regions. Polar heating at the Earth’s surface lessens the temperature          differences between the equator and North Pole in the troposphere, which          ultimately strengthens a positive phase of the Arctic Oscillation.         The          study also finds that when aerosols get into the stratosphere, very rapid          reactions that destroy ozone (especially in high latitudes) take place          on the surfaces of aerosol particles. When ozone gets depleted, less UV          radiation is absorbed in the stratosphere. This cools the polar stratosphere,          and increases the stratospheric equator-to-pole temperature difference,          creating a positive phase of the Arctic Oscillation. Ozone data were obtained          from NASA’s Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) satellite and          ozonesonde observations.

GX044-19-7238367	2) Stratosphere   Global estimates of lower-stratospheric temperatures are derived from channel-4 of the MSU.  During  1997, the estimated global mean temperature was 0.66°C below the 197995 base period means ( Fig. 7 ).  This was the second lowest value in the 19 year historical record, surpassed only by the record low value recorded in 1996.   Mean annual stratospheric temperatures have grown progressively colder during the 19-yr record, except  for two 2-yr periods in which temperatures were above-normal.  These periods coincide with the eruption of  El Chichon in 1982 and the eruption Mt. Pinatubo in 1991.  Also, global stratospheric temperatures have been  below the long-term mean for the past five years, likely in response to an overall decrease in global ozone  concentrations during the period.  During JanuaryJune, lower-stratospheric temperatures were below average over most of the globe ( Fig. 8a ).  Regions with the largest negative temperature anomalies included the Northern Hemisphere polar region,  the subtropical North Pacific extending eastward across the southern United States, and the Southern  Hemisphere middle latitudes. Substantially warmer than normal temperatures during the period were confined to the  high latitudes of the South Pacific and portions of Antarctica.  Over the high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, wintertime temperatures have averaged well-below  normal for the past three years ( Fig. 9 ). During 1997 extremely low temperatures were observed during  FebruaryApril, when area-mean temperatures for the region north of 60°N averaged more than 9.0°C below normal.  These below-normal temperatures were associated with below normal geopotential heights at 50-hPa everywhere  north of 60°N. The largest anomalies were centered directly over the polar region ( Fig. 10a ), where temperatures  averaged more than 12.0°C below normal and heights averaged more than 600 m below normal.   Collectively, these conditions were associated with an enhanced polar night jet ( Fig. 10b ).  Features of this jet included  an exceptionally strong gradient in the geopotential height field between 60°N and 80°N around the entire  hemisphere, and average zonal wind speeds of 25-35  m s -1 . These conditions contrast with the relatively weak  height gradient and ill-defined zonal wind maximum normally observed throughout the polar region at this time of  the year ( Fig. 10c ).   An additional feature of the polar region during February-March was the large-scale formation of polar  stratospheric clouds in response to extremely cold conditions temperatures.  The presence of these clouds leads to  the chemical destruction of stratospheric ozone, and during March contributed to below-normal ozone  concentrations throughout the Arctic [see  section 2c(1) ].    During JulyDecember, the primary features of the lower stratosphere included above-normal  temperatures over much of the polar region of the Northern Hemisphere and below-normal temperatures over most of  Antarctica. This anomaly pattern is nearly opposite in sign to that observed during January-June, and is  consistent with increased ozone destruction due to polar stratospheric clouds in the Southern Hemisphere polar  region, particularly during July-October.  In the extratropics, many of the anomaly features evident in the lower-stratospheric temperature field  during July-December reflected the stratospheric signature of large-scale circulation anomalies that extended well  into the middle and lower troposphere. For example, the very low temperatures over the high latitudes of the  North Atlantic and Scandinavia, combined with above-average  temperatures in the  lower troposphere ( Fig. 8b ), reflected above-normal tropospheric heights and recurring high-latitude blocking activity throughout the  region [see  section 2b(1) ].  Similarly, the patterns of above-normal temperatures in the lower stratosphere over  the Gulf of Alaska and eastern Siberia reflected the high-altitude signature of persistent, large-amplitude  troughs previously noted in these regions. This overall anomaly pattern across the higher latitudes of the Northern  Hemisphere was remarkably similar to that observed during 1996, a year which also featured recurring blocking  activity across the high latitudes of the North Atlantic (Halpert and Bell 1997, see their  Fig. 9 ).  Over the subtropical North and South Pacific, negative temperature anomalies in the lower stratosphere  during July-December were heavily linked to strong El Niño conditions, and were consistent with abnormally  warm tropospheric temperatures and well-defined anticyclonic circulation anomalies at upper-tropospheric levels.  In the Southern Hemisphere, the pattern of negative lower stratospheric temperature anomalies also delineated  the anticyclonic-shear side of a very strong and extended South Pacific jet stream throughout the period [see  section 3a(4) ].

GX044-33-11525611	"This summer the temperatures were relatively cool in the eastern U.S. but relatively warm in much of the western states. Was the reason for this;     El Nino     the eruption of Mt. Pinutubo      a combination of El Nino & the eruption of Mt. Pinutubo     natural climate variability      world-wide deforestation                   What's going on? - temperatures approaching 100 degrees (F) in Seattle, yet the thermometer struggled to get to 90 degrees in many eastern cities. In Washington, for example, for nearly four weeks in July and August the temperature stayed below 90 degrees!      Even though the tropical rain forest is being chopped-up at an alarming rate, a climatic signal has not yet been detected that is directly related to global deforestation. When trees are removed from an area, the amount of light reaching and reflected by the surface increases (higher albedo), and the amount of moisture transferred to the atmosphere (evapotranspiration) decreases. Also, when forests are removed , there's an increase in the amount of trace gases, (methane, carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide) released into the atmosphere. All of these things can have an impact on the world's weather and climate, however, there's no evidence to suggest that this summer's weather resulted from deforestation or any kind of human activity.        When volcanoes erupt with enough force to send dust and ash into the stratosphere, they may cause a short-term fluctuation of the climate over much of the Earth. Usually, only a handful of volcanoes each century spew enough debris into the Earth's atmosphere to alter the incoming sunlight. Mt. Pinatubo, in the Philippines, was such a volcano. Within a few weeks after the eruption, a cloud of dust, ash and sulfur dioxide circled the globe. These particles and aerosols may remain suspended in the upper atmosphere for several years, often producing glorious sunsets and sunrises. The sulfur dioxide is soon converted to tiny droplets of sulfuric acid which act to scatter or block some of the sunlight trying to reach the surface. This blockage can temporarily cool large areas of the Earth. But Mt. Pinatubo erupted in 1991, and although a cooling of about 2 degrees was observed over much of the U.S. in 1992, in subsequent years (1993-1995), higher temperatures were observed. Anyway, a volcanic eruption should not cause different temperature regimes in the eastern and western U.S.       Perhaps the El Nino is responsible. This is a phenomenon that affects world weather patterns about every four to seven years. In most years, prevailing winds over the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean blow from east to west (from South America towards Indonesia), pushing warmer water into the western Pacific Ocean. In some years, though, the easterly Pacific winds weaken, allowing the warmer waters in the western Pacific to slosh back toward the coast of South America. The arrival of these warmer waters signals the onset of the El Nino, usually around Christmas, hence, the Spanish term, ""El Nino"" (the child). When an El Nino has become established, a sort of domino effect takes place. The now-warmer waters off the coast of Peru displace the normal position of where storms form and thus, which direction they move. This results in a redistribution of energy with accompanying changes in temperature and precipitation patterns over a substantial portion of the globe. But 1996 was not an El Nino year.       There can be, and most often are, variations in climate that can't be attributed to a specific cause, such as volcanic eruptions or the El Nino. This was the case this summer in the U.S. The jet stream (the primary steering current in the upper atmosphere) was more active this summer than in recent summers. In most summers, the jet stream vacations over Canada and only occasionally visits the lower 48 states. So it's easier for the ""Bermuda High"" (a high pressure air mass system centered near the island of Bermuda) to, day after day, pump warm, humid air over the eastern U.S. In the west, in most summers, maritime air from the Pacific keeps much of the west coast reasonably cool. All that changed this summer. On many days in July and August, the jet stream was positioned in such a way that over the west it bulged north into Canada and then in the east dipped back down into New England. This permitted Pacific maritime air to move north over British Columbia, which in turn presented an opportunity for hot air, simmering over the desert southwest, to now and then, expand across much of the Great Basin and all the way north to Washington and Idaho. Over the eastern states, cold fronts prodded on by the jet stream, kept the ""Bermuda High"" at bay. But not all of the eastern U.S. experienced relatively cool weather. Those of you who saw some of the Olympics this summer know that Atlanta and parts of the southeastern states didn't get a reprieve from the oppressive heat.        What made the jet stream more active this summer? Now we move towards the realm of the unknown. Differing sea surface temperatures and sea ice conditions are but two of the things that may trigger the jet stream to wander about the globe in a serpentine fashion. We're a long way yet from being able to predict, with a high degree of certainty, where the jet stream will be positioned from one season to the next.              9/30/96"
GX045-88-8596869	"NOAA      News  ||  NOAA Home Page                PATTERNS OF GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE OVER RECENT CENTURIES REPORTED      BY NOAA AND UNIVERSITY SCIENTISTS          November 21, 2000 — For the first      time, year-by-year patterns of global temperature over the past      few centuries have now been revealed. Evidence from ice cores,      tree rings, corals, historical records and sediments in lakes      was used by a team of university and  NOAA       scientists to obtain the yearly maps, extending the history of      global climate to a time before people began taking measurements      with weather instruments.          Writing in the online journal      Earth Interactions, the scientists note that their work highlights      periods of unusual climatic conditions, such as the period of      ""dry fogs"" that were reported by Benjamin Franklin      in the 1780s. The new study shows that the hazy conditions Franklin      described from his home (at that time, in Paris) were related      to a cold episode that affected all of Europe for several years      following the eruption of a volcano in Iceland (Laki) in 1784.      Other major eruptions have had similar climatic effects. After      the eruption of Tambora in Indonesia in 1815, temperatures in      North America and Europe fell sharply, and cool conditions prevailed      for several years.          The current study provides      an interactive database that can be used to examine maps of global      temperature patterns for any year since 1730. These are based      on natural archives such as ice cores, tree-rings, lake sediments,      and corals, which record seasonal or annual climate conditions.      Data from the natural archives were calibrated by the instrumental      surface temperature data available during the 20th century.          The study also provided a longer-term      view of temperatures across the northern hemisphere. ""The      best evidence, based on the extension of hemispheric climate      reconstructions back a full millennium is that late 20th century      conditions are probably warmer than those which prevailed any      time this millennium,"" the scientists wrote. They noted      that conditions during the 11th through 14th centuries appear      warmer than those which prevailed during the 15th through 19th      centuries in general.          The scientists also studied      the statistical relationship between variations in the northern      hemisphere mean temperatures and estimates of the histories of      solar, greenhouse gas, and volcanic factors. ""While the      natural—solar and volcanic—forcings appear to be important      factors governing the natural variations of temperatures in past      centuries, only human greenhouse gas forcing alone....can statistically      explain the unusual warmth of the past few decades,"" they      wrote.

Research and Data Systems Corporation                 Concerns of global ozone depletion (e.g. WMO, 1999) have led to major international       programs to monitor and explain the observed ozone variations in the stratosphere. In       response to these, as well as other long-term climate concerns, NOAA has established       routine monitoring programs utilizing both ground-based and satellite measurement       techniques (OFCM, 1988).                Selected indicators of stratospheric climate are presented in each Summary from       information contributed by NOAA personnel. A Summary for the Northern Hemisphere is issued       each April, and for the Southern Hemisphere, each December. These Summaries are available       on the World- Wide-Web, at the site                 http:/ /www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov                with location:  products/stratosphere/winter_bulletins .

For 2001, the area covered by            extremely low total ozone values of less than 220 Dobson Units, defined as the Antarctic “ozone hole”,            was the third largest on record for October and November.  The ozone hole reached maximum size in September            and remained large through early October, then gradually decreased in size and ended in early December.             October anomalies of greater than  40 percent below the 1979-1986 base period were observed over Antarctica,            with negative anomalies of more than 10 percent also observed over southern South America.  Vertical            profiles of ozone amounts measured by balloons over the South Pole at the end of September and early            October 2001 showed essentially total destruction of ozone in the 15-20 km region, similar to observations            during other recent years. The minimum total ozone value of 101 Dobson Units, observed on October 4, 2001 at            the South Pole, was not as low as the record low value of 86 DU observed in 1993.  Lower stratosphere            temperatures over the Antarctic region in 2001 were again  low.  Temperatures below -78 C ( sufficiently low            for polar stratospheric cloud formation) occurred over a large region, thus promoting chemical  ozone loss.             At northern mid-latitudes, extensive ozone destruction was observed in the years following the massive            eruption of the Pinatubo volcano (approximately 1992-1996), with smaller losses observed in the past few years.             Uncertainties in the estimates of future ozone depletion include possible coupling to changes in water vapor            and carbon dioxide.  However, in the absence of further major eruptions, ozone depletion over much of the            globe is not expected to worsen substantially in the coming decade, because international actions have been            successful in reducing the release of ozone-depleting substances.         I.  DATA RESOURCES                  The data used for this report are listed below. This combination of complementary data,       from different platforms and sensors, provides a strong capability to monitor global ozone       and temperature.

Solar Backscatter Ultra-Violet (SBUV) instruments can produce data only for daylight-viewing conditions, so SBUV/2 data are not available at polar latitudes during winter darkness.  Increasing loss of NOAA-11 data at sub-polar latitudes from 1989 to1993 was caused by satellite precession, resulting in SBUV/2 viewing high latitudes only in darkness.  Recent NOAA-11 and NOAA-16 total ozone data have not yet been fully validated.  This impacts trends determined for the recent period.         II.  DISCUSSION             Figure 1  displays monthly average anomaly values (percent) of  zonal mean total ozone, as a function of latitude and time, from January 1979 to November 2001.  The anomalies are derived relative to each month's 1979-2001 average. Certain aspects of  long-term global ozone changes may be readily seen.  In the polar regions, ozone values have been substantially lower in the 1990s than in the 1980s.  Largest anomalies are shown for the polar regions in each hemisphere in winter-spring months, with positive anomalies of more than 10 percent in the earlier years changing to negative anomalies of greater than 10 percent for most recent years.  In September 2001, around 75 degrees south latitude, negative anomalies exceeded 26 percent (more than 52 percent lower than in earlier years), and were about 20 percent lower than average in October and November 2001.  At  midlatitudes, the anomalies also change from largely positive in the early years to negative in the 1990s.  Little or no significant trend is seen over the tropical region, but alternating years of positive and negative anomalies are seen, as part of a quasi-biennial oscillation.  At the end of  2001, positive anomalies were evident in the tropical region.       A map of monthly average  Southern Hemisphere SBUV/2 total ozone for October 2001 is  shown in  Figure 2 , with lowest ozone values displaced from the pole.   ""Ozone hole"" values  (defined as total ozone values less than 220) are shown over the South Atlantic sector of the Antarctic continent, with highest ozone over the Antarctic sector near the international dateline.   Figure 3  shows the difference in percent between the monthly mean total ozone for October 2001 and eight (1979-86) monthly means for October (Nagatani et al., 1988).  Negative anomalies in total ozone of up to 40 percent are shown over the South Atlantic sector of the Antarctic continent, and more than 10  percent below average values are also evident over southern South America.       Figure 4  compares for each year since 1979 the ozone hole area average for all days in October through November.   The growth in the ozone hole area  from the 1980s to the 1990s is quite apparent.  From a very small area in 1982, October-November average values increased dramatically to a maximum in 1998 of 16.2 million square kilometers. The October-November 2001 average ozone hole area value was 15.9 million square kilometers, much larger than the ozone hole area in 2000, and only a little smaller than the two previous  years.  September data for all years were not included for this calculation because SBUV/2 data over the South Polar region were not available in early September for years 1992, 1993, and 1995.      The center of the ozone hole, and associated lowest ozone, is often located close to the South Pole.   Figure 5  shows a time series during 2001 of ozone profiles  over the South Pole, measured using balloon-borne ozone instruments.  The appearance of anomalously low  ozone hole values is seen to begin in mid August, with extremely low values evident at the end of September  and in early October.  The  ozone destruction, especially in the 15 to 20 km region, is dramatic.    Figure 6  illustrates the change in ozone profiles measured  at the South Pole.  On 4 October 2001, 101 DU total column ozone amount was observed, the minimum value  for the year 2001.  This is compared with the profile on 8 July, with total ozone amount of 271 DU.  The decrease in total ozone between these two dates is 62 percent.  The 4 October profile shows nearly  complete destruction of ozone between 14 and 20 km.  The figure also shows the  region where temperatures  on 4 October were lower than -78 C.  In the region of low temperatures and chemical ozone depletion from  enhanced human produced chlorine and bromine, the 4 October profile shows markedly less ozone than the profile of 8 July.  This clearly demonstrates the value of vertical profile information in helping to understand the ozone depletion phenomenon and the processes responsible for changes in the total column amounts.         Figure 7  presents a time series at the South Pole of total column ozone, integrated from balloon-borne ozone measurements.  Minimum ozone amounts at the South Pole Station in 2001 are seen at the end of September and in early October.    Total ozone values were not as low during September as values for this time period for 2000, but values remained very low longer in 2001 than in 2000.  The extremely low total ozone values in early September likely reflected ozone depleted air which had previously been exposed to sunlight prior to moving over the South Pole.      Antarctic ozone depletion has occurred primarily between the altitudes of 12 and 20 km.  This is a region where polar stratospheric clouds form.   Figure 8  shows 12-20 km column ozone integrated from the balloon-borne ozone measurements at the South Pole. In 2001 the values were generally as low as in any previous year.  Large depletion rates are expected for the next decade or more, after which declining stratospheric chlorine amounts should result in slow recovery of stratospheric ozone.         Ozone amounts in the lower stratosphere are closely coupled to temperatures through dynamics and photochemistry.  Extremely low stratospheric temperatures (lower than -78 C) over the Antarctic region are believed to contribute to depletion of ozone, in that  low temperatures lead to the presence of polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs).  PSCs enhance the production and lifetime of reactive chlorine, leading to ozone depletion  (WMO, 1999).  Daily minimum temperatures over the polar region, 65S to 90S at 50 hPa (approximately 19 km) are shown in  Figure 9 .    For most of the southern hemisphere winter 2001, minimum temperatures in the polar region were low, but not near record low values.  However, minimum temperatures in late September, October and November were near record lows.  Minimum temperatures were sufficiently low (lower than -78 C) during May to November for polar stratospheric clouds to form and allow enhanced ozone depletion, in the presence of sunlight.   Figure 10  shows monthly average temperature anomalies at 50 hPa for three latitude regions, 25N-25S, 25S-65S, and 65S-90S.  For the polar region, temperatures for  October and November were 3 to 4 C  lower than the long-term average.  Negative temperature anomalies also predominated over the middle and tropical latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere.        Figure 11  presents time series of the area of the ozone hole, the size of the polar vortex, and the size of the polar area where lower stratosphere temperatures were below -78C.  The 2001 values are shown along with the average daily values and the maximum and minimum daily values for the most recent 10 years.  During 2001 the area for all three of these indicators was larger than average.  Indeed the ozone hole area and the polar vortex area were among the largest of recent years.      Figure 12  illustrates the direct relationship between the persistence of the ozone hole region and the persistence of the Antarctic polar vortex.  In years when the winter polar vortex persisted later in the season, the duration into the Spring season of the ozone hole also tended to be extended.  For the year 2001, the persistence of the ozone hole and the persistence of the Southern Hemisphere polar vortex were among the greatest for the years since 1982.  Indeed, 5 out of the most recent 7 years have had the longest duration of winter vortex and ozone hole.                            III.  CONCLUDING REMARKS           Very low ozone values were observed over Antarctica again in 2001.   Ozone depletion of 10 percent to more than 40 percent was observed over Antarctica compared to total ozone amounts observed in the early 1980's.  Vertical soundings over the South Pole during late September and early October 2001 again showed complete destruction of ozone at altitudes between 15 and 20 km.  Lower stratosphere temperatures in the winter and spring of 2001 over the Antarctic region were below average values, and were sufficiently low for ozone production of polar stratospheric clouds within the polar vortex.   The ozone hole area and the PSC area were again among the largest of all previous years.   For the year 2001, the ozone hole and Southern Hemisphere polar vortex persisted into December,  again among the longest duration of years since 1982.       Observations of chloroflourocarbons and of stratospheric hydrogen chloride support the view that international actions are reducing the use and release of ozone depleting substances (WMO, 1999; Anderson et al., 2000).  However, chemicals already in the atmosphere are expected to continue to deplete ozone for many decades to come.  Further, changing atmospheric conditions that modulate ozone can complicate the task of detecting the start of ozone layer recovery.  The eruption of the Pinatubo volcano provided an example of such a complication in the 1990s.  Based on an analysis of 10 years of South Pole ozone vertical profile measurements, Hofmann et al., (1997) estimated that recovery in the Antarctic ozone hole may be detected as early as the coming decade.  Indicators include: 1) an end to springtime ozone depletion at 22-24 km, 2) 12-20 km mid-September column ozone loss rate of less than 3 DU per day, and 3) a 12-20 km ozone column of more than 70 DU on September 15.  However, an intriguing aspect of recent observations of the Antarctic stratosphere is the apparent trend towards a later breakup of the vortex, as shown in Figure 12.  A full explanation of such meteorological anomalies is not yet available.  Continued monitoring and measurements, including total ozone and its vertical profile, are essential to achieving the understanding needed to identify ozone recovery.

Research and Data Systems Corporation                 Concerns of global ozone depletion (e.g. WMO, 1999) have led to major international       programs to monitor and explain the observed ozone variations in the stratosphere. In       response to these, as well as other long-term climate concerns, NOAA has established       routine monitoring programs utilizing both ground-based and satellite measurement       techniques (OFCM, 1988).                Selected indicators of stratospheric climate are presented in each Summary from       information contributed by NOAA personnel. A Summary for the Northern Hemisphere is issued       each April, and for the Southern Hemisphere, each December. These Summaries are available       on the World- Wide-Web, at the site                 http:/ /www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov                with location:  products/stratosphere/winter_bulletins .

Gelman           NOAA Climate Prediction Center          5200 Auth Road          Camp Springs, MD 20746-4304          Telephone: (301) 763-8071, ext. 7558          Fax: (301) 763-8125          E-mail:  melvyn.gelman@noaa.gov         ABSTRACT           An area of extensive ozone depletion was observed over Antarctica during the Southern Hemisphere            winter/spring of 2001, as has been the case since about the mid-1980s.  For 2001, the area covered by            extremely low total ozone values of less than 220 Dobson Units, defined as the Antarctic “ozone hole”,            was the third largest on record for October and November.  The ozone hole reached maximum size in September            and remained large through early October, then gradually decreased in size and ended in early December.             October anomalies of greater than  40 percent below the 1979-1986 base period were observed over Antarctica,            with negative anomalies of more than 10 percent also observed over southern South America.  Vertical            profiles of ozone amounts measured by balloons over the South Pole at the end of September and early            October 2001 showed essentially total destruction of ozone in the 15-20 km region, similar to observations            during other recent years. The minimum total ozone value of 101 Dobson Units, observed on October 4, 2001 at            the South Pole, was not as low as the record low value of 86 DU observed in 1993.  Lower stratosphere            temperatures over the Antarctic region in 2001 were again  low.  Temperatures below -78 C ( sufficiently low            for polar stratospheric cloud formation) occurred over a large region, thus promoting chemical  ozone loss.             At northern mid-latitudes, extensive ozone destruction was observed in the years following the massive            eruption of the Pinatubo volcano (approximately 1992-1996), with smaller losses observed in the past few years.             Uncertainties in the estimates of future ozone depletion include possible coupling to changes in water vapor            and carbon dioxide.  However, in the absence of further major eruptions, ozone depletion over much of the            globe is not expected to worsen substantially in the coming decade, because international actions have been            successful in reducing the release of ozone-depleting substances.         I.  DATA RESOURCES                  The data used for this report are listed below. This combination of complementary data,       from different platforms and sensors, provides a strong capability to monitor global ozone       and temperature.                  Method of Observation                                        Parameter               Ground-Based             Satellite/Instrument                                   Total Ozone             Dobson             NOAA/ SBUV/2                                                          Nimbus-7/SBUV                                  Ozone Profiles             Balloon-Ozonesonde              NOAA/ SBUV/2                                                          Nimbus-7/SBUV                                 Temperature Profiles             Balloon - Radiosonde             NOAA/TOVS                                        We have used total column ozone data from the NASA Nimbus-7  SBUV instrument from 1979 through February1985; NOAA-9 SBUV/2  from March 1985 to December 1989; NOAA-11 SBUV/2 from January 1989 to December 1993; NOAA-9 SBUV/2  from January 1994 to December 1995; NOAA-14 SBUV/2 from January 1996 to June 1998; NOAA-11 SBUV/2 from July 1998 to September 2000; and NOAA-16 SBUV/2 from October 2000.  Solar Backscatter Ultra-Violet (SBUV) instruments can produce data only for daylight-viewing conditions, so SBUV/2 data are not available at polar latitudes during winter darkness.  Increasing loss of NOAA-11 data at sub-polar latitudes from 1989 to1993 was caused by satellite precession, resulting in SBUV/2 viewing high latitudes only in darkness.  Recent NOAA-11 and NOAA-16 total ozone data have not yet been fully validated.  This impacts trends determined for the recent period.         II.  DISCUSSION             Figure 1  displays monthly average anomaly values (percent) of  zonal mean total ozone, as a function of latitude and time, from January 1979 to November 2001.  The anomalies are derived relative to each month's 1979-2001 average. Certain aspects of  long-term global ozone changes may be readily seen.  In the polar regions, ozone values have been substantially lower in the 1990s than in the 1980s.  Largest anomalies are shown for the polar regions in each hemisphere in winter-spring months, with positive anomalies of more than 10 percent in the earlier years changing to negative anomalies of greater than 10 percent for most recent years.  In September 2001, around 75 degrees south latitude, negative anomalies exceeded 26 percent (more than 52 percent lower than in earlier years), and were about 20 percent lower than average in October and November 2001.  At  midlatitudes, the anomalies also change from largely positive in the early years to negative in the 1990s.  Little or no significant trend is seen over the tropical region, but alternating years of positive and negative anomalies are seen, as part of a quasi-biennial oscillation.  At the end of  2001, positive anomalies were evident in the tropical region.       A map of monthly average  Southern Hemisphere SBUV/2 total ozone for October 2001 is  shown in  Figure 2 , with lowest ozone values displaced from the pole.   ""Ozone hole"" values  (defined as total ozone values less than 220) are shown over the South Atlantic sector of the Antarctic continent, with highest ozone over the Antarctic sector near the international dateline.   Figure 3  shows the difference in percent between the monthly mean total ozone for October 2001 and eight (1979-86) monthly means for October (Nagatani et al., 1988).  Negative anomalies in total ozone of up to 40 percent are shown over the South Atlantic sector of the Antarctic continent, and more than 10  percent below average values are also evident over southern South America.       Figure 4  compares for each year since 1979 the ozone hole area average for all days in October through November.   The growth in the ozone hole area  from the 1980s to the 1990s is quite apparent.  From a very small area in 1982, October-November average values increased dramatically to a maximum in 1998 of 16.2 million square kilometers. The October-November 2001 average ozone hole area value was 15.9 million square kilometers, much larger than the ozone hole area in 2000, and only a little smaller than the two previous  years.  September data for all years were not included for this calculation because SBUV/2 data over the South Polar region were not available in early September for years 1992, 1993, and 1995.      The center of the ozone hole, and associated lowest ozone, is often located close to the South Pole.   Figure 5  shows a time series during 2001 of ozone profiles  over the South Pole, measured using balloon-borne ozone instruments.  The appearance of anomalously low  ozone hole values is seen to begin in mid August, with extremely low values evident at the end of September  and in early October.  The  ozone destruction, especially in the 15 to 20 km region, is dramatic.    Figure 6  illustrates the change in ozone profiles measured  at the South Pole.  On 4 October 2001, 101 DU total column ozone amount was observed, the minimum value  for the year 2001.  This is compared with the profile on 8 July, with total ozone amount of 271 DU.  The decrease in total ozone between these two dates is 62 percent.  The 4 October profile shows nearly  complete destruction of ozone between 14 and 20 km.  The figure also shows the  region where temperatures  on 4 October were lower than -78 C.  In the region of low temperatures and chemical ozone depletion from  enhanced human produced chlorine and bromine, the 4 October profile shows markedly less ozone than the profile of 8 July.  This clearly demonstrates the value of vertical profile information in helping to understand the ozone depletion phenomenon and the processes responsible for changes in the total column amounts.         Figure 7  presents a time series at the South Pole of total column ozone, integrated from balloon-borne ozone measurements.  Minimum ozone amounts at the South Pole Station in 2001 are seen at the end of September and in early October.    Total ozone values were not as low during September as values for this time period for 2000, but values remained very low longer in 2001 than in 2000.  The extremely low total ozone values in early September likely reflected ozone depleted air which had previously been exposed to sunlight prior to moving over the South Pole.      Antarctic ozone depletion has occurred primarily between the altitudes of 12 and 20 km.  This is a region where polar stratospheric clouds form.   Figure 8  shows 12-20 km column ozone integrated from the balloon-borne ozone measurements at the South Pole. In 2001 the values were generally as low as in any previous year.  Large depletion rates are expected for the next decade or more, after which declining stratospheric chlorine amounts should result in slow recovery of stratospheric ozone.         Ozone amounts in the lower stratosphere are closely coupled to temperatures through dynamics and photochemistry.  Extremely low stratospheric temperatures (lower than -78 C) over the Antarctic region are believed to contribute to depletion of ozone, in that  low temperatures lead to the presence of polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs).  PSCs enhance the production and lifetime of reactive chlorine, leading to ozone depletion  (WMO, 1999).  Daily minimum temperatures over the polar region, 65S to 90S at 50 hPa (approximately 19 km) are shown in  Figure 9 .    For most of the southern hemisphere winter 2001, minimum temperatures in the polar region were low, but not near record low values.  However, minimum temperatures in late September, October and November were near record lows.  Minimum temperatures were sufficiently low (lower than -78 C) during May to November for polar stratospheric clouds to form and allow enhanced ozone depletion, in the presence of sunlight.   Figure 10  shows monthly average temperature anomalies at 50 hPa for three latitude regions, 25N-25S, 25S-65S, and 65S-90S.  For the polar region, temperatures for  October and November were 3 to 4 C  lower than the long-term average.  Negative temperature anomalies also predominated over the middle and tropical latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere.        Figure 11  presents time series of the area of the ozone hole, the size of the polar vortex, and the size of the polar area where lower stratosphere temperatures were below -78C.  The 2001 values are shown along with the average daily values and the maximum and minimum daily values for the most recent 10 years.  During 2001 the area for all three of these indicators was larger than average.  Indeed the ozone hole area and the polar vortex area were among the largest of recent years.      Figure 12  illustrates the direct relationship between the persistence of the ozone hole region and the persistence of the Antarctic polar vortex.  In years when the winter polar vortex persisted later in the season, the duration into the Spring season of the ozone hole also tended to be extended.  For the year 2001, the persistence of the ozone hole and the persistence of the Southern Hemisphere polar vortex were among the greatest for the years since 1982.  Indeed, 5 out of the most recent 7 years have had the longest duration of winter vortex and ozone hole.                            III.  CONCLUDING REMARKS           Very low ozone values were observed over Antarctica again in 2001.   Ozone depletion of 10 percent to more than 40 percent was observed over Antarctica compared to total ozone amounts observed in the early 1980's.  Vertical soundings over the South Pole during late September and early October 2001 again showed complete destruction of ozone at altitudes between 15 and 20 km.  Lower stratosphere temperatures in the winter and spring of 2001 over the Antarctic region were below average values, and were sufficiently low for ozone production of polar stratospheric clouds within the polar vortex.   The ozone hole area and the PSC area were again among the largest of all previous years.   For the year 2001, the ozone hole and Southern Hemisphere polar vortex persisted into December,  again among the longest duration of years since 1982.       Observations of chloroflourocarbons and of stratospheric hydrogen chloride support the view that international actions are reducing the use and release of ozone depleting substances (WMO, 1999; Anderson et al., 2000).  However, chemicals already in the atmosphere are expected to continue to deplete ozone for many decades to come.  Further, changing atmospheric conditions that modulate ozone can complicate the task of detecting the start of ozone layer recovery.  The eruption of the Pinatubo volcano provided an example of such a complication in the 1990s.  Based on an analysis of 10 years of South Pole ozone vertical profile measurements, Hofmann et al., (1997) estimated that recovery in the Antarctic ozone hole may be detected as early as the coming decade.  Indicators include: 1) an end to springtime ozone depletion at 22-24 km, 2) 12-20 km mid-September column ozone loss rate of less than 3 DU per day, and 3) a 12-20 km ozone column of more than 70 DU on September 15.  However, an intriguing aspect of recent observations of the Antarctic stratosphere is the apparent trend towards a later breakup of the vortex, as shown in Figure 12.  A full explanation of such meteorological anomalies is not yet available.  Continued monitoring and measurements, including total ozone and its vertical profile, are essential to achieving the understanding needed to identify ozone recovery.

GX072-54-9269029	November 19, 2003   Volcanic Eruptions May Affect El Niño Onset   A new study by scientists at the University of Virginia (UVa) in Charlottesville and the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in Boulder, Colorado, suggests that explosive volcanic eruptions in the tropics may increase the probability of an El Niño event occurring during the winter following the eruption. The research was funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF).    “The El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is the dominant mode of interannual climate variability on the planet,” says NCAR scientist Caspar Ammann. “When thinking about long-term climate, we must ask whether this system itself undergoes changes, perhaps in response to changes in radiative forcing or in the background climate itself. Our findings, based on two reconstructions, suggest that it indeed might.”    When a volcano erupts in the tropics, its aerosol emissions spread into the stratosphere across the northern and southern hemispheres, reflecting some of the sun’s heat back toward space and thereby cooling the Earth’s atmosphere. This cooling alters the interaction between the oceans and atmosphere, possibly encouraging a warming response in the Pacific Ocean as the massive body of water attempts to restore an initial equilibrium.    “Our results suggest that the atmospheric cooling from an eruption may help nudge the climate system towards producing an El Niño event,” said Michael Mann, an environmental scientist at the University of Virginia. The study results will appear in the November 20 issue of the journal Nature.    “This research illustrates the value of paleoclimate studies that draw on research from disparate fields to uncover connections,” said David Verardo, director of NSF’s paleoclimate program, which funded the research. “Studies of modern climate conditions gleaned from thermometers and barometers can only get you so far. Challenging the conventional wisdom, as this research does, is necessary to achieve a comprehensive understanding of Earth’s climate,” he said.    Some scientists had previously noted that during the 20th century, El Niño eventsthe periodic warming of sea surface temperatures in the equatorial Pacifictended to follow the eruption of volcanoes in the tropics. But that 100-year period, the only time span for which reliable instrumental records were kept, was considered too short a duration to substantiate a link between the two phenomena. The connection was thought to be coincidental. “So we turned to the paleoarchives for a longer history,” Mann said. “We actually didn’t expect the relationship to hold up in the long run.”    The scientists instead found that, when looking back over a 350-year period, as far back as paleorecords allow, there was credible evidence that volcanic activity in the tropics may play a significant role in the occurrence of El Niño events. “We now have a long record showing that the relationship between volcanic eruptions and an increased probability of El Niño events continues to hold up over several centuries,” Mann said. “It’s probably not just a fluke.”    Mann, Ammann, and UVa scientist Brad Adams used the paleoclimate records stored in ice cores, corals, and tree ring records to reconstruct El Niño events. They used independent ice-core volcanic dust evidence to reconstruct volcanic activity back to the early 1700s.    The paleoclimate records are called ‘proxy records’ because they are not direct measurements of current climate and ocean conditions, but instead are reconstructions of past conditions gleaned from the physical, biological, or chemical records or, “signatures,” stored in natural archives in the environment. Using these records, the scientists were able to precisely identify the years when eruptions occurred and the years when El Niño events occurred.    When they counted, year by year, the separate events and brought them together for comparison, they found that there was a nearly one-in-two chance that an El Niño event will occur after a volcanic eruption in the tropical zone, roughly double the normal probability. “I wouldn’t call this a tight connection  it’s not a one-to-one relationship,” Mann said, “but it appears that the eruption of a tropical volcano nudges the climate towards a more El Niño-like state.”    El Niño is a prominent altering factor on world climate, affecting weather patterns for months and years, often causing drought and severe weather in different parts of the world. “We seek to understand how El Niño responds to changes in natural factors such as volcanic activity in part, so we can potentially better understand how El Niño might respond to more recent human influences on climate,” Mann said.    Adams added that the findings might help oceanographers and atmospheric scientists to make better probabilistic forecasts of El Niño activity. “This is not a strictly predictive tool, but it may help in anticipating the odds that an El Niño event might occur in a given period,” Adams said.    ###   Contact:   Cheryl Dybas   National Science Foundation   703-292-7734    cdybas@nsf.gov This text derived from  http://www.eurekalert.org/bysubject/atmospheric.php     Recommend this Article to a Friend    Back to:   News                              Subscribe to the Earth Observatory   About the Earth Observatory   Please send comments or questions to:  eobmail@eodomo.gsfc.nasa.gov    Responsible NASA official: Yoram Kaufman  NASA/GSFC Security and Privacy Statement

The analysis supports scientists' claim that human activity is influencing the earth's climate. The findings are published in the December 15 issue of Geophysical Research Letters. NCAR's primary sponsor is the National Science Foundation.   ""Once the volcanic and El Nino influences have been removed,"" says Wigley, ""the overall record is more consistent with our current knowledge, which suggests that both natural and anthropogenic influences on climate are important and that anthropogenic influences have become more substantial in recent decades.""   Volcanic emissions cool the planet by blocking sunlight, while El Nino events raise global temperatures through warmer ocean waters. Sometimes the two occur simultaneously, muddying evidence of any underlying warming trend. During the past two decades, two massive volcanic eruptions--El Chichn in April 1982 and Mt. Pinatubo in June 1991--coincided with significant El Ninos, making trend detection more difficult.   Wigley quantified the effects of major volcanic eruptions and El Nino episodes on global mean temperatures. Overall, he found the cooling effect from sun-blocking volcanic emissions was slightly stronger than the warming effect of the coincident El Ninos. He then removed both from the temperature record to reveal an intensified, step-like warming trend over the past century.   In the raw temperature record--not adjusted for the influence of volcanic eruptions and El Nino events--the warming trend during the past two decades is similar in intensity to an earlier warming (1910 to 1940). Several decades of slight cooling separate the two warm periods. However, ""When ENSO and volcanic effects are removed,"" writes Wigley, ""the recent warming trend increases to 0.25 degree Celsius [from 0.18 degree C] per decade and becomes highly significant compared to the earlier period."" (ENSO stands for El Nino-Southern Oscillation, a term that describes interannual changes in both sea surface temperatures and atmospheric pressure across the Pacific basin.)   The overall result is a long-term warming trend that intensifies by century's end, in sync with increasing emissions of greenhouse gases. Using the raw data, greenhouse skeptics have claimed that the earlier warming's similarity to the later one suggests that both were due to natural variations rather than human activity.   Wigley also quantified and removed the warming influence of the 1997- 98 El Nino from the temperature record of the past decade. He found that of the 16 months in 1997-98 announced by the National Climatic Data Center as record breakers, at least six can be attributed to El Nino rather than to a longer-term global warming. ""The sequence is still unusual, but no more unusual than 1990-91, when an equal number of records occurred in the ENSO-adjusted data,"" writes Wigley. Nevertheless, the past decade's warmth is striking in the overall record.   NCAR is managed by the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research, a consortium of more than 60 universities offering Ph.D.s in atmospheric and related sciences.

GX026-08-1490029	Climate Change Over the Last 100 Years           Climate Change Over the Past 100 Years       Global surface temperature has been measured since 1880 at a network   of ground-based and   ocean-based sites. Over the last century, the average surface temperature of   the Earth has increased by about 1.0 o  F. The eleven warmest years   this century have all occurred since 1980, with 1995 the warmest on record. The   higher latitudes have warmed more than the equatorial regions.       Beginning in 1979, satellites have been used to measure the temperature   of the atmosphere up to a height of 30,000 feet. The long-term surface record   and the recent satellite observations differ, but that fact is not surprising:   the two techniques measure the temperature of different parts of the Earth   system (the surface, and various layers of the atmosphere). In addition to   this, a variety of factors, such as the presence of airborne materials from the   1991 eruption of the volcano Mt. Pinatubo, affect each record in a different   way. Satellite observations were initially interpreted as showing a slight   cooling, but more recent analyses accounting for natural, short-term   fluctuations imply warming, just as the ground-based measurements have   indicated over a longer time period. As more data from the satellite record   become available, and as the quality of measurements is improved, comparison of   these two records should yield additional insights.         Figure8-9.gif What does warming do? A warmer Earth speeds up the global water   cycle: the exchange of water among the oceans, atmosphere, and land. Higher   temperatures cause more evaporation, and soils will tend to dry out faster.   Increased amounts of water in the atmosphere will mean more rain or snow   overall. We may be seeing the first signs of changes in the water cycle. Since   the beginning of the century, precipitation in the United States has increased   by about 6 percent, while the frequency of intense precipitation events (heavy   downpours of more than two inches per day) has increased by 20 percent. Such   events can cause flooding, soil erosion, and even loss of life. In some   midcontinental areas, increased evaporation has led to drought because the   heavy rains fell elsewhere.        There is also evidence that ecosystems are reacting to warming. Between   1981 and 1991, the length of the growing season in the northern high latitudes   (between 45 o and 70 o  N) increased by a total of up to   twelve days, as documented by satellite imagery. Greening in spring and summer   occurred up to eight days earlier, and vegetation continued to photosynthesize   an estimated four days longer.       Global mean sea level has risen 4 to 10 inches over the last 100 years,   mainly because water expands when heated. The melting of glaciers, which has   occurred worldwide over the last century, also contributes to the rise.   Formerly frozen soils (permafrost) in the Alaskan and Siberian arctic have also   begun to melt, damaging both ecosystems and infrastructure. Melting and tundra   warming will also lead to decay of organic matter and the release of trapped   carbon and methane, creating an additional source of greenhouse gases.                 Table of Contents   President and First Lady  |  Vice President and Mrs. Gore Record of Progress  |  The Briefing Room Gateway to Government  |  Contacting the White House  |  White House for Kids White House History  |  White House Tours  |  Help Privacy Statement Help Site Map Graphic Version T H E   W H I T E   H O U S E

That was the message emerging from a week-long symposium examining climate            variability over the past 1,000 years, which brought together results            from a growing array of observational techniques, analyses of natural            records and model results (""Climate Variability and Forcing Over the            Past Millennium"", XXI General Assembly of the International Union of            Geodesy and Geophysics, Boulder, Colorado, 3-8 July 1995).                         Very precise measurement of the vertical profile of air temperature            in boreholes drilled up to a few thousand metres deep indicate how the            near-surface ground temperature has changed over the past few decades,            over the past one or two centuries, and since the early part of this            millennium (H. N. Pollack, Univ. Michigan). Papers were presented on            results from Europe, North America, Africa, Asia, New Zealand and Australia;            virtually all measurements indicate that there was an extended cool            period a few centuries ago and that ground temperatures during the present            century are on average about a degree warmer than during the last century            and, more importantly, than earlier this millennium.                         Whereas borehole temperatures provide a direct but increasingly smoothed            record, ice cores, tree rings and coral growth layers provide indirect,            but year-by-year (and even season-by-season) estimates of the temperature            and precipitation over much of the globe. Ice-core records provide information            about volcanic eruptions, specifically the amount of sulphate aerosol            injected (as deposited aerosols are trapped in the ice) and the cooling            that it induced, which can be inferred from changes in oxygen isotope            ratios (G. A. Zielinski, Univ. New Hampshire). Tree-ring evidence suggests            that the coldest summers were 1601, 1641, 1669, 1699, 1783, 1816 and            1912---with all but 1699 associated with known volcanic eruptions (P.            D. Jones, Univ. East Anglia). The latest results suggest that the sulphate            content of material ejected in the 1883 Krakatoa eruption was relatively            low, leading to only minor global cooling.                         Combined land and ocean records indicate that there has been a global            warming of 0.3 to 0.6 K since the last century, albeit with cooling            in the North Atlantic and some parts of China and North America (N.            Nicholls, Bureau of Meteorology Research Centre, Melbourne). Data on            retreat of mountain glaciers from the tropics to high latitudes reinforce            this evidence (M. F. Meier, Univ. Colorado). Although there is evidence            that the seasonal cycle is also shifting towards earlier winters (D.            J. Thomson, Bell Labs), there was considerable dispute about how certain            we could be that greenhouse gas increases were accelerating the shift            that is itself due to changes in the Earth's orbital elements.                         Several investigators (G. C. Reid, National Oceanic and Atmospheric            Administration, Colorado; D. V. Hoyt, Research and Data Systems, Maryland)            reported statistical linkages between climate fluctuations and variations            in solar irradiance, but the evidence that variations in the Sun's energy            output can be large enough to cause the changes will be at best circumstantial            until a plausible mechanism is quantified. A diagnostic model aiming            to match the climate record of the past few centuries indicated that            solar variations could only have had an important effect in the unlikely            event that the cooling influence of sulphate aerosols is largely compensating            for the warming influence of greenhouse gases. For the future, all indications            are that the greenhouse gas effect will increasingly govern the behavior            of the climate (M. E. Schlesinger, Univ. Illinois).                         Interestingly, the warming pattern since the mid-1970s looks rather            like the footprint of El Nino events, although this does not explain            the strong warming over parts of Eurasia (C. K. Folland, Hadley Centre,            UK). These quasi-periodic events warm the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean,            which sets off a chain of events that cool the central North Pacific,            warm northwest Canada, increase precipitation in the southeastern United            States and intensify the large-scale pressure pattern across the Pacific,            North America and the North Atlantic Ocean that alters mid-latitude            storm tracks. Does this finding mean that the recent warming is due            primarily to an increased (but not understood) frequency of El Nino            events, or is this the pattern by which greenhouse-gas-induced warming            is becoming evident? We don't know. Climate models are only just starting            to achieve the high resolution and verisimilitude needed to reproduce,            although often not strongly enough, the observed El Nino signature.            Some model simulations suggest that the warming pattern will be similar            to a persistent El Nino, but that oscillations will continue, superimposed            on the higher average temperature (G. A. Meehl, National Center for            Atmospheric Research, Colorado).                         A variety of model simulations for the nineteenth and twentieth centuries            are being conducted. Simulations that couple ocean, atmosphere and land            surface aerosols show better agreement with the historical record if            they include the increasing concentrations of both greenhouse gases            and sulphate aerosols than if they take into account just greenhouse            gases (J. F. B. Mitchell, Hadley Centre; U. Cubasch, Max-Planck-Institut            fur Meteorologie, Hamburg; see J. F. B. Mitchell et. al. Nature 376,            501-504; 1995). This is evident both in the records of the global average            temperature and in the geographical patterns of changes in surface and            tropospheric temperatures (B. D. Santer and K. E. Taylor, Lawrence Livermore            National Lab.). The chief discrepancy found in analyses of the vertical            temperature pattern is that the simulated warming extends up into the            lower stratosphere whereas the observations show cooling in this region.            This discrepancy is probably a result of not including the effects of            stratospheric ozone depletion, which other modeling studies indicate            causes cooling due to reduced absorption of solar and terrestrial radiation.                                    In addition to lowering projections of overall global warming, including            sulphates in the simulations has regional effects, including reversing            the projected intensification of the Asian summer monsoons found in            greenhouse-gas-only calculations (Mitchell). This occurs because the            high (but uncertain) projections of future sulphur emissions (mainly            from energy generation) for eastern Europe, India and China create a            cooling pall over southern Asia. Interestingly, the change in the Earth's            orbit since 6,000 years ago had a radiative influence of similar character,            and the modelled and observed result of the change is a reduction of            the summer monsoon and the aridification of much of the Middle East            and northern Africa (suggesting that the models are responding as would            nature).                         Another important issue is understanding the internal variability of            the atmosphere-ocean(-glacier) system. The picture slowly emerging from            observations seems to fit reasonably well (at least in some cases) with            mechanisms of decadal to interdecadal variability found in simulations            with coupled ocean-atmosphere models, which are becoming more realistic            (U. Mikolajewicz, Max-Planck-Institut fur Meteorologie).                         In the vernacular popular in the United States today, one could say            that the DNA (here for Distinguishing Natural and Anthropogenic) evidence            is becoming quite compelling. Although greenhouse gases and aerosols            are not yet convicted beyond all reasonable doubt, the case is becoming            steadily stronger.

Guiney and Richard J. Pasch Tropical Prediction Center National Hurricane Center Miami, Florida  urricane Mitch, the strongest October hurricane ever recorded, formed in the southwest Caribbean Sea from a tropical wave about 440 miles south of Kingston, Jamaica late on October 21, 1998. The system initially moved slowly westward and intensified into a tropical storm on October 22, while located about 260 miles east-southeast of San Andres Island. Mitch then moved slowly northward, and then northnorthwestward on the 23rd and 24th while gradually gaining strength. Early on October 24, Mitch became a hurricane and was  H  centered about 350 miles eastsoutheast of Cabo Gracias a Dios, Nicaragua. Later that day, as it turned toward the west, Mitch began to intensify rapidly. In about 24 hours its central pressure dropped 52 mb, to 924 mb, by the afternoon of October 25. Further strengthening took place and the central pressure reached a minimum of 905 mb on the afternoon of October 26, while the hurricane was centered about 35 nm southeast of Swan Island (see cover photograph). This pressure is the fourth lowest pressure ever measured in an Atlantic hurricane (tied with Hurricane Camille in  1969). This is also the lowest pressure ever observed in an October hurricane in the Atlantic basin. At its peak on the 26th, Mitch's maximum winds were estimated to be 155 knots, making it a category five hurricane on the Saffir/Simpson Hurricane Scale. After passing over Swan Island, Mitch began to gradually weaken on October 27 while moving slowly west. It then turned southwestward and southward toward the Bay Islands off the coast of Honduras. The center passed very near the Island of Guanaja as a category four hurricane, wreaking Continued on Page 5  4 Mariner s Weather Log   Hurricane Mitch Hurricane Mitch Continued from Page 4 havoc there. Mitch slowly weakened as its circulation interacted with the land mass of Honduras. From mid-day on the 27th to early on the 29th, the central pressure rose 59 mb. The center of the hurricane meandered near the north coast of Honduras from late on the 27th through the 28th, before making landfall during the morning of the 29th about 60 nm east of La Ceiba with 85-knot winds. Mitch moved southward over Honduras, weakening to a tropical storm early on the 30th. The cyclone moved slowly over Honduras and Guatemala on October 30-31, gradually weakening to a tropical depression. Mitch generated torrential rains over portions of Honduras and Nicaragua, where the associated floods and mud slides were devastating. The highest rainfall total reported by the Honduras Weather Service was 35.89 inches in Choluteca, located in the southernmost portion of the country. Even higher values may have gone unobserved. Some heavy rains also occurred in neighboring countries. Although Mitch's surface circulation center dissipated near the Guatemala/southeast Mexico border on November 1, the remnant circulation aloft continued to produce locally heavy rainfall over portions of central  America and eastern Mexico for the next couple of days. On November 3, a low-level circulation became evident in the eastern Bay of Campeche and the system regenerated into a tropical storm while located about 150 miles southwest of Merida, Mexico. Mitch moved northeastward and weakened to a depression early on the 4th as it moved inland over the northwest Yucatan peninsula. The center re-emerged over the southcentral Gulf of Mexico by midmorning on the 4th, and Mitch regained tropical storm strength. The storm began to accelerate northeastward as it became involved with a frontal zone moving through the eastern Gulf. Mitch made landfall on the morning of November 5 in southwest Florida near Naples, with maximum sustained winds near 55 knots. By mid-afternoon of the 5th, Mitch moved offshore of south Florida, and became extratropical. Most ships heeded the marine forecasts and only 30 ships reported wind of 34 knots or greater during hurricane Mitch. Table 1 lists these reports along with the pressure and significant wave height. The highest wind was 54 knots reported by ship C6HH3 (16.2N, 87.6W) at 1500 UTC on 31 October. It has been estimated that there was a 50 percent loss to Honduras' agricultural crops. At least  70,000 houses were damaged and more than 92 bridges were damaged or destroyed. There was severe damage to the infrastructure of Honduras and entire communities were isolated from outside assistance. To a lesser extent, damage was similar in Nicaragua, where a large mudslide inundated ten communities situated at the base of La Casitas Volcano. Guatemala and El Salvador also suffered from flash floods which destroyed thousands of homes, along with bridges and roads. The estimated death toll from Mitch (as of February 1,1999) stands at 9,086, with a comparable number of missing persons. The greatest losses of life occurred in Honduras and Nicaragua--5,677 and 2,836, respectively. The death toll also includes 31 fatalities associated with the loss of the schooner FANTOME. The exact number of deaths caused by Mitch will probably never be known. However, this was one of the deadliest Atlantic tropical cyclones in history, ranking below only the 1780 ""Great Hurricane"" in the Lesser Antilles, but comparable to the Galveston hurricane of 1900, and Hurricane Fifi of 1974, the latter also striking Honduras. Most of the U.S. damage from Mitch was caused by tornadoes in the Florida Keys which injured 65 people, damaged or destroyed 645 homes, and caused an estimated $40 million in damages.h  April 1999 5   Hurricane Mitch  Table 1.

While this theory is true to a large extent, the prominent role that both the Union and Confederate navies played during this period in history is not nearly as well known as many of the more famous Civil War land battles such as Vicksburg and Gettysburg. Indeed, some of the most important conflicts occurred not only along the United States'  coastline, rivers, and inlets, but also on the high seas. Xanthus Smith was born on February 26, 1839, on Locust Street in Philadelphia, to Russell Smith, a renowned 19th-century theater curtain and scenery painter, and his wife, Mary Smith, a well-known naturalist who worked in watercolors. At a young age, Smith expressed an interest in the sea through his sketches and watercolors. After touring Europe in the 1850s, he returned to study drawing at The Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia.  I  With the outbreak of the Civil War, Smith enlisted in the Navy and was stationed at Port Royal, South Carolina, aboard the U.S.S. WABASH, Rear Admiral Samuel Francis DuPont's flagship of the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron. It was during this assignment that Smith was encouraged by Rear Admiral DuPont and other superior officers to sketch and paint in detail several vessels in the squadron. In the latter part of 1864, Smith was forced to resign his commission and return home due to his Continued on Page 9  April 1999 7   8 Mariner s Weather Log  Independence Seapor t Museum  Farragut passing the forts below New Orleans.

However, he continued to create ship portraits similar to the ones he painted while stationed at Port Royal. These paintings led to the development of his studied and accurate approach to well-known Civil War naval battles including the clash between MONITOR and MERRIMACK at Hampton Roads, South Carolina, and the battles of New Orleans and Mobile Bay. While Smith's work focused on and represented individual battles, it also documented and conveyed important technological developments of the War. One of the most important developments reflected in his work was the emergence of an ironclad navy. It was the Confederates who first began ironclad construction with the conversion of U.S.S. MERRIMACK into the ironclad steamer C.S.S. VIRGINIA. Eventually, Union forces saw the need for an ironclad navy and began to work on the design and implementation of such vessels. Three very different designs were submitted to the Union Navy and approved for construction. Two of the three came from designer John Ericsson and shipbuilder Merrick and Sons', both of Philadelphia. Ericsson's design for the MONITOR and Merrick and Sons' design for the hull which would later to be known as NEW  IRONSIDES, were quickly put into production. This commitment to new technology had an invaluable impact on the future of the U.S. Navy and resulted in the construction of 40 Monitors by the end of the war. Eventually, Merrick and Sons' NEW IRONSIDES emerged as the prototype of the modern day navy vessel. Much of Smith's most famous and dramatic work recorded the frequent skirmishes with blockade runners along U.S. waterways. As a means of applying economic pressure on the South and attempting to stop their trading with Europe, President Lincoln announced the implementation of a Union blockade in April 1861, which ran from Alexandria, Virginia, to the Rio Grande River. Confederate ""runners"" were employed to break through the Union blockade and smuggle goods in and out of the South. The tantalizing lure of immense profits attracted men from all over the globe to the dangerous job of blockade running. As the Union blockade became more efficient, the profits from blockade running soared, as did the increased risks. Smith's work also detailed the international aspects of the Civil War. One of the most famous battles in international waters he depicted was that of U.S.S. KEARSARGE and C.S.S. ALABAMA on June 19, 1864. ALA-  BAMA had been traveling the globe attacking northern merchant ships and KEARSARGE had been searching for her along the northern European coast to the Canaries, Madeira, and into the Western Islands since March 1863. The two finally met in the waters off Cherbourg, France. ALABAMA opened fire first. KEARSARGE held steady and closed the distance between the two ships to less than 1,000 yards before opening fire. Within the hour, ALABAMA was forced to strike her colors and admit defeat. She appealed for assistance from KEARSARGE, which rescued the majority of her crew. Throughout his life, Smith continued to paint numerous Civil War naval battles, some of which were unfamiliar to him. For these particular paintings he often consulted with officers who had participated in an attempt to maintain historical accuracy. He maintained a studio on Chestnut Street in Philadelphia, where he continued to paint as the last surviving artist with Civil War service until his death on December 2, 1929. Smith's legacy continues today through his numerous paintings and sketches, significant not only because of the bold brush strokes and vibrant colors used to bring them to life, but for his ability to capture important historical moments in time with an awe-inspiring accuracy.h  April 1999 9   Saf f ir/Simpson Hurricane Scale  The Saf fir/Simpson Hurricane Scale: An Inter view with Dr. Robert Sim pson Debi Iacovelli Tropical Weather Specialist Cape Coral, Florida  Editor 's Note: The Saffir/Simpson Hurricane Scale was first proposed in 1971 by Robert Simpson and Herbert Saffir, and is now widely used. This interview was conducted in 1991. ""Hurricane Hugo is now a Category 4 on the Saffir/Simpson Scale..."" We hear the expression so often during the hurricane season, the ""Saffir/Simpson Scale."" But where did it originate and who was the creator of it? In this exclusive interview, Dr. Robert Simpson gives us some background about the scale and his personal feelings on the way it has been used in the discussion of hurricanes. Space will not permit me to do justice to the lengthy career of Dr. Robert Simpson. He and his wife, Dr. Joanne Simpson, are both fellows of the American Meteoro10 Mariner s Weather Log  logical Society. He is a former director of the National Hurricane Center (1967-1974) and is an accomplished writer of tropical meteorological books and articles. In 1991 he was awarded the ""Cleveland Abbe Award for distinguished Service to Atmospheric Sciences by an Individual"" for ""pioneering work in storm research and for outstanding leadership in planning and implementing complex operational programs over a span of decades."" He now operates a consulting meteorological firm in Charlottesville, Virginia, called ""Simpson Weather Associates, Inc."" Needless to say, Dr. Simpson and his wife are truly among the pioneers in hurricane research. DI: When did you first start working with hurricanes, Dr. Simpson?  RS: I got interested in hurricanes ever since I almost drowned in one in Corpus Christy (Texas) in 1919, but my first actual flight into a hurricane was in 1945. And then I flew with the Air Force in their early reconnaissances from 1945 through 1954 as a guest to get research data after they got their operational data. Based upon that then, when we were able to get the money in 1954 to establish a fulltime, around the year, research on hurricanes, I was asked to be the first director of it. We established that at West Palm Beach, Florida. We had three planes dedicated to research there, and by the Air Force, but they only did our hurricane research for us, we didn't get any operational information, just research. So that was the beginning of organized hurricane research itself. A lot of Continued on Page 11   Saf f ir/Simpson Hurricane Scale The Saf fir/Simpson Scale Continued from Page 10 people, both on the outside, in Universities as well as from within the Weather Services and NOAA, participated in the research, both on the data we got on the aircraft, and theoretical research. DI: Dr. Simpson, why don't you give us a bit of background on the development of the Saffir/ Simpson hurricane scale? RS: The problem of evacuating people and getting warnings out that are understood and which will evoke a response in the people who need to move has always been a difficult one. When I first came down to the Hurricane Center in 1967, I tried to come to grips with how we could do a better job of communicating. And that's very difficult; scientists communicate with each other very easily, but a scientist trying to communicate with a person who is a non-scientist on a technical problem is very difficult at times. So it occurred to me if we could find some means of expressing the gradations of risks that people have in a hurricane, it would help people like the American Red Cross and the Emergency Management people to decide how best to make their decisions and to deal with the people they were responsible to. So I was talking to Herb Saffir (in 1968) about work that he had been doing and had just completed for the United Nations. He had completed something in the way of a summary of what you could expect in the way of orna-  mental damage and basic damage to structures with winds of different strengths. I said this is probably, put in a different suit of clothing, exactly the type of thing we need but we'll have to add the storm surge to it and a few other things. So I took on the job of working with him to get this thing put up in a new suit of clothing that we could then distribute to people, like the American Red Cross, who have to provide disaster relief when it's all over. It was used that way for a couple of years before I left the Hurricane Center in 1974. Then the year after that when Neil Frank became the director, the pressure was put on him to distribute this to the public. I often felt that it was a little bit premature to put the scale out without perhaps improving it a little bit, and at least educating the people as to what it meant a little bit more. But politics and the situation was such that when people want something they want something, they're going to get it whether they know how to use it or not. So, I think that through the years it served a very good purpose for a lot of people. It's been misinterpreted, misused in a lot of places, but almost any device which is technical is. And the main difference in making it a equally useful thing to everybody is education, and telling them what it amounts to. The scale as devised, expresses what the extreme conditions can be expected from a hurricane of a certain type and a certain category. It doesn't mean that everyone that  a hurricane moves over, and the worst part of that hurricane, is going to receive that kind of damage or that kind of hazard. In other words, it's a study in probabilities--the probability of being hurt. And why is that? It's a great big storm, why isn't there a uniform amount of damage that you get? And if you've ever surveyed damage after a hurricane you know that one block of houses may be almost totally destroyed, and two blocks to either side there will be little damage at all. It's almost like a tornado. It's not a tornado, but what is happening is it's not a uniform bowl of pudding that's circulating around here. It's something that has lots of streaks in it, and the streaks are made by the cumulus clouds that are embedded in this great big storm. And as these cumulus clouds circulate around, they're relatively small. Some of them are no more than a couple of kilometers across and maybe four of five kilometers long. That means that just a few blocks to one side or to the other side of where this cumulus cloud is providing the extreme wind, you have much less than the extreme, and therefore get no damage at all that's comparable on either side of it. So, there's several problems. The problem is first, expressing to the people who have to leave that it's a matter of probabilities, but if they don't believe that they're going to be in the worst sector and receive the worst damage or hazard, then they're playing Russian Roulette. They have to assume the worst and act accordContinued on Page 12 April 1999 11   Saf f ir/Simpson Hurricane Scale The Saf fir/Simpson Scale Continued from Page 11 ingly. Others are engineers who brag about the fact that the house or building that they engineered received no damage, and another engineer whose building received a lot of damage tries to explain why it did, because he knows he engineered it right. There isn't that understanding, and it's difficult to understand that it's the difference in the hurricane, not the difference in the engineering that caused the  difference in the amount of damage received. DI: Dr. Simpson, in your opinion, since the Saffir/Simpson scale is an open ended scale, do you think that hurricane windspeeds could become a category 6 or 7? RS: I think it's immaterial. Because when you get up into winds in excess of 155 miles per hour you have enough damage if that extreme wind sustains itself for as much as six seconds on a building  it's going to cause rupturing damages that are serious no matter how well it's engineered. It may only blow the windows out, but on the other hand, it can actually rupture the stairwells, the elevator wells and twist them, and it's happened in many buildings so that you can't even use the elevators after they've experienced this. So I think that it's immaterial what will happen with winds stronger than 156 miles per hour. That's the reason why we didn't try to go any higher than that anyway.h  Saf f ir/Simpson Hurricane Scale* Category ONE Definition/Likely Effects Winds 75-95 mph (65-82 kts): No real damage to building structures.

Bruce Parker  Dr. Parker is Chief of the Coast Survey Development Laboratory in the National Ocean Service, NOAA. othing embodies the drama of the sea more than waves. To the average person, the images evoked are probably those of huge waves crashing onto a beach during a storm. To the recreational boater, it may be remembering the jarring rhythm of the boat's bow banging down onto the next set of wave crests and the resulting spray as you headed for the comfort and dryness of the dock. To the mariner, it may be the memory of tons of water crashing onto the deck of the cargo ship, and perhaps of fear as the captain kept  changing course and speed in an effort to keep the vessel in a position where a huge wave could not turn it over or break it in two. Though it has always been obvious that waves were caused by the wind, it may be surprising to learn that we still do not completely understand how the wind blowing over a smooth flat water surface can generate waves and how these waves can sometimes grow to heights of 50 or even 100 feet. When oceanographers say something is ""not completely understood,"" what they really mean is that they don't yet have a reliable mathematical model that can accurately predict what will happen in the real world for all conditions. Even when a math-  N  ematical model does work well, it may not be easy to translate the mathematics of the model into physical terms that are easily described and understood. That being said, in this column we will try to explain how the wind generates waves, hopefully in physical terms that make sense. Let's start with the most basic idea, i.e., the idea of a wave . In previous columns we have talked about an oscillation, such as a pendulum oscillating back and forth. A wave is merely an oscillation that does not stay in one place, but moves along or through some medium--for example, along a string, through the air, or Continued on Page 18 April 1999 17   Physical Oceanog raphy How W ind Generates Waves Continued from page 17 along the water 's surface (there are many kinds of waves in nature). If a taut string is plucked, and a point on that string moves up and down, that point is oscillating, but if the up and down motion moves along the string away from the point where it was plucked, that is a wave. For an oscillation or a wave to occur there must be a motionless at-rest position where all the forces are in balance (in equilibrium), and, when we upset this balance, there must be a restoring force that will try to bring it back to the equilibrium position. Suppose we have a ball attached to a string hanging motionless (i.e., a pendulum). We hit the ball  to the left, and its inertia carries the ball further to the left and the string forces it to move upward against the force of gravity (Figure 1). Gravity, the restoring force, eventually slows the ball down until it stops at the maximum height of its swing, and then pulls it downward again. The ball moves back to the right toward the original point of equilibrium (the point where it was when originally motionless). However, with little friction to stop it, the ball's inertia carries it right past this equilibrium point, moving to the right and once again upward against the force of gravity, which again slows it down and pulls it down and back to the left. Because there is very little friction in this system (mostly the friction of the air on the ball moving through it), the ball comes to a complete stop at  the equilibrium position only after many oscillations. Water sitting in a tank (or in an ocean basin) with no external forces pushing on its surface, will also be in an equilibrium position, i.e., motionless with a flat surface. If something moves the water away from this flat equilibrium position, there are two restoring forces that will work to make the water surface flat again: surface tension and gravity. If only a very small part of the water surface (less than an inch) is bent (and stretched), then it will be flattened out again by the water 's surface tension (due to the attraction of the water molecules for each other). If a larger portion of the water surface is bent, and a portion of water is moved vertically above the equilibrium level (above the original flat surface), gravity will pull the water back down. If the water is pushed down below the equilibrium level, causing a depression in the surface, then water pressure will force it back up. This water pressure is due to the gravity pulling down on the water around the depression. In all these cases, once the water starts moving back toward the equilibrium position, the inertia of the water will carry the surface past the equilibrium level, there being little friction to slow it down right away. But in this case, the water surface does not just go up and down at that one location. This up and  Figure 1. A simple oscillating pendulum. See text for explanation.  Continued on Page 19  18 Mariners Weather Log   Phy sical Oceanography How W ind Generates Waves Continued from page 18 down motion of the surface propagates as a wave away from that location. The reason the change in shape of the water surface (i.e., the wave) moves along the water surface away from the location where the original disturbance took place, is that water particles were also pushed horizontally, in addition to vertically, forward and then backward. Individual water particles oscillate about their own equilibrium positions. As they interact with their neighboring particles they transfer some energy to them. Those particles in turn interact with other neighboring particles and transfer energy to them, and so on (Figure 2). In fact, these water particles actually oscillate in two dimensions, moving in (almost) perfect vertical circles (usually referred to as particle orbits). After a complete cycle of the wave, each particle comes back to (almost) where it started one cycle earlier. This is clear when a float is on the water surface. When a wave goes by, the float moves forward as it moves upward, and then it moves backward as it moves downward. One also notes in Figure 2 that the wave has an effect on the water column below it. The circular particle orbits become smaller as one goes deeper, disappearing at a location of no wave motion at a depth equal to approximately half the wavelength. (If the water is too shallow for a location of no wave motion to occur, this shallowwater wave will have elliptical  Figure 2. A simple propagating water wave with the water particle orbits shown.  particle orbits, as well as other different characteristics, which we will look at in a later Physical Oceanography column.) A key point to remember is that it is the shape of the water surface (and the energy) that is propagating away, not the water particles themselves. [""(almost)"" was used twice in the previous paragraph because, to be very precise, there is a very, very small transport of water forward with each wave cycle, but this is insignificantly small compared with the speed of the propagating shape of the surface.]  At this point we should define some terms related to waves (some of which you probably have already seen before), which are illustrated in Figure 3. Note, however, that the wave shown in Figure 3 is an idealized wave (or one component making up a wave). The highest point that the water surface reaches is the crest of the wave; the lowest point is the trough. The difference from trough to crest is the wave height. The distance from one crest to the next crest, or from one trough to the next trough, is the wavelength . Continued on Page 20  Figure 3. Terms describing a simple water wave. The wave period is the time is takes for one complete wave cycle to pass by a point.  April 1999 19   Physical Oceanog raphy How W ind Generates Waves Continued from Page 19 As the wave propagates by a point, the time it takes one wave cycle to pass by that point (i.e., the time it takes between the first crest passing the point and the second crest passing that point) is called the wave period . The inverse of the period is the frequency of the wave, i.e. how many cycles of this wave pass by in a second. The speed at which a wave travels, its wave speed or celerity, is equal to its wavelength divided by the wave period. This is different from, and much greater than, the speed of individual water particles. So how does the wind generate waves and make them grow? It's obvious how the wind pushes on the sails of a sailboat. But what can the wind do to a glassy-calm flat sea surface? How can the wind move the water surface and change its shape? There are two possible ways. The first is through the friction of the horizontallyflowing air particles in the wind rubbing against the water particles in the water surface (this wind stress is a force tangential to the surface). However, when the wind blows over any surface, including water, the movement of the air particles is not simply parallel to the surface. The flow of air is turbulent, meaning that there are swirling eddies of various sizes and thus chaotic vertical movements of the air particles (which produce a force perpendicular to the water surface). The second way that the air can move the  water surface is through the vertical pressure of the air particles, either moving downward (pushing on and lowering the water surface) or moving upward (creating a reduced pressure that lifts the water surface). The question then is what role does either the frictional stress or the pressure (or both) play, first in generating waves and second in making them grow? When the wind speed is low (less than a few knots) over a flat water surface, the air flow is less turbulent and has only very small eddies. As a result of the vertical motion from these small eddies (less than an inch in size), there are increased pressures pushing the water down in some places and decreased pressures, allowing the water to rise in other places. Surface tension provides the restoring force for the resulting capillary waves or ripples (also called ""cat's paws,"" especially when momentarily propagating across the water surface during a light wind gust) . These very small waves disappear almost immediately when the wind stops. While they exist, however, they add roughness to the water 's surface that allows the wind to have a greater effect. For higher wind speeds, which are accompanied by larger eddies and larger pressure pulses, the elevations and depressions on the water surface are large enough for gravity to be the restoring force. The gravity waves do not disappear as quickly as the capillary waves. However, the key to the  generation of significant waves seems to be a resonant mechanism between the pressure pulses in the wind and the underlying gravity waves. This resonance occurs when the water waves propagate at the same speed as the wind component in the direction of wave propagation. When this happens, the wind can keep imparting energy to the waves because the wind pressure is greatest at the wave troughs (pushing down on the water surface at the same time as when the wave is already moving downward) and least at the wave crests (pulling up on the water surface at the same time as when the wave is already moving upward). When the vertical wind particle oscillations are in phase with the vertical water particle oscillations, more energy goes from the wind to the waves, and the waves grow. Once the water surface has become wavy, this wavy surface has an effect on the wind field, which leads to further wave growth. This is because now the wind has something it can push forward, applying pressure to the wave's backside (windward side) and giving the wave more energy. In addition, the wave has a sheltering effect which allows the formation of an eddy in the air on its leeward side (the front side) (see Figure 4). This eddy results in reduced pressure on the leeward side, that helps the wave grow. (On both sides of the wave there is also an upward tangential wind Continued on Page 21  20 Mariners Weather Log   Phy sical Oceanography How W ind Generates Waves Continued from Page 20 stress effect on the surface). As waves get larger, there is more windward surface for the wind to push on and also larger leeward eddies, and a feedback mechanism results which can make the waves grow quickly. While the wind is still blowing and the waves are still growing, three factors determine how large the waves can grow. The greater the wind speed, the longer the wind blows (its duration), and the longer the length of water it blows over (the fetch), the greater the height of the waves will be. When the waves have gotten as large as they can for a particular wind speed, duration, and fetch, it is referred to as a fully developed sea. When the waves reach a steepness where the wave height is approximately 1/7th of the wavelength, they become unstable and  begin to break (producing white caps). A description of wave generation is complex because many different waves are produced at the same time by the wind (especially in a storm) with many different wavelengths and periods, traveling in many different directions. At any one location at any given moment, the wavy surface will be a combination of all the waves passing by that location at that moment. Thus, the surface over an area looks very irregular (called a confused sea) and changes continuously, so much so that one cannot even pick one wave crest and follow its movement for any distance, because at some point it will disappear (at the point where the wave components at that moment happen to cancel each other out, instead of adding together). When many waves with different wavelengths add together  positively, the steepness easily can increase beyond 1/7 and cause white caps. The irregular, everchanging water surface makes it difficult to determine visually the average wave height of a confused sea, and the visually reported value (when compared to instrument measurements) usually turns out to be the average of the highest one-third of the waves (which has become a standard wave term called the significant wave height). The irregular surface is the reason why wave forecast models must deal with complex statistics. The easiest way for an oceanographer to describe all the waves in an area of the sea is in terms of its spectrum, which is merely a way of graphically showing how much energy there is at different wave periods (or, at different frequencies). Continued on Page 22  Figure 4. The effect of a wavy surface on the air flow and the further growth of the waves. See text for explanation.  April 1999 21   Physical Oceanog raphy How W ind Generates Waves Continued from Page 21 When waves propagate away from the storm (or when the storm dies out) the situation changes. When the wind was still blowing the waves were forced waves, meaning that energy was still being imparted to them by the wind. When the wind stops, these waves continue to propagate as free waves called swell. Swell is made up of longer, lower, rounder waves. This is because the various component waves of different wavelengths no longer stay together. In deep water the wave propagation speed depends only on the wavelength of the wave. Thus, waves with longer wavelengths travel faster than waves with shorter wavelengths, and therefore the waves tend to sort themselves out, the longer waves leaving the shorter waves behind. This is called dispersion. A distant storm at sea first makes its presence known by the long-wavelength swell coming from that direction. As swell travels, the shorter wavelength waves tend to decrease their wave heights much sooner than do the longer wavelength waves. In addition, the longer waves slowly increase in wavelength and period as they travel. Because of the very little frictional dissipation involved, these long, low, and rounded waves can travel hundreds and even thousands of miles over the ocean's surface (or until they hit a coast).  What does it take for a wave to reach 50 feet in height or the occasionally reported 100 feet in height? Winds blowing at Beaufort force 8 (34-40 knots) for a couple of days over a fetch of 500 nautical miles can produce waves with significant wave heights of 25 feet and occasional 50-foot waves. Those numbers are doubled in Beaufort force 11 (5666 knots) winds. A storm moving fairly fast can continue to impart energy to waves that are moving in the same direction as the storm, producing larger waves. A very large wave can result when two large waves happen to meet at the same location and be in phase (i.e., their crests come together at the same place). For smaller waves this happens fairly often, and a wave about twice the size of the significant wave height can show up about every 80 waves. But this can also occasionally happen when two large waves happen to meet. This can easily happen in a storm situation, but on rare occasions it may happen far from a storm (the resulting huge wave being referred to as a freak wave or a rogue wave). Another common cause of very high waves is when large waves propagate against a strong ocean current. This interaction is not a simple one to explain (without the mathematics), but it results in waves with shorter wavelengths and greater heights. If the current happens to have warm water (traveling under cooler air), the atmospheric instability that this causes increases the strength of the wind stress and the turbulence,  allowing even more energy to be imparted from the wind to the waves. Some of the largest waves in the world (occasionally reaching 100 feet) occur off the southeast coast of Africa and involve several of the mechanisms just mentioned. First, this area borders on the Southern Ocean, the only area of unlimited fetch in the world, since it encircles Antarctica. Extratropical cyclones with strong winds travel from west to east, moving in the direction of some of the waves they produce. Storms off the southeast coast of Africa can produce large waves and these will be combined with swell reaching this area from all parts of the vast reaches of the Southern Ocean. The final amplification of these waves occurs when they propagate into and against the Aghulhas Current, which flows southeastward at approximately 5 knots. In addition, the Aghulhas Current is a warm current, so it is possible that the instability of the cooler air over these warm waters also increases the transfer of energy from the wind to the waves. (Personal accounts of the huge waves observed in this and other areas of the world can be found in the special Fall 1993 issue of Mariners Weather Log). Finally, when waves propagate into shallow water they also increase in height, but we will save this discussion for another column since there are a great many things to say about waves in shallow water.h  22 Mariners Weather Log   National Data Buoy Center  Evicting Sea Lions J. Michael Hemsley Kathleen C. O'Neil LTJG Lee H. Allison, USCG National Data Buoy Center Stennis Space Center, MS 39529-6000  ea lions are smart. They're cute. But, they sure can be a problem for the National Data Buoy Center (NDBC). NDBC installs, operates, and maintains weather buoys and coastal meteorological stations for the National Weather Service (NWS) along and offshore the U.S. coasts. It is off the northwest coast where sea lions have been the source, directly and indirectly, of some considerable problems. All of NDBC's 23 Pacific coast buoy stations are in the range of Zalophus Californianus Californianus, the sea lion found in U.S. waters, but it is the stations that are nearshore, off northern California, Oregon, and Washing-  S  ton that are most often the ""targets"" of sea lions. Sea lions are very social animals that congregate in colonies on rocky and sandy beaches of coastal islands and mainland shorelines. At sea, they travel together in ""rafts."" In recent years, the sea lion population has seemed to increase, possibly the result of passage of a Federal law protecting marine mammals. NDBC's problems with sea lions stems from their interest in basking in the sunshine. Buoys provide a great sunning spot for a sea lion that has been foraging for food in the chilly Pacific, so NDBC technicians have often found buoys with sea lions piled  high. In one instance, a sea lion was perched high off the deck, nearly 6 feet from the water, in the upper structure of the buoy (see Figure 1). It is this penchant for sunning themselves on NDBC buoys that has caused some problems and led NDBC personnel to learn much more about these beasts. At first, the problems associated with sea lions were mostly caused by people. Although it is illegal to kill sea lions, they are sometimes seen as one cause of the depletion of some valuable fish stocks. The resulting dislike for sea lions can  Continued on Page 24  April 1999 23   National Data Buoy Center  or more sea lions, made it clear that they objected to each weighing up to the human presence.

This causes loss of data from external sensors and loss of solar power when cables can be reached by the animals. Since the cables have to be run through a circuitous route from sensors or solar panels to the electronics inside the buoy, it is impossible to completely protect them from bored, or hungry, sea lions. Finally, NDBC discovered that sea lions were possibly responsible for water intrusion into the buoys. For some time, NDBC had struggled with water intrusion. When too much sea water gets into the buoy, it drowns the batteries, creating a corrosive slush that destroys the aluminum hull and produces explosive hydrogen gas. It was clear that the intrusion was often the result of water entering the hatch access on the buoy deck. Dog bolts, which are intended to seal the hatch cover, were often  found loose. Vandalism was thought to be the cause, but sea lions were the real culprits. With enough sea lions stacked on the hatch, the hatch gasket was compressed to the point that the dog bolts came loose, allowing water to get into the buoy. That same pile of sea lions can also cause a loss of freeboard, sometimes leaving the deck awash and water entering the loose hatch (see Figure 3). Mr. Hoffland taught NDBC personnel much about sea lions. They can jump eight feet out of the water and can climb fairly well. When they climb, they stand on their hind flippers and jump to the top of a fence or wall. Then, using their front flippers, they hoist themselves over the obstacle. Knowing these things helped in the design of a ""sea lion fence."" It was necessary to keep the beasts off the buoys, but at the same time to allow access by technicians. The fence was designed to prevent the sea lion from getting onto the  deck by jumping or climbing. It was a simple design, one that used aluminum pipes to create the fence from the deck to the upper structure. The first buoy with a fence was installed at station 46050, offshore of Newport, Oregon. As soon as the buoy was installed and the cutter withdrew, a sea lion arrived to check out the buoy and seemed quite disappointed that no way was open to get onto his usual sunning spot. Several trips past the buoy have confirmed that no sea lions have been on the buoy, nor is there an indication that they have had any success on getting past the fence. Nine other buoys are being prepared with sea lion fences because of this apparent success. It seems likely that the problems associated with sea lions and their love of buoys have been solved. All NDBC can hope is that sea lions never learn to use a cutting torch. It's been said that they have nothing but time on their flippers!h  Figure 3.

April 1999 25   National Marine Fisheries Service  The Endangered Right Whales Reducing the Threat of Ship Strikes with Mandator y Ship Repor ting Lindy S. Johnson Gregory K. Silber Office of Protected Resources National Marine Fisheries Service Silver Spring, Maryland  n December 1998, the Interna tional Maritime Organization (IMO), a Specialized Agency of the United Nations that addresses international shipping issues, unanimously approved a U.S. proposal to establish a mandatory ship reporting system to reduce ship strikes of the highly endangered North Atlantic right whale. Starting in July 1999, all commercial ships of 300 gross tons and greater will be required to report to a shore-based station when entering two right whale aggregation areas. This measure, in conjunction with other measures being taken by the United States, is an important attempt to help recover the species. There are only about 300 right whales remaining in the North Atlantic. Ship strikes kill more  I  right whales than any other source of human-related mortality. Best estimates indicate that an average of about two deaths or serious injuries per year result from collisions with ships, and since 1991, about one-half of all recorded right whale deaths have been attributed to ship strikes. This may represent only a fraction of the total number of whales killed by ships, as many deaths may go undetected if whales drift out to sea. Although other large whale species may also be hit by ships, the behavior of right whales makes them particularly vulnerable to ship strikes. Right whales live close to shore, and in areas in or adjacent to major shipping lanes. Their feeding and calving areas, and migratory corridors are  crossed by international shipping routes. Right whales spend much of their time at the surface, feeding, resting, mating, and nursing. Calves are particularly vulnerable because they spend most of their time at the surface due to their undeveloped diving capabilities. Right whales appear to be unaware of approaching ships and apparently make little effort to avoid them. Thus, mariners cannot assume that whales will move out of their path. Mariners may have difficulty in seeing right whales because of their dark color and low profile in the water. Recognizing that ship strikes are likely a major impediment to right Continued on Page 27  26 Mariners Weather Log   National Marine Fisheries Service Endangered Right Whales Continued from Page 26 whale recovery, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) initiated a program aimed at reducing the likelihood of such occurrences. Much of the program is aimed at increasing mariner's awareness of the severity of the problem and seeking their input and assistance in minimizing the threat of ship strikes. One cornerstone of the program is the mandatory ship reporting system. The concept and design of the system was initiated by NOAA, the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), and the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG), with significant input from the International Fund for Animal Welfare and the Marine Mammal Commission. The system has received strong backing from Congressmen William Delahunt (D-MA) and Wayne Gilchrest (R-MD). The requirement for mandatory ship reporting is found in the Safety of Life at Sea Convention, Chapter V, regulation 8-1. Seven mandatory reporting systems exist world-wide. A reporting system for the Dover Straits/Pas de Calais was approved by IMO at the same time as the system proposed by the United States. The effective date for both of these systems was July 1, 1999. The U.S. reporting system requires that commercial ships of 300 gross tons and greater report to a shore-based station when they enter two areas off the east coast of the United States: one off  Massachusetts and one off Georgia and Florida (see charts on pages 28 and 29). The reporting system in the area off Massachusetts will operate year round while the one off Georgia and Florida will operate each year from November 15 to April 15, which corresponds with periods of right whale occurrence. Ships will be required to report their course, speed, location, destination, and route. In return, ships will receive an automated message indicating that the ship is entering an area critical for right whales, that whales are likely to be in the area, and that ship strikes are a serious threat to whales and may cause damage to the ship. The message will also indicate to mariners where they can receive the most recent information on right whale locations, and if possible and when available, recent sighting information will be provided in the return message. The system requires reporting only and will affect no other aspect of vessel operations; there will be no cost to the mariner. The return message will also contain advice on precautionary measures mariners may take to reduce the possibility of hitting right whales (see page 31). For example, mariners will be advised to refer to navigational publications such as the U.S. Coast Pilot, Sailing Directions, and nautical charts for information on relevant regulations, and the boundaries of the Gerry E. Studds Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary  and right whale critical habitats. They will be advised to obtain information about the location of whales in their vicinity by monitoring various broadcast media, including the USCG's Broadcasts to Mariners, satellite-linked marine safety broadcasts, and NOAA Weather Radio. Right whale location information is obtained from aircraft surveys supported by the U.S. Navy, USCG, Army Corps of Engineers, NMFS, and the states of Massachusetts, Georgia, and Florida. In addition, mariners will further be advised that information placards, videos, and other educational materials are available from shipping agents, port authorities, relevant state agencies, the USCG, and NMFS. Contact with the shore station will be transmitted via INMARSAT, a satellite-based, ship-to-shore communication system. Ships not equipped with INMARSAT should contact the USCG by VHF radio, which will in turn provide the return message described above. Specific reporting instructions will be provided by the USCG before the system is implemented. Collectively, the reports will yield data on ship number and routes in right whale habitat which will be useful in identifying possible further measures to reduce ship/ whale interactions. The entire program will be reviewed in three to five years to assess its effectiveness.

For example, in 1994, NMFS designated three right whale feeding and nursery areas along the U.S. east coast as ""critical habitats."" Other areas important to right whale protection have been established by the United States and Canada, including Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary off Massachusetts and a whale conservation area in the Bay of Fundy, Canada. In 1997, NMFS issued regulations requiring vessels and aircraft to stay a minimum 500 yards (460 m) from right whales. In the northeastern and southeastern United States, NMFS estab-  lished teams composed of representatives of government agencies, the maritime industry, and the scientific community to coordinate right whale protective measures. Among other things, these teams have coordinated the right whale aircraft survey programs. Surveys are conducted off the southeastern United States from December to March (the peak calving period), and whale sightings are broadcast to all vessels in the area by the U.S. Navy. In the northeastern United States, whale advisories and sightings are broadcast periodically by NMFS, and maps of right whale sightings are posted on the Internet by the Massachusetts Office of Environmental Affairs and NMFS (http://whale. wheelock.edu). With significant input and advice from the International Fund for Animal Welfare, the regional recovery teams, and  Whale carried on the bow of a ship after it was struck and killed. Ship strikes are more common among right whales than for other whale species.  the Marine Mammal Commission, NOAA and NMFS staff are ensuring that information on right whales in relevant navigational publications is timely and accurate. These steps, including the establishment of the mandatory ship reporting system, are attempts to address the serious threat posed by ships to the very survival of the North Atlantic right whale. Although none of these steps alone can ensure survival, this mosaic of protective measures will assist in reducing ship strikes. Efforts to further increase protection of this species will require continued close cooperation between the maritime community, environmental groups, and government entities.h  A dead whale stranded on the beach. The deep lacerations, from a ship's propeller, killed this whale.  30 Mariners Weather Log   National Marine Fisheries Service  Steps Mariners Can Take To Avoid Collisions wit h Critically Endangered Right Whales When transiting right whale critical habitat:  As soon as possible prior to entering right whale critical habitat, check U.S. Coast Guard Broadcast Notice to Mariners, NAVTEX, NOAA Weather Radio, Cape Cod Canal Vessel Traffic Control, the Bay of Fundy Vessel Traffic Control, and other sources for recent right whale sighting reports. When entering ports on the U.S. east coast, refer to Coast Pilot and Notice to Mariners, review right whale identification material described in those documents, and maintain a sharp watch with lookouts familiar with spotting whales. Ask port officials, port pilots, and Coast Guard officers for additional information on right whales. When planning passage through right whale critical habitat, attempt to avoid night-time transits, and whenever practical, minimize travel distances through the area. Anticipate delays due to whale sightings. When the ability to spot whales is reduced (e.g. night, fog, rain, etc.), mariners should bear in mind that reduced speed may minimize the risk of ship strikes.       In all coastal and offshore waters along the east coast of the U.S. and Canada:   If a right whale sighting is reported within 20 nautical miles of a ship's position, post a lookout familiar with spotting whales. If a right whale is sighted from the ship, or reported along the intended track of a large vessel, mariners should exercise caution and proceed at a slow, safe speed when within a few miles of the sighting location, bearing in mind that reduced speed may minimize the risk of ship strikes. Do not assume right whales will move out of your way. Right whales, generally slow moving, seldom travel faster than 5-6 knots. Consistent with safe navigation, maneuver around observed right whales or recently reported sighting locations. It is illegal to approach closer than 500 yards of any right whale (see 50 CFR 222.32, Chapter 2). Any whale accidentally struck, any dead whale carcass spotted, and any whale observed entangled in fishing gear should be reported immediately to the U.S. or Canadian Coast Guard noting the precise location and time of the accident or sighting.      In the event of a strike or sighting, the following information should be provided to the U.S. Coast Guard:     Location and time of the accident or sighting. Speed of the vessel. Size of the vessel. Water depth.     Wind speed and direction. Description of the impact. Fate of the animal, if known. Species and size, if known.  Right whales can occur anywhere along the east coast of the U.S. and Canada. Mariners are urged to exercise prudent seamanship in their efforts to avoid right whales.

One low developed storm force winds (48 kt) briefly on August 11. In late August, and especially in September, tropical activity picked up. Otherwise in September and beyond, an upper low over the Greenland-Iceland area increasingly imparted energy to lows moving off the U.S. east coast and Canadian Maritimes, with the lows frequently developing storm winds. An exception to this was  T  the building of an upper ridge over the central Atlantic in the middle of September which directed lows north from near Newfoundland then northwest to the west of Greenland. This allowed the tropics to become active, with up to four hurricanes in existence in the Atlantic basin simultaneously on September 25, the first time ever.  Tropical Activity Hurricanes Bonnie and Danielle recurved through the mid-Atlantic offshore waters late in August and  early September. They are worthy of mention here outside the Tropical Prediction Center 's (TPC's) column because they became significant extratropical storms. Tropical cyclones that recurve and accelerate into the middle latitudes while becoming extratropical can be very dangerous since they may travel at the same speed as the swell that they generate, building the wind waves on top of the swell, generating extreme wave heights.

The visible satellite picture shows Bonnie near the analysis time becoming more sheared, with the strong convection mainly east of the center prior to it becoming extratropical. The storm was accelerating at that time and became extratropical 24 hours later. At 00Z August 30, the center passed over the Canadian buoy 44142 (42.5N 64.0W) with pressure down to 989.3 mb. Buoy 44137 to the southeast at 41.8N 60.9W reported a southwest wind of 51 kt and 11 m (35 ft) seas at that time. These seas were higher than than those reported while the storm was a hurricane southeast of the Carolinas. The storm later weakened off the coast of Portugal on September 1. Danielle followed about four days later, missing the East Coast, but recurving and intensifying as an extratropical storm southeast of Cape Race by 18Z September 4. Danielle generated seas up to 16 m (52 ft) as it became extratropical. Later, as it approached Great Britain, it developed a pressure of 967 mb by 00Z September 6. A ship at 43N 23W reported winds to 55 kt and seas of 7 m (23 ft) at 06Z September 5. At 18Z September 6, seas built to 6 to 9 m (20 to 30 ft) west of the Bay of Biscay. Meanwhile the remains of Tropical Storm Earl  moved along the Carolina coast on the night of September 3, with winds of 60 kt reported near the coast. Earl strengthened to 965 mb near Newfoundland on September 6. One ship reported a 55 kt southwest wind and 8 m (26 ft) seas near Cape Race. Hibernia Platform in the Grand Banks also reported 55 kt winds. The remains of Danielle and Earl merged into a gale system northwest of Great Britain on the 9th. In late September three of the four hurricanes that formed in the Atlantic basin (Ivan, Karl, and Jeanne) recurved east as they weakened, with an upper ridge to the north suppressing their redevelopment into strong extratropical storms. In early October, Tropical Storm Lisa intensified and moved north along 40W as a hurricane. However, Lisa weakened abruptly east of Newfoundland on October 9 without becoming a significant extratropical storm.  METEOSAT7 satellite image valid at or near 18Z on the 8th showing extratropical storm Mitch west of Great Britain with 50 to 60 kt wind reports south of the center. This system was still intensifying at the time, with the lowest central pressure at 948 mb near Iceland 24 hours later. This was one of the most intense lows of the August to November period in the North Atlantic.  Other Signif icant Weather A strong upper level low near Greenland maintained a strong influence in November, causing several major developments of lows moving off the east coast of the U.S. and Canada. The redevelopment of Mitch is one of them, described above. Another rapidly deepening storm late in November developed from a cluster of weak lows in the Newfoundland area early on November 25 (Figure 3). The corresponding 500 mb charts are also shown. One finds four separate short wave troughs on the first panel of the Figure which merged with the Greenland upper low over the next 48 hours to form a deep surface and upper level system east of Greenland on the 27th. The pressure of the surface low was 951 mb six hours later (after the valid time of the third panel of Figure 3). Winds of 50 kt or more were reported as far south as 50N near the time of maximum intensity.h  Tropical Stor m Mitch Mitch became an extratropical storm after crossing Florida on November 5, and then tracked northeast to west of the British Isles on the 8th of November. There was a ship report at 36N 52W 00Z November 7, with a southwest wind 60 kt south of the center. Figure 2 is a surface analysis and infrared  April 1999 37   Marine Weather Review  Marine Weather Review North Pacific Area August through November 1998 George Bancroft Meteorologist Marine Prediction Center  he month of August started out more like mid-summer, with weak lows tracking across the northern Bering Sea into Alaska and others moving around the periphery of the North Pacific high pressure ridge which dominated the southern midlatitudes. Some of these lows attained minimal gale strength. By the middle of the month, the upper air pattern amplified, resulting in stronger lows forming and moving northeast through the Bering Sea. One of these became the first low of the late summer-fall season to develop storm force winds (983 mb central pressure), before  T  moving into mainland Alaska. This series of lows carved out an upper trough by late August over western Alaska and eventually extending into the Gulf of Alaska, setting the stage for a major storm in the Gulf of Alaska.  Gulf of Alaska Storm of August 30-31 Figure 1 depicts this development both at the surface and 500 mb.

The PRESIDENT ADAMS (WRYW) reported at 51.5N 150.5W three hours later with a southeast wind 40 kt close to the center and a pressure of 969 mb. The system was analyzed with 963 mb central pressure near Kodiak Island at 18Z August 31, before it moved northwest and weakened.  There were ship reports of 50 kt and 7 to 9 m seas (23 to 30 ft) southeast of the center at 00Z September 7, before the system became extratropical. This system subsequently began a slow weakening trend but still maintained 45 kt gales as it entered the Gulf of Alaska on September 9. Three other tropical cyclones followed, with one of them, Stella, deepening like Rex after becoming extratropical, but not as rapidly.  Stor m of October 24-27 This was perhaps the most significant event of the four month period in which four container vessels overtaken by this fast moving storm sustained cargo damage. The storm developed from a frontal wave passing south of Japan on October 24. Figure 4 shows the system deepening by 18 mb in a 12-hour period.

The first to affect the area was Rex, shown in the surface charts of Figure 1 as a typhoon south of Japan. Rex first appeared on the MPC surface analyses on August 26, and meandered northeast for more than a week. It weakened to a tropical storm on September 5, when it started to accelerate. Figure 3 shows Rex being picked up by two short wave troughs and becoming extratropical after merging with a polar front. The two short waves shown in the first panel of figure 3 merged and resulted in rapid intensification into an extratropical storm.

With this rate of intensification of more than 24 mb in 24 hours, this storm definitely qualifies as a ""bomb."" The winds were reported as high as 100 kt and seas up to 19 m (60 ft) with this storm, and the minimum recorded pressure was 940 mb, 13 mb lower than than was analyzed by MPC. The APL CHINA (V7AL5) sustained the worst damage of the four vessels while encountering the storm near the International Dateline, losing 360 containers overboard and having a similar number remaining on board that were damaged. Other reports from ships during this event showed winds as high as 50 to 60 kt (shown in Figure 4) and seas as high as 11 to 14 m (35 to 46 ft) from 12Z October 25 to 00Z October 26. The lowest analyzed central pressure was 953 mb. The storm then turned north and weakened by October 27 in the eastern Bering Sea. See References for related articles.  Other Signif icant Events Many significant gale and storm events occurred during October and November, a time of increasing strength, speed, and frequency of cyclonic systems as the fall season progressed. Lows moved along a southwest to northeast  track from near or north of Japan to the Bering Sea, with lows sometimes redeveloping in the Gulf of Alaska. The southern stream storm track became more important as October progressed, producing the October 24-27 storm noted above. Another development off the southern storm track followed on November 9, near the Dateline. A ship just ahead of the front near 42N 164W reported a southeast wind of 50 kt and 11 meter seas (35 ft) at 00Z November 10. This storm deepened to 972 mb near 41N 168W early on the 10th before beginning to weaken. A series of developing storms tracked northeast into the Bering Sea early in November, with one attaining 952 mb in the northwest Bering Sea on November 11. Late in the month, the northern storm track was especially active, with systems moving east along or just south of the Aleutians to the Gulf of Alaska. The strongest of these dropped to 966 mb central pressure and took only two days to travel from 160E to the eastern Gulf of Alaska. Several ships south of the center reported 50 kt winds and seas up to 11 m (35 ft) on November 19 and 20. Late in the month, the upper level trough deepened in the Gulf of Alaska, steering lows on a more southern track toward Washington coast. One of these rapidly intensified as it approached the Pacific Northwest offshore waters on November 23, reaching 964 mb after deepening 36 mb in 24 hours. Figure 5 is a satellite photo of the storm  approaching its peak with plotted data included, and a surface analysis for 18Z November 23, 9 hours later. This intense system, like the late August storm, has a ""ring cloud"" around the center, a location for tight pressure gradients and high winds. Note the 60 kt ship report from the MARIT MAERSK (OZFC2) near the center. From 18Z November 23 to 00Z November 24, seas were reported at 8 to 11 meters (25 to 35 ft) south of the storm center with the highest from a ship at 46N 132W at 00Z November 24. Buoy 46050, near the Oregon coast, reported seas to 9.5 m (32 ft). Destruction Island, off the Washington coast, reported peak winds of 70 kt at 05Z on November 24. This was the beginning of a period of active weather in late November, with both northern and southern storm tracks impacting the U.S. West Coast offshore waters.

Introduction Sea surface temperature anomalies in the tropical Eastern Pacific changed from warm to cold, showing a change from El Nio to La Nia conditions. This aided well above normal tropical cyclone activity in the Atlantic, which saw 14 tropical storms during the 1998 season (Figure 1). Nine storms became hurricanes, with three becoming major hurricanes (winds 100 kt or greater). A 35-day period from 19 August through 23 September saw ten tropical storms develop, making it one of the most active  times ever in the Atlantic. Four hurricanes existed simultaneously on 25-26 September. The Eastern Pacific basin produced 13 tropical storms during 1998 (Figure 2), of which nine became hurricanes and six major hurricanes. Two non-developing depressions also occurred. Most 1998 tropical cyclones formed from tropical waves. Several waves spawned cyclones while interacting with an unusually strong monsoon environment over the Gulf of Mexico and Eastern Pacific.  II. The Gulf of Mexico/East Pacific Monsoon of 1998 The word ""monsoon"" derives from the Hindi word for season and refers to seasonal wind and weather changes over India. In summer, southwest winds bring moisture and considerable rainfall. In winter, north and northeast winds bring cooler and dryer air. These ments gence called changes are due to moveof the Intertropical ConverZone (ITCZ), which is also the monsoon trough. In the Continued on Page 45  44 Mariners Weather Log   Marine Weather Review Tropical Prediction Center Continued from Page 44 northern hemisphere summer, the ITCZ moves north across India and brings southwesterly flow behind it. In the northern hemisphere winter, the ITCZ moves south across the Equator with northeasterly flow north of the Equator. Similar monsoon trough behavior occurs over much of the world, with two notable exceptions, the Atlantic and eastern Pacific. The  Atlantic ITCZ, while migrating with the seasons, usually does not show monsoon-type wind flows except near the African coast. Exceptions occurred during the active Atlantic hurricane season of 1995 and 1996, when the ITCZ more resembled a western Pacific monsoon trough. The Eastern Pacific ITCZ shows monsoon trough characteristics during the northern hemisphere summer but not during the southern hemisphere summer. It occasionally extends into the Western  Caribbean Sea, particularly in May/June and October/November. This produces monsoon-type wind flows in this area. The monsoon trough is a natural spawning ground for tropical disturbances. These include large low pressure areas called monsoon depressions that have very broad centers. Associated strong winds (often 30-40 kt) and convection are usually 100 nm or more from  Continued on Page 47  Figure 1. The 1998 Atlantic hurricane and tropical storm tracks.

Monsoon depressions lack the structure of a tropical cyclone. However, they can develop into tropical cyclones if convection forms near the center. The period 25 August through 10 September 1998, saw an unusually strong monsoon trough form from the western Gulf of Mexico across Mexico into the Pacific. The trough helped spawn Hurricane  Earl and Tropical Storm Frances in the Gulf, and Hurricane Isis and Tropical Storm Javier in the Pacific. All four systems were formed from tropical waves. However, interaction with the monsoon gave them monsoon depression characteristics during their initial development. Figure 3 shows the Tropical Prediction Center (TPC) Tropical Analysis and Forecast Branch (TAFB) surface analysis for 0600 UTC 31 August showing the pre-  Earl and pre-Isis disturbances. Notice the large size of both systems, with the pre-Isis low already 900 nm wide. Both systems were producing 25-30 kt winds at this time but lacked the organized convection needed for tropical depressions. That soon formed, as Earl became a tropical storm later that day and Isis the next day.  Continued on Page 48  Figure 4.

At the far left is Javier, which has just become a tropical depression. The large cloud swirl covering the western Gulf of Mexico and adjacent land areas is the preFrances low, which lacks organized convection. Notice the large area of clouds over the Pacific south of southeastern Mexico and Central America. This is associated with 20-25 kt southwest monsoon flow. A similar but weaker surge occurred in October. This helped develop Mitch, Kay, Lester, Madeline, and a Gulf of Mexico low. Monsoon trough development this strong is unusual over the eastern Pacific and rare over the Gulf of Mexico. However, similar (but weaker) development was seen there during the 1995 hurricane season (Landsea et al., 1998). One such episode helped produce Tropical Storm Gabrielle in the Gulf and Hurricane Flossie in the Pacific.  with an additional hurricane (Earl) left over from August. Two of these became major hurricanes. The Eastern Pacific produced six cyclones, of which five became tropical storms and four became hurricanes. One reached major hurricane status. 1. Atlantic: Hurricane Earl: As the period opened, Tropical Storm Earl was strengthening over the western Gulf of Mexico (Figure 1). An upper level trough steered the cyclone north-northeast on 1 September and northeast for the rest of its life. Earl reached hurricane strength on 2 September with a peak intensity of 85 kt later that day. A weakening hurricane made landfall over Panama City, Florida, early on 3 September. It weakened and became extratropical over the southeastern U.S. later that day. Extratropical Earl was trackable until 8 September, when it was absorbed by a larger low (ex-Hurricane Danielle) over the north Atlantic. The combination of monsoon characteristics and trough interaction gave Earl a non-classical structure. An eye never formed, and the strongest winds were in a band well east of the center. Strong winds affected the central and eastern Gulf. A U.S. Navy ship reported 40 kt winds with gusts to 70 kt and a pressure of 989.7 mb at 2100 2 September. Buoy 42039 reported 45 kt winds with gusts to 63 kt and a pressure  of 989.4 mb on 3 September. The minimum pressure recorded by reconnaissance aircraft was 985 mb on 3 September. Earl was responsible for three deaths and U.S. damages of $79 million. Tropical Storm Frances: Frances' initial development was similar to Earl's a week earlier. The cyclone first developed over the southern Gulf of Mexico and northwest Caribbean on 4 September. It drifted northwest and became Tropical Depression Six about 140 nm east of Brownsville, Texas, on 8 September (Figure 1). An erratic southward drift occurred on 9 September. This was followed by a north-northwest motion the next day as the system became a tropical storm. Frances reached a peak intensity of 55 kt at landfall just north of Corpus Christi, Texas, early on 11 September. The cyclone looped near the coast after landfall, and it remained a tropical storm until 12 September. A northward track resumed later that day, and the remnant low moved into the central U.S. before dissipating on 14 September. Frances' size produced a large area of tropical storm force winds mainly east of the center. The Coastal Marine Automated Network (C-MAN) station at Sea Rim State Park, Texas, reported 44 kt winds with gusts to 57 kt at 1210 11 September. Buoy 42002 reported 38 kt winds with a gust to Continued on Page 49  III. Significant Weather of the Period Note: All times are UTC unless stated otherwise. A.

Two offshore oil rigs, the K7R8 and the KS58, reported hurricane- force gusts of 77 kt and 70 kt respectively. Minimum pressure reported by reconnaissance aircraft was 990 mb just before landfall. A Louisiana tornado caused the only known fatality in Frances.  Widespread heavy rains of up to 16 inches across eastern Texas and Louisiana caused flooding that contributed most of the $500 million damage estimated for the storm. Hurricane Georges: This classic Cape Verde hurricane began when a tropical wave spawned Tropical Depression Seven near 10N 25W on 15 September (Figure 1). The cyclone followed a general west to  west-northwest track for the next ten days, reaching tropical storm and hurricane strength on 16 and 17 September, respectively. Faster strengthening occurred on 19 September (Figure 5), and Georges reached a peak intensity of 135 kt and an aircraft-measured minimum pressure of 937 mb early the next day. Georges moved through the Leeward Islands, the Continued on Page 50  Figure 5. GOES-8 visible image of Hurricane Georges at 1545 UTC 19 September 1998.

It smashed into the Dominican Republic the next day with 105 kt winds. This encounter weakened the cyclone, and it moved across Haiti into eastern Cuba as a minimal hurricane on 23 September. Slow re-intensification occurred on 24-25 September as Georges moved along the north Cuban coast and across Key West, Florida. A northwest motion occurred on 26-27 September as the hurricane maintained 90-95 kt winds (Figure 6). A northward turn took place on 28 September, which brought Georges to a final landfall near Biloxi, Mississippi. After a loop, Georges moved east and merged with a frontal system near the Georgia coast on 1 October. Ships generally avoided Georges. The PROJECT ARABIA reported 44 kt sustained winds and a 1002.9 mb pressure at 1500 29 September. Nearer the coast, the C-MAN station at Sombrero Key, Florida, reported 81 kt winds with gusts to 92 kt at 1500 25 September. Buoy 42040 reported 54 kt winds with gusts to 68 kt at 1900 27 September and a minimum pressure of 963.4 mb four hours later. The buoy also reported significant wave heights of 36 ft. Georges is responsible for an estimated 601 deaths, primarily due to flooding and mudslides in the Dominican Republic and Haiti. Total damage figures are not  known. However, U.S. damages are estimated at $5.91 billion including $3.5 billion in Puerto Rico. Tropical Storm Hermine: Tropical Depression Eight formed in the central Gulf of Mexico near 27N 90W on 17 September (Figure 1). The system's origins were complex, involving two tropical waves, an upper level low, and the remains of the monsoon flow over the Gulf. The cyclone made a slow cyclonic loop that ended with a northward track on 19 September. It reached tropical storm strength later that day. Hermine reached a peak intensity of 40 kt and an aircraft-measured minimum pressure of 999 mb just before landfall near Cocodrie, Louisiana, early on 20 September. The system dissipated over land later that day. Oil rig KS58 reported 42 kt winds with gusts to 51 kt at 1345 19 September. The TMM Mexico (XCMG) reported 35 kt winds at 1200 the same day. Two associated tornadoes caused the one injury and minor damage associated with Hermine. Hurricane Ivan: Tropical Depression Nine formed from a tropical wave near 13N 27W on 19 September (Figure 1). Initially moving west, the cyclone turned northwest the next day and continued this motion through 21 September. The depression became Tropical Storm Ivan late on 20 September, and slow strengthening continued for the  next two days despite interaction with two upper level troughs. Ivan moved north-northwest from 2224 September and reached hurricane strength early on the 24th. The hurricane recurved northeastward on 25-26 September, while reaching a peak intensity of 80 kt (Figure 6). Weakening followed as Ivan turned east, and it became extratropical about 300 nm northeast of the Azores on 27 September. The TINEKE reported 89 kt winds at 0300 24 September. However, the reliability of the report is suspect. The highest reliable winds are from the SLAVONIJA and HADERA, which reported 35 kt at 0600 22 September and 1200 23 September respectively. There are no reports of damage or casualties from Ivan. Hurricane Jeanne: Tropical Depression Ten formed from a tropical wave near 10N 17W late on 20 September (Figure 1). The genesis was unusually far east for an Atlantic tropical cyclone, as only one other known cyclone (Tropical Storm Christine in 1973) formed further east. Moving westnorthwest, the cyclone reached tropical storm strength on 21 September, and hurricane strength the next day. It reached a peak intensity of 90 kt on 24 September. Jeanne followed a smooth curve track around an eastern Atlantic ridge, turning northwest by 25 September, north on 26 September, northeast by 28 Continued on Page 51  50 Mariners Weather Log   Marine Weather Review Tropical Prediction Center Continued from Page 50 September, and east by 30 September. The cyclone maintained hurricane strength until 29 September, and then rapidly weakened. It was a depression when it passed through the Azores on 30 September, and it became extratropical just east of the islands later that day. Extratropical Jeanne continued east and moved into Portugal on 4 October. A French drifting buoy reported 75 kt winds at 1900 26 September.  The TEIGNBANK and AUCKLAND STAR reported 36 kt winds at 1200 and 1800 28 September respectively. Gusts to 35 kt were reported in the Azores. There are no reports of damage or casualties from Jeanne. Hurricane Karl: A non-tropical low formed near the coast of the Carolinas on 21 September, and tracked east. Convection became better organized, and the low became Tropical Depression Eleven about 50 nm west-north-  west of Bermuda on 23 September (Figure 1). The depression turned east-southeast and reached tropical storm strength on 24 September. This was followed by an eastward turn and hurricane strength the next day. When Karl became a hurricane, it marked the first time since 22 August 1893, that four Atlantic hurricanes existed simultaneously (Figure 6). Karl turned northeast on 26 September, and this motion continued for the rest of the Continued on Page 52  Figure 6.

It reached a peak intensity of 90 kt on 27 September. The hurricane weakened to a tropical storm on 28 September, and became extratropical later that day about 180 nm north of the Azores. Extratropical Karl was trackable until just west of France on 29 September.  There are no reports of damage, casualties, or tropical storm force winds from Karl. Hurricane Lisa: A tropical wave spawned Tropical Depression Twelve near 14N 46W on 5 October (Figure 1). Despite strong wind shear, the system became a tropical storm later that day. Initially moving northwest, Lisa recurved northeast on 6 October,  and this motion continued until a northward turn on 8 October. Acceleration occurred with the forward speed exceeding 50 kt by late on 9 September. Lisa briefly became a minimal hurricane on that day, and it became extratropical near 52N 32W early the next day.  Continued on Page 53  52 Mariners Weather Log   Marine Weather Review Tropical Prediction Center Continued from Page 52 A NOAA drifting buoy reported 35 and 36 kt winds at 0850 and 2138 5 October, which helped determine that Lisa had become a tropical storm. The CHIQUITA FRANCES reported 61 kt winds at 1800 9 October. There are no reports of damage or casualties from Lisa. Hurricane Mitch: This classic late-season Caribbean hurricane began when a tropical wave spawned Tropical Depression Thirteen near 12N 76W early on 22 October (Figure 1). Initially moving west, the system reached tropical storm strength later that day. Mitch made a small loop on 23 October. This was followed by a northward motion on 24 October as it reached hurricane strength. Mitch turned to a west to westnorthwest track on 25-26 October, while rapidly intensifying. Maximum sustained winds reached 155 kt at 1800 26 October, with an aircraft-measured central pressure of 905 mb (Figure 7). Mitch weakened while moving westsouthwest on 27 October, and further weakening took place when the storm stalled near 16N 86W the next day. It drifted south on 29 October, which brought Mitch across the coast of Honduras with 85 kt winds. The cyclone moved south and southwest across Central America on 30 October. Since the large circulation covered parts of both the Caribbean and the Pacific, Mitch was slow to  weaken. It remained at tropical storm strength until late on 31 October, while moving west over land. Most tropical cyclones die after several days over land, but Mitch proved quite tenacious. The remnant low continued west and northwest across Central America and Mexico, and it emerged over the southwest Gulf of Mexico on 2 November. It recurved northeast and re-intensified into a tropical storm the next day. The reborn Mitch moved northeast across the Yucatan Peninsula on 4 November, and the Florida Peninsula on 5 November. It became extratropical over the Atlantic later that day. Extratropical Mitch continued to pack a punch. The storm was tracked until it was northwest of the British Isles on 9 November, and associated gales continued for 2-3 days after Mitch moved north of 31N. The 905 mb central pressure is the lowest observed pressure of record in an October Atlantic hurricane. It also ties Mitch with Hurricane Camille for the fourth lowest observed in Atlantic hurricanes. Only Hurricane Gilbert of 1988 (888 mb), the Florida Keys Labor Day Hurricane of 1935 (892 mb), and Hurricane Allen of 1980 (899 mb) are known to have lower pressures. Mitch had wide-ranging marine effects. Many ships reported tropical storm force winds, including the SEABOARD  MARINER (C6HH3) with 54 kt at 1500 31 October and the CARNIVAL DESTINY (3FKZ3) with two reports of 48 kt on 4 November. The C-MAN station at Fowey Rocks, Florida, reported 52 kt winds with gusts to 63 kt at 1300 5 November. Swells produced by the hurricane over the Caribbean spread for hundreds of miles and were felt along the northern Gulf of Mexico coast. Great intensity, large size, and slow movement combined to produce a ghastly tragedy over Central America. An estimated 9,055 people were killed, mainly in Honduras and Nicaragua. At least that many more are missing. Property damage is in the billions. The vast majority of the damage and casualties were from prolonged heavy rains and flooding, not winds and storm surge. However, the sailing ship FANTOME was lost in Mitch near Guanaja Island, Honduras, on 27 October. All 31 aboard perished after an extensive search found only small amounts of debris from the ship. Hurricane Nicole: This late season hurricane developed into a tropical depression and tropical storm near 28N 28W on 24 November (Figure 1). It formed from a non-tropical low that had persisted in eastern Atlantic for two weeks. The track was a smooth curve: an initial westsouthwest motion, then west on 26-28 November, then recurvature Continued on Page 54  April 1999 53   Marine Weather Review Tropical Prediction Center Continued from Page 53 northeastward on 28-30 November, followed by a northward acceleration on 1 December. The intensity was not so simple. An initial rapid development to 60 kt on 24 November was followed by gradual weakening to a depression on 26 November. Regeneration to a tropical storm occurred late on 27 November, with hurricane status reached on 30 November. A peak intensity of 75 kt occurred early on 1 November. Nicole weakened to a tropical storm before becoming extratropical later that day near 43N 34W. The MAGIC confirmed satellite estimates that Nicole had developed. It reported 36 kt winds at 1200 24 November, and 58 kt winds six hours later. Additionally, the MOSEL ORE (ELRE5) reported 49 kt winds at 0900 1 December. There are no reports of damage or casualties from Nicole. 2. Eastern Pacific: Hurricane Isis: The disturbance that became Isis first developed in the last few days of August. A weak tropical wave interacting with the monsoon spawned a broad low on 29 August, several hundred miles west-southwest of the Mexican coast. The low grew in both size and strength as it moved north (Figure 3). Associated convection became better organized and the system became  a tropical depression near 18N 109W early on 1 September (Figure 2). Ship reports indicated the system became a tropical storm later that day. Isis continued north for the rest of its life. It crossed the southern tip of Baja, California, as a tropical storm on 2 September, then it reached a peak intensity of 65 kt later that day. The hurricane maintained this intensity until landfall near Los Mochis, Mexico, early on 3 September. Isis dissipated over northwest Mexico early the next day. The TCFC (name not available) reported 40 kt winds at 1800 1 September, and 45 kt winds at 0000 2 September. The AMTC (name not available) reported 54 kt winds and a 997.6 mb pressure at 0600 2 September, while the DOLE ECUADOR reported Beaufort force 10 (48-55 kt) and a 993 mb pressure at 2300 1 September. Isis was responsible for eight deaths in Mexico. Hundreds of homes were reported destroyed. Tropical Storm Javier: Javier formed from the interaction of the monsoon flow with a tropical wave which spawned Atlantic Hurricane Danielle. The monsoon depression developed off the Mexican coast on 5 September. It consolidated into Tropical Depression Eleven-E near 18N 107W on 6 September, and into Tropical Storm Javier the next day (Figure 2). Javier initially moved northwest. It slowed to an eastward  drift between Baja California and Socorro Island on 8 September, as it reached a 50 kt peak intensity. The drift continued on 9-10 September, as Javier weakened to a depression. This was followed by a southeast motion on 11 September. Recurvature to the northeast occurred on 12 September as Javier regained tropical storm status. This brief second peak intensity was 45 kt. The northeast track continued until landfall as a depression near Cabo Corrientes, Mexico, early on 14 September. The cyclone dissipated over land later that day. The SUN ACE (3EMJ6) reported 44 kt winds and a 1004.4 mb pressure at 2100 12 September. This was instrumental in determining that Javier had re-intensified. There are no reports of damage or casualties from Javier. Tropical Depression Twelve-E: Tropical Depression Twelve-E formed near 21N 109W on 1 October. It drifted slowly northwest until it dissipated near 22N 110W on 3 October. Maximum sustained winds were estimated at 30 kt. Hurricane Kay: Tropical Depression Thirteen-E formed near 16N 118W on 13 October (Figure 2). Initial strengthening was rapid, with the system reaching both tropical storm and hurricane strength later that day. Kay initially drifted west, then it turned Continued on Page 55  54 Mariners Weather Log   Marine Weather Review Tropical Prediction Center Continued from Page 54 southwest on 14 October, while weakening to a tropical storm. This was followed by a south to southeast drift until dissipation. Kay weakened to a depression on 15 October, and dissipated near 11N 120W on 17 October. The remnant low drifted east and was eventually absorbed into the ITCZ. There are no reports of damage, casualties, or tropical storm force winds from Kay. Hurricane Lester: Lester formed from the same tropical wave that spawned Atlantic Hurricane Lisa. The wave moved into the Pacific on 12 October, and developed into Tropical Depression Fourteen-E early on 15 October, near 11N 92W (Figure 2). Drifting northwest, the system reached tropical storm strength later that day and hurricane strength the next day. Lester turned west on 17 October, passing about 60 nm south of Puerto Angel, Mexico. The same motion with a faster forward speed continued through 19 October. The hurricane moved westnorthwest on 20-21 October, then stalled near 17N 109W on 22 October. The stall coincided with the peak intensity of 100 kt. A southwest motion and weakening to a tropical storm occurred on 23 October. Lester resumed a westnorthwest motion on 24 October, that continued for the rest of its life. The storm weakened to a depression on 26 October, and  dissipated later that day near 18N 115W. Shipping avoided Lester and the associated strong winds stayed mostly offshore. Thus, there are no reports of damage, casualties, or tropical storm force winds. However, associated heavy rains and coastal flooding did affect portions of southern Mexico. Reconnaissance aircraft flew into Lester and measured a 973 mb pressure on 18 October. Hurricane Madeline: Tropical Depression Fifteen-E formed about 200 nm west-southwest of Manzanillo, Mexico, on 16 October (Figure 2). The cyclone moved north-northwest and became Tropical Storm Madeline later that day. Madeline turned northeast on 17 October, as it reached hurricane strength, and a slow turn to the north occurred the next day as winds peaked at 75 kt (Figure 8). At this time, Madeline was about 90 nm west of the Mexican coast. Rapid weakening started as Madeline turned northwest on 19 October, and by early on 20 October, Madeline was a depression. The system dissipated later that day near 24N 109W. A few ships reported tropical storm force winds in Madeline. Most notable was the STAR TRONDANGER (LAQQ2), which reported 50 kt winds and a 1003.8 mb pressure at 2100 17 October. The ALLIGATOR RELIANCE (ZCBN5), which had encountered Mitch the week before, reported 40 kt and 1002.5 mb at 0900 the  same day. Reconnaissance aircraft also flew into Madeline and measured a 980 mb central pressure at 2153Z on 18 October. Although Madeline passed near the Islas Marias, there are no reports of damage or casualties. B. Other Significant Events 1. Atlantic: Tropical/Hybrid Low: A broad low pressure area formed over the northwest Caribbean Sea on 19 October. Associated convection gradually organized as the low crossed the Yucatan Peninsula into the Gulf of Mexico on 20-21 October. To this point, the development resembled the early stages of Earl and Frances. However, on 22 October, the system interacted with a strong cold front (with gales to the north) and turned south. It moved inland over the Isthmus of Tehuantepec on 23 October and dissipated over land the next day. Several ships and land stations reported tropical storm force winds during this event. These included a 58 kt gust at Villahermosa, Mexico, at 1345 23 October, and 45 kt sustained winds from the SEALAND FREEDOM (V7AM3) at 0000 the same day. A reconnaissance aircraft observed 70 kt winds about 120 nm west of the center at 1715 that day. While the reports suggest the system was of tropical storm strength, many winds were Continued on Page 56  April 1999 55   Marine Weather Review Tropical Prediction Center Continued from Page 55 associated with the cold air surge while others (such as Villahermosa) came from areas known for terrain-enhanced winds. The exact nature of this cyclone is uncertain. The tropical origin and attempts to develop central convection (particularly on 23 October) suggest tropical cyclone characteristics. However, the cold front and a broad center suggest non-tropical characteristics.  Other Events: Two cold fronts produced gales in the TPC area in December. The first was over the Gulf of Mexico on 22-23 December, and the second was over the western Atlantic on 30-31 December. A large high pressure system over the North Atlantic produced gales over the region south of Bermuda and east of the Bahamas on 2-3 December. 2. Eastern Pacific: Three Gulf of Tehuantepec gale events occurred, with the most  notable being the prolonged event of 12-19 December. The other events were 2-3 December and 2427 December. Two gale-producing cold fronts affected the area on 30 November and 6-8 December.  IV. References Landsea, C. W., G. D. Bell, W. M. Gray, and S. B.

The Alaska State ferries make only a few sailings a year across the Gulf of Alaska, and seldom during the winter months. This was an excellent opportunity for me to observe the weather and check the marine forecasts and our new marine verification program. The distance from Juneau to Seward, across the Gulf, is 600 nautical miles. At 16 knots, it took 36 hours to make the trip. We departed Juneau at at 7 a.m. January 5, and arrived back in Juneau at 3 p.m. January 8. The trip included an eight-hour stopover in Seward. Prevailing winds, northbound and southbound, were northeast, 15 to 30 knots, and seas ranged from 6 to 12 feet. Southbound, near Yakutat, wind speed reached 44 knots with seas to 19 feet. The  I  gale force winds lasted for three hours. I was given free access to the bridge, and spent many hours there. I spent much of my time with the captains and mates explaining and interpreting weather maps received onboard. I also stressed the importance of the Voluntary Observing Ship (VOS) program. The KTVA-TV crew onboard for this special sailing interviewed me twice during the trip. Perhaps the highlight of this trip was being able to see first hand how important a single marine observation can be. On January 4, the captain on the KENNICOTT called the National Weather Service Forecast office Juneau with a report that the wind speed in Lynn Canal was 60 kts (a bit stronger than the forecast). The duty forecaster took immediate action and upgraded our forecast to ""storm warning,"" thereby  alerting other vessels and mariners. Three of the ship captains I met with on this trip stated that they would be willing to participate in the VOS program. Arrangements have been made to implement the VOS programs on the KENNICOTT and TUSTUMENA. All the Alaska State ferries are now paricipating in our marine verification program (by informing the weather service whenever conditions are different than forecast). The captain on the M/V TUSTUMENA asked me to take another trip on his ship. He said that to improve our service, we must continue to work closely together. I think it's important for mariners and weather forecasters to know more about their respective work and services. When we know more about each other's needs, we can better work together. This will result in better products and smoother sailing for the mariners.h April 1999 59   Coas tal F orecast Of fice New s  Coastal Forecast Of fice News Southern California Area Don Whitlow Marine Focal Point National Weather Service Office San Diego  lthough the weather over the coastal waters of San Diego County is usually quite mild, on occasion, some weather conditions can cause havoc with boaters. A Santa Ana* condition on December 15, 1998, caused strong east winds that produced four- to six-foot wind waves. Along with a northwest swell of three to six feet, the confused sea state which developed nearly sank a commercial fishing boat about two miles off Point Loma. Several other boats needed assistance from the Coast Guard. Winds of 30 to 40 knots were reported during the event,  A  with an unofficial gust of 57 knots reported. Fog can also catch boaters unprepared if they are inexperienced and do not carry the proper equipment. During the first few weeks of January 1999, Southern California coastal waters had much fog. Boaters must be prepared to slow down, as there are many kinds of things they can run into. Also, the fog will redevelop at night (sometimes sooner than expected), and may catch some sailors unprepared. As a result of the recent foggy conditions, some boaters requested  Coast Guard escorts into harbors. The Coast Guard recommends that sailors carry a VHF radio, be cognizant of your equipment and navigation, use a GPS unit, and bring an EPIRB. Lifejackets are a must.  *A Santa Ana wind condition results from high pressure at the surface building behind a frontal system and moving into the great basin. This causes a moderate to strong pressure gradient and gusty northeast winds in Southern California.h  60 Mariners Weather Log   VOS Program  Voluntar y Obser ving Ship Program Martin S.

Continued on Page 62  April 1999 61   VOS Program VOS Program Continued from Page 61  Reporting Sea and Swell With the possible exception of the wind, waves have a greater impact on vessel operations than any other observed element in the Ships Synoptic Code. Reporting sea and swell is a unique responsibility peculiar to shipboard observers--weather observers on land have no comparable data to record, since the ground is not fluid and does not move. The ships synoptic code contains four wave groups. This is to report your local wind-driven sea and up to two different observed swells. Three wave characteristics are reported: (1) wave period (for sea and swell), (2) wave direction (for swell only, sea wave direction is not reported since it is presumed to be the wind direction reported as dd in group Nddff), and (3) wave height (for sea and swell). Sea waves are produced by the local wind, either at the time of observation, or in the recent past. Swell waves are waves that have travelled into your area after having been produced by distant winds, which can be a great distance (thousands of miles) away. In general, swell waves are long in comparison to sea, because shorter wavelength swell waves tend to dissipate (they have less energy and don't travel as far). The longest swells travel the greatest distances, and also travel faster than shorter swells (wave speed equals 3.1 times wave period in seconds). As swell travels, it's height decreases (after travelling 1200 miles, a swell loses about half it's height). Sea wave period (PwPw) and swell wave period (Pw1Pw1Pw2Pw2) are the time intervals in seconds, for successive wave crests or troughs to pass a given point. Choose a distinctive patch of foam or a small floating object, and note the time it takes for it to go from one one crest or trough to the next. Note several such oscillations, and report the average period you have observed. There is no code table for period--it's reported in seconds. Swell direction (dw1dw1dw2dw2), like wind direction, is the true direction from which the waves are coming. This is coded using the wind direction table (true direction from 00-36). When only one swell is reported, code dw2dw2 as //. Sea wave height (HwHw) and swell wave height (Hw1Hw1Hw2Hw2) are a measure of the vertical distance between the the top of a wave crest and the bottom of an adjacent trough. As estimates, they depend on the skill and ingenuity of the observer. Use a known height, such as that of a man, bulwark, forecastle, or other known ship dimension. Since wave trains always contain waves of varying heights, report the average height of the larger, better formed waves in your visual range (significant wave height). The code for wave height is in units of half meters, i.e., code figure 10 is 5 meters or 16 feet. Swell has an intriguing use as a weather forecast guide--longer swells will travel ahead of and give advance warning of a storm (which may or may not be approaching your ship). To determine if the storm is coming closer to your vessel, review your cloud as well as your swell observations. Advancing and thickening storm clouds accompanied by increasing swell is a good indication that a storm system with strong winds and heavy seas is approaching.

If you are sending your completed Ships Weather Observations Forms to him, please correct the mailing address on the PMO envelopes (which are pre-printed with the Newark address). The new address is: Tim Kenefick, PMO NOAA, NWS 110 Lower Main Street, Suite 201 South Amboy, NJ 08879-1367 Telephone: 732-316-5409 Fax: 732-316-7643 Pager: 888-399-6512 Email: timothy.kenefick@noaa.gov  Summar y of Weather Report Transmission Procedures Weather observations sent by ships participating in the VOS program are sent at no cost to the ship except as noted. The stations listed accept weather observations which enter an automated system at National Weather Service headquarters. This system is not intended for other types of messages. To communicate with NWS personnel, see phone numbers and e-mail addresses at the beginning of this manual. INMARSAT Follow the instructions with your INMARSAT terminal for sending a telex message. Use the special dialing code 41 (except when using the SEAS/AMVER software in compressed binary format with INMARSAT C), and do not request a confirmation. Here is a typical procedure for using an INMARSAT A transceiver: 1 2 3 4 5 6 . . . . . . Select appropriate Land Earth Station Identity (LES-ID). See table below. Select routine priority. Select duplex telex channel. Initiate the call. Wait for the GA+ signal. Select the dial code for meteorological reports, 41+. Upon receipt of our answerback, NWS OBS MHTS, transmit the weather message starting with BBXX and the ship's call sign. The message must be ended with five periods. Do not send any preamble.

Land-Earth Station Identity (LES-ID) of U.S. Inmarsat Stations Accepting Ships Weather (BBXX) and Oceanographic (JJYY) Reports Operator Service AOR-W COMSAT COMSAT COMSAT COMSAT STRATOS/IDB STRATOS/IDB STRATOS/IDB Use abbreviated dialing code 41. Do not request a confirmation If your ship's Inmarsat terminal does not contain a provision for using abbreviated dialing code 41, TELEX address 0023089406 may be used via COMSAT. Please note that the ship will incur telecommunication charges for any messages sent to TELEX address 0023089406 using any Inmarsat earth station other than COMSAT. Some common mistakes include: (1) failure to end the message with five periods when using INMARSAT A, (2) failure to include BBXX in the message preamble, (3) incorrectly coding the date, time, latitude, longitude, or quadrant of the globe, (4) requesting a confirmation.

The U.S. Coast Guard is able to accept, at no cost to the ship, AMVER reports transmitted via Inmarsat-C in a compressed binary format, created using the AMVER/SEAS program. Typically, in the past, the cost of transmission for AMVER messages has been assumed by the vessel. When ships participate in both the SEAS and AMVER programs, the position of ship provided in the meteorological report is forwarded to the Coast Guard as a supplementary AMVER position report to maintain a more accurate plot. To obtain the AMVER/SEAS program contact your U.S. PMO or AMVER/SEAS representative listed at the back of this publication. Continued on Page 65  64 Mariners Weather Log   VOS Program VOS Program Continued from Page 64 If using the NOAA AMVER/SEAS software, follow the instructions outlined in the AMVER/SEAS User 's Manual. When using Inmarsat-C, use the compressed binary format and 8-bit X.25 (PSDN) addressing (31102030798481), rather than TELEX if possible when reporting weather. Common errors when using the AMVER/SEAS include sending the compressed binary message via the code 41 or a plain text message via the X.25 address. Only COMSAT can accept messages in the compressed binary format. Text editors should normally not be utilized in sending the data in the compressed binary format as this may corrupt the message.  Telephone (Landline, Cellular, Satphone, etc.) The following stations will accept VOS weather observations via telephone. Please note that the ship will be responsible for the cost of the call in this case. GLOBE WIRELESS MARITEL WLO 650-726-6588 228-897-7700 334-666-5110  The National Weather Service is developing a dial-in bulletin board to accept weather observations using a simple PC program and modem. The ship will be responsible for the cost of the call when using this system.

The significant wave height is defined as the average height of the highest onethird of the waves during the average period each hour. The maximum significant wave height is the highest of those values for that month. At most stations, air temperature, water temperature, wind speed and direction are sampled once per second during an 8.0-minute averaging period each hour (moored buoys) and a 2.0-minute averaging period for fixed stations (C-MAN). Contact NDBC Data Systems Division, Bldg. 1100, SSC, Mississippi 39529 or phone (601) 688-1720 for more details.

Evidence from ice cores, tree rings, corals, historical records and sediments in lakes was used by a team of university and NOAA scientists to obtain the yearly maps, extending the history of global climate to a time before people began taking measurements with weather instruments.          Writing in the online journal Earth Interactions, the scientists note that their work highlights periods of unusual climatic conditions, such as the period of ""dry fogs"" that were reported by Benjamin Franklin in the 1780s.  The new study shows that the hazy conditions Franklin described from his home (at that time, in Paris) were related to a cold episode that affected all of Europe for several years following the eruption of a volcano in Iceland (Laki) in 1784.  Other major eruptions have had similar climatic effects.  After the eruption of Tambora in Indonesia in 1815, temperatures in North America and Europe fell sharply, and cool conditions prevailed for several years.     The current study provides an interactive database that can be used to examine maps of global temperature patterns for any year since 1730.  These are based on natural archives such as ice cores, tree-rings, lake sediments, and corals, which record seasonal or annual climate conditions.  Data from the natural archives were calibrated by the instrumental surface temperature data available during the 20th century.       The study also provided a longer-term view of temperatures across the northern hemisphere.  ""The best evidence, based on the extension of hemispheric climate reconstructions back a full millennium is that late 20th century conditions are probably warmer than those which prevailed any time this millennium,"" the scientists wrote.  They noted that conditions during the 11th through 14th centuries appear warmer than those which prevailed during the 15th through 19th centuries in general.      The scientists also studied the statistical relationship between variations in the northern hemisphere mean temperatures and estimates of the histories of solar, greenhouse gas, and volcanic factors.  ""While the natural -- solar and volcanic -- forcings appear to be important factors governing the natural variations of temperatures in past centuries, only human greenhouse gas forcing alone....can statistically explain the unusual warmth of the past few decades,"" they wrote.

Bradley and Frank Keimig, University of Massachusetts; Jonathan Overpeck, formerly of NOAA, now with the University of Arizona, and Malcolm K. Hughes, University of Arizona.      The publication, titled Global Temperature Patterns in Past Centuries, contains the latest look at temperatures over the last 600 years, and includes data and  animations of global temperatures from paleoclimatic records starting in 1730, up through instrumental data through 1993.

GX226-18-13990627	What Microwaves Teach Us About the Atmosphere     [  MSU Home  ]    Mankind's impact on the global climate and whether pollution from modern energy use is indeed warming the Earth have become important issues for national and international policy makers. Political pressure and public sentiment are based on complex data sets that, alone, cannot tell the whole story. The ultimate question is whether our climate is becoming warmer because of the slow build-up in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. The answer is not clear, because much of what we know about global climate change in inferred from historical evidence of uncertain quality. Reliable ground-based measurements by scientific instruments have been made just in this century. These measure conditions only at the location of each instrument, and they are usually land-based, although 75% of the Earth is covered with water. We have been able to take precise, direct measurements only in the last four decades, and not until the advent of precision spaceborne instruments in the 1970s were we able to measure global temperatures at a range of altitudes across the entire atmosphere.    GHCC scientists have compiled two decades of data showing how atmospheric temperature has behaved over the entire globe. All matter emits microwave radiation that varies with its temperature, among other factors. Microwave sensors on weather satellites can take more than 60,000 temperature measurements of oxygen in the atmosphere, from the surface to about 10 km (6 mi) altitude. The story that these measurements tell is more complex than simply saying the Earth is warming or cooling. Temperatures in the lower troposphere (the portion of the atmosphere where we live) have shown a series of ups and downs since 1979, mostly in a ±0.4oC band, with negligible trends over that period. This contrasts with surface thermometers that show warming during the same period of time. The 1997-98 El Nino caused strong lower tropospheric warming in late 1997, and record warmth in February 1998. Satellite measurements of the lower stratosphere reveal two marked warm periods (as much as 1.5oC warmer), caused by sulfuric acid aerosols deposited in this layer by the eruptions of two large volcanoes. These two warm periods are superimposed upon a strong cooling trend over the 19-year period that has been attributed to ozone depletion in the lower stratosphere. In 1997, record low stratospheric temperatures were recorded. This is an ongoing research effort that will have greater impact as more data are collected and analyzed.       Microwave measurements from satellites are also being utilized to measure rainfall. Because oceanic rainfall is particularly difficult to measure by conventional methods, additional data from the satellites have been utilized since 1979 to monitor oceanic precipitation and temperatures. Studies of tropical rainfall from these data have revealed large increases during El Nino years, such as 1997-98. Future satellite data from planned instruments, such as the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer, will fuel further research into such processes. These efforts will help us better understand how the atmosphere adjusts to climate perturbations, such as increasing levels of greenhouse gases.
