General George Washington first raised the Continental Army flag in 1776, a red-and-white striped flag with the British Union Jack where we now have stars. Several flag designs with 13 stripes were used in 1776 and 1777, until Congress established an official design on June 14, 1777 -- now observed as Flag Day. The act stated, ""That the Flag of the thirteen United States be thirteen stripes, alternate red and white, that the union be thirteen stars, white in a blue field, representing a new constellation."" Washington explained it this way: ""We take the stars from heaven, the red from our mother country, separating it by white stripes, thus showing that we have separated from her, and the white stripes shall go down to posterity representing liberty.""  U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Washington, D.C. 20420  the original 13 colonies, now states. This was the Star Spangled Banner"" of which Francis Scott Key wrote in 1814.  1818 Law Sets Final Form As other states entered the Union, it became obvious that stripes could not be added continually, so in 1818 Congress reestablished the 13-stripe flag for the original 13 colonies and allowed for additional stars for new states. The law specified that stripes should be horizontal, alternately red and white, and the union, or canton, should display 20 stars for the states then in the union. But it did not specify color shades or arrangement of the stars, and wide variation persisted. During the Civil War, gold stars were more common than white and the stars sometimes appeared in a circle. The first time the Stars and Stripes flew in a Flag Day celebration was in Hartford, Conn., 1861, the first summer of the Civil War. In the late 1800s, schools held Flag Day programs to contribute to the Americanization of immigrant children, and the observance caught on with individual communities. As a patriotic custom, the Stars and Stripes still flies in front of schools when classes are in session. In 1916, the president proclaimed a nationwide observance of Flag Day, but it was not until 1949 that Congress voted for Flag Day to be a permanent holiday. When the 49th and 50th stars were added in 1959 and 1960, the standards of design became even more precise. The regulated design calls for seven red and six white stripes, with the red stripes at top and bottom. The union of navy blue fills the upper left quarter from the top to the lower edge of the fourth red stripe. The stars have one point up and are in nine horizontal rows. The odd-numbered rows have six stars. The evennumbered rows have five stars, centered diagonally between the stars in the longer rows.  The First Flag No records confirm who designed the original Stars and Stripes, but historians believe Francis Hopkinson, one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence, probably modified the unofficial Continental flag into the design we now have. The State Navy Board of Pennsylvania, on May 29, 1777, commissioned Betsy Ross to sew flags for Navy vessels. Legend credits Ross with having sewn the first flag to meet the specifications outlined by Congress, while changing the stars from six points to five to speed her work. The flag was first carried in battle at Brandywine, Pa., in September 1777. It first flew over foreign territory in early 1778, at Nassau, Bahama Islands, where Americans captured a fort from the British. After Vermont and Kentucky became states in the 1790s, Congress approved adding two more stars and two more stripes to the group that represented   CELEBRATING AMERICA'S FREEDOMS ""Old Glory""  U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Washington, D.C. 20420  The name ""Old Glory"" was first applied to the U.S. flag by a young sea captain who lived in Salem, Mass. On his twenty-first birthday, March 17, 1824, Capt. William Driver was presented a beautiful flag by his mother and a group of local young ladies. Driver was delighted with the gift. He exclaimed, ""I name her `Old Glory.'"" Then Old Glory accompanied the captain on his many voyages. Captain Driver quit the sea in 1837 and settled in Nashville, Tenn. On patriotic days, he displayed Old Glory proudly from a rope extending from his house to a tree across the street. After Tennessee seceded from the Union in 1861, Captain Driver hid Old Glory by sewing the flag inside a comforter. When Union soldiers entered Nashville on February 25, 1862, Driver removed Old Glory from its hiding place, carried the flag to the state capitol building, and proudly raised it for all to see. Shortly before his death, the old sea captain placed a small bundle into the arms of his daughter. He said to her, ""Mary Jane, this is my ship flag, Old Glory. It has been my constant companion. I love it as a mother loves her child. Cherish it as I have cherished it."" The flag remained as a precious heirloom in the Driver family until 1922. Then it was sent to the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., where it is carefully preserved under glass today.   CELEBRATING AMERICA'S FREEDOMS The Pledge of Allegiance Thirty-one words which affirm the values and freedom that the American flag represents are recited while facing the flag as a pledge of Americans' loyalty to their country. The Pledge of Allegiance was written for the 400th anniversary, in 1892, of the discovery of America. A national committee of educators and civic leaders planned a public-school celebration of Columbus Day to center around the flag. Included with the script for ceremonies that would culminate in raising of the flag was the pledge. So it was in October 1892 Columbus Day programs that school children across the country first recited the Pledge of Allegiance this way:  U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Washington, D.C. 20420  I pledge allegiance to my Flag and to the Republic for which it stands: one Nation indivisible, with Liberty and Justice for all. Controversy continues over whether the author was the chairman of the committee, Francis Bellamy -- who worked on a magazine for young people that published the pledge -- or James Upham, who worked for the publishing firm that produced the magazine. The pledge was published anonymously in the magazine and was not copyrighted. According to some accounts of Bellamy as author, he decided to write a pledge of allegiance, rather than a salute, because it was a stronger expression of loyalty -- something particularly significant even 27 years after the Civil War ended. ""One Nation indivisible"" referred to the outcome of the Civil War, and ""Liberty and Justice for all"" expressed  the ideals of the Declaration of Independence. The words ""my flag"" were replaced by ""the flag of the United States"" in 1923, because some foreignborn people might have in mind the flag of the country of their birth, instead of the U.S. flag. A year later, ""of America"" was added after ""United States."" No form of the pledge received official recognition by Congress until June 22, 1942, when it was formally included in the U.S. Flag Code. The official name of The Pledge of Allegiance was adopted in 1945. The last change in language came on Flag Day 1954, when Congress passed a law which added the words ""under God"" after ""one nation."" Originally, the pledge was said with the hand in the so-called ""Bellamy Salute,"" with the hand resting first outward from the chest, then the arm extending out from the body. Once Hitler came to power in Europe, some Americans were concerned that this position of the arm and hand resembled the salute rendered by the Nazi military. In 1942, Congress established the current practice of rendering the pledge with the right hand placed flat over the heart. Section 7 of the Federal Flag Code states that when not in military uniform, men should remove any headdress with their right hand and hold it at the left shoulder, thereby resting the hand over the heart. People in military uniform should remain silent, face the flag and render the military salute. The Flag Code specifies that any future changes to the pledge would have to be with the consent of the president. The Pledge of Allegiance now reads:  I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one Nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.   CELEBRATING AMERICA'S FREEDOMS  U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Washington, D.C. 20420  Guidelines for Display of the Flag Public Law 94-344, known as the Federal Flag Code, contains rules for handling and displaying the U.S. flag. While the federal code contains no penalties for misusing the flag, states have their own flag codes and may impose penalties. The language of the federal code makes clear that the flag is a living symbol. In response to a Supreme Court decision which held that a state law prohibiting flag burning was unconstitutional, Congress enacted the Flag Protection Act in 1989. It provides that anyone who knowingly desecrates the flag may be fined and/or imprisoned for up to one year. However, this law was challenged by the Supreme Court in a 1990 decision that the Flag Protection Act violates the First Amendment free speech protections. Important Things to Remember Traditional guidelines call for displaying the flag in public only from sunrise to sunset. However, the flag may be displayed at all times if it's illuminated during darkness. The flag should not be subject to weather damage, so it should not be displayed during rain, snow and wind storms unless it is an allweather flag. It should be displayed often, but especially on national and state holidays and special occasions. The flag should be displayed on or near the main building of public institutions, schools during school days, and polling places on election days. It should be hoisted briskly and lowered ceremoniously. When carried in procession with other flags, the U.S. flag should be either on the marching right (the flag's right) or to the front and center of the flag line. When displayed on a float in a parade, the flag should be hung from a staff or suspended so it falls free. It should not be draped over a vehicle. When displayed with another flag against a wall from crossed staffs, the U.S. flag should be on its own right (left to a person facing the wall) and its staff should be in front of the other flag's staff. In a group  of flags displayed from staffs, the U.S. flag should be at the center and the highest point. When flags of states, cities or organizations are flown on the same staff, the U.S. flag must be at the top (except during church services conducted at sea by Navy chaplains). When other flags are flown from adjacent staffs, the U.S. flag should be hoisted first and lowered last. It must be on the right of other flags and no other flag should stand higher than it. Flags of other nations should be flown from separate staffs. International custom dictates that flags of different nations be displayed at the same height in peacetime and be approximately the same size.   On a casket, the union (blue field) should be at the deceased person's head and heart, over the left shoulder. But the flag should be removed before the casket is lowered into the grave and should never touch the ground. The flag may be flown at half-staff to honor a newly deceased federal or state government official by order of the president or the governor, respectively. On Memorial Day, the flag should be displayed at half-staff until noon. Whenever the flag is displayed at half-staff, it should be first raised to the top. Lowering from half-staff is preceded by first raising it momentarily to the top. Other Things Not to Do with the Flag Out of respect for the U.S. flag, never:  dip it for any person or thing, even though state flags, regimental colors and other flags may be dipped as a mark of honor.  display it with the union down, except as a signal of distress.  let the flag touch anything beneath it: ground, floor, water, merchandise.  carry it horizontally, but always aloft.  fasten or display it in a way that will permit it to be damaged or soiled.  place anything on the flag, including letters, insignia, or designs of any kind.  use it for holding anything.  use it as wearing apparel, bedding or drapery. It should not be used on a costume or athletic uniform. However, a flag patch may be attached to the uniform of patriotic organizations, military personnel, police officers and firefighters.  use the flag for advertising or promotion purposes or print it on paper napkins, boxes or anything else intended for temporary use and discard. During the hoisting or lowering of the flag or when it passes in parade or review, Americans should stand at attention facing the flag and place their right hand over the heart. Uniformed military members render the military salute. Men not in uniform should remove any headdress and hold it with their right hand at their left shoulder, the hand resting over the heart. Those who are not U.S. citizens should stand at attention. When the flag is worn out or otherwise no longer a fitting emblem for display, it should be destroyed in a dignified way, preferably by burning.  When displayed flat against the wall on a speaker's platform, the flag should be above and behind the speaker with the union on the left side as the audience looks at it (again, the flag's right). When the flag hangs from a staff in a church or public place, it should appear to the audience on the left, the speaker's right. Any other flags displayed should be placed on the opposite side of the speaker.  The flag may cover a casket, but should not cover a statue or monument for unveiling. It should never be draped or drawn back in folds. Draped red, white and blue bunting should be used for decoration, with the blue at the top and red at the bottom.   CELEBRATING AMERICA'S FREEDOMS The Story of Taps The 24-note melancholy bugle call known as ""taps"" is thought to be a revision of a French bugle signal, called ""tattoo,"" that notified soldiers to cease an evening's drinking and return to their garrisons. It was sounded an hour before the final bugle call to end the day by extinguishing fires and lights. The last five measures of the tattoo resemble taps. The word ""taps"" is an alteration of the obsolete word ""taptoo,"" derived from the Dutch ""taptoe."" Taptoe was the command -- ""Tap toe!"" -- to shut (""toe to"") the ""tap"" of a keg. The revision that gave us present-day taps was made during America's Civil War by Union Gen. Daniel Adams Butterfield, heading a brigade camped at Harrison Landing, Va., near Richmond. Up to that time, the U.S. Army's infantry call to end the day was the French final call, ""L'Extinction des feux."" Gen. Butterfield decided the ""lights out"" music was too formal to signal the day's end. One day in July 1862, he recalled the tattoo music and hummed a version of it to an aide, who wrote it down in music. Butterfield then asked the brigade bugler, Oliver W. Norton, to play the notes and, after listening, lengthened and shortened them while keeping his original melody.  U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Washington, D.C. 20420  He ordered Norton to play this new call at the end of each day thereafter, instead of the regulation call. The music was heard and appreciated by other brigades, who asked for copies and adopted this bugle call. It was even adopted by Confederate buglers. This music was made the official Army bugle call after the war, but not given the name ""taps"" until 1874. The first time taps was played at a military funeral may also have been in Virginia soon after Butterfield composed it. Union Capt. John Tidball, head of an artillery battery, ordered it played for the burial of a cannoneer killed in action. Not wanting to reveal the battery's position in the woods to the enemy nearby, Tidball substituted taps for the traditional three rifle volleys fired over the grave. Taps was played at the funeral of Confederate Gen. Stonewall Jackson 10 months after it was composed. Army infantry regulations by 1891 required taps to be played at military funeral ceremonies. Taps now is played by the military at burial and memorial services and to signal the ""lights out"" command at day's end.   CELEBRATING AMERICA'S FREEDOMS ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" This patriotic song, whose words were written by Francis Scott Key on Sept. 14, 1814, during the War of 1812 with Great Britain, was adopted by Congress as the U.S. national anthem in 1931. For many years before Congress made this choice, the song was popular and regulations for military bands required that it be played for ceremonies. Though Key wrote the words during the British bombardment of Fort McHenry at Baltimore, the melody was an English tune well known in America by the 1790s. It was the music for a poem, ""To Anacreon in Heaven,"" written about 1780 as the official song of a British social and musical organization, the Anacreontic Society. In fact, Key had used the music in 1805 to accompany another poem he wrote to honor Commodore Stephen Decatur.  U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Washington, D.C. 20420  shells at it, about 400 of them landing inside. Four defenders were killed and 24 wounded. Key drafted the words of a poem on an envelope. The American detainees were sent ashore, the British fleet withdrew, and Key finished the poem and made a good copy of it in a Baltimore hotel the next day.  Poem an Instant Hit in Baltimore According to some accounts, Key showed the poem to relatives of his wife in Baltimore who had it printed immediately and distributed throughout the city on a handbill, entitled ""The Defense of Fort McHenry."" Within a couple of weeks, Baltimore newspapers published the poem. It gained instant popularity and was renamed ""The Star-Spangled Banner."" An actor sang it to the popular British tune at a public performance in Baltimore. Only with the start of the Civil War did ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" become a nationally popular song. During World War I, a drive began in Congress to make it the official anthem of America's armed forces. There were other contenders for the title, including ""America the Beautiful"" and ""Yankee Doodle."" Maryland legislators and citizens were among the most active groups and individuals who pressed to get Francis Scott Key's words and accompanying English tune ratified into law as the country's first national anthem. That finally happened when President Herbert Hoover signed legislation on March 3, 1931. The anthem has four verses, each ending with the line, ""O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave.""  Key Detained While Negotiating Key was a well known 34-year-old Washington, D.C., lawyer-poet. The British had captured Washington and taken William Beanes, a physician, prisoner. They were holding him aboard ship in their fleet off the Baltimore shore. Friends of Beanes persuaded Key to negotiate his release. Key went out to the British fleet and succeeded in gaining Beanes' release but, because the British planned to attack Baltimore at that time, both were detained. During the night of Sept. 13-14, Key watched the bombardment of Baltimore from the deck of a British ship. Although rain obscured the fort during the night, at daybreak he could see the American flag still flying from Fort McHenry. The fort still stood after the British had fired some 1,800 bombs, rockets and   CELEBRATING AMERICA'S FREEDOMS National cemeteries in the United States for military veterans and service members began during the Civil War, near the battlefields, military hospitals and campgrounds of the war. On July 17, 1862, President Lincoln signed legislation authorizing the federal government to purchase ground for use as national cemeteries ""for soldiers who shall have died in the service of the country."" Up to then, the dead were hastily buried in fields, churchyards, or close to hospitals or prison camps where they died. After the war, Army crews searched the countryside to find and rebury the Union dead in the original 14 national cemeteries. The remains of Confederate prisoners of war were included, although it was not until 1906 that legislation approved marking their graves with headstones. The reinterment process took five years and resulted in establishing 50 more cemeteries to hold a quarter-million remains. They were reburied with honor. The new cemeteries were enclosed by brick walls and entered through ornate gates. However, the identities of nearly half of the Union dead who are buried in national cemeteries are unknown. A few of the national cemeteries developed around Union prisoner of war camps, where a large numbers of Confederate soldiers died. Eight years after the war ended, Congress opened national cemeteries to all honorably discharged veterans of the Union forces. Legislation after World War I opened them to American veterans of all wartime service. Finally, after World War II, Congress expanded eligibility for burial to all veterans of U.S. armed forces, American war veterans of allied armed forces and veterans' spouses and dependent children. From their founding until 1973, national cemeteries were operated by the Department of the Army. Today, the National Cemetery Administration is part of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). VA operates national cemeteries throughout the United  U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Washington, D.C. 20420  The National Cemetery Administration States and Puerto Rico. The Department of the Interior and the Department of the Army also administer several national cemeteries, including Arlington National Cemetery near Washington, D.C. Veterans of every conflict in which the U.S. participated -- from the Revolutionary War to the Gulf -- are buried in VA's national cemeteries. In addition to providing a gravesite, VA provides a headstone or marker, and perpetually cares for the grave at no cost to the veteran's family or heirs.

Maj. Gen. John A. Logan declared it should be May 30. It is believed the date was chosen because flowers would be in bloom all over the country. The first large observance was held that year at Arlington National Cemetery, across the Potomac River from Washington, D.C. The ceremonies centered around the mourning-draped veranda of the Arlington mansion, once the home of Gen. Robert E. Lee. Various Washington officials, including Gen. and Mrs. Ulysses S. Grant, presided over the ceremonies. After speeches, children from the Soldiers' and Sailors' Orphan Home and members of the GAR made their way through the cemetery, strewing flowers on both Union and Confederate graves, reciting prayers and singing hymns. Local Observances Claim To Be First Local springtime tributes to the Civil War dead already had been held in various places. One of the first occurred in Columbus, Miss., April 25, 1866, when a group of women visited a cemetery to decorate the graves of Confederate soldiers who had fallen in battle at Shiloh. Nearby were the graves of Union soldiers, neglected because they were the enemy. Disturbed at the sight of the bare graves, the women placed some of their flowers on those graves, as well. Today, cities in the North and the South claim to be the birthplace of Memorial Day in 1866. Both Macon and Columbus, Ga., claim  U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Washington, D.C. 20420  the title, as well as Richmond, Va. The village of Boalsburg, Pa., claims it began there two years earlier. A stone in a Carbondale, Ill., cemetery carries the statement that the first Decoration Day ceremony took place there on April 29, 1866. Carbondale was the wartime home of Gen. Logan. Approximately 25 places have been named in connection with the origin of Memorial Day, many of them in the South where most of the war dead were buried. Official Birthplace Declared In 1966, Congress and President Lyndon Johnson declared Waterloo, N.Y., the ""birthplace"" of Memorial Day. There, a ceremony on May 5, 1866, honored local veterans who had fought in the Civil War. Businesses closed and residents flew flags at half-staff. Supporters of Waterloo's claim say earlier observances in other places were either informal, not community-wide or one-time events. By the end of the 19th century, Memorial Day ceremonies were being held on May 30 throughout the nation. State legislatures passed proclamations designating the day, and the Army and Navy adopted regulations for proper observance at their facilities. It was not until after World War I, however, that the day was expanded to honor those who have died in all American wars. In 1971, Memorial Day was declared a national holiday by an act of Congress, though it is still often called Decoration Day. It was then also placed on the last Monday in May, as were some other federal holidays.   Some States Have Confederate Observances Many Southern states also have their own days for honoring the Confederate dead. Mississippi celebrates Confederate Memorial Day on the last Monday of April, Alabama on the fourth Monday of April, and Georgia on April 26. North and South Carolina observe it on May 10, Louisiana on June 3 and Tennessee calls that date Confederate Decoration Day. Texas celebrates Confederate Heroes Day January 19 and Virginia calls the last Monday in May Confederate Memorial Day. Gen. Logan's order for his posts to decorate graves in 1868 ""with the choicest flowers of springtime"" urged: ""We should guard their graves with sacred vigilance. ... Let pleasant paths invite the coming and going of reverent visitors and fond mourners. Let no neglect, no ravages of time, testify to the present or to the coming generations that we have forgotten as a people the cost of a free and undivided republic."" The crowd attending the first Memorial Day ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery was approximately the same size as those that attend today's observance, about 5,000 people. Then, as now, small American flags were placed on each grave -- a tradition followed at many national cemeteries today. In recent years, the custom has grown in many families to decorate the graves of all departed loved ones. The origins of special services to honor those  who die in war can be found in antiquity. The Athenian leader Pericles offered a tribute to the fallen heroes of the Peloponnesian War over 24 centuries ago that could be applied today to the 1.1 million Americans who have died in the nation's wars: ""Not only are they commemorated by columns and inscriptions, but there dwells also an unwritten memorial of them, graven not on stone but in the hearts of men."" To ensure the sacrifices of America's fallen heroes are never forgotten, in December 2000, the U.S. Congress passed and the president signed into law ""The National Moment of Remembrance Act,"" P.L. 106-579, creating the White House Commission on the National Moment of Remembrance. The commission's charter is to ""encourage the people of the United States to give something back to their country, which provides them so much freedom and opportunity"" by encouraging and coordinating commemorations in the United States of Memorial Day and the National Moment of Remembrance. The National Moment of Remembrance encourages all Americans to pause wherever they are at 3 p.m. local time on Memorial Day for a minute of silence to remember and honor those who have died in service to the nation. As Moment of Remembrance founder Carmella LaSpada states: ""It's a way we can all help put the memorial back in Memorial Day.""   CELEBRATING AMERICA'S FREEDOMS The Origins of Veterans Day In 1921, an unknown World War I American soldier was buried in Arlington National Cemetery. This site, on a hillside overlooking the Potomac River and the city of Washington, D.C., became the focal point of reverence for America's veterans. Similar ceremonies occurred earlier in England and France, where an unknown soldier was buried in each nation's highest place of honor (in England, Westminster Abbey; in France, the Arc de Triomphe). These memorial gestures all took place on November 11, giving universal recognition to the celebrated ending of World War I fighting at 11 a.m., November 11, 1918 (the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month). The day became known as ""Armistice Day."" Armistice Day officially received its name in America in 1926 through a Congressional resolution. It became a national holiday 12 years later by similar Congressional action. If the idealistic hope had been realized that World War I was ""the War to end all wars,"" November 11 might still be called Armistice Day. But only a few years after the holiday was proclaimed, war broke out in Europe. Sixteen and one-half million Americans took part. Four hundred seven thousand of them died in service, more than 292,000 in battle.  U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Washington, D.C. 20420  On Memorial Day 1958, two more unidentified American war dead were brought from overseas and interred in the plaza beside the unknown soldier of World War I. One was killed in World War II, the other in the Korean War. In 1984, an unknown serviceman from the Vietnam War was placed alongside the others. The remains from Vietnam were exhumed May 14, 1998, identified as Air Force 1st Lt. Michael Joseph Blassie, and removed for burial. To honor these men, symbolic of all Americans who gave their lives in all wars, an Army honor guard, the 3rd U.S. Infantry (The Old Guard), keeps day and night vigil. A law passed in 1968 changed the national commemoration of Veterans Day to the fourth Monday in October. It soon became apparent, however, that November 11 was a date of historic significance to many Americans. Therefore, in 1978 Congress returned the observance to its traditional date.  National Ceremonies Held at Arlington The focal point for official, national ceremonies for Veterans Day continues to be the memorial amphitheater built around the Tomb of the Unknowns. At 11 a.m. on November 11, a combined color guard representing all military services executes ""Present Arms"" at the tomb. The nation's tribute to its war dead is symbolized by the laying of a presidential wreath. The bugler plays ""taps."" The rest of the ceremony takes place in the amphitheater. Veterans Day ceremonies at Arlington and elsewhere are coordinated by the President's Veterans Day National Committee. Chaired by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, the committee represents national veterans organizations. Governors of states and U.S. territories appoint Veterans Day chairpersons who, in cooperation with the National Committee and the Department of Defense, arrange and promote local ceremonies.  Armistice Day Changed To Honor All Veterans The first celebration using the term Veterans Day occurred in Birmingham, Alabama, in 1947. Raymond Weeks, a World War II veteran, organized ""National Veterans Day,"" which included a parade and other festivities, to honor all veterans. The event was held on November 11, then designated Armistice Day. Later, U.S. Representative Edward Rees of Kansas proposed a bill that would change Armistice Day to Veterans Day. In 1954, Congress passed the bill that President Eisenhower signed proclaiming November 11 as Veterans Day. Raymond Weeks received the Presidential Citizens Medal from President Reagan in November 1982. Weeks' local parade and ceremonies are now an annual event celebrated nationwide.   CELEBRATING AMERICA'S FREEDOMS Arlington National Cemetery Almost four million people a year visit the national cemetery across the Potomac River from Washington, D.C., where a constant vigil is maintained at the Tomb of the Unknowns. Arlington National Cemetery is the site of the changing of a military guard around the clock daily. A stone coffin bearing the body of an unidentified soldier of World War I -- entombed on Veterans Day 1921 -- is the visible part of the tomb, while crypts next to it under the terrace bear the unknown American service members of World War II and the Korean and Vietnam Wars (the remains from Vietnam were exhumed May 14, 1998, identified as Air Force 1st Lt. Michael Joseph Blassie, and removed for burial). Each Memorial Day and Veterans Day, a presidential wreath is laid at the tomb. This may explain why Arlington is America's most well-known national cemetery, even though it is not the largest or the oldest. Some 230,000 veterans and dependents are buried on the cemetery's 612 acres. From Pierre L'Enfant, George Washington's aide during the American Revolution, to American service members killed during Operation Desert Storm, Arlington holds the remains of veterans representing every military action the United States has fought.  U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Washington, D.C. 20420  bitter grudge against the South that Union Brig. Gen. Montgomery Meigs bore, and the need for burial space for the Union dead, this commander of forces at Arlington urged the federal government to convert 200 acres of Lee's property to a cemetery. Meigs ordered burials near the house to make the grounds uninhabitable after the war. The first soldier was buried in Arlington in May 1864. By war's end, 16,000 graves filled the spaces close to Arlington House. Though the Supreme Court ruled finally in favor of the heir to the property, the eldest Lee son ceded title to the government for $150,000 and renounced any thought of living in Arlington House. From the portico of the mansion, the first official Memorial Day was proclaimed in 1868.  Burials Restricted Whereas after the Civil War, only the poor or unidentified were entombed at Arlington, now it is a burial site particularly coveted by veterans and their families. Space for in-ground burials is restricted to those who die on active duty, have had 20 years of service, or earned certain military decorations, and their spouses and dependents. Any honorably discharged veterans and dependents may have their cremated remains inurned in Arlington's columbarium. Honors are rendered daily by military units bearing a flag-draped coffin, firing a rifle volley and performing taps. Numerous veterans and civic groups hold memorial services in the cemetery's marble amphitheater. Monuments have been erected from time to time to memorialize specific groups of military members or veterans buried there. Prominent Americans buried at Arlington include: Presidents John F. Kennedy and William H. Taft; World War I General of the Armies John J. Pershing; Generals Omar Bradley and George C. Marshall of World War II; and Generals Daniel ""Chappie"" James and Maxwell Taylor of the Vietnam War.  Union Seized Lee's Property The cemetery's origins go back to just before the Civil War. George Washington Parke Custis, adopted son of the first president, owned a 1,100-acre plantation and constructed on it a memorial to Washington named Arlington House, which held the world's largest collection of memorabilia related to the president. Ownership of his estate passed to Custis' daughter, who had married Robert E. Lee, and they lived in Arlington House for more than 30 years. The Lee family fled when the Civil War was imminent. The Union seized the property because of its strategic location overlooking Washington. Because of the   CELEBRATING AMERICA'S FREEDOMS The POW/MIA Flag  U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Washington, D.C. 20420  who gave up their freedom protecting ours. Three years later, in 1982, the POW/MIA flag became the only flag other than the Stars and Stripes to fly over the White House in Washington, D.C. On August 10, 1990, Congress passed U.S. Public Law 101-355, designating the POW/MIA flag: ""The symbol of our Nation's concern and commitment to resolving as fully as possible the fates of Americans still prisoner, missing and unaccounted for in Southeast Asia.""  Displaying the POW/MIA Flag In 1971, Mrs. Michael Hoff, the wife of a U.S. military officer listed as missing in action during the Vietnam War, developed the idea for a national flag to remind every American of the U.S. servicemembers whose fates were never accounted for during the war. The black and white image of a gaunt silhouette, a strand of barbed wire and an ominous watchtower was designed by Newt Heisley, a former World War II pilot. Some claim the silhouette is a profile of Heisley's son, who contracted hepatitis while training to go to Vietnam. The virus ravaged his body, leaving his features hallow and emaciated. They suggest that while staring at his son's sunken features, Heisley saw the stark image of American servicemembers held captive under harsh conditions. Using a pencil, he sketched his son's profile, creating the basis for a symbol that would come to have a powerful impact on the national conscience. By the end of the Vietnam War, more than 2,500 servicemembers were listed by the Department of Defense as Prisoner of War (POW) or Missing in Action (MIA). In 1979, as families of the missing pressed for full accountability, Congress and the president proclaimed the first National POW/MIA Recognition Day to acknowledge the families' concerns and symbolize the steadfast resolve of the American people to never forget the men and women Congress designated the third Friday of September as National POW/MIA Recognition Day and ordered prominent display of the POW/MIA flag on this day and several other national observances, including Armed Forces Day, Memorial Day, Flag Day, Independence Day and Veterans Day. The 1998 Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 105-85) mandates that on these national observances, the POW/MIA flag is to be flown over the White House, the U.S. Capitol, the Korean and Vietnam Veterans War Memorials, the offices of the Secretaries of State, Defense and Veterans Affairs, offices of the Director of the Selective Service System, every major military installation (as directed by the Secretary of Defense), every post office and all Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical centers and national cemeteries. The act also directs VA medical centers to fly the POW/MIA flag on any day on which the flag of the United States is displayed. When displayed from a single flag pole, the POW/MIA flag should fly directly below, and be no larger than, the United States flag. If on separate poles, the U.S. flag should always be placed to the right of other flags. On the six national observances for which Congress has ordered display of the POW/ MIA flag, it is generally flown immediately below or adjacent to the United States flag as second in order of precedence.   CELEBRATING AMERICA'S FREEDOMS The Origin of the VA Motto  U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Washington, D.C. 20420  Lincoln's Second Inaugural Address As the nation braced itself for the final throes of the Civil War, thousands of spectators gathered on a muddy Pennsylvania Avenue near the U.S. Capitol to hear President Lincoln's second inaugural address. It was March 4, 1865, a time of great uneasiness. In just over one month, the war would end and the president would be assassinated. President Lincoln framed his speech on the moral and religious implications of the war; rhetorically questioning how a just God could unleash such a terrible war upon the nation. ""If we shall suppose that American slavery is one of those offenses in the providence of God, ... and that He gives to both North and South this terrible war as the woe due to those by whom the offenses came."" With its deep philosophical insights, critics have hailed the speech as one of Lincoln's best. As the speech progressed, President Lincoln turned from the divisive bitterness at the war's roots to the unifying task of reconciliation and reconstruction. In the speech's final paragraph, the president delivered his prescription for the nation's recovery. ""With malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in, to bind up the nation's wounds, to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and orphan, to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations."" With the words, ""To care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and orphan,"" President Lincoln affirmed the government's obligation to care for those injured during the war and to provide for the families of those who perished on the battlefield. Today, a pair or metal plaques bearing those words flank the entrance to the Washington, D.C. headquarters of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). VA is the federal agency responsible for  serving the needs of veterans by providing health care, disability compensation and rehabilitation, education assistance, home loans, burial in a national cemetery, and other benefits and services. Lincoln's immortal words became the VA motto in 1959, when the plaques were installed, and can be traced to Sumner G. Whittier, administrator of what was then called the Veterans Administration. A document on VA medical history prepared for the congressional Committee on Veterans' Affairs and titled, ""To care for him who shall have borne the battle,"" details how the words became VA's motto. ""He (Whittier) worked no employee longer or harder than himself to make his personal credo the mission of the agency. What was that credo? Simply the words of Abraham Lincoln, to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and orphan. To indicate the mission of his agency's employees, Mr. Whittier had plaques installed on either side of the main entrance."" President Lincoln's words have stood the test of time, and stand today as a solemn reminder of VA's commitment to care for those injured in our nation's defense and the families of those killed in its service.   CELEBRATING AMERICA'S FREEDOMS When should the flag be flown at half-staff? An easy way to remember when to fly the United States flag at half-staff is to consider when the whole nation is in mourning. These periods of mourning are proclaimed either by the president of the United States, for national remembrance, or the governor of a state or territory, for local remembrance, in the event of a death of a member or former member of the federal, state or territorial government or judiciary. The heads of departments and agencies of the federal government may also order that the flag be flown at half-staff on buildings, grounds and naval vessels under their jurisdiction. On Memorial Day the flag should be flown at half-staff from sunrise until noon only, then raised briskly to the top of the staff until sunset, in honor of the nation's battle heroes. In the early days of our country, no regulations existed for flying the flag at half-staff and, as a result, there were many conflicting policies. But on March 1, 1954, President Dwight Eisenhower issued a proclamation on the proper times. The flag should fly at half-staff for 30 days at all federal buildings, grounds, and naval vessels throughout the United States and its territories and possessions after the death of the president or a former president. It is to fly 10 days at half-staff after the death of the vice president, the chief justice or a retired chief justice of the United States Supreme Court, or the speaker of the House of Representatives. For an associate justice of the Supreme Court, a member of the Cabinet, a former vice president, the president pro tempore of the Senate, the majority leader of the Senate, the minority leader of the Senate, the majority leader of the House of Representatives, or the minority leader of the House of Representatives the flag is to be displayed at half-staff from the day of death until interment.  U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Washington, D.C. 20420  Flying the American Flag at Half Staff The flag is to be flown at half-staff at all federal buildings, grounds and naval vessels in the Washington, D.C., area on the day and day after the death of a United States senator, representative, territorial delegate, or the resident commissioner from the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. It should also be flown at halfstaff on all federal facilities in the state, congressional district, territory, or commonwealth of these officials. Upon the death of the governor of a state, territory or possession, the flag should be flown at half-staff on all federal facilities in that governor's state, territory or possession from the day of death until interment. The president may order the flag to be flown at half-staff to mark the death of other officials, former officials, or foreign dignitaries. In addition to these occasions, the president may order half-staff display of the flag after other tragic events. The flag should be briskly run up to the top of the staff before being lowered slowly to the half-staff position.   CELEBRATING AMERICA'S FREEDOMS The Origins of Flag Day That the flag of the United States shall be of thirteen stripes of alternate red and white, with a union of thirteen stars of white in a blue field, representing the new constellation. This was the resolution adopted by the Continental Congress on June 14, 1777. The resolution was made following the report of a special committee which had been assigned to suggest the flag's design. A flag of this design was first carried into battle on September 11, 1777, in the Battle of the Brandywine. The American flag was first saluted by foreign naval vessels on February 14, 1778, when the Ranger, bearing the Stars and Stripes and under the command of Captain Paul Jones, arrived in a French port. The flag first flew over a foreign territory in early 1778 at Nassau, Bahama Islands, where Americans captured a British fort. Observance of the adoption of the flag was not soon in coming, however. Although there are many claims to the first official observance of Flag Day, all but one took place more than an entire century after the flag's adoption in 1777. The first claim was from a Hartford, Conn., celebration during the first summer of 1861. In the late 1800s, schools all over the United States held Flag Day programs to contribute to the Americanization of immigrant children, and the observance caught on with individual communities. The most recognized claim, however, comes from New York. On June 14, 1889, Professor George Bolch, principal of a free kindergarten for the poor of New York City, had his school hold patriotic ceremonies to observe the anniversary of the Flag Day resolution. This initiative attracted attention from the State Department of Education, which arranged to have the day observed in all public schools thereafter. Soon the state legislature passed a law making it the responsibility of the state superintendent of public schools to ensure that schools hold observances for Lincoln's Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day and Flag Day. In 1897, the governor  U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Washington, D.C. 20420  of New York ordered the displaying of the flag over all public buildings in the state, an observance considered by some to be the first official recognition of the anniversary of the adoption of the flag outside of schools. Another claim comes from Philadelphia. In 1893, the Society of Colonial Dames succeeded in getting a resolution passed to have the flag displayed on all of the city's public buildings. Elizabeth Duane Gillespie, a direct descendant of Benjamin Franklin and the president of the Colonial Dames of Pennsylvania, that same year tried to get the city to call June 14 Flag Day. Resolutions by women were not granted much notice, however, and it was not until May 7, 1937, that Pennsylvania became the first state to establish the June 14 Flag Day as a legal holiday. Flag Day is a nationwide observance today, but Pennsylvania is the only state that recognizes it as a legal holiday. Bernard J. Cigrand, a school teacher in Waubeka, Wisconsin, reportedly spent years trying to get Congress to declare June 14 as a national holiday. Although his attempts failed, the day was widely observed. ""Father of Flag Day"" honors have been given to William T. Kerr, who was credited with founding the American Flag Day Association in 1888 while still a schoolboy in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Both President Wilson, in 1916, and President Coolidge, in 1927, issued proclamations asking for June 14 to be observed as the National Flag Day. But it wasn't until August 3, 1949, that Congress approved the national observance, and President Harry Truman signed it into law.   CELEBRATING AMERICA'S FREEDOMS The American Bald Eagle The bald eagle has been the national bird of the United States since 1782, when it was placed with outspread wings on the Great Seal of our country. It appears in many government institutions and on official documents, making it the most pictured bird in all of America. The eagle appears on the president's flag, the mace of the House of Representatives, military insignia, and billions of onedollar bills. The bald eagle first appeared as an American symbol on a Massachusetts copper cent coined in 1776. Since then it has appeared on the reverse side of many U.S. coins, notably the silver dollar, halfdollar and quarter, as well as the gold coins which were christened the eagle, half eagle, quarter eagle, and double eagle. For six years, the members of Congress held a bitter dispute over what the national emblem should be. It wasn't until 1789 that the bald eagle was finally chosen to represent the new nation. One of the most prominent opponents to the bald eagle's status was Benjamin Franklin. In a letter to a friend, Franklin wrote: I wish the bald eagle had not been chosen as the representative of our country; he is a bird of bad moral character; like those among men who live by sharping and robbing, he is generally poor, and often very lousy. The turkey is a much more respectable bird and withal a true, original native of America. But not all of Congress shared Franklin's sentiments. Bald eagles, like other eagles worldwide, had been seen by many as symbols of strength, courage, freedom and immortality for generations. And, unlike other eagles, the bald eagle was indigenous only to North America.  U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Washington, D.C. 20420  Some eagles have become notable in American history. ""Old Abe,"" the mascot of a Wisconsin regiment during the Civil War, was a constant target of enemy riflemen, but survived 42 battle engagements relatively unscathed. Today, the American bald eagle is protected under the National Emblem Act of 1940. Although once plentiful throughout the continental United States, the bald eagle population has greatly declined in recent times. Farmers and fishermen have killed many eagles for getting too close to their poultry or fishing nets; game keepers have captured them for falconry; and pesticides have killed many eagles. Most of the bald eagle population can now be found in northern regions of North America and Florida breeding sanctuaries. President John F. Kennedy wrote to the Audubon Society: The Founding Fathers made an appropriate choice when they selected the bald eagle as the emblem of the nation. The fierce beauty and proud independence of this great bird aptly symbolizes the strength and freedom of America. But as latter-day citizens we shall fail our trust if we permit the eagle to disappear.   CELEBRATING AMERICA'S FREEDOMS Gun Salutes Today, the firing of guns is seen as a great honor bestowed upon both military and political officials. Firing guns at the approach of a party demonstrates not only welcome but also respect and trust. In former times, however, firing all guns could leave a ship, fort or battery virtually defenseless, for the reloading took a great deal of time. For this reason, gun salutes were seen as a great honor. The practice of firing gun salutes was well established by the sixteenth century, although gun salutes had existed for centuries. Later, the number of guns to fire was designated for various ceremonies, honors and officials -- in relation to their importance and position. The firing of three rifle volleys (rounds) over the graves of fallen armed forces members and political leaders can be traced to the European dynastic wars, when fighting was halted to remove the dead and wounded. Once an area was cleared of casualties, three volleys were sent into the air as a signal to resume fighting. By about 1730, the British navy was prescribing 21 guns for certain anniversary dates as a personal salute to members of the royal family. This was not mandatory, however. The 21-gun salute was adopted as the standard salute for royalty in 1808. The United States fired a ""national salute,"" on special occasions and during times of mourning, of one gun for each state in the union until 1841, when the salute was standardized at 21 guns. It was customary at that time, when naval vessels were visiting foreign ports, to salute the flag of that nation with the number of guns present in the foreign country's national salute. It would have been difficult, if not impossible, for vessels visiting the United States to fire a salute that, in 1841, doubled the number of guns prescribed by most other nations (42 as compared to 21). Also, it would have been internationally discour-  U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Washington, D.C. 20420  teous to offer a salute to a foreign port with fewer guns then prescribed by our own national salute. The British proposed that the two nations exchange salutes gun for gun when their vessels visited American ports in the nineteenth century. In 1875, the British minister at Washington, D.C., and the U.S. secretary of state decided to work towards an agreement on salutes. On August 18, 1875, the United States formally adopted the 21-gun salute, the number prescribed by Britain, France and other nations. No one can explain why the number 21 was chosen for national salutes. In ancient cultures, numerology, the study of numbers, developed symbolism behind most numbers. These cultures believed the number seven to be sacred and, therefore, it is believed, multiples of seven would be looked upon favorably (hence 21). Other gun salutes vary from five guns (the lowest) to 21 guns (the highest) by increments of two, and are prescribed in accordance with occasion and level of importance of those honored. It is generally believed that gun salutes are set off in odd numbers because of an old naval superstition that even numbers are unlucky.   CELEBRATING AMERICA'S FREEDOMS The Flower of Remembrance In Flanders Fields In Flanders fields the poppies blow Between the crosses, row on row, That mark our place; and in the sky The larks, still bravely singing, fly. Scarce heard amid the guns below. We are the dead. Short days ago We lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow, Loved, and were loved, and now we lie In Flanders fields. Take up our quarrel with the foe: To you from failing hands we throw The torch; be yours to hold it high. If ye break faith with us who die We shall not sleep, though poppies grow In Flanders fields. This was the poem written by World War I Colonel John McCrae, a surgeon with Canada's First Brigade Artillery. It expressed McCrae's grief over the ""row on row"" of graves of soldiers who had died on Flanders' battlefields, located in a region of western Belgium and northern France. The poem presented a striking image of the bright red flowers blooming among the rows of white crosses and became a rallying cry to all who fought in the First World War. The first printed version of it reportedly was in December 1915, in the British magazine Punch. McCrae's poem had a huge impact on two women, Anna E. Guerin of France and Georgia native Moina Michael. Both worked hard to initiate the sale of artificial poppies to help orphans and others left destitute by the war. By the time Guerin established the first sale in the U.S., in 1920 with the help of the American Legion, the poppy was well known in the allied countries -- America, Britain, France, Canada, Australia and New Zealand -- as the ""Flower of Remembrance."" Proceeds from that first sale went to the American and French Children's League.  U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Washington, D.C. 20420  Guerin had troubles with the distribution of the poppies in early 1922 and sought out Michael for help. Michael had started a smaller-scaled Poppy Day during a YMCA conference she was attending in New York and wanted to use the poppies as a symbol of remembrance of the war. Guerin, called the ""Poppy Lady of France"" in her homeland, and Michael, later dubbed ""The Poppy Princess"" by the Georgia legislature, went to the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) for help. The poppy was adopted as the official memorial flower of the VFW at its national convention in Seattle, Wash., in August 1922, following the first nationwide distribution of poppies ever conducted by any veterans organization. In 1923, faced by a shortage of poppies from French manufacturers, the VFW relied on New York florists to make up the difference. This was a huge setback, however, and led to the idea by VFW officials to use unemployed and disabled veterans to produce the artificial flower. This concept was approved in late 1923 and the first poppy factory was built in Pittsburgh, Pa., in 1924. This provided a practical means of assistance to veterans and also ensured a steady, reliable source of poppies. Veterans at Department of Veterans Affairs medical facilities and veterans homes help assemble the poppies, and each year the VFW distributes roughly 14 million worldwide. It was around the same time the first poppy factory was built that the VFW registered the name ""Buddy Poppy"" with the U.S. Patent Office. The term ""Buddy"" was coined by the poppy makers as a tribute to their comrades who did not come home from the war or who were scarred and crippled for life. The VFW celebrated the 75th anniversary of the Buddy Poppy as its official flower in 1997. While profits from its sales have helped countless veterans and their widows, widowers and orphans over the years, the poppy itself survives as a perpetual tribute to those who have given their lives for the nation's freedom.   CELEBRATING AMERICA'S FREEDOMS Activities for Veterans Day Veterans Day is an excellent occasion for schools and local communities to produce a variety of meaningful cooperative programs. Participation by veterans organizations and other patriotic groups can enhance many of the activities suggested in this guide. 1. Veterans Day Ceremony Depending on the facilities available, an indoor assembly program can provide a most meaningful tribute to Veterans Day. The scope of such a program may be large enough to permit invitations to the community at large. This ceremony outline represents a typical one-hour program. Prelude and Posting of Colors -- As the audience enters to be seated, a school or community musical organization may offer several appropriate selections. A procession and posting of the Nation's colors (the American Flag) is always a stirring event. Local veterans service organizations often participate in such programs with their impressive array of military banners and American flags. Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag and Singing of the National Anthem -- The program chairperson, school principal or student body president should invite the audience to stand and join in the Pledge of Allegiance and singing of the National Anthem. Introductory Remarks -- Brief introductory remarks set the tone for the program. The following remarks may be used or, if desired, the President's Veterans Day Proclamation, which the White House posts on the Internet shortly before Veterans Day at http://www.whitehouse.gov, may be read. When Francis Scott Key wrote the ""Star Spangled Banner"" almost 200 years ago, he called America, ""the land of the free and the home of the brave."" Those words are as true today as they were then.  U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Washington, D.C. 20420  Throughout this Nation's history, America's soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines and coastguardsmen have bravely answered the call to defend our freedom, to aid our friends and allies, and to turn back aggressors. We can never fully repay our debt of gratitude to the more than 650,000 American servicemembers who died in battle or the 1.4 million who were wounded. We can, however, recognize and thank the more than 25 million veterans still living today. These words are inscribed on the Korean War Memorial in Washington, D.C.: ""Our nation honors her sons and daughters who answered the call to defend a country they never knew and a people they never met."" Those words apply equally to many of our World War I, World War II, Vietnam War and Gulf War veterans as well. They apply to today's active duty servicemembers -- tomorrow's veterans -- who are helping to maintain peace throughout the world. Today, it is our privilege to say ""thank you"" to all of America's veterans, to let them know that we appreciate them for their service and honor them for their sacrifices. The price of freedom is high. We cannot afford to forget those willing to pay it. Today, we celebrate America's veterans for keeping this Nation ""the land of the free and the home of the brave."" Special Musical Selection -- A band or choral group should offer one of the more impressive patriotic selections available.   C  U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Washington, D.C. 20420  ELEBRATING AMERICA'S FREEDOMS  Activities for Veterans Day (Cont.) Introduction of Guests -- Dignitaries selected as special guests may include local government officials, school alumni with distinguished military service, veterans from the community who represent different periods of service, and faculty members who are veterans. Principal Speaker -- Your principal speaker should be invited far enough in advance to allow adequate preparation for your program. Student Essay or Reading -- In school programs, student body participation may be increased by including in the program various presentations by individual pupils. Selected essays from school-wide competition may be offered by the student author. A reading of a well-known patriotic address by an American president or famous military hero by a talented student can be effective. There are a number of published musicals/narratives which could add greatly to your program. Moment of Silence, Taps -- While Veterans Day is primarily a tribute to America's living veterans, and should be observed more as a celebration than as a somber remembrance, it is always appropriate to include a moment of respect for those who gave their lives for their country. The signing of the World War I Armistice took place in a railway coach near the battle zone in France. The bugles sounded ""cease firing"" and the hostilities ended, marking a most significant moment in world history. Although 11 a.m. remains a traditional hour for this type of tribute, a moment of silence is appropriate at any point in the program. This may be followed by a rendition of ""Taps."" Closing -- The Master of Ceremonies announces ""Retire the Colors."" Accompanied by appropriate music, such as a John Philip Sousa march, the colors are paraded out of the assembly area, concluding the ceremony. 2. Flag-Raising Ceremony Weather permitting, outdoor flag-raising ceremonies permit group participation in an event that is often performed without notice. Such a ceremony, although brief, should include the Pledge of Allegiance and the singing of the National Anthem. A special guest may be invited to participate. 3. Musical Programs Veterans Day offers an excellent opportunity for school or community musical organizations to display their talents. A midday concert at the school or at a central location in the community may be especially dedicated to Veterans Day. An innovative program might include selections known to have been popular during America's wars. 4. Poster Contest The creative talents of students can be encouraged through participation in a school-wide Veterans Day poster contest. Winners should be appropriately recognized and awarded certificates. Local newspapers should be invited to photograph the winning entries. 5. School Newspaper Activities Veterans Day stories can be featured in school publications. Publish a roster of faculty members who are veterans. Describe Veterans Day activities being held in classrooms throughout the school. 6. Library Activities School or community libraries can prepare lists of recommended reading material suitable for Veterans Day. An appropriate display of book jackets or a special shelf containing selected publications can be used to call attention to the project. 7. Patriotic Groups Local veterans, historical or other patriotic organizations may enliven Veterans Day programs by   CELEBRATING AMERICA'S FREEDOMS Activities for Veterans Day (Cont.) providing period-uniformed flag bearers, fife and drum corps, and other marching and musical units. These organizations may also provide speakers with unique military experiences to share. 8. The Department of Veterans Affairs Local VA facilities -- medical centers, regional benefits offices and national cemeteries -- can serve as sources of information and speakers for Veterans Day programs. They can also provide contact with local veterans service organizations and arrange visits, tours and other special programs for students. To contact your local VA facilities, look under Department of Veterans Affairs in the Federal Government listings in the local telephone directory. 9. Classroom Activities Veterans Day themes can be included in writing assignments. First-person accounts of military service of a relative or friend can help develop narrative skills. Assign students to investigate the various benefits offered to veterans by government agencies. Write about veterans who are receiving educational benefits from the Department of Veterans Affairs. Describe various veterans memorials which may be located nearby. The colorful and varied uniforms worn by members of the armed forces throughout our history offer students of all ages ideal subjects to draw and paint. Elementary-school children enjoy opportunities to create and exhibit costume items. Making colored construction paper hats representing various military eras is a modest and effective way of interesting pupils in Veterans Day subjects. Ask students to research and list all their known relatives who served in the Armed Forces. Since nearly 30 percent of the United States population are veterans, their dependents and survivors, most students should be able to contribute something.

Satellites operated by the Commerce              Department’s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration              ( NOAA ) and by the Russian government,              detected a distress signal from the fishing vessel  Ranger .              The Coast Guard received an Emergency Positioning Indicating Radio              Beacon ( EPIRB )              distress alert from the 107-foot vessel homeported in Port Elizabeth,              N.J. The alert started a search and rescue mission that used five              rescue planes and helicopters from Coast Guard units in three states              to rescue the seven men.              Rescue              planes and helicopters from  Coast              Guard Air Station Elizabeth City, N.C. , a rescue plane from Coast              Guard Air Station Cape Cod, Mass., as well as two helicopters from              Coast Guard Air Station Atlantic City all were involved with the rescue              which took place in the early morning hours 80 miles east of Atlantic              City.              Arriving              at the  Ranger , the rescue crew hoisted five fishermen to              the safety of the helicopter. A Coast Guard rescue swimmer stayed              behind in the life raft with two remaining fisherman in the 10-15              foot seas and 25 mph winds awaiting rescue from a second Coast Guard              rescue helicopter. The rescue swimmer and the two remaining fisherman              were rescued about 45 minutes later. All the fishermen were taken              back to Coast Guard Group Air Station Atlantic City and met by awaiting              ambulance and EMS from Atlantic City International Airport. Six of              the seven were released with one going to a local hospital.              “These              fishermen helped us save their lives. The EPIRB told us where to search,              survival suits kept them warm and their life raft kept them out of              the frigid water until our people could get them to safety,”              said Captain Bob Durfey, commanding officer of Coast Guard Group Air-Station              Atlantic City.              The Coast Guard strongly recommends having              charts, a global positioning device and reliable means of communication              on board. It is critically important that mariners rely on a VHF-FM              radio and EPIRBs as their primary means of communicating a distress.                           “This              particular rescue once again demonstrates the effectiveness of the               Copas-Sarsat System  and              NOAA’s commitment to protecting lives and property,” said              retired Navy Vice Admiral  Conrad              C. Lautenbacher , Ph.D., undersecretary of commerce for oceans              and atmosphere and NOAA administrator. “Truly, Cospas-Sarsat              works to take the ‘search’ out of search and rescue.”             The              Cospas-Sarsat system uses a constellation of satellites in geostationary              and polar orbits to detect and locate emergency beacons on vessels              and aircraft in distress. NOAA’s National Environmental Satellite,              Data, and Information Service ( NOAA              Satellite and Information Service ) represents the United States              in this program, providing satellite platforms and ground equipment,              and operating the U.S. Mission Control Center.             NOAA’s              Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites ( GOES )              can instantly detect emergency signals. The  polar-orbiting              satellites  in the system detect emergency signals as they circle              the Earth from pole to pole. Emergency signals are sent to the  U.S.              Mission Control Center  at NOAA’s facility in Suitland, Md.,              then automatically sent to rescue forces around the world. Today there              are 35 countries participating in the system.             NOAA’s              National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service ( NOAA              Satellites and Information ) is the nation’s primary source              of space-based meteorological and climate data. NOAA Satellites and              Information operates the nation's environmental satellites, which              are used for weather forecasting, climate monitoring and other environmental              applications such as fire detection, ozone monitoring and sea surface              temperature measurements.              NOAA              Satellites and Information also operates three  data              centers , which house global data bases in climatology, oceanography,              solid earth geophysics, marine geology and geophysics, solar-terrestrial              physics, and paleoclimatology.

GX135-68-9294472	Congressman Jim Kolbe   5 TH  DISTRICT ARIZONA   PRESS RELEASE                   December 19, 2000                   Here’s a Switch: Medals Pinned on a Trophy Mogul                   (Tucson)  --  Morton K. Tuller, 79, a Tucsonan and veteran of World War II, was awarded nine combat medals, some 55 years overdue, at ceremonies presided over by Rep. Jim Kolbe on Tuesday, Dec. 19.  Tuller was awarded a total of nine silver and bronze stars for service in the Asiatic Pacific; the European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign; and the Philippine Liberation movement. The ceremony was held at Tuller Trophy Factory, 525 N. 6th Ave.  A native of Brooklyn, New York, Tuller served as a cryptographer and performed message deciphering and decoding duties. He enlisted in the Army in August of 1942, entered active service in February of the following year and was discharged in January of 1946. Despite enlisting in the Army, Tuller spent much of his time in the service aboard Navy ships.  Tuller grew up in Chicago. When he was in high school, Tuller auditioned for a part in “The Dead End Kids,” and wound up in a touring company that criss-crossed the United States. He is well-known throughout Southern Arizona for volunteer efforts on behalf of Tucson Medical Center and Saguaro National Park.   Tuller moved to Tucson in 1947 and, after a stint in the jewelry business in Tucson and Los Angeles, opened Tuller Trophy in 1955 on East Broadway near Scott Avenue, across from the Westerner Hotel. (A picture taken in 1953 of Tuller and his wife, Sylvia, now deceased, appears on the mural on the Broadway underpass in downtown Tucson.)  The shop moved to N. 6th Avenue location in 1966. A second location at 5631 E. 22nd Street opened in 1974. Tuller continues to play an active role in the business, though day-to-day management is in the hands of his son, Howard. Tuller said he had “no particular interest” in seeking medals he deserved until he joined a bagpipe band and was informed that he should wear war medals on his outfit. Two years ago, he started querying the government record center in St. Louis, Mo. When those requests went unanswered, he mentioned the matter to Rep. Kolbe at a Friends of Saguaro National Park gathering.                   Home| Press Releases

More than 100 lives are saved each year through                 CAP search and rescue efforts.                                 Disaster Relief                CAP volunteers are often the first on the scene when disaster                 strikes. CAP provides air and ground transportation, and an                 extensive communication network to local, state, and national                 disaster relief agencies.                                 Humanitarian Relief                CAP transports time-sensitive medical materials in support of                 humanitarian organizations such as the American Red Cross. CAP's                 live organ transport program is credited with saving an average                 of 10 lives every year.                                 Counterdrug Operations                Through agreements with the US Air Force, US Customs Service,                 the Drug Enforcement Agency, and the US Forest Service, CAP                 provides aerial reconnaissance, airborne communications support,                 and airlift support of law enforcement personnel.

Civil Air                 Patrol cadets receive training in a broad spectrum of aviation                 and space topics with an emphasis on career exploration. Cadets                 also receive a series of orientation flights which provide an                 introduction to aircraft operation.                                 External                Each year, CAP supports over 200 workshops for educators at                 colleges and universities across the country, preparing                 approximately 5,000 educators to teach aerospace-related                 subjects. CAP annually develops and publishes curricula and                 other aerospace education materials to be used in the nation's                 schools. Each year, CAP sponsors the National Congress on                 Aviation and Space Education, the premier national convention                 for aerospace educators.                                                                         Cadet Program              The goal of the Cadet Program is to develop the potential of young             persons through physical fitness, ethics and leadership training,             and aerospace education.                                               Aerospace Education                Most cadets join because of an interest in aviation. In                 addition to the self-paced aerospace curriculum that cadets                 study, CAP offers flight orientation rides and even flight                 training opportunities for cadets.                                 Leadership Training                CAP cadets receive unique leadership and management training                 that can can be used later in any career field.                  Some cadets join CAP because they have an interest in the Air                 Force. Ten percent of all students now enrolled in the Air Force                 Academy are former CAP cadets. Cadets who earn the CAP Mitchell                 Award are eligible to enlist in the Air Force at a higher pay                 grade.                                 Emergency Services Education and Community Service                CAP cadets train and work alongside CAP senior members and are                 an important part of CAP's emergency services team.                                          CAP operates the world's largest fleet of civilian aircraft, with             CAP pilots flying nearly 130,000 hours each year.
GX030-89-11609923	"LITTLE BIGHORN BATTLEFIELD   National Monument                                      Plan of Action      On the evening of June 21 General Terry gathered his principal subordinates in the cabin of the  Far West,  moored to the bank of the Yellowstone at the mouth of the Rosebud, and worked out the details of a strategy that had already formed in his mind for snaring the Indians whose trail Reno had seen in the Rosebud Valley. Two fundamental assumptions shaped this plan: that the enemy probably numbered less than a thousand warriors, and that unless surrounded and forced into battle they would flee to the mountains as soon as they discovered the approach of soldiers. Although General Crook had learned that Sioux strength and will to fight had been grossly underestimated, word of his recent setback had not yet reached Terry. Terry's information indicated that the hostile camp almost certainly lay somewhere in the Little Bighorn Valley. By maneuvering Custer into position on one side and Gibbon on the other, he hoped to box in the Indians and force them into battle. Accordingly, Custer would lead his regiment up the Rosebud, cross to the Little Bighorn, and drop down that stream from the south; Gibbon, accompanied by Terry and his staff, would march back up the Yellowstone, ferry to the south bank, ascend the Bighorn, and enter the Little Bighorn Valley from the north.    Although recognizing that uncertainties of terrain and enemy location would prevent close cooperation, Terry hoped that no action would be precipitated before June 26—the earliest day Gibbon's foot soldiers could reach the objective. To afford Gibbon the needed time and to satisfy himself that the quarry had not slipped out of the trap to the southeast, Terry intended for Custer to continue up the Rosebud beyond the point where the hostile trail turned west and not veer toward the Little Bighorn until he had passed the head of the Rosebud.    Terry fully understood that Custer's cavalry, with no infantry to hold it back, enjoyed a much better chance of striking a blow than did Gibbon. For this reason he let Custer have six of Gibbon's Crow Indian scouts, who knew the country better than the Arikaras, and also offered to send along Gibbon's battalion of the 2d Cavalry under Maj. James Brisbin, as well as the Gatling gun battery. Custer gratefully accepted the scouts but declined the additional cavalry and the artillery. The Gatlings, he said in truth, would slow his march; Brisbin's cavalry, he explained less plausibly, would not enable him to overcome any opposition that the 7th alone could not cope with.    The next morning, June 22, Terry outlined his views to Custer in writing. Before sketching in general terms the troop movements that had been decided upon, the general noted the impossibility of giving definite instructions, and he professed, anyway, to repose too much confidence in his subordinate's ""zeal, energy, and ability"" to attempt to lay down detailed orders ""which might hamper your action when nearly in contact with the enemy."" Custer should conform to Terry's views, therefore, unless he saw ""sufficient reason for departing from them."" Depart from them he did. Whether sufficient reason existed has ever since been a topic of heated controversy.

At the direction of the Secretary of Agriculture.        Computation of periods for half-staffing:      When the number of days is specified :        The day of death counts as the first day, even if the flags were not placed at     half-staff that day because death occurred after the normal time to lower the flags for     the day or notification was received too late to half-staff on that day.                The flags must be flown each day for the specified days, even if they would not     normally be flown on some of the days. This policy is applicable only if operating     personnel normally scheduled to work are available to perform this function.        On the death and on the following day :       If notification of death is received before the normal time to lower the flags for the day, the flags will be lowered to half-staff on that day and flown at half-staff on the following day.        If notification is received too late to half-staff the flags on the day of death, the     flags are flown at half-staff only on the day following death.               If notification of death is received on a day that the flags are normally not flown, the     flags must be flown at half-staff on that day and on the following day. However, if     notification is received too late to half-staff the flags on the day of death, the flags     are flown at half- staff only on the following day.        From the day of death until interment :      If notification of death is received before the time the flags are normally lowered for the day, the flags must be lowered to half staff on that day. The flags will also be flown at half-staff on each succeeding day, including the day of interment.        If notification is received too late to half-staff the flags on the day of death, the     flags must be flown at half-staff beginning the following day and on each succeeding day     through the day of interment.               If notification of death is received on a day that the flags are normally not flown, the     flags must be flown at half-staff on that day and on each succeeding day, including the     day of internment. If notification is received too late to half-staff the flags on the day     of death, above instructions for the “day of death and the following day,” under     “Computation of periods for half-staffing,” apply.          Coincident occasions to half-staff :      If during a period when the flags are already at half-staff, notification of another death is received, the half-staff period will run concurrently, not consecutively.             6.    Procedures for Half-Staffing the U.S. Flag        CD/RL/LC.  If appropriate, submit request to the AD for approval to display the flags of the United States at half-staff to address local observances.      AD.

Only excerpts pertinent to REE have been quoted.          Display and Use of Flag by Civilians; Codification of Rules and Customs; Definition     (36 U.S.C. 173)            The following codification of existing rules and customs pertaining to the display and use     of the flag of the United States of America is established for use by such civilians or     civilian groups or organizations as may not be required to conform with regulations     promulgated by one or more executive departments of the United States. The flag of the     United States of America, for the purpose of this chapter, shall be defined according to     Sections 1 and 2 of Title 4, United States Code, and Executive Order 10824, issued     pursuant thereto.               Time and Occasions for Display; Hoisting and Lowering (36 U.S.C. 173)                     It is the universal custom to display the flag from sunrise to sunset on buildings and         on stationary flagstaffs in the open. However, when a patriotic effect is desired, the         flag may be displayed 24 hours a day if properly illuminated during the hours of darkness.                           The flag should be hoisted briskly and lowered ceremoniously.                           The flag should not be displayed on days when weather is inclement, except when an all         weather flag is displayed.                           The flag should be displayed on all days, especially on: New Year's Day, January 1; Dr.         Martin Luther King, Jr.'s Birthday, third Monday in January; Inauguration Day, January 20;         Lincoln's Birthday, February 12; Washington's Birthday, third Monday in February; Easter         Sunday (variable); Mother's Day, second Sunday in May; Armed Forces Day, third Saturday in         May; Memorial Day (half-staff until noon), the last Monday in May; Flag Day, June 14;         Independence Day, July 4; Labor Day, first Monday in September; Constitution Day,         September 17; Columbus Day, second Monday in October; Navy Day, October 27; Veteran's Day,         November 11; Thanksgiving Day, fourth Thursday in November; Christmas Day, December 25;         and such other days as may be proclaimed by the President of the United States; the         birthday of States (date of admission); and on State holidays.                           The flag should be displayed daily on or near the main administration building of every         public institution.                                 Position and Manner of Display (36 U.S.C. 175)            The flag, when carried in a procession with another flag or flags, should be either on the     marching right; that is, the flag's own right, or if there is a line of other flags, in     front of the center of that line.                     The flag of the United States of America, when it is displayed with another flag against         a wall from crossed staffs, should be on the right, the flag's own right, and its staff         should be in front of the staff of the other flag.                           The flag of the United States of America should be at the center and at the highest         point of the group when a number of flags of States or localities or pennants of societies         are grouped and displayed from staffs.                           When the flags of States, cities or localities, or pennants of societies are flown on         the same halyard with the flag of the United States of America, the latter should always         be at the peak. When the flags are flown from adjacent staffs, the flag of the United         States of America should be hoisted first and lowered last. No such flag or pennant may be         placed above the flag of the United States of America or to the right of the flag of the         United States of America.                           When flags of two or more nations are displayed, they are to be flown from separate         staffs of the same height. The flags should be of approximately equal size. International         usage forbids the display of the flag of one nation above that of another nation in time         of peace.                           When the flag of the United States of America is displayed from a staff projecting         horizontally or at an angle from the window sill, balcony, or front of a building, the         union or blue field of the flag should be placed at the peak of the staff unless the flag         is at half-staff.                            When displaying either horizontally or vertically against a wall, the union or blue         field should be uppermost and to the flag's own right, that is, to the observer's left.                            When used on a speaker's platform, the flag, if displayed flat, should be displayed         above and behind the speaker. When displayed from a staff in a church or public         auditorium, the flag of the United States of America should hold the position of superior         prominence, in advance of the audience, and in the position of honor at                 the clergy's or speaker's right as he/she         faces the audience. Any other flag or display should be placed on the left of the         clergyman or speaker or at the right of the audience.                           The flag should form a distinctive feature of the ceremony of unveiling a statue or         monument, but it should never be used as the covering for the statue or monument.                           The flag, when directed by an Agency Head to fly at half-staff, must meet the following         provisions:                    (1)        The flag will fly at half-staff for a         period not to exceed 1 day.                    (2)        Flying the flag at half-staff         symbolizes respect to the memory of a USDA   individual(s) who died in the line         of duty or the loss of life of a local individual(s) through an act of heroism.                    (3)        The lowering of the flag to half-staff         can only be done in USDA controlled buildings or facilities.                    (4)        In a multi-tenant building complex or         facility, the lead agency must agree to fly the flag at half-staff.                           The flag, when flown at half-staff, should be first hoisted to the peak for an instant         and then lowered to the half-staff position. The flag should be again raised to the peak         before it is lowered for the day. On Memorial Day the flag should be displayed at         half-staff until noon only, then raised to the top of the staff. By order of the         President, the flag shall be flown at half-staff upon the death of principal figures of         the United States Government and the Governor of a State, territory, or possession, as a         mark of respect to the memory. In the event of the death of other officials or foreign         dignitaries, the flag is to be displayed at half-staff according to Presidential         instructions or orders, or in accordance with recognized customs or practices not         inconsistent with law. In the event of the death of a present or former official of the         Government of any State, territory, or possession of the United States, the Governor of         that State, territory, or possession may proclaim that the flag of the United States of         America shall be flown at half-staff. The flag shall be flown at half-staff 30 days from         the death of the President or a former President; 10 days from the death of the Vice         President, the Chief Justice or retired Chief Justice of the United States, or the Speaker         of the House of Representatives; from the day of death until interment of an associate         Justice of the Supreme Court, a Secretary of an executive department, a former Vice         President, or the Governor of a State, territory, or possession; and on the day of death         and the following day for a Member of Congress.                    As used in this subsection,                    (1)        the term “half-staff” means         the position of the flag when it is one-half the distance between the top and bottom of         the staff;                    (2)        the term “executive or military         department” means any agency listed under sections 101 and 102 of Title 5, United         States Code; and                     (3)        the term “Member of Congress”         means a Senator, a Representative, a Delegate, or a Resident Commissioner from Puerto         Rico.                                 Respect of the Flag (36 U.S.C. 176)            No disrespect should be shown to the flag of the United States of America; the flag should     not be dipped to any person or thing. Regimental colors, State flags , and organization or     institutional flags are to be dipped as a mark of honor.                     The flag shall never touch anything beneath it, such as the ground, the floor, water, or         merchandise.                           The flag should never be fastened, displayed, used, or stored in such a manner as to         permit it to be easily torn, soiled, or damaged in any way.                           The flag, when it is in such condition that it is no longer a fitting emblem for         display, should be destroyed in a dignified way, preferably by burning.                                 Conduct During Hoisting, Lowering or Passing of the Flag (36 U.S.C. 177)            During the ceremony of hoisting of or lowering the flag or when the flag is passing in a     parade or in a review, all persons present except those in uniform should face the flag     and stand at attention with the right hand over the heart. Those present in uniform should     render the military salute. When not in uniform men should remove their headdress with     their right hand and hold it at left shoulder, the hand being over the heart. Aliens     should stand at attention. The salute to the flag in a moving column should be rendered at     the moment the flag passes.               Modification of Rules and Customs by President (36 U.S.C. 178)            Any rule or custom pertaining to the display of the flag or the United States of America,     set forth in section 171 to 178 or Title 36, United States Code, may be altered, modified,     or repealed, or additional rules with respect thereto may be prescribed, by the Commander     in Chief of the Armed Forces of the United States, whenever he deems it to be appropriate     or desirable and any such alteration or additional rule shall be set forth in a     proclamation.

GX030-89-15443606	"LITTLE BIGHORN BATTLEFIELD   National Monument                                   Chief Gall.      March to the Little Bighorn      At noon on June 22 the 7th Cavalry passed in review for Terry and, behind the buckskin-clad Custer, began the march up the Rosebud. The column numbered 31 officers and about 585 en listed men, 40 Indian scouts, and nearly 20 packers, guides, and other civilian employees. Each trooper carried 100 cartridges for his carbine and 24 for his pistol, and a mule packtrain trans ported another 50 rounds of carbine ammunition per man together with rations and forage for 15 days.    Amid clouds of choking dust, Custer's column pushed up the Rosebud. On the 23d it struck the hostile trail, which through out the afternoon and all next day grew rapidly fresher and larger. In the broad trail and the proliferation of abandoned campsites, the Crow and Arikara scouts saw evidence of a great many more Indians than Custer and his officers suspected—perhaps several thousand—and they made no secret of their misgivings over being drawn into a fight with such an array. Although Custer thought the scouts inclined to exaggerate, he had raised his own estimate of enemy strength to 1,500 warriors, a force he judged his regiment well able to handle. A different fear gripped him, as it had everyone from the beginning of the campaign—that the Sioux would escape if given a chance. Impelled by this likelihood, he pushed the column hard—from 12 miles on the 22d to 30 each on the 23d and 24th. By the evening of the 24th, he had reached the point where the trail bent to the west and ascended the divide between the Rosebud and Little Bighorn Valleys. Indian ""sign"" left little doubt that the Sioux village lay just over the mountains.    Here Custer made a crucial decision. Instead of continuing up the Rosebud as Terry desired, he would follow the trail nearly to the summit of the divide, spend the 25th resting his exhausted command and fixing the location of the hostile camp, then hit it with a dawn attack on the 26th, the date appointed for Gibbon to reach the mouth of the Little Bighorn.        Custer Divides the Seventh Cavalry into Three Battalions.  (click on image for an enlargement in a new window)    A night march, adding 10 miles to the 30 already covered during the day, carried the regiment nearly to the summit. At the same time, Lt. Charles A. Varnum and several of his scouts climbed a high hill to the south, known as the Crow's Nest, and at dawn scanned the wrinkled landscape stretching off to the Bighorn Mountains. Some 15 miles to the west, where a thread of green traced the course of the Little Bighorn, the Crows discerned smoke rising from the Sioux village and on the benchland beyond a vast undulating mass that represented the Sioux pony herd. Lieutenant Varnum could not see these things, and neither could Custer when he arrived in response to a message from the lieutenant.    Although doubting that his scouts had actually detected the village, Custer knew it could not be far off. Moreover, his worst fears at once seemed confirmed, for two small parties of Sioux were spotted during the morning. Unquestionably, the regiment had now been discovered. If action were delayed until the 26th as planned, there would probably be no Indians to attack. And so Custer made his second crucial decision—to find the village and strike it as soon as possible.    For his decisions on the evening of the 24th and the morning of the 25th, Custer's detractors, pointing to his burning pride in the 7th Cavalry and his reputation as an impetuous commander, have charged him with willful disobedience of orders springing from a blind determination to win all the glory. He failed to meet Terry's desire that he continue up the Rosebud beyond the point where the Indian trail left it before turning to the Little Bighorn, then rushed his exhausted command into battle a day early and without first ascertaining the location and strength of the enemy.    Custer's defenders have replied that Terry's instructions were not binding, that the hostile trail clearly revealed that the Sioux were so close that they could not possibly have slipped off to the southeast, and that to continue the march up the Rosebud would not only have been pointless but might have afforded them the opportunity to escape. Once the regiment had been discovered, moreover, there was no other proper decision than to attack, for the enemy could hardly have been expected to remain in place waiting until the soldiers found it convenient to fight.    A good case can be made for either point of view, and the imponderables insure that men will always arrive at different answers. The command decisions that brought on the Battle of the Little Bighorn will doubtless continue to form fascinating topics of debate.

GX030-89-9165736	"LITTLE BIGHORN BATTLEFIELD   National Monument                                 IV. A Participant's Account of Major Reno's Battle      One of the more literate members of Major Reno's battalion was John M. Ryan, first sergeant of Capt. Thomas H. French's Company M. This extract from his recollections appeared in the  Hardin  (Mont.)  Tribune,  June 22, 1923:    Reno's battalion started down the valley, first on a trot, and then at a gallop, marching in columns of twos. Lieutenant Varnum, a very brave young officer in command of the scouts, rode ahead of Reno's battalion. He swung his hat around in the air, and sung one to the men, ""Thirty days' furlough to the man who gets the first scalp."" We were very anxious for the furlough, but not so particular about the scalp.    We arrived at the bank of the Little Beg Horn river and waded to the other side, and here there was a very strong current, and there was quicksand about three feet deep. On the other side of the river we made a short halt, dismounted, tightened our saddle girths, and then swung into our saddles. After mounting we came up, ""Left front into line,"" Captain French's Company M on the right and Lieutenant McIntosh's company on the left, and Captain Moylan's in the rear.    We were then in the valley of the Little Big Horn, and facing down stream. We started down on a trot and then one a slow gallop. Between the right of my company and the river bank there was quite a lot of underbrush, and bullberry bushes. Captain French gave me orders to take 10 men off to the right of my company and form a skirmish, line, so as to cover the brush from the right of our line to the river bank, as the Indians might be lurking there. We advanced in that formation from one and a half to two miles, until we came to a heavy piece of timber.    Hears First Shot    Before we arrived at the timber, there was one shot fired away ahead of us. I did not know whether it was fired by Lieutenant Varnum's scouts or one of the hostile Indians. That was the first shot that I heard in the opening of the battle of the Little Big Horn on June 25, 1876, and I had pretty good ears about that time.    Private James Turley of my troop when we arrived at the timber and had orders to halt, could not control his horse which carried him towards the Indian camp. That was the last I saw of him. He was a very nice young man. A little incident happened a day our two before we left Fort Rice to go on the expedition. Turley asked me if I would allow him to put some of his property in my clothes chest. I told him that I would with the understanding that if he was killed the contents of the chest would belong to me and if I was killed it would belong to him. After coming back from the expedition the property belonging to those men that were killed was sold at public auction and the proceeds turned over to the paymaster.    When we got to the timber we rode down an embankment and dismounted. This was where the channel of the river changed and was probably several feet lower than the level of the prairie. We dismounted in haste, number four of each set of four holding the horses.    We came up onto higher ground forming a skirmish line from the timber towards the bluffs on the other side of the valley and facing down stream in the direction of the Indian camp. This was our first view of the Indian camp from the skirmish line. Some of the men laid down while others knelt down.    At this particular place there was a prairiedog town and we used the mounds for temporary breast e works. We got the skirmish line formed and here the Indians made their first charge. There were probably 500 of them coming from the direction of their village. They were well mounted and well armed. They tried to cut through our skirmish line. We fired volleys into them repulsing their charge and emptying a number of their saddles.    Lieutenant Hodgson walked up and down the line encouraging the men to keep cool and fire low.    First Man Killed    Finally when they could not cut through us, they strung out in a single file, lying on the opposite side of their ponies from us, and then they commenced to circle. They overlapped our skirmish line on the left and were closing in on the rear to complete the circle. We had orders to fall back to our horses. This was where the first man was killed, Sergt. Miles F. O'Hara of my troop M. He was a corporal going out on the expedition and promoted to a sergeant a few days before his death to replace Sergt. John Dolane, who was discharged, as his term of service had expired, and was back with, the wagon trains at Powder river. Sergeant O'Hara was considered a very fine soldier in M troop and we missed him very much.    In the Indian camp after the battle, when we were destroying it, we found the heads of three of our men tied together with wires and suspended from a lodge pole with their hair all burned off. We did not see their bodies there. The Indians probably threw them into the river. We got back to our horses and the orders were given to mount and this time some of the men became confused and some of them could not fined their horses.    Major Reno had lost his hat and had a red handkerchief tied around his head. As we mounted I looked to the rear in the direction of the river and saw the Indians completing the circle, riding through the brush and lying flat on their ponies. I mentioned the fact to Captain French, saying: ""Captain, the Indians are in our rear."" He answered: ""Oh, no; those are General Custers' men."" Just at that moment one of those Indians fired and Private George Lorentz of my company, who was number one of the first set of fours, was shot, the bullet striking him in the back of his neck and coming out of his mouth. He fell forward on his saddle and dropped to the ground. Just at that moment the Indians fired into us from all sides, and I said to Captain French of my company: ""The best thing that we can do is to cut right through them."" By this time they had us surrounded. They were on higher ground than we were. Major Reno rode up and said: ""Any of you men who wish to make your escape, follow me.""    Reno Leads Charge    The order was then given to charge, and away we went up the steep embankment, cutting through the Indians in a solid body, Major Reno being in advance. As we cut through them the fighting was hand to hand, and it was death to any man who fell from his horse, or was wounded and was not able to keep up with the command. After cutting through we went back over the same ground, and took a circle to the left to gain the bluffs at the nearest point. Here there was some pretty sharp fighting. The Indians were in great numbers on all sides of us. In this charge there were 30 men killed, my company losing 10, but we reached the river.    Bloody Knife, chief of Indian scouts; Charlie Reynolds, a white scout, and Izar Dorman, the negro interpreter, were killed here. Lieutenant Hodgson was wounded, and had his horse shot, and Lieut. Donald Mcintosh was killed. Mcintosh was a brave and faithful officer, commanding Company G.    Lieutenant DeRudio and Fred Girard, a white scout, and some 10 or 12 men became separated from the command and hid themselves in the brush or in the woods, or under the river embankment, and some of those men told me afterwards that they stood in water up to their necks, under the embankment, to keep out of sight of the Indians. Two of those men were sergeants of my company, Charles White and Patrick Carney. They joined the command in the intrenchments on the bluff after dark.    At this point the river was about 50 yards wide, and the water about two and a half feet deep, with a swift current. Lieutenant Hodgson asked one of the men to carry him across, he being wounded and his horse being shot. It was reported that a trumpeter from my company named Fisher, better known as ""Bounce,"" told him to hold on to his stirrup, and the horse drew the lieutenant as well as the rider across the river. He was shot a second time and killed. Now I know of three men who claim to have aided Hodgson.    Fighting is Desperate    The opposite bank of the river was very steep, and the only way to get up to the bluffs was through a buffalo trail worn on the bank, and only wide enough to let one man pass through at a time. Before we crossed the river the fighting was desperate and at close quarters.    In many instances the soldiers would empty their revolvers right into the breasts of the Indians, and after these were empty some were seen to throw them away, and grab their carbines, not having time to return their revolvers to their holsters. In my opinion, if Reno had remained in the timber a short time longer not a man would have made his escape as the Indians outunumbered us 10 to one.    In scaling the bluff Dr. DeWolf, a contract surgeon on the expedition, was killed; also Sergeant Clair of Company K, William D. Myer, a farrier of company M, and Henry Gordono of the same company. Their bodies, with a number of others, lay under cover of our guns, so that the Indians did not get a chance to scalp them.    After we gained the bluffs we could look back upon the plains where the Indians were, and could see them stripping and scalping our men, and mutilating their bodies in a horrible manner. The prairie was all afire. The officers did all in their power to rally the men, and while they were doing so many were killed.    After the companies were formed the firing ceased, and we were joined by Benteen's battalion, which was the first we had seen of him since the division of the regiment. Soon after, the pack train arrived, with Company B, under Captain McDougall, which was very fortunate, as our ammunition was nearly exhausted, and we could not get supplies from any other source. We had several wounded men and we attended to them as well as circumstances would permit. I understood at that time that Captain Weir with his company D, left the command there, and started in the direction General Custer took for a short distance, and theme returned, although I did not see him.    Leaving two companies with the packs and wounded, Major Reno, with five companies, or what was left of them, proceeded in the direction we had supposed General Custer took, and in the direction of the Indian camp.    We went in that direction for probably half a mile until we gained a high point and could overlook the Indian camp and the battlefield. We saw at a distance of from a mile and a half to two miles parties whom we supposed were Indians, riding back and forth, firing scattering shots. We thought that they were disposing of Custer's wounded men, and this afterward proved to be true.    We halted for a few moments, and saw a large herd of ponies at the further end of the village, and could distinguish a large party of Indians coming towards the Indian camp. The prairie around the village and the first battlefield was all afire, having been set by the Indians to hide their movements.    At the top of this bluff we halted, and at foot there was a ford, and this was where Custer had first encountered the Indians, as we found some of the dead bodies there two days afterwards. While we were on the bluffs the Indians again made their appearance, coming in large numbers from the direction in which we heard the firing. We exchanged several shots with them, and we lost a few men, and then had orders to fall back to our packs and wounded.    On our arriving there we dismounted in haste, putting the wounded in a low depression on the bluffs and put packs from the mules around them to shelter them from the fire of the Indians. We then formed a circle of our pack mules and horses, forming a skirmish line all around the hole, and then lay down amid waited for the Indians.    Indians Surround Them    We had been in this position but a short time when they advanced in great numbers from the direction in which we came.    They made several charges upon us and we repulsed them every time. Finally they surrounded us. Soon the firing became general all along the line, very rapid and at close range. The company on the right of my company had a number of men killed in a few minutes. There was a high ridge on the right and an opening on the right of our lines, and one Indian in particular I must give credit for being a good shot.    While we were lying in this line he fired a shot and killed the fourth man on my right. Soon afterward he fired again and shot the third man. His third shot wounded the man on my right, who jumped back from the line, and down among the rest of the wounded. I thought my turn was coming next. I jumped up, with Captain French, and some half a dozen members of my company, and, instead of firing straight to the front, as we had been doing up to the time of this incident, we wheeled to our right and put in a deadly volley, and I think we put an end to that Indian, as there were no more men killed at that particular spot.    Captain French was as brave an officer as ever served in the Seventh Cavalry, and was known to have killed several Indians on different occasions. He had a Springfield rifle, caliber .50, breechloader, and it was his custom, whenever he shot an Indian, to cut a notch in the stock of that gun.    I remember on one occasion he fired at a curlew, two or three shots, and did not hit it. He felt so discouraged that he took the gun and threw it away. A little later I picked it up and rolled it up in a blanket, put it in one of the government wagons, and brought it into Fort Rice, Dakota, after the expedition broke up, unknown to him, and when he learned that I had it he reclaimed it. He retired from the service some years afterwards, and I have been informed, I am sorry to say, he meet with a fatal accident.    When dark set in, it closed the engagement on the twenty-fifth. We went to work with what tools we had, consisting of two spades, our knives and tin coups, and, in fact, we used pieces of hard tack boxes for spades, and commenced throwing up temporary works. We also formed breastworks from boxes of hard bread, sacks of bacon, sacks of corn and oats, blankets, and in fact everything that we could get hold of.    During the night ammunition and the rations reached us where we were entrenched in the lines, but we suffered severely from lack of water. Although the river was only three or four hundred yards away, we were unable to get any water, as the Indians held the approach to it. During the night several men made attempts to get e water, but they were killed or driven back.    About the middle of the night we heard a trumpet call, and the men commenced to cheer, thinking it was Custer's men who were coming to our assistance. Major Reno ordered one of our trumpeters to sound a call, but it was not repeated, so we made up our minds that it was a decoy on the part of the Indians to get us out of our works.    Benteen Hard Pressed    The trumpet that they used probably belonged to one of Custer's trumpeters, but we did not know it at that time. We had no thought of leaving our works, as we head a number of our men wounded there, and some of them pretty badly.    At intervals during the night we could hear the Indians riding back and forth across the river. I have an idea that they thought we were going to make a rush and get out of there.    The next morning, being the 26th, two shots were fired just before daylight by the Indians, in rapid succession. All this time we were wondering what had become of Custer and his troops. This began the engagement of another day. In a few moments the battle raged in earnest, the Indians advancing in large numbers and trying to cut through.    Captain Benteen's company particularly was hard pressed, and the men did their utmost to repulse those Indians who were gaining ground on the troops. Captain Benteen called out to Major Reno for re-enforcements, saying: ""The Indians are doing their best to cut through my lines, and it will be impossible for me to hold my position much longer."" Captain French's Company M was immediately withdrawn from that part of the line which they occupied, and rushed to the assistance of Captain Benteen's company. Both companies made a charge on the Indians and drove them down the hill, but in doing so we lost a number of men. This section of the battlefield was a little higher than the balance of the ground.    Private Tanner Killed    Had the Indians been successful, the day would have been lost, and Reno's command would have shared the fate of Custer's brave men, as Captain Benteen said afterward.    Private James Tanner of Company M, was badly wounded in this charge, and his body lay one the side of the bluffs in an exposed position. There was a call for volunteers to bring him down, and I grabbed a blanket with three other men, rushed to his assistance, rolled him into the blanket, and made quick tracks in getting him from the side of the bluffs to where our wounded lay. Fortunately none of the rescuing party received anything more than a few balls through their clothing. After placing Tanner with the rest of the wounded, he died in a few minutes.    There was a gray horse belonging to my company, that was ridden by Captain French, and he was the best buffalo horse in the command. He was among the other horses near the wounded, and an Indian shot him through the head. He was staggering about among the other horses, and Private Henry C. Voyt, of my company took hold of him to lead him out of the way of the other horses, and Voyt at the same instant had his brains blown out. We buried Private Tanner, about whom I have made some explanation, and Voyt in the same grave the next morning. Then we made a head board out of a piece of hardtack box, and marked their names with a lead pencil one the board, and drove it in to the ground.    Indian Fire Slackens    Late in the day the fire of the Indians slackened, except on the point of a high bluff in the direction in which it was supposed that Custer had gone. Here the Indians put in a few well-directed shots that laid several of our men low. I do not know what kind of a gun one of those Indians used, but it made a tremendous noise, and, in fact those Indians were out of range of our carbine, which were Springfields, caliber .45. Captain French of my company asked me if I could do anything with, those Indians, as they were out of range of the carbines. I told the captain that I would try, and as I was the owner of a 15-pound Sharp's telescope rifle, caliber .45, which I had had made in Bismarck before the expedition started out, and which cost me $100. I fired a couple of shots until I got range of that group of Indians. Then I put in half a dozen shots in rapid succession, and those Indians scampered away from that point of the bluff and that ended the firing on the part of the Indians in that memorable engagement, and the boys set up quite a cheer.    The Indians all scampered from the bluffs across the river and moved back to their encampment. We could see them pulling down their lodges and getting ready for a hasty removal. In a short time they stripped the hides off their lodges and left the poles standing and moved out out from their camp up the valley of the Little Big Horn, and over the field where Major Reno's battalion fought in the beginning of the engagement, and where his dead lay. It was the largest body of Indians that I ever saw move together at one time.    I have seen the Cheyennes, the Arapahoes, the Kiowas, the Apaches, and the Comanches move together inn the Indian territory, and in Kansas years before, while campaigning there under General Custer, I should say that there were double the number moving out from this camp.    When they moved, the captain of my company, Thomas H. French, and I fired into them while they remained in range of our two guns, and those were the last shots fired in the battle of the Little Big Horn. That was well known by every man in Reno's battalion.    Major Reno, Captain French, Captain Benteen, Captain McDougall, Captain Weir, Lieutenant Godfrey and, in fact all of the officers did all that they could in order to defeat the Indians, and some of the officers must have had a charmed life the way they stood up under this heavy fire.    I think the Indians took some of our men prisoners, and when other reinforcements joined us we found what appeared to be human bones, and parts of blue uniforms, where the men had been tied to stakes and trees. Some of the bodies of our officers were not found, at least not at that time. Among them were Lieutenants Harrington, Porter and Sturgis. I understood that some parts of their clothing, uniform or gauntlet gloves were found on the field, which showed that they were killed. In burying the dead many of the bodies were not identified.    After the Indians moved out of sight we jumped out of our works, built better rifles pits, and unsaddled our horses, which had not been unsaddled since the evening of the twenty-fourth.    45 Men Killed    We also took the packs from the mules. Then we got water from the river in camp kettles, and made a better shelter for the horses and wounded, for we expected that the Indians would attack us again.    Reno's command lost, between the engagement in the bottom and the entrenchments on the bluffs, somewhere about 45 men killed and 60 wounded, which will show how desperate the engagement was. In my company, out of 45 men and horses that went into the engagement, 14 men and the second lieutenant were killed, 10 wounded, and we lost about 15 horses killed or disabled.    That night everything was quiet as far as the Indians were concerned. The next morning at daylight we could look from the bluffs over the timber to where the Indian camp was, and we saw that it was deserted, with the exception of the lodge poles, which remained standing. On the other side, a long way off from the Indian camp, we noticed a large cloud of dust arising, and a body of either Indians or troops coming towards the Indian camp, but at the time we could not distinguish which they were.    Some of the officers turned their field glasses on, and thought they were troops. Reno immediately dispatched a couple of his scouts, and it proved to be the balance of our expedition, and General Gibbon's command under General Alfred Terry. It appears that they came through Custer's battlefield, and they counted the dead bodies of 207 men. They then crossed the river.

Educated at the U.S. Military Academy at  West Point , Custer proved his brilliance and daring as a cavalry officer of the Union Army in the Civil War.  General George McClellan  appointed the twenty-three-year-old Custer as brigadier general in charge of a Michigan cavalry brigade. By 1864, Custer was leading the Third Cavalry Division in General Philip Sheridan's Shenandoah Valley campaign. Throughout the fall, the Union Army moved across the Valley, burning homes, mills, and fields of crops.           View of an American Indian Camp ,  Mathew Brady Studio,  between 1844 and 1860.

Custer's Division Retiring from Mount Jackson in the Shenandoah Valley,  October 7, 1864 ,  Alfred Waud, artist.   American Treasures of the Library of Congress    This sketch of Custer's division retiring from Mount Jackson in the Shenandoah Valley on October 7, 1864 is by Alfred Waud, a Civil War sketch artist who documented the war for the press. At a time when the shutter speed of cameras was not fast enough to capture action, the public's only glimpse of battle came from sketch artists. Waud routinely ventured dangerously close to the fighting. He portrays, more intimately than any other artist, the drama and horror of this country's most devastating conflict.         Tapped to pursue General Robert E. Lee's army as it fled from  Richmond , Custer himself received the Confederate flag of truce when Lee surrendered at  Appomattox Courthouse . At the end of the Civil War, he was commissioned to the western frontier as part of an Army campaign to impress and intimidate hostile Plains Indians with a show of U.S. military might.    After gold was discovered in the Black Hills in 1874, white miners flocked into territory ceded the Sioux less than ten years earlier. Although the second Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868) clearly granted the tribe exclusive use of the Black Hills, in the winter of 1875, the U.S. ordered the Sioux to return to their reservation by the end of January. With many Indians out of communication range and many others hostile to the order, the U.S. Army prepared for battle.     On May 17, 1876, Lieutenant Colonel Custer led the 750 men of the 7th United States Cavalry Regiment out of Fort Abraham Lincoln, Dakota Territory.  Commanded by Brigadier General Alfred H. Terry, Custer's division was part of an expedition intended to locate and rout tribes organized for resistance under Chief Sitting Bull.  Hoping to entrap Sitting Bull in the Little Big Horn area, Terry ordered Custer to follow the Rosebud River while he brought the majority of the men down the Yellowstone River. After meeting at the mouth of the Little Big Horn, they planned to force the Lakota Sioux and Cheyenne back to their reservations.

Instead of waiting for Terry, the lieutenant colonel chose to wage an immediate attack. He divided his forces into several groups, and headed out.  Quickly encircled by their enemy, the five companies under Custer's immediate command were slaughtered in less than an hour. Over the next two days, the remnants of the 7th Cavalry fought for their lives as they waited in vain for Custer to relieve them. On June 27, the Indians retreated as reinforcements arrived.  Expecting to meet Custer and prepare for battle, General Terry discovered only the bodies of Custer and his men.     Nearly a third of the men of the 7th Cavalry, including Custer and his brother, died at Little Big Horn.  A stunning but short-lived victory for Native Americans, the Battle of Little Big Horn galvanized the public against the Indians. In response, federal troops poured into the Black Hills.    While many Native Americans surrendered to federal authorities, in 1877, Sitting Bull sought refuge in Canada.  Four years later, with his supporters on the brink of starvation, Sitting Bull returned to the U.S. and to life at Standing Rock Agency. There, he fought the sale of tribal lands under the  Dawes Severalty Act  and lived to participate in the  Ghost Dance  Movement--a cultural and religious revitalization among Native Americans.  Threatened by a religious awakening that promised the end of white dominance, federal authorities attempted to take custody of Sitting Bull in  1890 .  He was killed in the affray sparked by the attempted arrest.

Lane Evans (D-IL), the Ranking Democratic Member on the              House Committee on Veterans Affairs, a Florida firm has agreed to              keep jobs under a new VA property management contract in the United              States.  Evans, a strong supporter of Buy America, had opposed              award of the contract because the company, Ocwen Financial              Corporations, has become a leader in outsourcing American jobs to              low-paid employees in India.                Evans noted that after he brought the matter to              the attention of the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, Anthony J.              Principi, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) was able to obtain              from Ocwen a bilateral agreement declaring that it will not              outsource labor for VA property management services to India.               Further, Ocwen has also agreed to provide a right of first refusal              to displaced VA employees whom Ocwen determines are qualified for              jobs under the contract.  Nonetheless, even if offered jobs with              Ocwen, former federal employees will be required to relocate to              Florida and will have no guarantee that the wages and benefits              provided by Ocwen will be commensurate with those currently provided              by VA.                While I am pleased that the jobs under this              contract will not be outsourced to other countries, I find it              unacceptable that federal workers are being placed at competitive              disadvantage due to Ocwens use of low-paid Indian workers to              improve its bottom line, said Evans.  By providing government              contracts to companies that pride themselves on saving money by              moving jobs from the United States to developing countries, our              government sends a message that the bottom line for corporations is              more important than maintaining jobs for skilled American workers,              observed Evans.                Evans has a long history of supporting the              rights of American workers.  He persuaded the VA to obtain employee              uniforms made by American workers in Illinois rather than low-paid              workers in developing countries.  Evans questioned how can the              United States prosper if this government is willing to sacrifice              American jobs to improve corporate profits?  While outsourcing some              government work to American workers may be appropriate and              cost-effective, Evans strongly opposes placing federal workers at a              competitive disadvantage by corporate outsourcing to nations with              low wages.                -30-                                          Back to  Press Releases

Lane, PAO       June - 2003                                                    Volume 5, Issue 6    NEW MEXICO WING   Tell me and I forget; Show me and I remember; Involve me and I understand   NM WING CADET NAMED  SWR CADET OF THE YEAR   By 1st Lt Craig Degenhardt,Eagle Composite Squadron P.A.O         C/Lt Col Kaycee Gilbert after flight in T-34 aircraft   ( Photo by 1st Lt Craig Degenhardt)   The T-34 was revving up its engine, the only T-34 in operation in the Civil Air Patrol. The pilot in the front seat returned the salute of the ground operations cadet. The old fighter trainer started rolling down the taxiway. The cadet officer in the back seat was beaming. As well she should, she was about to take off fast and high, just like her Civil Air Patrol career. Cadet Lt. Col. Kaycee Gilbert in 5 short years has come from wanting to be like her brothers, to surpassing them and flying high into the CAP history books. For the first time in memory a New Mexico cadet is to be the Southwest Region Cadet of the Year. Only 8 out of the nearly 27,000 cadets in the Civil Air Patrol receive this honor.    Just as an airplane doesn't fly it's self, it takes a whole organization to get it airborne, so it was with Ms. Gilbert. Her desire to read all her brothers CAP Manuals lead her to join CAP. As a member of Central New Mexico Composite Squadron she met then Cadet Colonel Isaac Block (now senior Capt. Block), She looked up to him and wanted to be like him. Capt David Simonson helped keep her motivated. Yet she claims the most influential person in her CAP life has been Col. Robert Haulenbeek, The leadership of these pilot officers encouraged her, she has logged over 22 hours as a student pilot.    Her accomplishments in the air are only a small portion of her resume. She is embarrassed by the fuss and wouldn't sit long for an interview. She has done ""some things"" is about all you'll get out of her. Yet in reviewing the letters of recommendation for her award her ""some things"" turns into an impressive array of accomplishments: Squadron Cadet Commander; many encampment leadership positions-even filling in Senior positions; Three Commander's Commendations; Mission qualifications include Communications Unit Director, Radio Operator, Flight Line Marshaller, Ground Team Member; New Mexico Wing Cadet Programs Cadet Activities Officer; Southwest Region Conference 2002 Cadet Activities organizer; assisted with the 2002 Southwest Region Cadet Competition; International Air Cadet Exchange US representative to the United Kingdom; New Mexico Wing Cadet of the Year 1998 (while being a cadet for only 9 months of that year); and several roles in the Cadet Advisory Council's for the Wing, the Region, and the Nation.    Outside of CAP she is a member of the National Honors Society, 2002 graduate of Estancia High School, Lettered athlete in football, baseball, basketball, cross country and track. She is currently studying biology at University of New Mexico. Her assistance was invaluable during the Presidentially declared disaster Cerro Grande Fire, She was awarded the Disaster Relief Ribbon with ""V"". She travels over an hour from her home to attend Eagle Composite Squadron Meetings. Early in her career she was passed over as Squadron Cadet Commander, it didn't make her happy but she understood why. She thinks she learned more by being passed over then if she had received the position the first time. In July 2002 she was rewarded with the challenge of taking over the Wing's Squadron of the Year. She has tried to keep it the best squadron in the state. While results are not yet in on the squadron rating for this year she is proud that Cadet and Senior membership is at an all time high. She is also Cadet Activities Officer for the Wing, She works with Lt.Col. Paul Ballmer, coordinating activities with nearly every squadron in the Wing. She seems to spend more time at Wing HQ & squadron than anyone else. On July 3rdt 2003, after two consecutive terms, she will turn over command of the cadets in Eagle Composite Squadron, Kirtland A.F.B. She is old enough to turn senior member but will remain a Cadet because she says she has too much that she can still do for the Cadet program. She will take on duties as Eagle Composite Squadron Administration Officer and Senior Professional development. She has 22 awards to on her ribbon rack, some have been awarded multiple times. The Southwest Region Cadet of the Year will officially be bestowed upon her at the September NM Wing Conference.    That T-34 is coming in for a landing at Santa Fe Municipal airport. She has another mission under her belt, a SAREX ELT search. She is still beaming when she the canopy opens. When asked what in CAP had given her the most pleasure, she didn't hesitate, ""Flying the T-34, and working with NCAC"" And what does the highest ranking cadet to come out of the now de-chartered Central New Mexico Composite Squadron say when asked what was the worse she's experienced in CAP? After pondering for a while her face brightens and she says 'What's bad with CAP?.....I can't think of anything!"" Of such stuff is made the Southwest Region Cadet of the Year.    z     WING STAFF - SQUADRON COMMANDERS TO MEET   New Mexico Wing Staffers and Squadron Commanders will meet on Saturday 14 June at NM Wing HQ beginning at 10:00AM. Anyone with an agenda item is asked to email them to Chief of Staff David Gottheimer at  dgott@juno.com . Squadron Commanders will meet together immediately after the joint morning meeting to discuss issues in their squadrons.   z     Aircrew  (Scanner/Observer)  Course Offered in June   NM Wing will hold an Aircrew (Scanner/Observer) Course at Wing Headquarters on 21-22 June 2003. Class will begin at 1000 21 June and end approximately 1530 22 June. All members needing aircrew training for their specialty qualification--initial or renewal--should attend, especially mission pilots who need scanner training to re-qualify as mission pilots.   It is anticipated there will be training funds to reimburse aircraft and vehicle travel expenses. Interested members should send a CAPF-17 to LtCol Frank A. Buethe at wing headquarters or, register by e-mail at  fbuethe@comcast.net . If you use email registration, be sure to include your name, your address, your phone number, your rank, your squadron name and your Squadron Commander's name.   z     CLOVIS JUNE SAREX CANCELLED   By Lt Col Frank Buethe, NMWGDES   Due to the existing manning levels in High Plains squadron, the events already and to be scheduled in June, and the necessity of additional staff training the Clovis SAREX has been cancelled. Clovis and Roswell will conduct a combined SAREX on 5-7 September with both squadrons hosting the event at either the Clovis or Roswell airport. SAREX staffing will be provided by both Clovis and Roswell squadron personnel.   The SAREX scheduled for 15-17 August at Gallup will be staffed by Gallup Composite Squadron supplemented by Farmington personnel. Emergency Services will schedule additional ICS staff training in June for all wing personnel who need education or retraining in ICS   operations.   z       CN Arena Needs Camera Info   Lt Ralph Meyerheim, head of the Customs part of our counter drug mission, would like to know of anyone who has a digital camera. Meyerheim said, ""If anyone is using their personal camera on CN or ES missions I would like them to contact me."" The idea is to find out what computer software is needed to view the pictures once the camera is brought to a mission base. Unfortunately, each respective camera must have its own software to download the pictures. Meyerheim's plan is to have all the software on a computer that is centrally located.   To contact Lt Meyerheim, email him at  Remeyerheim@msn.com  or call him at 505-898-3373.   z     NEW SQUADRON COMMANDERS ANNOUNCED   On Saturday 19 May, Col James Norvell went to Clovis. He was a Wing Commander on a mission. The mission was to help High Plains Composite Squadron get back on its feet. He was accompanied by Col Larry Harrah, LtCol Ric Himebrook, LtCol Frank Buethe and Major Dave Gottheimer. When the trusty band of leaders had finished their meeting with the squadron members they had a new Squadron Commander --M. Pat O'Briant! Col Norvell was delighted with the enthusiasm of the small group and was heartened by the fact there were three new members who had applications and money in hand at the meeting. He told the gathering, ""We are all here to help you. Please call on NM Wing Staff members and Squadron Commanders for their guidance and expertise if you have the need.""   On Wednesday 28 May, Col Norvell further announced there is a new Squadron Commander for Thunderbird Composite Squadron in Albuquerque. He is Maj Russ Kappelman who comes to us from the Wisconsin Wing. Maj Kappleman comes with a vast knowledge of CAP having served five times previously as a squadron commander in Wisconsin. Again, Col Norvell assured Maj Kappleman of the assistance of the NM Wing Staff and fellow Squadron Commanders.   Welcome aboard to these fine gentlemen in the Squadron Commander position for these two squadrons!   z     WING STAFF VACANCY    Information provided by Lt Col John Green, NMWGDOS   The NM Wing will have a staff vacancy for Wing Stan/Eval Officer on July 1st.   The position will be filled by a CFI & CFII. Besides the job description described in CAPM 20-1, the Stan/Eval Officer will schedule, coordinate, file necessary forms, and if necessary put together annual pilot training seminars for National Check Pilot Standardization Course (once per year in January). The Stan/Eval Officer will also organize Flight Clinics (once or twice per year), and Mountain Flying Clinics (once or twice per year). In addition, he/she will be responsible for twice annual compiling and reporting to National HQ of NM Wing's completed flight checks (form 5, 5G, & 91). And, most importantly, be responsible for all the Wing's check pilots. Anyone interested in this position, please contact Lt Col John J. Green, NM Wing/DO by email at  john.green@ao.dtra.mil  or by calling his cell phone at 505- 459-7382.   z     LAS CRUCES MID-SCHOOL INITIATIVE CADETS GRADUATE   By Lt Col Charles Moorer, III, Las Cruces Information Officer   The Las Cruces Composite Squadron held a Promotion and Awards Ceremony at the Sierra Middle School in Las Cruces on Tuesday, 20 May. It was held for new Civil Air Patrol cadets who were the first graduates in the new CAP Cadet Initiative program at the school. Co-sponsors of this program were the Sierra Middle School, the New Mexico Wing of the Civil Air Patrol and the New Mexico National Guard. Daily meetings were held during the spring school semester.   The ceremony began with the Presentation of the Colors by a Color Guard from the Las Cruces Composite Squadron. Chaplain Lt Col Charles A. Moorer, III, the New Mexico Wing Chaplain gave the Invocation. Introduction of the staff was conducted by Chief Warrant Officer Frank Delmargo, Liaison Officer for the Department of Justice of the New Mexico National Guard. He introduced Sgt Major Alex Garcia, Drug Demand Reduction Administrator of the New Mexico National Guard. He also presented the following that have been National Guard Mentorship Coordinators who have worked directly with the new cadets: Sgt Patrick Chaves, Sgt Sean Dimmer and Sgt Richard Hernandez. Also introduced was Lt Col Fred Harsany, New Mexico Wing Liaison Officer, Lt Col Claude Luisada, New Mexico Wing Middle School Initiative Coordinator and Lt Col Alan Fisher, Squadron Commander. Each spoke about the scope of the Mid School Initiative program. A special guest was the Honorable Bill Mattiace, newly elected Mayor of Las Cruces, who brought greeting and congratulations from the City of Las Cruces. Mayor Mattiace also assisted in the presentation of the Certificates of Graduation. Also honored was 1Lt Deborah Martin, Las Cruces Composite Squadron Professional Development Officer, Training Officer and Testing Officer. Lt Martin also worked with the cadets.   There were 47 new cadets who were enrolled in the program. Of the 47 new cadets, 43 were presented with Certificates of Promotion. There were several awards presentations to new cadets for excellence in various activities. The ceremony ended with a fellowship time and refreshmen ts.    z     INVEST $$$ IN  YOUR  SQUADRON   In Civil Air Patrol, the good leaders from the squadron level on up have hours and hours of leadership training under their belts. Its easy to think, ""I can do that"" and then realize, without the proper training, things do not run smoothly without trained leaders.    Since the reorganization of the billeting at Kirtland Air Force Base the cost of attending the SWR Staff College has increased considerably because students and staff now pay for their rooms. In years past billeting was free to CAP members -- but no more. A person can eat like a king at the Base Dining Hall for very little but by the time billeting, food AND the college fee are added up it sometimes is beyond people's budget.    The SWR Staff College is a wonderful opportunity to start new members (two years or less) on the road to taking over the responsi-bilities of your squadron one day. One way the squadron can invest their hard-earned money wisely is to pay the college fee $95 (in the form of a scholarship) for good leadership candidates. The squadron will reap the rewards when the well-trained officer returns with enthusiasm and knowledge of ""how to"". It’s a much better investment than throwing a whale of a Christmas party!   Start now. Encourage your  potential  squadron commanders to send in their CAPF 17 to attend this extensive training and offer to help them with expenses. Former students of the SWRSC can almost guarantee it will be the best $95 your squadron ever invested!   z       CADETS CARRY COLORS FOR CELTIC FESTIVAL   By 1st Lt Craig Degenhardt,  Eagle CS PAO     Members of the Thunderbird and Eagle Composite Squadrons presented the Colors at the 16th Annual Rio Grande Valley Celtic Festival & Highland Games on Saturday 17 May 2003 at the Menual School in Albuquerque. It is a celebration of Scottish, Irish, Welsh, Manx & Galician cultures. The Civil Air Patrol Color Guard led a parade of bagpipe & drum units onto the field of honor, including the world champions Grade 4B Desert Pipes and Drums from Albuquerque New Mexico.     z     Safety Bulletin   By Col Larry Harrah, NMWGSO   Temperature threats:   With the warm weather already here, it is time to assess the treats imposed by increasing temperature. Our most obvious threat is to aircraft performance. Last year about this time I addressed to problem with air ingestion engines and I will not address this here! These is more to the story than engine performance!! Remember that the airfoil’s lift   depends on air density in much the same way as the engine depends on th scooping up of air (oxygen) to burn the fuel efficiently. If the air density has decreased due to an increase in temperature, then to produce as much lift, the wing must pass an equivalent MASS of air in an equivalent time period: it has to go faster! If the aircraft has to go faster to produce the lift, and the engine is producing less power, the takeoff is greatly extended. All this is pointing out that it takes much more runway in hot weather than cold; do your computations!! before hauling the load into the air, maybe.   Some things about low air density (high density altitude) may not have been considered. Another factor that makes low air density considerations important in flying and driving as well, is that as the air density decreases, its ability to conduct heat decreases as well. While this is mostly offset in the aircraft with its necessity to maintain a specific airspeed (the airspeed necessary to provide the required lift gives the same mass airflow over the cooling surfaces), in ground vehicles that is not the case. At the same ground speed, a vehicle gets less cooling as the density altitude increases! Your engine, oil cooler and transmission fluid cooler become rapidly less efficient at the posted speed limit. For warm weather, you should inspect and correct any deficiencies in these devices to ensure their proper operation. Particularly, check to see that mud and insects have not blocked the cooling surface or vanes (radiator). Overheating in our mountainous territory in the summer months can be directly attributed to high density altitude!   I have not read any article that addresses the high density altitude effects on the human body!  Why Not?  The body consumes air in much the same way as your air breathing engine! The loss in ""power"" experienced by the body is treated in FAA regulations as a function of altitude, not in terms of density altitude! How can this be? It is density altitude that matters! That controls the body’s oxidation function that supplies our operational energy! Please remember that our body functions run about the same way as the engine in your aircraft. More oxygen, more energy produced per unit of time (power). Thought processes require energy and, they as well are affected by density altitude. Look at the accomplishments of our government during the summer months; the idiots make even more ridiculous decisions during the ""dog days"". Do a self survey to assess your ability to think and  perform  in times of high density altitude. Get your cooling system in shape for summer (clogged arteries cool less efficiently and distribute power less quickly). A regimen of regular exercise will help clean up your system; do it.   All of this leads to our June safety slogan:       Beat the Heat with Air Flow (Over the Wings and Through the Cooler)!   Do the calculations and be safe on our missions and in your everyday activities. Be prepared is the Boy Scouts marching song and should be ours as well (Tom Lehrer, please forgive the plagiarism, you might write a song about that; Johann Bolyai will approve) (if anyone remembers Nicolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky let me know).   Well, I have waxed eloquent on this subject but it is an important one!!! Don’t forget the effect of density altitude on performance of any device, including our bodies.   Next month, I will do some analysis of our next threat, thunderstorms. They are coming, hopefully by mid June; we need the water badly. We don’t need tornados but they are a possibility. I hope that you will consider this subject carefully and use your common sense to face the challenges.   Next months Safety Meetings should consider weather during our monsoon period; challenges and rewards. Remember to review the ""Sentinel"" in your meetings. Let us learn from other’s mistakes since we will not have the luxury to make them ourselves.   I still need Safety Slogans from the units; I’m getting to the bottom of my well. Accepted slogans get rewards!   Remember, Safety Reports are overdue for the first quarter of 2003 as are some of the yearly Safety Surveys! Next deadline is 15 July for Safety Reports for quarter 2 of 2003.   z     Going Downhill   By Capt John Lorenz   Us macho and macha high-desert pilots get to feeling smug about flying at high density altitudes and in mountainous terrain, and about how pilots flying from less exalted elevations have to adjust to what we deal with regularly, albeit not always successfully. But there are also important changes to be aware of when going from 9000-foot density altitudes down to the thicker soup they call ‘atmosphere’ at sea level.   For one, the nose-up attitudes that produce Vx, Vy, and cruise climb airspeeds are steeper than those we’re used to since the engine, now sucking in as much as 20% more oxygen, is producing up to 20% more power and is capable of dragging the airframe up a steeper hill. Lowland pilots who are accustomed to such steep climb angles get caught nose high and slow, closer to a stall than they realize, when trying to out-climb obstacles or rising terrain at unaccustomed high density altitudes. But a pilot going the other way, who is used to the relatively shallow climb attitudes and who is trying to outclimb trees at the end of a sea-level runway, may not be using the full potential of the airplane.    The additional power near sea level means you may have to hold the brakes harder during runup and that marginal brakes may not even hold completely, so watch for forward creep while checking the mags. Additional power also means that fuel consumption goes up: the 8 gallons per hour that the Lycoming O-320 has been burning rain or shine, night or day, taxi or full-power climb, may jump to 10 gallons per hour. That combined with slower true airspeeds results in significantly reduced range in terms of both hours aloft and miles over the ground, a potential ‘gotcha’ with serious consequences.   Maintaining a proper airspeed is critical on final, and a 65-kt approach should be flown at 65 knots regardless of density altitude. Unfortunately, near the ground, much of our perception of speed is based on the visual impression of forward speed over the ground. Sea-level pilots get into trouble because they are used to seeing the ground go by more slowly on short final than is required to maintain a safe airspeed at higher density altitudes. Therefore they sometimes let airspeed bleed off to dangerous conditions in order to maintain the accustomed impression of speed over the ground. On the other hand, pilots who are used to seeing the ground go by faster on final are prone to flying final approach too fast at sea-level airfields, since otherwise it appears to us that the aircraft is loafing along at dangerously slow speeds. The main problem with a fast approach is that many sea-level runways are relatively short: with full power available from engines, runways at lower altitudes don’t have to be as long as those in the mountains. 2000-ft runways, bounded by FAA-approved 50-ft trees, are not uncommon in Ohio. Arriving in the flare with excess airspeed leads to floating and possible runway over-runs. A pitot tube can’t see the ground, and it responds to changes in density altitude the same way lift from the wing does, so be aware of the airspeed indicator on final and use the normal approach airspeed.   Haze and limited visibility are more common at lower altitudes, and the numerous small towns often seem to have been cloned. It takes some mental re-adjustment for pilots who are used to navigating by heading for a distinctive mountain range 50-75 miles away to navigate successfully where ""good"" visibility is only 5-10 miles, all roads run north-south/east-west, and where everything is flat and green. There are also more tall radio towers where the population is denser. Towers aren’t plotted on most GPS data bases, so plan to stay high or else keep track of their positions on a sectional map and anticipate them.   High humidity is common at lower altitudes whether or not it’s hazy, so carburetor icing and fuel tank contamination from condensation are both more likely. The first reaction to pulling the carb heat if ice is present in the venturi will be for the engine to run  more  roughly as it melts and ingests the ice, and it takes willpower to let the process continue for a minute or two until the engine runs better.    Management of the mixture is also different. Lean for taxi but remember to go full rich before takeoff and again before landing. A go-around with a leaned mixture might cause the engine to balk; at a minimum it would be with less than maximum power. It can also cause engine damage.   The grass airfields that are more common at low altitudes make dirt and gravel strips of the desert look like ragged cousins, but grass can be treacherous. It’s slippery when wet, diminishing directional control and virtually negating braking. Tall grass can add drag and extend a takeoff roll, so a soft-field takeoff technique is appropriate.    Familiarity with flight at high density altitudes doesn’t automatically over-qualify us for flight at sea level. Aviation, for all its numbers, benefits from a bit of flexibility.   z      US Air Force Judges NM Wing ES   By Maj Sharon Lane, NMWGPAO   NM Wing was evaluated for its SAR soundness the weekend of 2-3 May at Santa Fe. Aircraft from all over New Mexico were present along with 48 senior members and six cadets and the new Mobile Operations Base trailer participated in the two-day event.   SW Region CAP/USAF personnel were the evaluators and came into New Mexico from the SAREVAL in Arizona. Those attending were Col Blake Fentress, SWR CAP/USAF Commander, Col Joe ""Brillo"" Macklin, Lt Col Vic Demorol, MSgt (ret.) Ken Skelton, MSgt Rod Watson, Beth White, SWRDAE all from Ft Worth, Texas, NM Wing AF Liaison Office State Director Mr. Fred Harsany, Col Milton West, USAF, Maj Sherry Riddle, USAF, Maj Bernie Ulmer of Albuquerque. Lt Col Allan Williams-SWRDEO and Capt Tina Britton from Louisiana and Sgt Chuck Farry ,USAF and Michael ""ET"" Holm both from Arizona.   The evaluators walked quietly through the mission base and the flight line observing NM Wing members at their assigned jobs. Col Fentress, in his conclusion Saturday evening said, ""The pre-planning on Friday night was exceptional --the best we've ever seen!"" The evaluators met in the late afternoon in a closed-door session to determine the grade for each area evaluated and then met with mission base personnel to reveal the tentative grade. Col Macklin said, ""This is not written in stone. Before the final typing of the report, we will again look at each area and make sure we didn't miss anything."" With a SATISFACTORY overall grade, 14 areas received the following grades:   Agency Liaison - satisfactory, Air Crews - marginal, Air Operations - marginal, Air support group/flight line - satisfactory   Chaplain - excellent, Communications - satisfactory, Finance/admin - satisfactory, Ground teams - not evaluated   Incident Commander - satisfactory, Information (PAO) - excellent, Logistics - outstanding, Operations - satisfactory   Planning - satisfactory, Safety - satisfactory   Col Fentress was very pleased to hand out two very special awards at the end of the report. He said, ""Even though everyone SHOULD do their best during an evaluation, sometimes there are some really outstanding people or exceptional performers who go ""above and beyond"". I am pleased to recognize two such people tonight."" He continued, ""For an exceptional performance in their positions I award these specially minted SW Region coins to 1Lt John Gravel (project officer for the Eval) and Chaplain Col Thomas Jackson."" Those in attendance acknowledged their approval of the awards with loud applause. Following his presentations, NM Wing Commander Col Jim Norvell and ES Director Lt Col Frank Buethe stepped to the podium to present Commanders Commendations to Lt Col Larry Zentner, 1Lt John Gravel, Capt David Simonsen and Mr. Fred Harsany for outstanding performance in preparing the Santa Fe Mission Base for the important event. Again, loud applause marked the approval for these notable commendations.   Air crews and personnel were invited back to fly on Sunday and attend a ""hot wash"" (a debriefing) at the mission base. After hearing the grade Saturday night, Lt Col Frank Buethe said, ""This is how we learn what areas we need improvement in. Its been a good evaluation."" Knowing Lt Col Buethe, one can assume he started on Sunday to ""make it better"".   z     LONGTIME COLUMNIST DIES FROM CANCER   By Capt Joe Baker, Farmington   A long time columnist for AOPA Pilot magazine and noted aviation historian died April 27 after a lengthy battle with cancer. Peter M. Bowers was 84. Born in San Francisco, Bowers wrote hundreds of columns, magazine and newspaper articles, and books. His monthly column appeared in Pilot from 1962 to 1984. He also wrote the popular ""Wings & Things"" for GANews, setting a record of 786 columns since it began in 1972. Bowers also accumulated one of the largest collections of aviation photographs in the country; unfor-tunately, a large part of it was lost in a fire several years ago. Bowers is survived by his wife, Alice, step-daughter Allison Berghmans, and son David Rice Bowers.   z     NEW MEXICANS - AREN'T WE INTERESTING PEOPLE?

You just got your fifth DWI and got elected to the state legislature in the same week. ( I don't write this stuff--I just publish it! Ed. )   Your swamp cooler got knocked off your roof by a dust devil.   You have been on TV more than three times telling about your alien abduction.   You think Las Vegas is a town in the northeastern part of the state.   You iron your jeans to ""dress up"".   Your other vehicle is also a pick-up truck.   You know the punch line to at least one Espanola joke.   You have driven to an Indian Casino at 3:00 AM because you were hungry.    You think the Lobos fight song is ""Louie, Louie"".   You know whether you want ""red or green.""   You see nothing odd when, in the conversations of the people in line around you at the grocery store, every other word of each sentence alternates between Spanish and English.

Fact sheets                  Publications                  Federal           Register           notices        Contacts                               Wave your Stars and Stripes with respect               As we approach Veteran's Day on Nov. 11, its a good time to think about how we can honor those who have served our country. One way is to display an American flag—a symbol of the freedoms that veteran's worked hard to guarantee.        To ensure you treat the flag with respect, heed the following guidelines from the U.S. flag code:        Raise the American flag briskly and lower it slowly and ceremoniously. Ordinarily it should be displayed only between sunrise and sunset. It should be illuminated if displayed at night. Salute the flag of the United States of America as it is hoisted and lowered. Hold the salute until the flag is unsnapped from the halyard, or through the last note of music, whichever is the longest.         To salute, all persons come to attention. Those in uniform give the appropriate formal salute. Citizens not in uniform salute by placing their right hands over the heart. Men wearing hats should remove them and hold them to the left shoulder, hand over the heart. Members of organizations in formation should salute upon command of the person in charge.         When the flag is lowered, no part of it should touch the ground or any other object; it should be received by waiting hands and arms. Store the flag by folding it neatly and ceremoniously.         When the flag is displayed from a staff projecting from a window, balcony or building, the union should be at the peak of the staff unless the flag is at half-staff.        When the flag is displayed over a street, it should be hung vertically, with the union to the north or east. If the flag is suspended over a sidewalk, the flag's union should be farthest from the building.        When flown with flags of states, communities or societies on separate flagpoles, which are of the  same height and in a straight line, the United States flag is always placed in the position of honor.                The other flags may be smaller, but none may be larger.        No other flag ever should be placed above it.        The flag of the United States is always the first flag raised and the last lowered.              When using a flag remember:                Never dip the flag to any person or thing. Fly it upside down only as a distress signal.        Don't use the flag as a drapery, for covering a speaker's desk, draping a platform or for any decoration in general. Bunting of blue, white and red stripes is available for these purposes. The blue stripe of the bunting should be on the top.        Never use the flag for advertising purposes. It should not be embroidered, printed or otherwise impressed on such articles as cushions, handkerchiefs, napkins, boxes or anything intended to be discarded after temporary use. Advertising signs should not be attached to the staff.        Don't use the flag as part of a costume or athletic uniform, except that a flag patch may be used on the uniform of military personnel, fireman, policeman and members of patriotic organizations.        The flag should never have anything placed on it, attached to it, nor any mark, insignia, letter, word, number, figure or drawing of any kind.        Never use the flag as a receptacle for receiving, holding, carrying or delivering anything.              Remember to mend and clean an American flag as needed. When a flag is so worn it is no longer fit to serve as a symbol of our country, it should be destroyed by burning in a dignified manner. Most American Legion posts or Boy Scout troops regularly conduct a dignified flag-burning ceremony. Contact your local American Legion post or Boy Scout council to ask about this service.        Fly your United States of America flag with pride and treat it with respect.

GX009-04-0603638	"California Army National Guard Brings     ""Safe"" and ""Secure"" Christmas at Parkway Elementary       By     Capt. Kas Jordan      California Army National Guard                S anta Claus delivered a powerful     message to the students, faculty and families at Parkway Elementary School Sunday,     December 5: The community, backed by the California National Guard, intends to keep     violence and drugs out and safety and security in the South Sacramento School located in     an area with a reputation of violence and drug abuse. ""Listen     to your parents and your teachers,"" said Santa in a deep resonant voice that would     make any child feel secure. ""Listen and they will help you get to where you have to     be in this world.""       Santa     Claus, played by Spec. Gerome Sims, California National Guard, arrived at the school on     board a Humvee jeep with three tiny reindeer played by Sgt. Cassandra Simon as Vixen,     Claudette Romo, as Rudolph, and Spec. Elena Vallecorner as Comet, and a mouse played by     Larissa Love. Any grinches lingering nearby with hopes of  disrupting the school     Christmas celebration were quickly discouraged as Santa's helpers from the 1-184th Air     Assault and 126th Medical Company touched down in a Blackhawk helicopter on the school     grounds. The Sacramento Police Department and the Sacramento County Sheriff's Department     reinforced the ""safe School, drug free"" atmosphere with 10 officers in full     uniform attending the celebration. The police also delivered their message through their     actions when they stopped a motorist driving recklessly near the school, reassuring     families that the school was safe. The police officers strengthened their bond with school     children by passing out badges and talking with the kids, adding to the safe atmosphere.       ""We have 60 Parkway families that we contacted for the     Christmas Party,"" explained Parkway Principal Jim Trimble. ""Forty-four of them     attended.""       Military hardware, police officers and soldiers dressed in Battle Dress Uniforms (BDU)     were not the only support that Santa enlisted from the community. The jolly old man from     the North Pole also conscripted community groups and corporate sponsors. Scottish     bagpipers from the Sacramento Pipe Band added holiday music to the party and Fox 40     Television News Anchor Warren B. Armstrong added to to the holiday atmosphere with his     narration of ""The Night Before Christmas,"" Staff Sgt. Greg Fessler and staff     acted out a spoof skit as Armstrong read a modified version of the famous Christmas poem.       ""This is not a charity project,"" explained Lt. Col. Harrison jack, the     strategic planner for this youth program. ""It's  a community support project.     The California National Guard is supporting the families' and Parkway community's efforts     to chase violence and drugs from the area and to nourish a safe and secure     environment.""       The Parkway project is part of Maj. Gen. Paul D. Monroe, Jr.'s community relations     mission. The adjutant general tasked Jack to develop the program last August when Dr.     Herman Wrice, a nationally recognized advocate for drug free communities, visited the     school and organized a community mach on local crack houses and well-known drug habitats.     Wrice asked the California National Guard to adopt the Parkway Elementary School and to     help clean up and repair the school. The 132nd Engineer Battalion and the 2668th     Transportation Company volunteers painted, landscaped, pruned trees and built benches at     the school last August. Since then the Guard has maintained its presence at the school,  volunteering for various maintenance     and community activity projects.       ""Many of Parkway's 600 students live in Franklin Villa,"" Jack said. ""I     realized that if we could adopt the school, then we could spread over to the Franklin     Villa with antidrug and anticrime programs.""       The headquarters, State Area Command, requested to celebrate its annual Christmas Party     at the school and bring their families and friends to the school. The celebration had a     dramatic impact as soldiers dressed in BDUs generated a powerful visual message that the     school was safe. The children obviously felt secure as more than 100 of them rushed to     greet Santa, his reindeer and helpers as they climbed from the Humvee jeep and Blackhawk     helicopter. Many children, and their parents, remained behind as the pilots and flight     crews answered questions and allowed guests to tour the equipment.       Guardsmen raised more than $350 for food and candy. Local businesses and private     individuals donated several hundred more dollars for toys. Robin Trimble, the Director of     Contributions for USAA, said that USAA was able to donate 150 sweat shirts to be used as     uniforms for the students. Staff Sgt. Greg Fessler, one of the event's organizers, said     that the party was an NCO (Noncommissioned officer) mission.       ""All the NCOs went above and beyond the call of duty to come through for these     kids,"" Fessler said. ""Soldiers from this headquarters spend many hours of their     personal time to make this party a success.""       For Sgt. 1st Class Dorothy Love the event was a family affair. She was one of the     event's coordinators, her daughter was one of Santa's helpers, and her son-in-law and     grandchildren also participated.       The Guard plans on continuing its relationship with Parkway this summer by sponsoring a     summer leadership camp at the school, similar to other ongoing California Guard youth     programs. The camp will emphasize good citizenship, leadership skills, and sportsmanship.       According to Jim Trimble, 20 first and second grade boys need soldiers as mentors as     quickly as possible.       ""If any of your soldiers are interested please have them call me at the school at     (916) 443-5082,"" Trimble said. ""We here at Parkway really appreciate all the     energy and time your soldiers have committed to helping our kids.""       Jack echoed the adjutant general's commitment to find mentors and expand the Parkway     program.       ""Through shared traditions, the Guard hopes to expand its own families to the     larger community family,"" he said. ""The Guard hopes to broaden community     networking that will attract private corporations.""

GX007-43-9764169	Guidelines for Display of the Flag   Public Law 94-344, known as the Federal Flag Code, contains rules for handling and displaying the U.S. Flag. While the federal code contains no penalties for misusing the flag, states have their own flag codes and may impose penalties. The language of the federal code makes clear that the flag is a living symbol.   In response to a Supreme Court decision which held that a state law prohibiting flag burning was unconstitutional, Congress enacted the Flag Protection Act in 1989. It provides that anyone who knowingly desecrates the flag may be fined and/or imprisoned for up to one year. However, this law was challenged by the Supreme Court in a 1990 decision that the Flag Protection Act violates the First Amendment free speech protections.   Important Things to Remember   Traditional guidelines call for displaying the flag in public only from sunrise    to sunset. However, the flag may be displayed at all times if it's illuminated    during darkness. The flag should not be subject to weather damage, so it should    not be displayed during rain, snow and wind storms unless it is an all-weather    flag.   It should be displayed often, but especially on national and state holidays    and special occasions.   The flag should be displayed on or near the main building of public institutions,    schools during school days, and polling places on election days.   It should be hoisted briskly and lowered ceremoniously.   When carried in procession with other flags, the U.S. flag should be either    on the marching right (the flag's right) or to the front and center of the flag    line. When displayed on a float in a parade, the flag should be hung from a    staff or suspended so it falls free. It should not be draped over a vehicle.   When displayed with another flag against a wall from crossed staffs, the U.S.    flag should be on its own right (left to a person facing the wall) and its staff    should be in front of the other flag's staff. In a group of flags displayed    from staffs, the U.S. flag should be at the center and the highest point.   When flags of states, cities or organizations are flown on the same staff,    the U.S. flag must be at the top (except during church services conducted at    sea by Navy chaplains).   When other flags are flown from adjacent staffs, the U.S. flag should be hoisted    first and lowered last. It must be on the right of other flags and no other    flag should stand higher than it. Flags of other nations should be flown from    separate staffs. International custom dictates that flags of different nations    be displayed at the same height in peacetime and be approximately the same size.    If the flag is suspended outdoors from a rope stretched from a building to a    pole, the flag should be hoisted out from the building with the union first.    When the flag is displayed other than from a staff, it should be flat or suspended    so that it falls free.   When displayed against something, such as a wall, the union should be at the    top and to the flag's own right, the observer's left - whether displayed horizontally    or vertically.   When displayed over a street or sidewalk, where it can be seen from either    side, be sure the union is to the north on an east-west street, and to the east    on a north-south street. The same directions apply in a building lobby or corridor    with entrances to the east and west or north and south.   When displayed flat against the wall on a speaker's platform, the flag should    be above and behind the speaker with the union on the left side as the audience    looks at it (again, the flag's right).   When the flag hangs from a staff in a church or public place, it should appear    to the audience on the left, the speaker's right. Any other flags displayed    should be placed on the opposite side of the speaker.   The flag may cover a casket, but should not cover a statue or monument for    unveiling. It should never be draped or drawn back in folds. Draped red, white    and blue bunting should be used for decoration, with the blue at the top and    red at the bottom. On a casket, the union (blue field) should be at the deceased    person's head and heart, over the left shoulder. But the flag should be removed    before the casket is lowered into the grave and should never touch the ground.   The flag may be flown at half-staff to honor a newly deceased federal or state    government official by order of the president or the governor, respectively.   On Memorial Day, the flag should be displayed at half-staff until noon. Whenever    the flag is displayed at half-staff, it should be first raised to the top. Lowering    from half-staff is preceded by first raising it momentarily to the top.   Other Things Not to Do with the Flag   Out of respect for the U.S. flag,  never:        dip it for any person or thing, even though state flags, regimental colors      and other flags may be dipped as a mark of honor.      display it with the union down, except as a signal of distress.      let the flag touch anything beneath it: ground, floor, water, merchandise.      carry it horizontally, but always aloft.      fasten or display it in a way that will permit it to be damaged or soiled.         place anything on the flag, including letters, insignia, or designs of any      kind.      use it for holding anything.      use it as wearing apparel, bedding or drapery. It should not be used on      a costume or athletic uniform. However, a flag patch may be attached to the      uniform of patriotic organizations, military personnel, police officers and      firefighters.      use the flag for advertising or promotion purposes or print it on paper      napkins, boxes or anything else intended for temporary use and discard.     During the hoisting or lowering of the flag or when it passes in parade or    review, Americans should stand at attention facing the flag and place their    right hand over the heart. Uniformed military members render the military salute.    Men not in uniform should remove any headdress and hold it with their right    hand at their left shoulder, the hand resting over the heart. Those who are    not U.S. citizens should stand at attention. When the flag is worn out or otherwise    no longer a fitting emblem for display, it should be destroyed in a dignified    way, preferably by burning.

Milwaukee Journal Sentinel  February 17, 2003 Monday   Civil Air Patrol taking on terror;  It quietly shifts focus from search and rescue to homeland security  BYLINE: PETER MALLER  pmaller@journalsentinel.com   Larry Stys, a social studies teacher at South Milwaukee Middle School, spends   weekends flying missions for the Civil Air Patrol, training for the  unthinkable: an attack by terrorists on Wisconsin.  A Civil Air Patrol volunteer since his teens, Stys, 53, takes aerial photos  of  bridges, supply depots and other potential state targets to help emergency  workers respond if terrorists strike.  ""I bring back digital pictures of railroad overpasses, power plants and fuel  tank farms to show we have the ability to photograph them accurately and can  help law enforcement handle any problem,"" said Stys, former commander of the  Wisconsin Wing of the Civil Air Patrol.  A national organization with branches in every state, the Civil Air Patrol  was  started by amateur pilots in the 1940s to patrol harbors for enemy ships.  When  the need for these missions ended after World War II, the volunteers switched   their attention to assisting in search and rescue missions. But now the  organization is again focusing on homeland security, according to Lt. Col.  Jeffrey Wiswell, spokesman for the state group.  The U.S. Air Force, which oversees the program, issued a directive six months   ago putting the group under a newly formed Homeland Security Directorate at  the Pentagon, he said. Since then, the Civil Air Patrol has been quietly  implementing the changes.  Like Stys, virtually all 800 members of the state group have day jobs  unrelated to aviation. But if terrorists strike, the Civil Air Patrol would  provide aerial reconnaissance, operate emergency communication systems and  transport disaster workers, Wiswell said.  ""They are university professors, students, doctors and people who own bowling   alleys or work at McDonald's,"" he said. ""These citizen volunteers take time  daily to help their friends and neighbors whether we are at war or at peace.""  The pilots also could ferry food, blood and organs for transplants, as well  as  supply other critical needs, he said. They could be called upon to monitor  border crossings, remote airstrips and ports and harbors, Wiswell said.  Besides having members trained as pilots, the organization has volunteers  working the ground, operating communications systems and performing other  essential services, he said.  If terrorists strike, the Civil Air Patrol would use specialties to support  emergency government personnel and local law enforcement departments, he  said.  Focusing on homeland security is an appropriate assignment for the  organization, which already is trained to find downed aircraft and help  during  natural disasters, said Col. Clair Jowett, commander of the Wisconsin Wing.  Weekly gatherings  Wisconsin is divided into 34 squadrons with members who gather to conduct  meetings each week at municipal airports and National Guard centers.  ""The advantage we have is that we have 14 aircraft stationed all around the  state,"" Jowett said, a retired assistant principal at Wausau East High  School.  ""So we can have fairly quick access to every area. We'll be using many of the   skills we already use.""  Even before the group was ordered to deal with the consequences of terrorism,   Lt. Col. Mike Curry, commander of Racine Composite Squadron 59, began moving  in that direction. After the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, Curry directed his  members, who specialize in operating electronic communications systems, to  train for homeland security.  ""We literally have a trailer full of equipment,"" he said. ""You just add  people  and a place to plug it into -- and you have a mission headquarters.""  Curry's group uses a van to transport computers and other electronic gear to  sites around the state. The 12 members in his unit sometimes work with  members  of other squadrons at a mobile communications system based at City Hall in  West Bend, he said.  The Civil Air Patrol recruits members as young as 12 for its cadet program  but  accepts volunteers of all ages, Wiswell said.  Many of these youngsters later enter careers in the military, he said. The  group also runs community education programs in aerospace science.  Feeling a sense of patriotism, Kerry Brady, 13, a student at Kennedy Middle  School in Germantown, became a cadet soon after the attacks on the World  Trade  Center, she said.  ""The first meeting I attended, we talked about 9-11, and it made me feel more   proud to be part of this group,"" said Brady, a member of the 461st Composite  Squadron based at West Bend.

GX011-74-3747597	Flying the American Flag at Half Staff       When should the flag be flown at half-staff?        A relatively easy way to remember when to fly the United States flag at half-staff is to consider when the whole nation is in mourning. These periods of mourning are proclaimed either by the president of the United States, for national remembrance, or the governor of a state or territory, for local remembrance, in the event of a death of a member or former member of the federal, state or territorial government or judiciary. The heads of departments and agencies of the federal government may also order that the flag be flown at half-staff on buildings, grounds and naval vessels under their jurisdiction.       On Memorial day the flag should be flown at half-staff from sunrise until noon only, then raised briskly to the top of the staff until sunset, in honor of the nation's battle heroes.       In the early days of our country, no regulations existed for flying the flag at half-staff and, as a result, there were many conflicting policies. But on March 1, 1954, President Dwight Eisenhower issued a proclamation on the proper times.       The flag should fly at half-staff for 30 days at all federal buildings, grounds, and naval vessels throughout the United States and its territories and possessions after the death of the president or a former president. It is to fly 10 days at half-staff after the death of the vice president, the chief justice or a retired chief justice of the United States Supreme Court, or the speaker of the House of Representatives. For an associate justice of the Supreme Court, a member of the Cabinet, a former vice president, the president pro tempore of the Senate, the majority leader of the Senate, the minority leader of the Senate, the majority leader of the House of Representatives, or the minority leader of the House of Representatives the flag is to be displayed at half-staff from the day of death until interment.       The flag is to be flown at half-staff at all federal buildings, grounds and naval vessels in the Washington, D.C., area on the day and day after the death of a United States senator, representative, territorial delegate, or the resident commissioner from the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. It shall also be flown at half-staff on all federal facilities in the state, congressional district, territory, or commonwealth of these officials.       Upon the death of the governor of a state, territory or possession, the flag shall be flown at half-staff on all federal facilities in that governor's state, territory or possession from the day of death until interment.       The president may order the flag to be flown at half-staff to mark the death of other officials, former officials, or foreign dignitaries. In addition to these occasions, the president may order half-staff display of the flag after other tragic events.       The flag should be briskly run up to the top of the staff before being lowered slowly to the half-staff position.

Francis Scott Key, a 34-year old lawyer-poet, watched the attack from the deck     of a British prisoner-exchange ship. He had gone to seek the release of a     friend but they were refused permission to go ashore until after the attack had     been made. As the battle ceased on the following morning, Key turned his     telescope to the fort and saw that the American flag was still waving. The     sight so inspired him that he pulled a letter from his pocket and began to     write the poem which eventually was adopted as the national anthem of the     United States--""The Star Spangled Banner."" Key was returned to Baltimore and     later that day took a room at a Baltimore tavern where he completed the poem.     Years later, Key told a hometown audience in Frederick, Maryland:         ""I saw the flag of my country waving over     a city-the strength and pride of my native State-a city devoted to plunder and     desolation by its assailants. I witnessed the preparation for its assaults. I     saw the array of its enemies as they advanced to the attack. I heard the sound     of battle; the noise of the conflict fell upon my listening ear, and told me     that 'the brave and the free' had met the invaders.""         The joint Committee on Printing is pleased to     present the latest edition of Our Flag. This Congressional publication briefly     describes the history of the flag, and sets forth the practices and observances     appropriate to its display. The Committee hopes that this document will be both     useful and informative to its audience.         ACKNOWLEDGMENT        The Joint Committee on Printing extends thanks     and appreciation to the individuals and organizations that contributed their     knowledge to this booklet.         ""Let the praise, then, if any be due,     be given, not to me, who only did what I could not help doing, not to the     writer, but to the inspirers of the song!""        -Francis Scott Key          THE HISTORY OF THE STARS AND STRIPES               The Stars and Stripes originated as a result of      a resolution adopted by the Marine Committee of the Second Continental Congress      at Philadelphia on June 14, 1777. The resolution read:         ""Resolved, that the flag of the United      States be thirteen stripes, alternate red and white; that the union be thirteen      stars, white in a blue field representing a new constellation.      ""         The resolution gave no instruction as to how      many points the stars should have, nor how the stars should be arranged on the      blue union. Consequently, some flags had stars scattered on the blue field      without any specific design, some arranged the stars in rows, and some in a      circle. The first Navy Stars and Stripes had the stars arranged in staggered      formation in alternate rows of threes and twos on a blue field. Other Stars and      Stripes flags had stars arranged in alternate rows of four, five and four. Some      stars had six points while others had eight.         Strong evidence indicates that Francis      Hopkinson of New Jersey, a signer of the Declaration of Independence, was      responsible for the stars in the U.S. flag. At the time that the flag      resolution was adopted, Hopkinson was the Chairman of the Continental Navy      Board's Middle Department. Hopkinson also helped design other devices for the      Government including the Great Seal of the United States. For his services,      Hopkinson submitted a letter to the Continental Admiralty Board asking ""whether      a Quarter Cask of the public Wine will not be a proper & reasonable Reward      for these Labours of Fancy and a suitable Encouragement to future Exertions of      a like Nature."" His request was turned down since the Congress regarded him as      a public servant.         AN EARLY STARS AND STRIPES               ""Graphic omitted""         During the Revolutionary War, several patriots      made flags for our new Nation. Among them were Cornelia Bridges, Elizabeth      (Betsy) Ross, and Rebecca Young, all of Pennsylvania, and John Shaw of      Annapolis, Maryland. Although Betsy Ross, the best known of these persons, made      flags for 50 years, there is no proof that she made the first Stars and      Stripes. It is known that she made flags for the Pennsylvania State Navy in      1777. The flag popularly known as the ""Betsy Ross flag,"" which arranged the      stars in a circle, did not appear until the early 1790's.         The claims of Betsy Ross were first brought to      the attention of the public in 1870 by one of her grandsons, William J. Canby.      In a paper he read before the meeting of the Historical Society of      Pennsylvania, Canby stated:         ""It is not tradition, it is report from the      lips of the principal participator in the transaction, directly told not to one      or two, but a dozen or more living witnesses, of which I myself am one, though      but a little boy when I heard it. . . . Colonel Ross with Robert Morris and      General Washington, called on Mrs. Ross and told her they were a committee of      Congress, and wanted her to make a flag from the drawing, a rough one, which,      upon her suggestions, was redrawn by General Washington in pencil in her back      parlor. This was prior to the Declaration of Independence. I fix the date to be      during Washington's visit to Congress from New York in June, 1776 when he came      to confer upon the affairs of the Army, the flag being no doubt, one of these      affairs.""          THE GRAND UNION FLAG          ""Graphic omitted""          The first flag of the colonists to have any      resemblance to the present Stars and Stripes was the Grand Union Flag,      sometimes referred to as the Congress Colors, the First Navy Ensign, and the      Cambridge Flag. Its design consisted of 13 stripes, alternately red and white,      representing the Thirteen Colonies, with a blue field in the upper left-hand      corner bearing the red cross of St. George of England with the white cross of      St. Andrew of Scotland. As the flag of the revolution it was used on many      occasions. It was first flown by the ships of the Colonial Fleet on the      Delaware River. On December 3, 1775, it was raised aboard Captain Esek Hopkin's      flagship Alfred by John Paul Jones, then a Navy lieutenant. Later the flag was      raised on the liberty pole at Prospect Hill, which was near George Washington's      headquarters in Cambridge, Massachusetts. It was our unofficial national flag      on July 4, 1776, Independence Day; and it remained the unofficial national flag      and ensign of the Navy until June 14, 1777, when the Continental Congress      authorized the Stars and Stripes.         Interestingly, the Grand Union Flag also was      the standard of the British East India Company. It was only by degrees that the      Union Flag of Great Britain was discarded. The final breach between the      Colonies and Great Britain brought about the removal of the British Union from      the canton of our striped flag and the substitution of stars on a blue      field.         FIFTEEN STARS AND STRIPES              ""Graphic omitted""         When two new States were admitted to the Union     (Kentucky and Vermont), a resolution was adopted in January of 1794, expanding     the flag to 15 stars and 15 stripes. This flag was the official flag of our     country from 1795 to 1818, and was prominent in many historic events. It     inspired Francis Scott Key to write ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" during the     bombardment of Fort McHenry; it was the first flag to be flown over a fortress     of the Old World when American Marine and Naval forces raised it above the     pirate stronghold in Tripoli on April 27, 1805; it was the ensign of American     forces in the Battle of Lake Erie in September of 1813; and it was flown by     General Jackson in New Orleans in January of 1815.        However, realizing that the flag would become     unwieldy with a stripe for each new State, Capt. Samuel C. Reid, USN, suggested     to Congress that the stripes remain 13 in number to represent the Thirteen     Colonies, and that a star be added to the blue field for each new State coming     into the Union. Accordingly, on April 4, 1818, President Monroe accepted a bill     requiring that the flag of the United States have a union of 20 stars, white on     a blue field, and that upon admission of each new State into the Union one star     be added to the union of the flag on the fourth of July following its date of     admission. The 13 alternating red and white stripes would remain unchanged.     This act succeeded in prescribing the basic design of the flag, while assuring     that the growth of the Nation would be properly symbolized.        Eventually, the growth of the country resulted     in a flag with 48 stars upon the admission of Arizona and New Mexico in 1912.     Alaska added a 49th in 1959, and Hawaii a 50th star in 1960. With the 50-star     flag came a new design and arrangement of the stars in the union, a requirement     met by President Eisenhower in Executive Order No. 10834, issued August 21,     1959. To conform with this, a national banner with 50 stars became the official     flag of the United States. The flag was raised for the first time at 12:01 a.m.     on July 4, 1960, at the Fort McHenry National Monument in Baltimore,     Maryland.        Traditionally a symbol of liberty, the American     flag has carried the message of freedom to many parts of the world. Sometimes     the same flag that was flying at a crucial moment in our history has been flown     again in another place to symbolize continuity in our struggles for the cause     of liberty.        One of the most memorable is the flag that flew     over the Capitol in Washington on December 7, 1941, when Pearl Harbor was     attacked. This same flag was raised again on December 8 when war was declared     on Japan, and three days later at the time of the declaration of war against     Germany and Italy. President Roosevelt called it the ""flag of liberation"" and     carried it with him to the Casablanca Conference and on other historic     occasions. It flew from the mast of the U.S.S. Missouri during the formal     Japanese surrender on September 2, 1945.        Another historic flag is the one that flew over     Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. It also was present at the United Nations     Charter meeting in San Francisco, California, and was used at the Big Three     Conference at Potsdam, Germany. This same flag flew over the White House on     August 14, 1945, when the Japanese accepted surrender terms.         ""Graphic omitted""         Following the War of 1812, a great     wave of nationalistic spirit spread throughout the country; the infant Republic     had successfully defied the might of an empire. As this spirit spread, the     Stars and Stripes became a symbol of sovereignty. The homage paid that banner     is best expressed by what the gifted men of later generations wrote concerning     it. The writer Henry Ward Beecher said:    ""A     thoughtful mind when it sees a nation's flag, sees not the flag, but the nation     itself. And whatever may be its symbols, its insignia, he reads chiefly in the     flag, the government, the principles, the truths, the history that belongs to     the nation that sets it forth. The American flag has been a symbol of Liberty     and men rejoiced in it. ""The stars     upon it were like the bright morning stars of God, and the stripes upon it were     beams of morning light. As at early dawn the stars shine forth even while it     grows light, and then as the sun advances that light breaks into banks and     streaming lines of color, the glowing red and intense white striving together,     and ribbing the horizon with bars effulgent, so, on the American flag, stars     and beams of many-colored light shine out together . . . .""                              In a 1917 Flag Day message,     President Wilson said:   ""This flag, which we     honor and under which we serve, is the emblem of our unity, our power, our     thought and purpose as a nation. It has no other character than that which we     give it from generation to generation. The choices are ours. It floats in     majestic silence above the hosts that execute those choices, whether in peace     or in war. And yet, though silent, it speaks to us-speaks to us of the past, of     the men and women who went before us, and of the records they wrote upon it.     ""We celebrate the day of its birth; and from its birth until now it has     witnessed a great history, has floated on high the symbol of great events, of a     great plan of life worked out by a great people.... ""Woe be to the man or group     of men that seeks to stand in our way in this day of high resolution when every     principle we hold dearest is to be vindicated and made secure for the salvation     of the nation. We are ready to plead at the bar of history, and our flag shall     wear a new luster. Once more we shall make good with our lives and fortunes the     great faith to which we were born, and a new glory shall shine in the face of     our people.""        EARLY AMERICAN FLAGS           Archeological digs in northern India, dating     around 3,500 B.C., have uncovered a seal, used to sign documents. The seal     shows a procession of seven men carrying square standards, held aloft on poles     like modem flags. While these ancient flags were rigid, like boards, and not     made of cloth as modern flags are, they provided ample testimony that heraldry     and the displaying of banners dated to the earliest civilizations.        In American history, the Vikings carried a flag     which bore a black raven on a field of white. In 1492 Columbus sailed to our     shores with his three small ships displaying the Spanish flag bearing two red     lions on two white fields and two yellow castles on two red fields. The Dutch     brought their own striped flags when they settled in New Amsterdam, which we     now call New York, and pioneers from other nations also brought along the     standards of their countries when they settled on our shores.        It is only natural, therefore, that America     should create colonial flags as soon as the first colonists settled. Given the     disparate array of settlers, it is not surprising that a wide variety of flags     was created. The first flags adopted by our colonial forebears were symbolic of     their struggles with the wilderness of the new land. Beavers, pine trees,     rattlesnakes, anchors and various other insignia were affixed to different     banners with mottoes such as ""Hope,"" ""Liberty,"" ""Appeal to Heaven,"" or ""Don't     Tread on Me.""        In the early days of the Revolution, there were     colonial and regimental flags by the score. The Boston Liberty flag, consisting     of nine alternate red and white horizontal stripes, flew over the Liberty Tree,     a fine old elm in Hanover Square in Boston, where the Sons of Liberty met.     Still another was a white flag with a green pine tree and the inscription, ""An     Appeal to Heaven."" This particular flag became familiar on the seas as the     ensign of the cruisers commissioned by General Washington, and was noted by     many English newspapers of the time.        Flags with a rattlesnake theme also gained     increasing prestige with colonists. The slogan ""Don't Tread on Me"" almost     invariably appeared on rattlesnake flags. A flag of this type was the standard     of the South Carolina Navy. Another, the Gadsden flag, consisted of a yellow     field with a rattlesnake in a spiral coil, poised to strike, in the center.     Below the snake was the motto, ""Don't Tread on Me."" Similar was the Culpepper     flag, banner of the Minutemen of Culpepper (now spelled Culpeper) County,     Virginia. It consisted of a white field with -a rattlesnake in a spiral coil in     the center. Above the rattlesnake was the legend ""The Culpepper Minute Men"" and     below, the motto, ""Liberty or Death"" as well as ""Don't Tread on Me.""             In December of 1775, an anonymous Philadelphia     correspondent wrote to Bradford's Pennsylvania journal concerning the symbolic     use of the snake. He began the letter by saying:                 ""I recollected that her eye excelled in brightness that of any     other animal, and that she has no eye-lids. She may, therefore, be esteemed an     emblem of vigilance. She never begins an attack, nor, when once engaged, ever     surrenders. She is, therefore, an emblem of magnanimity and true courage.                                  It was probably the deadly bite of     the rattler, however, which was foremost in the minds of its designers, and the     threatening slogan ""Don't Tread on Me"" added further significance to the     design.        The Moultrie flag was the first     distinctive American flag displayed in the South. It flew over the ramparts of     the fort on Sullivan's Island, which lies in the channel leading to Charleston,     South Carolina, when the British fleet attacked on June 28, 1776. The British     ships bombarded the fort for 10 hours. But the garrison, consisting of some 375     regulars -and a few militia, under the command of Col. William Moultrie, put up     such a gallant defense that the British were forced to withdraw under cover of     darkness. This victory saved the southern Colonies from invasion for another     two years. The flag was blue, as were the uniforms of the men of the garrison,     and it bore a white crescent in the upper corner next to the staff, like the     silver crescents the men wore on their caps, inscribed with the words ""Liberty     or Death.""        The Maritime Colony of Rhode     Island had its own flag, which was carried at Brandywine, Trenton, and     Yorktown. It bore an anchor, 13 stars, and the word ""Hope."" Its white stars in     a blue field are believed by many to have influenced the design of our national     flag.        The Army preferred its regimental     flags on the battlefield instead of the Stars and Stripes. A popular form of     the U.S. flag that was used in battle had the obverse (front) of the Great Seal     in the canton. The Army also used the Stars and Stripes with 13 stars in a     circle. The Stars and Stripes was officially used in Army artillery units in     1834, and in infantry units in 1842.           HISTORICAL FLAGS        ""Graphic omitted""        FORT MOULTRIE         South Carolinians defending Fort     Moultrie in Charleston Harbor in 1776 raised one of the earliest flags of     American liberty. The silver crescent appeared as a badge worn on their caps.     The cause for which they fought-liberty-was emblazoned on the     crescent.           ""Graphic omitted""              GREEN MOUNTAIN BOYS         General John Stark of New     Hampshire commanded a militia brigade known as the ""Green Mountain Boys.'     Tradition relates that its green flag was flown at the Battle of Bennington on     August 16, 1777. As in many American flags, the stars here were arranged in an     arbitrary fashion. Nevertheless they signified the unity of the Thirteen     Colonies in their struggle for independence.         ""Graphic omitted""        RHODE ISLAND REGIMENT         The State flags of America found     their earliest forms during the Revolutionary War. The starry canton in the     flag of the Rhode Island Regiment symbolized national unity, but the white     field corresponded to the uniform of the State troops. The anchor symbol and     motto which completed the design had been used for more than a century. The     original flag may be found in the State House in Providence.         ""Graphic omitted""            COMMODORE PERRY'S FLAG         During the War of 1812 Captain               James Lawrence of the Chesapeake encouraged his men, as he lay               dying by exhorting ""Don't Give Up the Ship."" Three months later at               the Battle of Lake Erie, Commodore Perry emblazoned these words on               a flag which carried him to victory. Similar flags and mottoes have               inspired Americans throughout our two centuries of existence.         ""Graphic omitted""        BENNINGTON FLAG         Originally believed to have been     carried during the Revolution, this flag is now seen as having probably been     made for the 50th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence in 1826. Its     design is typical of the exuberant artistic expressions found in flags of the     19th century.         ""Graphic omitted""        CAVALRY GUIDON         During the Civil War a special     version of the United States flag-with swallowtail and stars of gold instead of     white-was carried by the cavalry. General Custer and others used the flag in     succeeding decades in the West.           THE FLAG TODAY        The flag of the United States of     America has 13 horizontal stripes--7 red and 6 white--the red and white stripes     alternating and a union which consists of white stars of 5 points on a blue     field placed in the upper quarter next to the staff and extending to the lower     edge of the fourth red stripe from the top. The number o stars equals the     number of States in the Union. The proportions o the flag as prescribed by     Executive Order of President Eisenhower on August 21, 1959, are as     follows:        Hoist (width) of flag..................1.0        Fly (length) of flag.....................1.9  Hoist (width) of       union...............0.5385  Fly (length) of union..................0.76        Width of each stripe.................0.0769  Diameter of each       star..............0.0616         FLAG ANATOMY                ""Graphic omitted""        FLAG LAWS AND REGULATIONS        The laws relating to the flag of     the United States of America are found in detail in the United States Code.

Time and occasions for     display        (a) It is the universal custom to display the flag     only from sunrise to sunset on buildings and on stationary flagstaffs in the     open. However, when a patriotic effect is desired, the flag may be displayed     twenty-four hours a day if properly illuminated during the hours of     darkness.        ""Graphics omitted""        §175. Position and manner of     display        The flag, when carried in a procession with       another flag or flags, should be either on the marching right; that is, the       flag's own right, or, if there is a line of other flags, in front of the center       of that line.         (a) The flag should not be displayed on a float       in a parade except from a staff, or as provided in subsection (i) of this       section.           (b) The flag should not be draped over the       hood, top, sides, or back of a vehicle or of a railroad train or a boat. When       the flag is displayed on a motorcar, the staff shall be fixed firmly to the       chassis or clamped to the right fender.        (c) No other flag or pennant should be placed       above or, if on the same level, to the right of the flag of the United States       of America, except during church services conducted by naval chaplains at sea,       when the church pennant may be flown above the flag during church services for       the personnel of the Navy. No person shall display the flag of the United       Nations or any other national or international flag equal, above, or in a       position of superior prominence or honor to, or in place of, the flag of the       United States at any place within the United States or any Territory or       possession thereof. Provided, That nothing in this section shall make unlawful       the continuance of the practice heretofore followed of displaying the flag of       the United Nations in a position of superior prominence or honor, and other       national flags in positions of equal prominence or honor, with that of the flag       of the United States at the headquarters of the United Nations.        (d) The flag of the United States of America,       when it is displayed with another flag against a wall from crossed staffs,       should be on the right, the flag's own right, and its staff should be in front       of the staff of the other flag.        (e) The flag of the United States of America should be at       the center and at the highest point of the group when a number of flags of       States or localities or pennants of societies are grouped and displayed from       staffs.        (f) When flags of States, cities, or       localities, or pennants of societies are flown on the same halyard with the       flag of the United States, the latter should always be at the peak. When the       flags are flown from adjacent staffs, the flag of the United States should be       hoisted first and lowered last. No such flag or pennant may be placed above the       flag of the United States or to the United States flag's right.        (g) When flags of two or more         nations are displayed, they are to be flown from separate staffs of the same         height. The flags should be of approximately equal size. International usage         forbids the display of the flag of one nation above that of another nation in         time of peace. (h) When the flag of the               United States is displayed from a staff projecting horizontally or               at an angle from the window sill, balcony, or front of a building,               the union of the flag should be placed at the peak of the staff               unless the flag is at half staff.         When the flag is suspended over a         sidewalk from a rope extending from a house to a pole at the edge of the         sidewalk, the flag should be hoisted out, union first, from the         building.           (i) When displayed either         horizontally or vertically against a wall, the union should be uppermost and to         the flag's own right, that is, to the observer's left. When displayed in a         window, the flag should be displayed in the same way, with the union or blue         field to the left of the observer in the street.         (j) When the flag is displayed over the       middle of the street, it should be suspended vertically with the union to the       north in an east and west street or to the east in a north and south       street.         (k) When used on a speaker's platform,       the flag, if displayed flat, should be displayed above and behind the speaker.       When displayed from a staff in a church or public auditorium, the flag of the       United States of America should hold the position of superior prominence, in       advance of the audience, and in the position of honor at the clergyman's or       speaker's right as he faces the audience. Any other flag so displayed should be       placed on the left of the clergyman or speaker or to the right of the       audience.          (l) The flag should form a distinctive       feature of the ceremony of unveiling a statue or monument, but it should never       be used as the covering for the statue or monument.          (m) The flag, when flown at half-staff,       should be first hoisted to the peak for an instant and then lowered to the       half-staff position. The flag should be again raised to the peak before it is       lowered for the day. On Memorial Day the flag should be displayed at half-staff       until noon only, then raised to the top of the staff. By order of the       President, the flag shall be flown at half-staff upon the death of principal       figures of the United States Government and the Governor of a State, territory,       or possession, as a mark of respect to their memory. In the event of the death       of other officials or foreign dignitaries, the flag is to be displayed at       half-staff according to Presidential instructions or orders, or in accordance       with recognized customs or practices not inconsistent with law. In the event of       the death of a present or former official of the government of any State,       territory, or possession of the United States, the Governor of that State,       territory, or possession may proclaim that the National flag shall be flown at       half-staff. The flag shall be flown at half-staff thirty days from the death of       the President or a former President; ten days from the day of death of the Vice       President, the Chief Justice or a retired Chief Justice of the United States,       or the Speaker of the House of Representatives; from the day of death until       interment of an Associate justice of the Supreme Court, a Secretary of an       executive or military department, a former Vice President, or the Governor of a       State, territory, or possession; and on the day of death and the following day       for a Member of Congress. As used in this subsection          (1) the term ""half-staff"" means the       position of the flag when it is one-half the distance between the top and       bottom of the staff;           (2) the term ""executive or military       department"" means any agency listed under sections 101 and 102 of title 5,       United States Code; and           (3) the term ""Member of Congress"" means a       Senator, a Representative, a Delegate, or the Resident Commissioner from Puerto       Rico.           (n) When the flag is used to       cover a casket, it should be so placed that the union is at the head and over       the left shoulder. The flag should not be lowered into the grave or allowed to       touch the ground.          (o) When the flag is suspended across                       a corridor or lobby in a building with only one main                       entrance, it should be suspended vertically with the union                       of the flag to the observer's left upon entering. If the                       building has more than one main entrance, the flag should                       be suspended vertically near the center of the corridor or                       lobby with the union to the north, when entrances are to                       the east and west or to the east when entrances are to the                       north and south. If there are entrances in more than two                       directions, the union should be to the east.         §176. Respect for the      Flag         No disrespect should be shown to the flag of      the United States of America; the flag should not be dipped to any person or      thing. Regimental colors, State flags, and organization or institutional flags      are to be dipped as a mark of honor.          (a) The flag should never be displayed with the      union down, except as a signal of dire distress in instances of extreme danger      to life or property.         (b) The flag should never touch anything      beneath it, such as the ground, the floor, water, or      merchandise.         (c) The flag should never be carried flat or      horizontally, but always aloft and free.          (d) The flag should never be used as wearing      apparel, bedding, or drapery. It should never be festooned, drawn back, nor up,      in folds, but always allowed to fall free. Bunting of blue, white, and red,      always arranged with the blue above, the white in the middle, and the red      below, should be used for covering a speaker's desk, draping the front of the      platform, and for decoration in general.          (e) The flag should never be fastened,      displayed, used, or stored in such a manner as to permit it to be easily torn,      soiled, or damaged in any way.          (f) The flag should never be used as a      covering for a ceiling.          (g) The flag should never have placed upon it,      nor on any part of it, nor attached to it any mark, insignia, letter, word,      figure, design, picture, or drawing of any nature.          (h) The flag should never be used as a      receptacle for receiving, holding, carrying, or delivering anything.               (i) The flag should never be used for      advertising purposes in any manner whatsoever. It should not be embroidered on      such articles as cushions or handkerchiefs and the like, printed or otherwise      impressed on paper napkins or boxes or anything that is designed for temporary      use and discard. Advertising signs should not be fastened to a staff or halyard      from which the flag is flown.          j) No part of the flag should ever be used as a      costume or athletic uniform. However, a flag patch may be affixed to the      uniform of military personnel, firemen, policemen, and members of patriotic      organizations. The flag represents a living country and is itself considered a      living thing. Therefore, the lapel flag pin being a replica, should be worn on      the left lapel near the heart.          (k) The flag, when it is in such condition that      it is no longer a fitting emblem for display, should be destroyed in a      dignified way, preferably by burning.          §177. Conduct during      hoisting, lowering or passing of flag         During the ceremony of hoisting or lowering the      flag or when the flag is passing in a parade or in review, all persons present      except those in uniform should face the flag and stand at attention with the      right hand over the heart. Those present in uniform should render the military      salute. When not in uniform, men should remove their headdress with their right      hand and hold it at the left shoulder, the hand being over the heart. Aliens      should stand at attention. The salute to the flag in a moving column should be      rendered at the moment the flag passes.         §178. Modification of      rules and customs by President         Any rule or custom pertaining to the display of      the flag of the United States of America, set forth herein, may be altered,      modified, or repealed, or additional rules with respect thereto may be      prescribed, by the Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces of the United States,      whenever he deems it to be appropriate or desirable; and any such alteration or      additional rule shall be set forth in a proclamation.        FLAG PRESENTATION        Presentation of the flag during a ceremony     should be preceded by a brief talk emphasizing the importance of the occasion.     Following the presentation all present should salute the flag, recite the     pledge of allegiance, and sing the national anthem.                           FOLDING THE FLAG               Two persons, facing each other, hold the       flag waist high and horizontally between them.        The lower striped section is folded,       lengthwise, over the blue field. Hold bottom to top and edges together       securely.        Fold the flag again, lengthwise, folded edge       to open edge.        A triangular fold is started along the       length of the flag, from the end to the heading by bringing the striped corner       of the folded edge to meet the open edge.         The outer point is turned inward parallel       with the open edge, forming a second triangle.        Repeat the triangular folding until the       entire length of the flag is folded.        When the flag is completely folded only the       triangular blue field should be visible.                      CARE OF YOUR FLAG        The life of your flag depends on your care.     Dirt can cut fabrics, dull colors, and cause wear. Most outdoor flags can be     washed in mild detergent and thoroughly rinsed. Indoor and parade flags should     be dry-cleaned. Many dry cleaners offer free cleaning of U.S. flags during the     months of June and July. Damaged flags can be repaired and utilized as long as     the overall dimensions are not noticeably altered. American Legion Posts and     local governments often have facilities to dispose of unserviceable flags.     Store your flags in a well ventilated area away from any harsh chemicals or     cleaning compounds. If your flag gets wet, never store it until it is     completely dry. Wet folds cause permanent creases. Dampness ruins fabric and     causes mildew. Pole care is also related to flag care. Rust and scale cause     permanent stains and some metallic oxides actually eat holes in     fabric.               SIZES OF FLAGS        The size of the flag is determined by the     exposed height of the flagpole from which it is flying. The only consideration     is for the flag to be in proper proportion to its pole. Flags which fly from     angled poles on homes and those which are displayed on standing poles in     offices and other indoor displays are usually either 3' x 5' or 4' x 6'. Color     guards usually carry flags measuring 4' x 6'. Other recommended sizes are shown     in the following table:                        Flagpole Height (ft.)          Flag Size (ft.)                        20          4 x 6                        25          5 x 8                        40          6 x 10                        50          8 x 12                        60          10 x 15                        70          12 x 18                        90          15 x 25                        125          20 x 30                        200          30 x 40                        250          40 x 50                              FLAGS AT THE UNITED STATES      CAPITOL         No record has been found for the earliest date      the flag was flown over the east and west fronts of the Capitol. Early      engravings and lithographs in the office of the Architect of the Capitol show      flags flying on either side of the original low dome above the corridors      connecting the areas now known as Statuary Hall and the Old Senate      Chamber.         After the addition of the new House and Senate      wings in the 1850s, even before the great dome was completed in 1863,      photographs of the period show flags flying over each new wing and the central      east and west fronts.         The custom of flying the flags 24 hours a day      over the east and west fronts was begun during World War I. This was done in      response to requests received from all over the country urging that the flag of      the United States be flown continuously over the public buildings in      Washington, DC.         The east and west front flags, which are 8 x 12      feet, are replaced by new ones when they become worn and unfit for further use.      Prior to machine-made flags, individuals were hired by the Congress to handsew      these flags.         Presidential proclamations and laws authorize      the display of the flag 24 hours a day at the following places:         Fort McHenry National Monument and Historic      Shrine, Baltimore, Maryland (Presidential Proclamation No. 2795, July 2, 1948).               Flag House Square, Albemarle and Pratt Streets,      Baltimore Maryland (Public Law 83-319, approved March 26, 1954).          United States Marine Corp Memorial (Iwo Jima),      Arlington, Virginia (Presidential Proclamation No. 3418, June 12, 1961).               On the Green of the Town of Lexington,      Massachusetts (Public Law 89-335, approved November 8, 1965).          The White House, Washington, DC. (Presidential      Proclamation No. 4000, September 4, 1970).          Washington Monument, Washington, DC.      (Presidential Proclamation No. 4064, July 6, 1971, effective July 4, 1971).               Fifty flags of the United States are displayed      at the Washington Monument continuously. United States Customs Ports of Entry      which are continually open (Presidential Proclamation No. 413 1, May 5, 1972).               Grounds of the National Memorial Arch in Valley      Forge State Park, Valley Forge, Pennsylvania (Public Law 94-53, approved July      4,1975).          Many other places fly the flag at night as a      patriotic gesture  by custom .          HOW TO OBTAIN A FLAG      FLOWN OVER THE CAPITOL         Constituents may arrange to purchase flags that      have been flown over the Capitol by getting in touch with their Senators or      Representative. A certificate signed by the Architect of the Capitol      accompanies each flag. Flags are available for purchase in sizes of 3' x 5' or      5' x 8' in fabrics of cotton and nylon.         AMERICAN WAR MOTHERS FLAG         The American War Mothers is a national      organization chartered by Congress with its headquarters in Washington, DC. Its      members are mothers whose sons and daughters have served or who are serving in      the Armed Forces. Its objective is to aid the serviceman or veteran and his      family, including those who are hospitalized.          According to records in the Office of the      Architect of the U.S. Capitol, the American War Mothers flag was purchased by      them and first flown over the U.S. Capitol, always below the American flag, on      Armistice Day, November 11, 1926.          The authority for flying that flag over the      U.S. Capitol on this occasion and in subsequent years has been granted annually      by written permission of the Vice President and the Speaker of the House of      Representatives.          Provision for the ceremony was further      recognized when the flagpole on the east front, after the extension of 1960,      was installed with two halyards.          Traditionally the flag has been raised at 11      minutes after 11 a.m. by a detail from the Capitol Police . The flag flies      until sundown, although originally it flew only for three hours. A bugler      selected from one of the armed services plays taps. Brief memorial services are      held in connection with the ceremony. These services have been accommodated on      the east and west front steps or in Statuary Hall and permission to hold them      is generally granted in the same letter that permits the flag to be flown.               The act of July 1, 1882, regulating the use of      the Capitol Grounds vests the Vice President and the Speaker with the authority      to grant this privilege.          The American War Mothers flag is kept in a      safe at the U.S. Capitol. The present flag, first used in 1970, replaced the      original woolen flag of 1926. It is of a synthetic fabric, 47 x 72 inches in      size, consisting of a white field with a red border 11 inches wide. At the top      is an 11-inch blue star for the 4,695,039 who served in World War I. These      figures are 2 1/2 inches in blue. Across the center in 4-inch letters are the      words ""United States Service Flag."" Below is an 11-inch gold star for the      60,672 who gave their lives. These figures are 21/2 inches high in gold.              HOW TO OBTAIN A BURIAL FLAG FOR A     VETERAN        Any honorably discharged veteran     is entitled to a burial flag. The funeral director, as part of the services,     will make the necessary arrangements for the family on behalf of the veteran.     The flag may be used to cover the casket and it is presented to the family as a     keepsake. The local office of the Department of Veterans' Affairs can also     provide information on the procedure for obtaining a flag for a deceased     veteran.

Oklahoma                    Entered the Union in 1907 as the 46th State;               flag adopted in 1925, modified in 1941 and 1988. An Osage shield               stands for defense, its small crosses for lofty ideals. The blue               background symbolizes loyalty, while the olive branch and calumet               are for peace.                               Oregon                    Entered the Union in 1859 as the 33rd State;               flag adopted in 1925. The ox wagon of pioneers combines with scenes               of nature and symbols of agriculture and shipping. The reverse of               the flag is blue with a gold beaver.                Pennsylvania                               Ratified the Constitution on 1787 as the second State; flag               adopted in 1907. The coat of arms incorporates a ship for commerce               and a plow and wheat sheaves for agriculture. Draft horses, the               American eagle, and the State motto complete the design.                   Rhode Island                                 Ratified the Constitution on 1790 as the 13th               State; flag adopted in 1897. An anchor, traditional symbol of hope,               was first adopted by Rhode Island as a symbol in 1647. Rhode Island               troops in the Revolutionary War carried flags of white with an               anchor and thirteen stars.                   South Carolina                    Ratified the Constitution on 1788 as the               eighth State; flag adopted in 1861. Troops defending harbor forts               during the Revolutionary War displayed a blue flag with a white               crescent. The State tree, a palmetto, was added to the flag when               South Carolina proclaimed its independence in 1861.                   South Dakota                    Entered the Union in 1889 as the 40th State;               flag adopted in 1963. The State seal is represented against a               sunburst. Its design includes symbols of stock raising, industry,               agriculture commerce, and nature.                Tennessee                    Entered the Union in 1796 as the 16th State;               flag adopted in 1905. The three stars refer to the fact that               Tennessee was the third State to join after the Original Thirteen               and is composed of three geographic regions. The colors are found               in the flags of the United States and of the Confederacy.                Texas                    Entered the Union in 1845 as the 28th State;               flag adopted in 1839. The American origin of the settlers who               revolted against Mexican rule and established the independent               Republic of Texas was reflected in the flags they carried,               including the one which eventually became the State flag of the               ""Lone Star State"".                   Utah                    Entered the Union in 1896 as the 45th State;               flag adopted in 1911, modified in 1913. The beehive symbolizes               industry, while the American eagle and flags stand for loyalty to               the Nation. The early settlers were saved from starvation by eating               the sego lily, now recognized as the State flower.                   Vermont                    Entered the Union in 1791 as the 14th State;               flag adopted in 1923. The coat of arms, based on the State seal,               shows a scene from nature with pine tree and mountains. Branches of               pine below commemorate the  1814 Battle of Plattsburgh.                Virginia                     Ratified the Constitution in 1788 as the 10th               State, flag adopted in 1861. The Latin motto ""Thus Ever to Tyrants""               is reflected in the design of the seal, which shows a woman               subduing a king. Around the edges are vines of the ivy known as               Virginia creeper.                Washington                                 Entered the Union in 1889 as the 42nd State;               flag adopted in 1923, modified in 1967. The ""Evergreen State"" shows               the color green for the background of its flag, which bears the               State seal. The president for whom the State was name was made part               of the seal in 1889.                   West Virginia                    Entered the Union in 1863 as the 35th State;               flag adopted in 1905, modified in 1907 and 1929. The big laurel,               the State flower, frames the shield of the State seal. The hunter               and miner stand over a motto meaning ""Mountaineers Are Always               Free.""                   Wisconsin                Entered the Union in 1848 as the 30th State;               flag adopted in 1913, modified in 1981. Various symbols of               agriculture, mining, shipping, and industry are found in the coast               of arms of Wisconsin. The badger over the shield is a reference to               the State nickname.                Wyoming                Entered the Union in 1890 as the 44th State;               flag adopted in 1917. The State seal appears on a silhouette of a               bison, familiar to 19th century settlers. The red is for Native               Americans, white for purity, and blue for the sky, justice, and               loyalty.                District of Columbia                Established in 1791; flag adopted in 1938.               The personal arms of George Washington form the District flag. It               has no historical relationship to the Stars and Stripes, despite               the similarity of design.                American Samoa                Unincorporated American territory since 1900;               flag adopted in 1960. Red, white, and blue are the colors of Samoa               and the United States. The American bald eagle holds traditional               Samoan symbols, a staff and war club.                Guam                    Established as a territory of the United               States in 1898; flag adopted in 1917, modified in 1948. The               traditional Chamorro canoe, a palm tree, and the mouth of the Agaña               River appear in the seal. The shape of the seal recalls the ancient               Guamanian sling stone.                Northern Marianas                     Commonwealth established in 1986; flag               adopted in 1972. Blue is for the Pacific Ocean, the star for the               commonwealth. The grey latte stone is for Taga, a legendary               Chamorro. The Stone and star are surrounded by the traditional               Carolinian mwarr.                   Puerto Rico                                 Commonwealth established in 1952; flag               adopted in 1952. Based on the Cuban flag and, ultimately, the Stars               and Stripes, the flag of Puerto Rico was created in 1895 when the               island was seeking independence from Spain.                   Virgin Islands                    Established as a territory of the United               States in 1917; flag adopted in 1921. The coat of arms of the               United States has been simplified and stylized for use in the               territorial flag together with the initials of the islands. Many               believe the arrows stand for St. Thomas, St. John, and St. Croix.                                FLAG DAY                Each year on June 14, we celebrate the               birthday of the Stars and Stripes, which came into being on June               14, 1777. At that time, the Second Continental Congress authorized               a new flag to symbolize the new Nation, the United States of               America.                 The Stars and Stripes first flew in a Flag               Day celebration in Hartford, Connecticut in 1861, during the first               summer of the Civil War. The first national observance of Flag Day               occurred June 14, 1877, the centennial of the original flag               resolution.                By the mid 1890's the observance of Flag Day               on June 14 was a popular event. Mayors and governors began to issue               proclamations in their jurisdictions to celebrate this event.                              In the years to follow, public sentiment for               a national Flag Day observance greatly intensified. Numerous               patriotic societies and veterans groups became identified with the               Flag Day movement. Since their main objective was to stimulate               patriotism among the young, schools were the first to become               involved in flag activities.                 In 1916 President Woodrow Wilson issued a               proclamation calling for a nationwide observance of Flag Day on               June 14. It was not until 1949 that Congress made this day a               permanent observance by resolving ""That the 14th day of June of               each year is hereby designated as Flag Day . The measure was signed               into law by President Harry Truman.                 Although Flag Day is not celebrated as a               Federal holiday, Americans everywhere continue to honor the history               and heritage it represents.                 THE GREAT SEAL OF THE UNITED STATES                On July 4, 1776, the Continental Congress               passed a resolution authorizing a committee to devise a seal for               the United States of America. This mission, designed to reflect the               Founding Fathers' beliefs, values, and sovereignty of the new               Nation, did not become a reality until June 20, 1782.                In heraldic devices, such as seals, each               element has a specific meaning. Even colors have specific meanings.               The colors red, white, and blue did not have meanings for the Stars               and Stripes when it was adopted in 1777. However, the colors in the               Great Seal did have specific meanings. Charles Thompson, Secretary               of the Continental Congress, reporting to Congress on the Seal,               stated:                ""The colors of the pales (the vertical               stripes) are those used in the flag of the United States of               America; White signifies purity and innocence, Red, hardiness &               valour, and Blue, the color of the Chief (the broad band above the               stripes) signifies vigilance, perseverance & justice.""                                              The obverse front of the Great Seal-which is               used 2,000 to 3,000 times a year-authenticates the President's               signature on numerous official documents such as treaty               ratifications, international agreements, appointments of               Ambassadors and civil officers, and communications from the               President to heads of foreign governments. The design of the               obverse of the Seal, which is the U.S. coat of arms, can be shown               on coins, postage stamps, passports, monuments and flags, and in               many other ways. The American public sees both the obverse and less               familiar reverse, which is never used as a seal, every day when               exchanging the $1 dollar bill.                The Great Seal die, counter die, press, and               cabinet in which they are housed, are located in the Exhibit Hall               of the Department of State inside a locked glass enclosure. An               officer from the Department's Presidential Appointments Staff does               the actual sealing of documents after the Secretary of State has               countersigned the President's signature.                ""Graphic omitted""                The American bald eagle is prominently               featured supporting a shield composed of 13 red and white stripes               (pales) representing the Thirteen Original States with a blue bar               (chief) uniting the shield and representing Congress. The motto of               the United States, E Pluribus Unum (meaning out of many, one),               refers to this union. The olive branch and 13 arrows grasped by the               eagle allude to peace and war, powers solely vested in the               Congress, and the constellation of stars symbolizes the new Nation               taking its place among the sovereign powers.                 ""Graphic omitted""            The pyramid signifies strength and duration: The eye over   it and the motto, Annuit Coeptis (meaning He, [Godj has favored our   undertakings), allude to the many interventions of Providence in favor of the   American cause. The Roman numerals below are the date of the Declaration of   Independence. The words under it, Novus Ordo Seclorum (meaning a new order of   the ages), signify the beginning of the new American era in 1776.                             FORT McHENRY                Fort McHenry is located in Baltimore,               Maryland. This low citadel overlooks the entrance to Baltimore               harbor and it is where the Americans defended the city against               British land and naval attack on September 13-14 in 1814. It was               during this battle that Francis Scott Key began the draft to ""The               Star-Spangled Banner"" after seeing the flag still flying after a               day and night of bombardment.                The fort continued in active military service               for nearly a century after the battle but changing technology               eventually made it obsolete as a coastal defense system. Today the               43-acre fort is preserved as a national monument and historic               shrine. The property is managed by the National Park Service and               the flag is flown over the fort 24 hours a day.                ""Graphic omitted""                THE FLAG HOUSE                The Flag House is located on the northwest               corner of Albemarle and Pratt Streets in Baltimore, Maryland. It               was the home of Mary Pickersgill from 1807 to 1857, and it was               where she made the original ""Star-Spangled Banner,"" which measured               30 by 42 feet. The stripes were two feet wide and the stars were               two feet from point to point. Mrs. Pickersgill was paid $405.90 for               her services. The flag was delivered to Fort McHenry on August 19,               1813, a full year before the Battle of Baltimore.                In 1876, Caroline Pickersgill Purdy wrote a               letter to Georgiana Armistead Appleton, daughter of the Fort               McHenry Commandant, in which she recounted the details of the               making of the flag. Caroline wrote""                ""It was made by my mother, Mrs. Mary               Pickersgill, and I assisted her. My grandmother, Rebecca Young,               made the first flag of the Revolution under George Washington's               directions, and for this reason my mother was selected by Commodore               Barney and General Stricker to make this star-spangled banner,               being in exceedingly patriotic woman. This flag, I think, contained               four hundred yards of bunting, and my mother worked many nights               until twelve o'clock to complete it in a given time.""                                              The flag bears the autograph of Lt. Col.               George Armistead as well as the date of the British bombardment.               The flag remained in the Armistead family for many years until it               was loaned to the Smithsonian for an official display in 1907. On               December 19, 1912, it was donated to the Smithsonian where it is               now on permanent exhibit. In 1914, much-needed preservative work               was done on the flag by Mrs. Amelia Fowler and several other               restoration experts. Although the flag was reduced in size in order               to repair it, the reinforcement technique used has preserved its               existence.                The Flag House is a National Historic               Landmark, and is operated by an independent non-profit association.               The flag is flown over the house 24 hours a day.                PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE TO THE FLAG                ""I PLEDGE ALLEGIANCE TO THE FLAG OF               THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND TO THE REPUBLIC FOR WHICH IT               STANDS, ONE NATION UNDER GOD, INDIVISIBLE, WITH LIBERTY AND JUSTICE               FOR ALL.""                The Pledge of Allegiance received official               recognition by Congress in an Act approved on June 22, 1942.               However, the pledge was first published in 1892 in the Youth's               Companion magazine in Boston, Massachusetts to celebrate the 400th               anniversary of the discovery of America, and was first used in               public schools to celebrate Columbus Day on October 12, 1892.                In its original version, the pledge read ""my               flag"" instead of ""the flag of the United States."" the change in the               wording was adopted by the National Flag Conference in 1923. The               rationale for the change was that it prevented ambiguity among               foreign-born children and adults who might have the flag of their               native land in mind when reciting the pledge.                The phrase ""under God"" was added to the               pledge by a Congressional act approved on June 14, 1954. At that               time, President Eisenhower said:                ""in this way we are reaffirming the               transcendence of religious faith in America's heritage and future;               in this way we shall constantly strengthen those spiritual weapons               which forever will be our country's most powerful resource in peace               and war.""                              The American's Creed                              I  BELIEVE IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AS A GOVERNMENT OF THE PEOPLE, BY THE  PEOPLE, FOR THE PEOPLE; WHOSE JUST POWERS ARE DERIVED FROM THE CONSENT OF THE  GOVERNED; A DEMOCRACY IN A REPUBLIC, A SOVEREIGN NATION OF MANY SOVEREIGN  STATES; A PERFECT UNION, ONE AND INSEPARABLE; ESTABLISHED UPON THOSE PRINCIPLES  OF FREEDOM, EQUALITY, JUSTICE, AND HUMANITY FOR WHICH AMERICAN PATRIOTS  SACRIFICED THEIR LIVES AND FORTUNES.  I THEREFORE BELIEVE IT IS MY DUTY TO MY  COUNTRY TO LOVE IT, TO SUPPORT ITS CONSTITUTION; TO OBEY ITS LAWS; TO RESPECT  ITS FLAG; AND TO DEFEND IT AGAINST ALL ENEMIES.    The Creed was written in 1918 by William Tyler Page of  Friendship Heights, Maryland in the course of a nationwide contest on the  subject. Page was a descendent of President Tyler, and Representative John Page,  who served in the Congress from 1789-97.   William Tyler Page began his government career as a  Congressional page in December of 1881. In 1919, he was elected Clerk of the  House of Representatives, and held that position until December of 1931. a new  post, Emeritus Minority Clerk, was then created for him which he occupied until  his death on October 20, 1942.                School Projects                The study of the history and symbolism of               flags is known as VEXILLOLOGY from the Latin word, VEXILLUM which               means a square flag or banner.                Numerous books have been written about the               flag. Local and school libraries should have a catalog reference               for these books. Also, military and veterans organizations as well               as the Daughters of the American Revolution and the American Legion               provide useful information on the flag and flag code.                You also can find the complete flag code,               including laws and proclamations in the depository library in your               Congressional district. Your local librarian can assist you in               obtaining information from your nearest depository library.                             Return       to Federal Citizen Information Center Home Page"

Cooke on a sheet torn from his field dispatch book.  At the top and right of the message is a ""translation"" written by Captain Benteen. The original message is in the U. S. Military Academy Library, West Point, N.Y.  (Reproduced by courtesy of the U. S. Military Academy Library, West Point)      The March of Generals Terry and Gibbon and Their Arrival at the Battleground              Trumpeter John Martin who carried Custer's last message to Captain Benteen. (Photograph by D. F. Barry in 1906.)          The troops of Generals Terry and Gibbon, numbering about 450 men, left the mouth of the Rosebud Creek on June 21, proceeded up the Yellowstone River, and crossed to its south side just below the mouth of the Bighorn River. On the night of the 24th they camped on lower Tullock Creek. The 25th, the day of Custer's battle, they traversed the arid hills along the Bighorn River in an effort to get to the mouth of the Little Bighorn River.    On Monday the 26th, near the mouth of the Little Bighorn River, these troops had sign talk with three Crow Indians who had been scouts with Custer. The Indians told them all the white men had been killed. None of the men fully believed this story. The entire command marched up the Little Bighorn Valley, continually noting Indians farther up the valley and on the bluffs to the right, some riding singly and others in groups. That evening camp was made near the present site of Crow Agency, Mont.    On the morning of the 27th no Indians were seen by the troops and, following breakfast, the march southward began. Lieutenant Bradley, with a detail, was sent on special scout duty to the east side of the river. After the main column of troops had marched south up the valley about 3 miles, an officer saw men and animals moving on a hill 3 miles to the east across the valley. An officer, with a few men, was detailed to get closer to this group to identify them. They proved to be a detachment which had been sent by Reno. The story was told of the disappearance of Custer and his battalion.    While this conference was in progress, Lieutenant Bradley and his scouting party returned. He brought the first official news of the tragic loss. On July 27, 1876, in the  Helena Weekly Herald,  Bradley made the following statement of what he had found:       ""Of the 206 bodies buried on the field, there were very few that I did not see, and beyond scalping, in possibly a majority of cases, there was little mutilation. Many of the bodies were not even scalped, and in the comparatively few cases of disfiguration it appeared to me rather the result of a blow than of a knife . . .""       Immediate action was taken to care properly for the wounded men in Reno's command. They were transferred before the day ended from the Reno defense area on the hills to the valley where Generals Terry and Gibbon had set up camp, and the men began work making litters on which to transport them.        Grave of Lt. John J. Crittenden, Twentieth United States Infantry. He was attached to the Seventh Cavalry for duty and killed with Custer's troops. Photograph taken in 1877. (Courtesy of the National Archives.)    On the 27th, a group under the supervision of Captain Benteen was sent to Custer's Battlefield to make a survey of the field. Early the next day the Seventh Cavalry proceeded to the battlefield to locate, count, and bury the bodies of their comrades. Four officers and 14 enlisted men were found to be missing, but none was found alive. Accounts vary as to what percent of the bodies were scalped or mutilated. Much of the clothing and personal belongings was missing. It is known that General Custer's body, though stripped of clothing, was neither scalped nor mutilated. He had been struck twice by bullets, either one of which could have been fatal. The burials were made in shallow graves and properly marked wherever identification was possible.    Previous to the arrival of the soldiers, the Indians had carried away and cared for most of their own dead. The exact place of their burials is not known. The loss of the Indians has never been satisfactorily deter mined. Published figures vary from 30 to 300.

Never display the U.S. flag from a float except from a staff, or so suspended that its folds fall free as though staffed.         When other flags are flown from the same halyard, the U.S. flag should always be at the peak. When other flags are flown from adjacent staffs, the U.S. flag should be hoisted first and lowered last. No flag may fly above or the right of the U.S. flag (except flags of other nations; see below).              The U.S. flag, when displayed with another flag against a wall from crossed staffs, should be on the U.S. flag's own right, and its staff should be in front of the staff of the other flag.              When flags of two or more nations are displayed, they are to be flown from separate staffs of the same height. The flags should be of approximately equal size. International usage forbids the display of the flag of one nation above that of another nation in time of peace.              The U.S. flag should be at the center and at the highest point of the group when a number of flags of states or localities or pennants of societies are grouped and displayed from staffs.              When the U.S. flag is displayed from a staff projecting from a building, the union of the flag should be placed at the peak of the staff unless the flag is at half staff. When suspended from a rope extending from the building on a pole, the flag should be hoisted out, union first from the building.

When not in uniform, men should remove their headdress with their right hand and hold it at the left shoulder, the hand being over the heart. Persons in uniform should remain silent, face the flag, and render the military salute.    Display the U.S. flag on all days but especially on national and state holidays and other days that may be proclaimed by the President of the United States. On Memorial Day, the U.S. flag should be half-staffed until noon.    The U.S. flag should be displayed on or near the main building of every public institution, during school days in or near every school, and in or near every polling place on election days.    Always hoist the U.S. flag briskly. Lower it ceremoniously.    Things Not to Do    Never in any way should disrespect be shown the U.S. flag.    The U.S. flag should never be dipped to any person or thing. Regimental colors, state flags, and organization or institutional flags are dipped as a mark of honor.    The U.S. flag should never be displayed with the union down except as a signal of dire distress.    The U.S. flag should never touch anything beneath it-ground, floor, water or merchandise.    The U.S. flag should never be carried horizontally, but always aloft and free.    Always allow the U.S. flag to fall free-never use the U.S. flag as drapery, festooned, drawn back or up in folds. For draping platforms and decoration in general, use blue, white and red bunting. Always arrange the bunting with blue above, the white in the middle and the red below.    The U.S. flag should never be fastened, displayed, used or stored in a manner which will permit it to be easily torn, soiled or damaged in any way.    Never use the U.S. flag as a covering or drape for a ceiling.    Never place anything on the U.S. flag. The U.S. flag should never have placed upon it, or on any part of it, or attached to it, any mark, insignia, letter, word, figure, design, picture or drawing of any nature.    Never use the U.S. flag for receiving, holding, carrying or delivering anything.    The U.S. flag should not be embroidered on such articles as cushions, handkerchiefs, and the like, printed or otherwise impressed on paper napkins or boxes or anything that is designed for temporary use and discard; or used as any portion of a costume or athletic uniform. However, a flag patch may be affixed to the uniform of military personnel, fire fighters, police officers and members of patriotic organizations. Advertising signs should not be fastened to a staff or halyard from which the flag is flown.    When the U.S. flag is in such condition that it is no longer a fitting emblem for display, it should be destroyed in a dignified way, preferably by burning.

In the event of the death       of other officials or foreign dignitaries, the flag is to be displayed at       half-staff according to Presidential instructions or orders, or in accordance       with recognized customs or practices not inconsistent with law. In the event of       the death of a present or former official of the government of any State,       territory, or possession of the United States, the Governor of that State,       territory, or possession may proclaim that the National flag shall be flown at       half-staff. The flag shall be flown at half-staff thirty days from the death of       the President or a former President; ten days from the day of death of the Vice       President, the Chief Justice or a retired Chief Justice of the United States,       or the Speaker of the House of Representatives; from the day of death until       interment of an Associate justice of the Supreme Court, a Secretary of an       executive or military department, a former Vice President, or the Governor of a       State, territory, or possession; and on the day of death and the following day       for a Member of Congress. As used in this subsection          (1) the term ""half-staff"" means the       position of the flag when it is one-half the distance between the top and       bottom of the staff;           (2) the term ""executive or military       department"" means any agency listed under sections 101 and 102 of title 5,       United States Code; and           (3) the term ""Member of Congress"" means a       Senator, a Representative, a Delegate, or the Resident Commissioner from Puerto       Rico.                                                         (n) When the flag is used to       cover a casket, it should be so placed that the union is at the head and over       the left shoulder. The flag should not be lowered into the grave or allowed to       touch the ground.                   (o) When the flag is suspended across a       corridor or lobby in a building with only one main entrance, it should be       suspended vertically with the union of the flag to the observer's left upon       entering. If the building has more than one main entrance, the flag should be       suspended vertically near the center of the corridor or lobby with the union to       the north, when entrances are to the east and west or to the east when       entrances are to the north and south. If there are entrances in more than two       directions, the union should be to the east.

Parading and Saluting the                   Flag                    When carried in a procession, the flag should be to the right                   of the marchers. When other flags are carried, the flag of the                   United States may be centered in front of the others or                   carried to their right. When the flag passes in a procession,                   or when it is hoisted or lowered, all should face the flag and                   salute.                                         The Salute                    To salute, all persons come to attention. Those in uniform                   give the appropriate formal salute. Citizens not in uniform                   salute by placing their right hand over the heart and men with                   head cover should remove it and hold it to left shoulder, hand                   over the heart. Members of organizations in formation salute                   upon command of the person in charge.                     The Pledge of Allegiance                   and National Anthem                    The pledge of allegiance should be rendered by standing at                   attention, facing the flag, and saluting. When the national                   anthem is played or sung, citizens should stand at attention                   and salute at the first note and hold the salute through the                   last note. The salute is directed to the flag, if displayed,                   otherwise to the music.                     Displaying the Flag                   Outdoors                     When the flag is displayed from                   a staff projecting from a window, balcony, or a building, the                   union should be at the peak of the staff unless the flag is at                   half staff.                      When it is displayed from                   the same flagpole with another flag - of a state, community,                   society or Scout unit - the flag of the United States must                   always be at the top except that the church pennant may be                   flown above the flag.                      When the flag is                   displayed over a street, it should be hung vertically, with                   the union to the north or east. If the flag is suspended over                   a sidewalk, the flag's union should be farthest from the                   building.                      When flown with flags of                   states, communities, or societies on separate flag poles which                   are of the same height and in a straight line, the flag of the                   United States is always placed in the position of honor - to                   its own right. The other flags may be smaller but none may be                   larger.                      When flown with the                   national banner of other countries, each flag must be                   displayed from a separate pole of the same height. Each flag                   should be the same size. They should be raised and lowered                   simultaneously.                                         Displaying the Flag Indoors                    When on display, the flag is accorded the place of honor,                   always positioned to its own right. Place it to the right of                   the speaker or staging area or sanctuary. Other flags should                   be to the left.                      The flag of the United                   States of America should be at the center and at the highest                   point of the group when a number of flags of states,                   localities, or societies are grouped for display.                      When one flag is used                   with the flag of the United States of America and the staffs                   are crossed, the flag of the United States is placed on its                   own right with its staff in front of the other flag.                      When displaying the flag                   against a wall, vertically or horizontally, the flag's union                   (stars) should be at the top, to the flag's own right, and to                   the observer's left.                                         Raising and Lowering the                   Flag                    The flag should be raised briskly and lowered slowly and                   ceremoniously. Ordinarily it should be displayed only between                   sunrise and sunset. It should be illuminated if displayed at                   night.                      The flag of the United                   States of America is saluted as it is hoisted and lowered. The                   salute is held until the flag is unsnapped from the halyard or                   through the last note of music, whichever is the longest.                                         The Flag in Mourning                    To place the flag at half-staff, hoist it to the peak for an                   instant and lower it to a position half way between the top                   and bottom of the staff. The flag is to be raised again to the                   peak for a moment before it is lowered.                      On Memorial Day the flag                   is displayed at half staff until noon and at full staff from                   noon to sunset.                      The flag is to be flown                   at half-staff in mourning for designated principal government                   leaders and upon presidential or gubernatorial order.                      When used to cover a                   casket, the flag should be placed with the union at the head                   and over the left shoulder. It should not be lowered into the                   grave.

The flag of the United States of America, for the purpose of this chapter, shall be defined according to sections 1 and 2 of Title 4, United States Code and Executive Order 10824, issued pursuant thereto.          2 TIME AND OCCASIONS FOR DISPLAY; HOISTING AND LOWERING (36 U.S.C. 173)      a It is the universal custom to display the flag from sunrise to sunset on buildings and on stationary flagstaffs in the open. However, when patriotic effect is desired, the flag may be displayed twenty-four hours a day if properly illuminated during the hours of darkness.   b The flag should be hoisted briskly and lowered ceremoniously.   c The flag should not be displayed on days when weather is inclement, except when an all-weather flag is displayed.   d The flag should be displayed on all days, especially on New Year's Day, January 1; Inauguration Day, January 20; Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s Birthday, third Monday in January; Lincoln's Birthday, February 12; Washington's Birthday, third Monday in February; Easter Sunday (variable); Mother's Day, second Sunday in May; Armed Forces Day, third Saturday in May; Flag Day, June 14; Independence Day, July 4; Labor Day, first Monday in September; Constitution Day, September 17; Columbus Day, second Monday in October; Navy Day, October 27; Veteran's Day, November 11; Thanksgiving Day, fourth Thursday in November; Christmas Day, December 25; and such other days as may be proclaimed by the President of the United States; the birthdays of States (date of admission); and on State holidays.    e The flag shall be flown at half-staff on Peace Officers Memorial Day, May 15 unless that day is also Armed Forces Day; Memorial Day (half-staff until noon only, then raised to the top of the staff), last Monday in May; National Korean War Veterans Day, July 27 (half-staff until the year 2003); National Pearl Harbor Day, December 7.   f The flag should be displayed daily on or near the main administration building of every public institution.                 3 POSITION AND MANNER OF DISPLAY (36 U.S.C. 175)      The flag, when carried in a procession with another flag or flags, should be either on the marching right; that is, the flag's own right, or if there is a line of other flags, in front of the center of that line.    a The flag of the United States of America, when it is displayed with another flag against a wall from crossed staffs, should be on the right, the flag's own right, and its staff should be in front of the staff of the other flag.   b The flag of the United States of America should be at the center and at the highest point of the group when a number of flags of States or localities or pennants of societies are grouped and displayed from staffs.   c When flags of States, cities or localities, or pennants of societies are flown on the same halyard with the flag of the United States of America the latter should always be at the peak. When the flags are flown from adjacent staffs, the flag of the United States of America should be hoisted first and lowered last. No such flag or pennant may be placed above the flag of the United States of America or the United States of America flag's right.    d When flags of two or more nations are displayed, they are to be flown from separate staffs of the same height. The flags should be of approximately equal size.

When displaying either horizontally or vertically against a wall, the union should be uppermost and to the flag's own right, that is, to the observer's left.    f When displaying other flags horizontally or vertically against a wall, the union should be uppermost and to the flag's own right, that is, to the observer's left.    g When used on a speaker's platform, the flag, if displayed flat, should be displayed above and behind the speaker. When displayed from a staff in a church or public auditorium, the flag of the United States of America should hold the position of superior prominence, in advance of the audience, and in the position of honor at the clergyman's or speaker's right as he/she faces the audience. Any other flag so displayed should be placed on the left of the clergyman or speaker or to the right of the audience.    h The flag should form a distinctive feature in the ceremony of unveiling a statue or monument, but it should never be used as the covering for the statue or monument.   i The flag, when directed by an Agency Head to fly at half-staff, must meet the following provisions:      (1) The flag will fly at half-staff for a period not to exceed one day.   (2) Flying the flag at half-staff symbolizes respect to the memory of a USDA individual(s) who died in the line of duty or the loss of life of a local individual(s) through an act of heroism.   (3) The lowering of the flag to half-staff can only be done in USDA controlled buildings or facilities.   (4) In a multi-tenant building complex or facility the lead agency must agree to fly the flag at half-staff.      j The flag, when flown at half-staff, should be first hoisted to the peak for an instant and then lowered to the half-staff position. The flag should again be raised to the peak before it is lowered for the day. On Memorial Day the flag should be displayed at half-staff until noon only, then raised to the top of the staff.   By order of the President, the flag shall be flown at half-staff upon the death of principal figures of the United States Government and the Governor of a State, territory, or possession, as a mark of respect to their memory. In the event of the death of other officials or foreign dignitaries, the flag is to be displayed at half-staff according to Presidential instructions or orders, or in accordance with recognized customs or practices not inconsistent with law.

GX027-63-11393625	Tri-County Senior Squadron                             Emergency Services                                        Emergency Services is one of Civil Air Patrol's best-known activity. It entails  air and ground search and rescue, local disaster relief, as well as cooperation with and  assistance to other emergency services agencies. CAP members fly 80 percent of all the hours  flown on search and rescue missions directed by the    Air Force Rescue Coordination Center (AFRCC)   at Langley   Air Force Base, Virginia. The center coordinates search and rescue efforts within the inland search  and rescue region (48 contiguous states). Civil Air Patrol is also active in Alaska where it is  directed in its search operations by the Alaskan Air Command Rescue Coordination Center. In Hawaii, the CAP works under the direction of the Pacific Air Forces Joint Rescue Coordination Center. In  Puerto Rico, Civil Air Patrol works in cooperation with the U.S. Coast Guard and local civil  authorities.   In the last five years, CAP crews have been involved in more than 5,500 search and  rescue or other emergency service missions.  During this time, these volunteers were credited with  saving the lives of more than 425 persons and with locating the objects of their searches nearly 2,500 times. These missions required more than 92,000 hours of flying time.            CAP, as well as members who fly their own airplanes on these missions, are reimbursed by the  Air Force for fuel, oil, and communication expenses. In addition, the Air Force now provides  maintenance costs for these as well as for certain training missions.                            Often, CAP members also help out in missions which may involve airlifting blood or donor organs,  medication and civil or relief officials to disaster areas. Disaster relief missions may also involve air surveillance of disaster areas, as well as the air evacuation of the stranded, sick or injured.  Rescue work and aid are provided during floods, hurricanes, earthquakes, and other emergencies.    CAP maintains a nationwide network of over 20,000 radio stations which provides an invaluable backup  to state, local civil defense and Air Force communications. Locally, the stations support state disaster plans and provide communications for CAP search and rescue and other disaster relief missions.

All cadets must learn drill and ceremonies in order to progress through the program. Through the Civil Air Patrol Cadet Program, cadets have the opportunity to learn about aviation, travel to other parts of the world with the International Air Cadet Exchange program, attend flight academies, band encampments, leadership schools, and familiarization courses for the Air Education and Training Command and Air Force Space Command. Those cadets who enjoy emergency services are able to attend special activities including Para-rescue Orientation Courses and Ground Search and Rescue Schools.   Aerospace Education   Civil Air Patrol provides Aerospace Education to both its seniors and its cadets. Along with educating its own members about the importance of the aerospace field, the Civil Air Patrol also works to educate the general public about the importance of the field. Civil Air Patrol holds workshops for teachers, assists in teaching about aerospace, and is the source of a great deal of information on the topic. Cadets in Civil Air Patrol are required to participate in aerospace education by passing an aerospace test for many of the achievements that must be completed in order to progress through the program. Additional programs such as model rocketry are available for cadets to participate in.   Emergency Services   Civil Air Patrol takes part in Emergency Services as a way to help the Air Force free up valuable resources. Civil Air Patrol participates in search and rescue, disaster relief, and in times of war, civil defense. Civil Air Patrol's fleet of aircraft are equipped with direction finding radio equipment in order to make locating downed aircraft possible, as well as making aerial damage assessment possible. Civil Air Patrol squadrons have ground team qualified cadets and seniors that are available to take part in missions for both disaster relief and search and rescue missions. For cadets choosing to take part in the emergency services aspect of Civil Air Patrol, Search and Rescue Exercises, Field Training Exercises, and Ground Search and Rescue School are all activities in which he or she may gain more experience and become qualified to take part in emergency services missions.                                                  Civil Air Patrol is the Official Auxiliary of the U.S. Air Force         Semper Vigilans - ""Always Vigilant""          [  Activities  ]   [  Photos  ]   [  Staff  ]   [  Senior Program  ]   [  Cadet Program  ]   [  Schedule  ]   [  About CAP  ]   [  Joining CAP  ]   [  Squadron Info  ]   [  Links  ]                          Home SER-GA-140 Website        last updated 12-May-03        Website maintained by C/Lt Col Reed Martin        Original design by C/Lt Col Dan Upshaw          Webmaster"

GX144-81-0269077	"FORT DAVIS   National Historic Site                                 Camels at Fort Davis      SECRETARY OF WAR JEFFERSON DAVIS believed that the vexing problem of supply and transportation on the western deserts might be solved by the use of camels. At his urging, Congress in 1855 appropriated $30,000 to conduct experiments. By early 1856, 74 camels had been brought from the Levant and corralled at Camp Verde north of San Antonio. The first camels passed by Fort Davis in July 1857 under charge of a naval officer, Lt. Edward F. Beale, who had been assigned to survey a wagon road across Arizona. The lieutenant already had high praise for the efficiency and endurance of the animals. Two years later, Davis' successor, Secretary of War John B. Floyd, ordered additional tests. Lt. William B. Echols was to use camels in searching out a shorter route from San Antonio to Fort Davis. Lt. Edward L. Hartz and an infantry detachment from Fort Davis Served as escort. For comparison, 24 camels and 24 mules carried the supplies. Throughout the summer of 1859, the command scoured the desert between Forts Stockton and Davis and the Big Bend, and the officers emerged from the trials convinced of the superiority of camels over mules.    The following year, 1860, Secretary Floyd ordered more experiments in still rougher terrain. Again attempting to pioneer a new route from the Pecos to Fort Davis, Lieutenant Echols with 25 camels and 20 mules nearly perished in the desert. For 5 days, 120 miles, they found no water. But the camels, carrying much water and consuming none, saw the party through to Fort Davis. But for their ""endurance, docility, and sagacity,"" wrote the acting department commander, Bvt. Col. Robert E. Lee, ""the reconnaissance would have failed.""    Despite their demonstrated value, camels were not again used. Those at Camp Verde fell into the hands of Confederates in 1861. After the war, any project associated with the name of Jefferson Davis was discredited, and no one ever attempted to revive the idea. The camels were sold at auction, and the army mule continued to enjoy its customary supremacy.

Troy Beshears  Petty Officer 1st Class Mike Bouchard  Petty Officer 1st Class John Green       Read Sen. Landrieu's Tribute to Coast Guard Helicopter Aircrew   Read the Program Honoring the Officers      Article published in the New Orleans  Times-Picayune  on Sunday, January 21, 2001:       COPTER CREW EARNS MEDAL       51 people saved in daring rescue from burning oil rig in the Gulf   Crew braves fire to get pal who stayed    behind         By Paul Purpura; West Bank bureau         The citations speak of ""extraordinary achievement,"" ""exceptional fortitude"" and ""devotion to duty.""       The phrases will be read aloud Monday for four members of a Coast Guard helicopter crew at Air Station New    Orleans. They will be awarded Distinguished Flying Crosses, the highest award military and Coast Guard    aviators can get, for their role in rescuing 51 people from a burning oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico. They also    saved one of their own from the rig when it erupted in a fiery explosion.       Their story began July 5 about 10:20 p.m. While monitoring another situation east of Plaquemines Parish, the    crew aboard the HH-65 Dolphin helicopter overheard a distress call placed to the Coast Guard Station in    Venice.       ""Mayday, mayday, mayday. This is the Ocean Crusader. I'm a rig. I'm on fire,"" is what Lt. Troy Beshears, the    pilot, recalls hearing.       Though no one dispatched the helicopter to the rig, Lt. Cmdr. Brian Moore, 39, the flight commander and also    a former Army pilot, made the decision: ""We're going.""             Watery inferno        They had no precise coordinates to guide them and had used almost half their fuel. Aided by night-vision    goggles, they flew into the darkness hanging over the Gulf. They arrived 15 minutes later to see flames fueled    by natural gas shooting from the well head on one side of a jack-up rig. ""They did not seem to have it under    control, but they had it at bay,"" said Petty Officer 1st Class Mike Bouchard, 38, the flight mechanic.       Moments later, Beshears landed the orange helicopter on the square landing pad that jutted out from the    jack-up rig, which stood in 50 feet of water about 30 miles south of Grand Isle. ""The first thing I can see were    all these faces on the platform, and all of them jumping up at one time,"" Beshears said.       Petty Officer 1st Class John Green, 35, the copter's rescue swimmer, described the frightened crew as having    ""big eyes and life preservers."" There were 51 people, and the helicopter could carry only four at a time.       Bouchard and Green attempted to keep the rig crew from rushing the helicopter, according to their citations.    An evacuation plan was quickly devised: They would fly crew members to another platform about 10 miles    away in groups of four. Green would stay behind to help organize the evacuation. A supply boat in the area    offered to help, and Green began a process in which crew members would be lowered to the boat using a    crane and gondola, again in groups of four.             Dangerous venture          The risks of such a rescue are great, particularly for aviators in an aircraft carrying flammable fuel, said Danny    Clayton, director of well control for Boots & Coots, a Houston company renowned for extinguishing well fires    that later handled this fire. Heat can cause downdrafts that affect the helicopter's ability to stay aloft.    Oxygen bottles or oil barrels on the rig could ignite, causing secondary explosions that litter the air with fiery    debris. The landing pad, heated by fire, could collapse under the weight of the helicopter, he said. ""It sounds    like somebody was awfully ballsy,"" Clayton said after hearing the rescue story.       Having flown 12 men to safety in three trips, the helicopter crew didn't have enough fuel to make it home and    had to leave the scene to refuel at a nearby platform. They left the operation thinking only Green and the    crane operator were on the rig. They were wrong. Shortly afterward, Green learned there were three crew    members still on the rig. In his last radio transmission to the copter, he told them so and warned that the rig's    power would be shut down. That meant the helicopter crew would return to a rig lit only by flames. To refuel,    they had to cut the helicopter's power and thus lost communication with Green, who by then had overseen    the evacuation of 36 people to the boat.       Meanwhile, a second New Orleans-based Coast Guard helicopter entered the fray, flying to the scene from    Mobile, Ala. Green knew help was on the way, having heard radio transmissions. But Moore and his crew did    not. The second helicopter's crew also thought only two people were left on the rig. ""Well, when they landed,    they found out there's four of us now,"" Green said. ""So they say, 'We can squeeze on three, but we can't take    four of you.' ""               Risking all to stay behind          At 6 feet and 200 pounds, Green volunteered to remain to avoid overloading the already-heavy helicopter.    Petty Officer 3rd Class Ian Powell, 23, the rescue swimmer on that flight, described the three rig crewmen as    ""pretty big gentlemen,"" and for a moment, his flight commander considered leaving him on the rig, too.       Now alone on the rig, Green watched the second helicopter fly away. In the distance he could see the lights    of his helicopter returning from the refueling platform, so he said he knew his ride was seconds away. Then the    rig erupted.       ""All I see is fire all the way down to the water, fire a good 100 feet above the top of the rig,"" said Beshears,    40. ""It looked like a giant mushroom cloud. I just panicked. It was like, 'Oh my God, we just lost our swimmer.    There's no way there's anybody alive on that rig.' ""       The whooshing sound was deafening as a wave of intense heat shot across the landing pad, knocking Green to    his knees. He covered his face. ""I'm thinking I'm not getting off this thing,"" he said.       Powell had been in the air only seconds when he saw the well blow up. ""The fire went over the structures on    the rig. It was a quick flash, maybe lasting three seconds, and then it went to smoke. I was speechless for a    second or two.""              Going in for the save         Time seemed to crawl. Powell couldn't see Green, but he heard his voice belt through the radio headset: ""You    guys better come and get me out.""       As flight commander, Moore calls the shots. ""If I was going to call wave-off, it was going to be at the very    last second,"" he said. ""I don't think we're shy to make that call. . . . That's an environment that at night is    challenging at best. It was doable. There wasn't a point where it was like, 'Hey, wave it off.' ""       Still, Moore suggested to Green that he jump off the landing pad into the Gulf, more than 100 feet below.    Green reluctantly agreed. ""If I'm going to jump at 120, 150 feet, I'm going to break something or be knocked    unconscious or whatever else,"" he said. ""I was just thinking there's no way I can jump off this thing.""       But he didn't have to jump. Beshears and Moore continued flying to the rig. ""Next thing I know we're in the    smoke,"" Beshears said. ""We can't see and we're flying into something that is solid steel.""       Bouchard hung out of the helicopter, looking through the smoke for the landing pad. The aircraft's rotors    washed away smoke, and Bouchard spotted the edge of the pad. Beshears said the helicopter touched the    pad as soon as he saw it. Then the helicopter ""shuddered, and all I hear is 'Go, go, go, go!' "" Beshears said.       The ""shudder"" was Green diving into the helicopter. Bouchard yelled into the helicopter's intercom, "" 'He's in,    he's in, let's go.' That was it. We were gone.""               'The Perfect Rig'           Because the helicopter's engine was damaged during the night, the crew had to fly to Venice instead of the    Naval Air Station-Joint Reserve Base in Belle Chasse. Almost two hours had passed since the crew had heard    the distress call. All 51 people were evacuated. No one was injured.       Safely on the ground, they jokingly dubbed the rescue ""The Perfect Rig,"" after the movie ""The Perfect Storm.""       ""Of course, at that time, anything was funny to me,"" Green said.       Attempts to interview crew members who were evacuated that night were unsuccessful. The platform was    owned by Basin Exploration Inc., and the rig was owned by Diamond Offshore Drilling Inc., which did not    comment.       In Venice, Beshears and Moore considered recommending Green for the Distinguished Flying Cross. ""He stayed    on that rig. That's what made (the evacuation) work,"" Beshears said. ""There's no other way to acknowledge    what occurred that night. In our eyes he was the hero.""       ""They're thinking I'm some hero,"" Green said. ""I'm glad they came back through all that to get me.""       Congress established the Distinguished Flying Cross in 1926, and the first recipient was Charles Lindbergh, an    Army Air Service Reserve captain, for the first flight across the Atlantic Ocean. It's the highest-ranking medal    given exclusively to military aviators, and in the overall pot of medals, it ranks between the Silver Star and the    Bronze Star, said Jim Farrar of the Distinguished Flying Cross Society, a fraternal nonprofit group of World War    II veterans.       ""It's rarely given in peacetime, and in peacetime it's given for very extraordinary circumstances,"" said Farrar,    who received his medal for actions as a crewman aboard an Air Force C-130 airplane during the Vietnam War.    The Coast Guard crew, he said, ""had to have gone far beyond any call of duty, knowingly going into extreme    danger.""                         Previous Constituents in the Spotlight...

GX227-73-3370293	"Sen. Landrieu's Tribute to Coast Guard Helicopter Aircrew         Ms. LANDRIEU.  Mr. President, I stand here today to pay tribute to four great Americans � Lieutenant Commander Brian Moore, Lieutenant Troy Beshears, Petty Officer First Class Mike Bouch and Petty Officer First Class John Green, all serving in the United States Coast Guard.   Last July, these four extraordinary Guardsmen were conducting a night flight over the Gulf of Mexico when the heard a distress call from the oil rig ""Ocean Crusader.""  Immediately flying to the rig, they arrived to find it engulfed in flames from a natural gas fire.  Placing themselves in imminent danger, they landed on the rig to rescue the crew of 51.  To expedite the rescue, Petty Officer Green left the helicopter to coordinate rescue efforts while his crew mates began the difficult task of ferrying the rig workers to another platform in groups of four.  As the helicopter began its first evacuation flight, Petty Officer Green began lowering rig workers to a rig supply boat in groups of four using a crane and gondola.   After rescuing 12 workers, in three dangerous trips, the helicopter crew was forced to leave the scene to refuel while Petty Officer Green remained behind to keep lowering people to the supply boat and safety.  He lowered 36 workers that way before another Coast Guard rescue helicopter arrived on the scene and landed to pick up the four men who remained on the platform.  When told the helicopter could only take three safely, Petty Officer Green courageously volunteered to stay behind.  Alone on that platform as the helicopter took the workers to safely, in the distance he could see his own aircraft returning when the rig erupted with fire raging from the waterline hundreds of feet in the air.   Committed to rescuing their crew mate, Lieutenant Commander Moore decided to try and rescue Petty Officer Green.  With Petty Officer Bouchard hanging out of their aircraft trying to spot the landing platform in the smoke, he flew the helicopter into the middle of the inferno the Ocean Crusader had become, setting down amidst the flames to pick up Petty Officer Green.   Today people say we live in a world without heroes, one in which cynicism and selfishness rule the day.  I am proud to say this is not the case in our United States Coast Guard.  Guardsmen and Guardswomen like Lieutenant Commander Moore, Lieutenant Beshears, Petty Officer Bouch and Petty Officer Green put their lives on the line every day so that others may live.  In this case, 51 men owe their lives to these four heroes who lived up to the Coast Guard's motto of ""Semper Paratus � Always Prepared.""  On behalf of those 51 men, their families, the state of Louisiana and Americans everywhere, I am proud to stand here today and say ""Thank you � job well done!"" to these extraordinary heroes."

Division of Soil and Water employees William Daisey, Orlando King and            Gerald Wingate had boarded the Department of Natural Resources and Environmental            Control dredge late afternoon yesterday when it was discovered after            periodic checks that the dredge appeared to be taking on water.           King, a dredge operator, and Wingate, an automotive and marine mechanic,            were transported to Broadkill Beach one at a time via a basket lowered            onto the dredge from the helicopter. Daisey, chief of field operations,            was grabbed by a swimmer from the helicopter crew and the two were hoisted            by line to the helicopter after the rescue basket was damaged during            King's and Wingate's evacuations. Daisey was taken to Dover Air Force            Base. Wingate and Daisey were unhurt; King suffered a knee injury, apparently            while onboard the dredge.           ""We are extremely grateful to the Coast Guard,"" said John            Hughes, Director of the Division. ""They did a magnificent job of            rescuing our men who were in serious danger.""           Higher than predicted winds, which eventually gusted to 67 miles per            hour last evening, surging waves and a broken cable may have contributed            to the dredge taking on water. Between 2:30 and 3 p.m., as the weather            shifted and the winds grew more robust, it became apparent that the            dredge had changed its orientation. The Delaware Bay Launch Service            was contacted at Slaughter Beach and Daisey, King, and Wingate were            transferred by launch boat to the dredge to begin pumping out the water.            The launch boat then traveled to Roosevelt Inlet to pick up additional            pumps and by the time it arrived back at Broadkill, the weather had            worsened to the extent that a decision was made to call the Coast Guard            for assistance to evacuate the men from the dredge.           ""The people of Broadkill Beach were extremely helpful and opened            their homes to the rescued men,"" said Hughes. ""We're very            thankful to them.""           Damage to the dredge will be evaluated by a salvage company that has            been called in to assess the damage. The dredge had been anchored offshore            at Broadkill Beach where it had been working on a beach replenishment            job last week.            -30-           Document no. 40-01/00/03/31                                                     Want your news hot off the press?

Milwaukee Journal Sentinel  February 17, 2003 Monday FINAL EDITION  HEADLINE: Civil Air Patrol taking on terror; It quietly shifts focus from search and rescue to homeland security  BYLINE: PETER MALLER  pmaller@journalsentinel.com   BODY: Larry Stys, a social studies teacher at South Milwaukee Middle School, spends  weekends flying missions for the Civil Air Patrol, training for the  unthinkable: an attack by terrorists on Wisconsin.  A Civil Air Patrol volunteer since his teens, Stys, 53, takes aerial photos of  bridges, supply depots and other potential state targets to help emergency  workers respond if terrorists strike.  ""I bring back digital pictures of railroad overpasses, power plants and fuel  tank farms to show we have the ability to photograph them accurately and can  help law enforcement handle any problem,"" said Stys, former commander of the  Wisconsin Wing of the Civil Air Patrol.  A national organization with branches in every state, the Civil Air Patrol was  started by amateur pilots in the 1940s to patrol harbors for enemy ships. When  the need for these missions ended after World War II, the volunteers switched  their attention to assisting in search and rescue missions. But now the  organization is again focusing on homeland security, according to Lt. Col.  Jeffrey Wiswell, spokesman for the state group.  The U.S. Air Force, which oversees the program, issued a directive six months  ago putting the group under a newly formed Homeland Security Directorate at  the Pentagon, he said. Since then, the Civil Air Patrol has been quietly  implementing the changes.  Like Stys, virtually all 800 members of the state group have day jobs  unrelated to aviation. But if terrorists strike, the Civil Air Patrol would  provide aerial reconnaissance, operate emergency communication systems and  transport disaster workers, Wiswell said.  ""They are university professors, students, doctors and people who own bowling  alleys or work at McDonald's,"" he said. ""These citizen volunteers take time  daily to help their friends and neighbors whether we are at war or at peace.""  The pilots also could ferry food, blood and organs for transplants, as well as  supply other critical needs, he said. They could be called upon to monitor  border crossings, remote airstrips and ports and harbors, Wiswell said.  Besides having members trained as pilots, the organization has volunteers  working the ground, operating communications systems and performing other  essential services, he said.  If terrorists strike, the Civil Air Patrol would use specialties to support  emergency government personnel and local law enforcement departments, he said.  Focusing on homeland security is an appropriate assignment for the  organization, which already is trained to find downed aircraft and help during  natural disasters, said Col. Clair Jowett, commander of the Wisconsin Wing.  Weekly gatherings  Wisconsin is divided into 34 squadrons with members who gather to conduct  meetings each week at municipal airports and National Guard centers.  ""The advantage we have is that we have 14 aircraft stationed all around the  state,"" Jowett said, a retired assistant principal at Wausau East High School.  ""So we can have fairly quick access to every area. We'll be using many of the  skills we already use.""  Even before the group was ordered to deal with the consequences of terrorism,  Lt. Col. Mike Curry, commander of Racine Composite Squadron 59, began moving  in that direction. After the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, Curry directed his  members, who specialize in operating electronic communications systems, to  train for homeland security.  ""We literally have a trailer full of equipment,"" he said. ""You just add people  and a place to plug it into -- and you have a mission headquarters.""  Curry's group uses a van to transport computers and other electronic gear to  sites around the state. The 12 members in his unit sometimes work with members  of other squadrons at a mobile communications system based at City Hall in  West Bend, he said.  The Civil Air Patrol recruits members as young as 12 for its cadet program but  accepts volunteers of all ages, Wiswell said.  Many of these youngsters later enter careers in the military, he said. The  group also runs community education programs in aerospace science.  Feeling a sense of patriotism, Kerry Brady, 13, a student at Kennedy Middle  School in Germantown, became a cadet soon after the attacks on the World Trade  Center, she said.  ""The first meeting I attended, we talked about 9-11, and it made me feel more  proud to be part of this group,"" said Brady, a member of the 461st Composite  Squadron based at West Bend.

Charles C. Newcomb   Director of Public Affairs   405-650-1792  Civil Air Patrol Continues Storm Assistance   TINKER AFB-Since Monday evening, just  minutes after killer tornadoes ripped  through Oklahoma, Civil Air Patrol's Oklahoma Wing has been assessing storm  damage and assisting law enforcement officers and emergency managers. Major  Mark Weiser, Oklahoma Wing Chief of Staff, said Civil Air Patrol (CAP)  volunteers from all over Oklahoma have worked nearly 2000 man-hours-a value to  the taxpayers of more than $35,000.   Another CAP team from the 103rd Composite  Squadron of the Connecticut Wing is standing by to help, and will be brought to  Oklahoma City courtesy of Southwest Airlines if necessary.   Oklahoma Wing staff  members were meeting at Tinker Air Force Base Monday when the storms came  through central Oklahoma, and went to work as soon as the storm had passed.   Since then more than 100 CAP volunteers have assessed damage all along the  storm's path-a total area of more than 30 square miles.  Civil Air Patrol aircraft have flown 20 hours in support of the disaster carrying city, state, and federal officials on survey flights. Eight Civil Air Patrol ground vehicles and three CAP aircraft have been utilized for disaster relief missions, along with two privately-owned aircraft and a large number of personal cars.  Communications support is being provided by AT&T Wireless Services of Stillwater.   Today, CAP damage assessment teams are working in Boonesville, Bridgecreek, and rural Pottowatomie County.  Other CAP members are assisting residents at the Moore and Oklahoma City disaster recovery centers.  Civil Air Patrol is the auxiliary of the United States Air Force.  It performs more than 85-percent of the inland search and rescue missions tasked by the Air Force Rescue Coordination center.  CAP members also support aerospace education activities and serve as mentors to America's youth through the CAP Cadet Program. -CAP-  EDITORS NOTE:  High-resolution photographs of CAP damage assessment teams working in storm-damaged areas are available on the Oklahoma Wing web site at  http://www.okwg.cap.gov/cap/pao .

GX042-57-4197908	Blue Ash Cadet Squadron                             Emergency Services                                  Emergency Services is one of Civil Air Patrol's best-known activity. It entails  air and ground search and rescue, local disaster relief, as well as cooperation with and  assistance to other emergency services agencies. CAP members fly 80 percent of all the hours  flown on search and rescue missions directed by the    Air Force Rescue Coordination Center (AFRCC)   at Langley   Air Force Base, Virginia. The center coordinates search and rescue efforts within the inland search  and rescue region (48 contiguous states). Civil Air Patrol is also active in Alaska where it is  directed in its search operations by the Alaskan Air Command Rescue Coordination Center. In Hawaii, the CAP works under the direction of the Pacific Air Forces Joint Rescue Coordination Center. In  Puerto Rico, Civil Air Patrol works in cooperation with the U.S. Coast Guard and local civil  authorities.   In the last five years, CAP crews have been involved in more than 5,500 search and  rescue or other emergency service missions.  During this time, these volunteers were credited with  saving the lives of more than 425 persons and with locating the objects of their searches nearly 2,500 times. These missions required more than 92,000 hours of flying time.          CAP, as well as members who fly their own airplanes on these missions, are reimbursed by the  Air Force for fuel, oil, and communication expenses. In addition, the Air Force now provides  maintenance costs for these as well as for certain training missions.                     Often, CAP members also help out in missions which may involve airlifting blood or donor organs,  medication and civil or relief officials to disaster areas. Disaster relief missions may also involve air surveillance of disaster areas, as well as the air evacuation of the stranded, sick or injured.  Rescue work and aid are provided during floods, hurricanes, earthquakes, and other emergencies.    CAP maintains a nationwide network of over 20,000 radio stations which provides an invaluable backup  to state, local civil defense and Air Force communications. Locally, the stations support state disaster plans and provide communications for CAP search and rescue and other disaster relief missions.

Crowe, Chief, Public Relations Ph.: (334) 953-5320  Fax: (334) 953-4245, E-Mail: pa@cap.af.mil < mailto:pa@cap.af.mil >     Oklahoma Wing quick to act following tornadoes  MAXWELL AFB, ALABAMA-As fire department and emergency service technicians were rushing wounded Oklahomans to the hospital, Civil Air Patrol damage-assessment teams were on the job. As storm clouds parted, a ground team sped to Midwest City, dodging turned over cars on the interstate, storm debris and downed power lines. Once there, they began going house-to-house, rating the level of damage suffered to every home and business in the tornado-stricken neighborhoods.  CAP volunteers delivered its first damage-assessment reports to the Oklahoma emergency operations center Monday night. These initial damage-assessments factor heavily in Presidential Declarations of Disaster Areas.  ""We're working closely with the Office of Emergency Services, Red Cross and other agencies, assessing damage and assisting in every way possible,"" says Col. Virginia Keller, Oklahoma Wing Commander.   Civil Air Patrol volunteers began plotting a damage-assessment plan while hunkered down in a storm shelter on Tinker Air Force Base.   ""Tornado alarms sounded just about the time our weekly meeting was to start,"" says Mission Coordinator Mark Weiser. ""Tinker officials herded us into a shelter and we started planning our operations there.""  As soon as the alarms subsided, CAP ground teams were dispatched to damaged areas, surveying homes and businesses and interviewing residents. In neighborhoods where street signs were blown away, the ground teams studied special maps to navigate through the maze of unmarked streets.   Emergency-response officials quickly secured devastated neighborhoods and tasked two Civil Air Patrol ground teams to manage entry. In one neighborhood, CAP volunteers issued 1,400 passes in four hours, bringing a sense of order from chaos that reigned after the storm.   On Tuesday, CAP members assisted the Red Cross and Salvation Army in distributing potable water and food to families scavenging personal belongings from the remains of their homes. Other ground teams continued assessing damage in Chickasha, Moore, and Mulhall.  On Wednesday, Oklahoma CAP flew National Institute of Standards and Technology engineers over schools, hospitals, bridges to evaluate how engineered structures withstood tornadic forces. On Wednesday and Thursday, CAP pilots flew officials from the National Weather Service over the damaged areas.   ""The flights provided by CAP are very helpful in determining the extent and magnitude of the damage caused by tornadoes,"" says Mac McLaughlin, chief meteorologist services for the National Weather Service Southern Region. ""Viewing damage from the air helps us determine the number of tornadoes and the paths they took,"" McLaughlin explains.  NWS will also use photographs taken from the air in detailed research that compares radar signatures of the storms to damage that occurs on the ground. Civil Air Patrol can get meteorologists to places inaccessible by other means. ""We have used CAP in following every major tornado outbreak,"" says McLaughlin. ""CAP pilots go out their way to cover areas that require a second look.""  Civil Air Patrol disaster relief efforts are expected to continue through early next week.  Civil Air Patrol, the official Air Force Auxiliary, is a nonprofit organization. It performs more than 85% of inland search and rescue missions tasked by the Air Force Rescue Coordination Center in the continental United States.

The ceremony will be held at Air              Station Kodiak, Hangar 1 from 8:30 a.m. until 9:45 a.m. Awards include              Meritorious Unit and Team Commendations,               Air Medals and C-130 and H-60 Awards.              “Alaskans are rightfully proud of the Coast Guard men and women              who every day risk and inconvenience             themselves to save lives. These awards honor the extraordinary talents              and bravery of Alaska’s Coast Guard             members,” stated Lieutenant Governor Leman.              The 180-foot fishing boat, named Galaxy, exploded 35 miles south              of St. Paul and had 26 crew on board. In             20-foot seas and winds exceeding 25 knots, the dead-in-the-water vessel              came abeam the wind-line, which             caused it to roll 30 degrees to each side and pitch violently. Chemicals              onboard the crippled ship launched             fireballs into the air, making an overhead rescue approach impossible.              The crew was finally rescued after Aviation             Survival Technician Third Class Jason Quinn was hoisted into the water              at the stern of the boat. Quinn had the             Galaxy crewmen jump in the water one at a time so he could place them              in the recovery basket; 23 crewmen             survived.              Governor Murkowski recognized Quinn in his January State of the State              Address.                                                                                                                            ###                                                                                                               Contact:                        Nona Wilson ,                      465-4084                                                                                                                                                                                           released 3/5/03            click on image                                                             Permanent Fund Status                                           Division of Motor Vehicles                                           State Troopers – DIAL 911                                                                         Fish                  & Game,   Licenses                                                       Doing Business in Alaska                                           Public Notices legal, bids                                           State Employee Directory                                           Alaska Marine Highway                                                                               Office of the Governor                                           Lieutenant Governor                                           Alaska Legislature                                           Alaska Court System                                           Alaska Facts & Visitor Info                                           Alaska Photo Library                                           Alaska Communities                                           Alaska Seafood Marketing                                                                                        Text Only    Services    Departments    PFD    myAlaska    Webmaster

Tech. Sgt. Lex Goan regularly works one of the special                       posts patrolling a huge area outside the base perimeter                       that includes fields, rivers, woods and most importantly,                       some local villages.                       “I’ve never had a deployment where I was doing                       something like this on this scale,” said Goan. “This                       is awesome. We may be the first and only Americans that                       a lot of the people in the villages will ever meet. It’s                       our responsibility to make a good impression.”                       Shortly after a recent patrol left the base gate, it was                       apparent the locals knew who they were. Almost everyone                       waved, and most signaled for the team to stop and visit.                       After a conversation using an accompanying interpreter,                       the patrol moved on through a maze of fields and wooded                       trails.                       “It’s real easy to get lost here,” said                       Goan. “That’s why we keep the same person out                       here.                       “Also, knowledge of the area is vital for noticing                       something out of place,” he said.                       As soon as the patrol stopped at the first of three villages,                       children raced to the vehicle, waving and shouting. When                       they got to the truck, they stopped and looked at the security                       forces in amazement with wide eyes and dropped jaws. They                       did not jump on the truck or ask for anything, they simply                       waited for the team to start the conversation.                       “Who wants some candy,” asked Goan as he pulled                       a large bag from the back of the vehicle. “I’ll                       trade you for your bike,” he playfully told one of                       the boys, who readily agreed.                       While Goan handed out candy and the children asked him                       questions, one boy was excited to explain who the small,                       shy girl with him was.                       “My sister. My sister,” the boy told them                       as he pointed to the girl, who was turning her head in                       embarrassment.                       After visiting with the children, the patrol headed toward                       another village. The terrain was rough and only a Humvee                       could get through it, Goan said.                                                                                                                        The next village was no different than                     the first. Children race to the Humvee and waited for the                     airmen to get out and talk.                      “The kids are always excited to                     see us,” said Airman 1st Class David O’Connor. “They                     crowd around and we give them candy and water. It’s                     neat to see.”                    During the stop, a local farmer recognized Goan and stopped                     his horse-drawn wagon so he and his son could talk for a                     bit. He explained that he was on his way to the market to                     sell the calf because he needed some money.                      While Goan was petting the calf and talking to the farmer,                     one of the patrol members pulled out a camera. The children                     quickly gathered and begged to get their pictures taken with                     the airmen.                      “They know us,” O’Connor explained. “If                     they see a new face, they ask who you are. They were real                     curious about the Danish cop we had with us because his uniform                     was different. They’re good with recognizing faces.”                     O’Connor said working the patrol is not possible for                     every security forces airman. The patrol has a special weapons                     requirement, and those who are qualified rotate through the                     post to give everyone a chance to gain some experience.                     “A lot of the younger (airman) we bring out here tell                     me they feel sorry for the people,” said Goan. “I                     tell them I don’t because the people don’t feel                     sorry for themselves. They’re very proud, happy and                     family-oriented people. They may not have all the commercial                     goods that we have at home, but they don’t know about                     life with those things, so they can’t possible notice                     not having them.”                     The patrol spent some more time with the children and headed                     back into the woods toward the base. The day was another                     success in providing force protection and building relationships                     in the local area.                     “Primarily, we are here for force protection,” said                     Tech. Sgt. Patrick Thompson. “We’re also letting                     the community know that we’re not all bad guys the                     way we’re portrayed.”                     Since he began working the post in early May, Goan said                     nothing out of the ordinary has happened on his shift.                     “For the most part, the people we talk to are happy                     to have us here,” he said. “I haven’t had                     any kind of conflict with anyone, and I think our presence                     works as a deterrent to those who might be thinking of doing                     the base harm.”                                                                                                                          Printer-friendly Version                                                         Email A Copy                                                                                                                                                       Ballistic          Missile Defense  |  Defense          Department Overview  |  Joint          Chiefs of Staff CENTCOM           |  EUCOM           |  JFCOM           |  NORAD           |  NORTHCOM           |  PACOM           |  SOCOM           |  STRATCOM       |  SOUTHCOM          |  TRANSCOM            Maps           |  Recruiting           |  Today's          Military  |  DoDBusOpps            Home  |  Privacy          & Security  |  Disclaimer           |  About Us  |  Contact          Us  |  Link to Us  |  Search

Cook, noncommissioned officer-in-charge, personnel administration, and awards and decorations monitor for Headquarters, Texas Air National Guard, was promoted last month here at Camp Mabry. She began her military career in 1973 when she enlisted in the U. S. Air Force. She completed Basic Military Training at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio and the administration technical school at Keesler Air Force Base, Miss., and was assigned to the 4018th Combat Crew Training Squadron at Carswell Air Force Base in Fort Worth, Texas, as the commander's secretary. Cook served for more than 14 years on active duty, crosstraining into the air traffic control career field to work as a radar controller and then back to the administrative career field. Her assignments included tours at Aviano Air Base, Italy; Sheppard Air Force Base, Texas; Zaragoza Air Base, Spain; and, Mather Air Force Base, Calif. Cook initially transferred to the Texas Air National Guard in July 1987 through the PALACE CHASE program and was assigned as an administrative specialist in the 221st Combat Communications Squadron, at Garland Air Guard Station, Texas. She transferred to the Air Force Reserve in September 1988 and worked for the next three years as an intelligence administrative specialist and information management specialist for various squadrons in the  NCOIC continued on page 3...   2 Legislative and Legal Updates Status of bills for lowering age of non-regular military retired pay WASHINGTON  The current status is identified for the following bills, introduced in House and Senate, related to reducing the age for military retired pay. HR 3831 -- would reduce the age for receipt of military retired pay for non-regular service from 60 to 55. It has 122 co-sponsors and was referred to the House Subcommittee on Milita ry Person nel. HR 4676 -- would provide that military retired pay for non-regular service shall be paid without regard to the age of a person otherwise eligible for such retired pay, rather than commencing when an otherwise eligible person attains age 60. It has 21 co-sponsors and was referred to the House committee/subcommittee for actions. Executive comment was requested from DOD. S 2250 -- would reduce from 60 to 55 the minimum age for the receipt of military retired pay for nonregular (reserve) service. It was read twice and referred to the Senate Committee on Armed Services.  Presidential advisors threaten concurrent receipt From Armed Forces News WASHINGTON -- The fiscal 2003 National Defense Authorization Act is likely to overturn the requirement that military retirees--the only group of federal or civilian retirees so affected--must forfeit one dollar of retired pay for each dollar of disability compensation they are awarded by the Department of Veterans Affairs. The House's version of the act would phase out the forfeiture over five years for veterans disabled 60 percent or higher. The Senate's version would simply toss it out completely, and allow all disabled veterans to receive disability payments along with their earned retirement income. But senior Administration officials have advised President Bush to veto either version. Veterans' organizations vehemently oppose the forcing military retirees to forfeit their retired pay in exchange for VA disability compensation. In addition, 82 senators and 395 House members are cosponsors of legislation to repeal the 100-year-old law. Nevertheless, on June 19 the Office of Management and Budget said that for reasons of ""fiscal discipline"" the President's senior advisors would recommend that he veto the entire fiscal 2003 National Defense Authorization Act if it contained either of the concurrent receipt plans. The written statement asserted that the action ""is contrary to the long-standing principle that no one should be able to receive concurrent retirement benefits and disability benefits based upon the same service."" It added, ""All federal compensation systems aim for an equitable percentage of income replacement in the case of either work-related injury or retirement.""  Mobilized Guard may gain Relief From Armed Forces News WASHINGTON -- The Senate Veterans Affairs Committee is supporting a bill that extends the protections of the Soldiers and Sailors Civil Relief Act to members of the National Guard who have been mobilized by state governors for service in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. The legislation would protect them from being evicted from their homes or having their homes foreclosed due to their inability to pay because of pay cuts incurred when they were mobilized. It also will place a ceiling on interest rates that their creditors can charge while they are on active duty.  Status of DoD authorization and appropriations acts From the National Guard Bureau Legislative Liaison WASHINGTON -- The FY2003 National Defense Authorization Act (HR 4546), which passed the House in May, passed the Senate S 2514 during the last week of June. The FY2003 Defense Appropriations Act (HR 5010) passed the House during the last week of June but no current information is available for the Senate. The FY2003 Military Construction Appropriations Act (HR 5011) passed the House and the Senate Appropriations Committee prior to the July recess.   3  Total Air Force transformation By Lt. Gen. Daniel James III, director of the Air National Guard WASHINGTON -- Today, our Total Air Force continues to ""transform"" itself and maintain a robust presence in the war on terrorism. Although the definitions of transformation vary somewhat with the audience, it clearly involves a deliberate focus on the warfighters and providing the tools they need. The three `leverage' points most often used to describe this transformation are: 1 -- Developing new capabilities-based Concepts of Operations (CONOPS); 2 -- Exploiting advanced technologies; and 3 -- Harnessing innovative organizational changes to enhance efficiency and effectiveness. The implementation of CSAF's ""Task Forces"" across current panel structures (for resource allocations) drives home the point. Programs will no longer compete for resources - capabilities will. The current Air Force shift from a program (XP) focus, to a capabilities (XO) focus emphasizes the importance of this new philosophy. The Air National Guard staff will mirror the Air Force structure to better integrate and influence this new process. Effective 1 Jul 2002, our DO Directorate will become the XO Directorate. Additionally, ANG/AQ will stand down as a directorate and become a division within XO, known as XOR. This action will bring together two of our most talented staffs into a single organization focused on providing the warfighters the tools to succeed. I'm pleased to announce Col. Brock Strom as the new Director for XO. Col. Mark Dougherty will assist with the transition until his retirement later this year. I ask for your support as we continue to adjust our organization to enhance our productivity and relevancy.  ...NCOIC continued from page 1 San Antonio area. After transferring to and working for less than a year as an administrative specialist in the Washington Air National Guard, at Fairchild Air Force Base, Wash., Cook returned to the Texas Air National Guard in San Antonio. She worked as an information management technician for the 149th Services Flight, at Kelly Air Force Base. Cook transferred to the Inactive Ready Reserves in October 1993 when she accompanied her spouse to Spain. Five years later, Cook returned to the U. S. and back into the Texas Air National Guard. She was assigned to the 149th Services Flight, and while waiting for a school date, she was sent on temporary duty to the Headquarters at Camp Mabry to work in the awards and decorations office. She applied and was selected for  the administrative position in July 1998. She also worked as a program analyst in the Counterdrug Program at Camp Mabry reviewing and processing incoming grants for the drug task forces and drug courts. She was selected for the full-time NCOIC, administration, and awards and decorations monitor, an AGR position, at Headquarters, Texas Air National Guard in July 1999. Throughout her career, Cook increased her knowledge, expanded her skills, and enhanced her abilities in the administrative career field that evolved into expertise and professionalism as a noncommissioned officer. Her major awards and decorations include the Meritorious Service Medal, Air Force Commendation Medal, Air Force Achievement Medal, other Air Force awards, and several Texas National Guard medals.  SGLI cap may quadruple From Armed Forces News WASHINGTON -- The House Veterans Affairs Committee is considering a bill by Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Ill., that would kick the current cap on the Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance program from $250,000 to $1 million. Under the bill, service members would be offered increments of $500,000, $750,000, or $1 million at a monthly cost of about 8 cents per $1,000 in coverage. This would raise the maximum monthly rates from $20 for $250,000 in coverage to $80 for the $1 million death benefit. To prevent a surge of signups for top coverage just before combat deployments, implementation would start with a 30-day window, after which restrictions would be imposed.   4  Commentary: AEF--It won't work if you're not ready by Maj. Gen. Timothy A. Peppe Special assistant to the chief of staff for air and space expeditionary forces WASHINGTON (AFPN) -- You've heard it said many times: our Air Force is expeditionary. What does this mean? Quite simply, that the Air Force is organized and prepared for military operations abroad, and that everyone of us is a warrior and should be ready to go anywhere on the planet to fight our nation's battles. While the great majority of our people are ready, we continue to see a large number of personnel reporting for duty in an area of responsibility without all prerequisites accomplished. All of us--officer, enlisted and civilian; active duty, Reserve and Guard--must take ownership of our expeditionary culture. While the air and space expeditionary force concept ensures the Air Force is capable of providing rapidly responsive, need-specific, aerospace power, prepared to conduct military operations across the full spectrum of combat, it simply won't work if we aren't ready. Being ready to deploy means a lot of things. I like to break them down into three areas--being trained, staying healthy and taking care of your family. If you take care of these three, our Air Force will always win. First are the obvious preparations, the ones that train you to fight. These include chemical warfare defense training, weapons qualification, self-aid and buddy care, a law of armed conflict review and antiterrorism training, to name just a few. People in your local readiness unit will tell you what training you need for your particular deployment. Readiness also means staying healthy. Are your immunization records complete? Are you exercising several times a week? Are you eating a nutritious and balanced diet? Are you limiting your tobacco and alcohol use? The Air Force mission is to defend the United States and protect its interests through aerospace power. We can't do that if you're not healthy. Finally, there's the third category of preparations, the one that is sometimes less obvious but no less important--taking care of your family. This means a lot of things. It means talking to your spouse and kids to make sure they are mentally prepared for you to leave. It also means making sure your will is up to date, that your family's identification cards are current, and that the DoD sticker on the family car is valid. It's up to you to make sure these, and all the other little details your family is counting on, are taken care of before you step on that plane. While readiness is a personal responsibility, commanders, first sergeants and supervisors play a vital role. If you're one of these people, you should ask yourself some questions. Do your people know what AEF they are assigned to? Have you made sure they are trained and ready? Is their equipment ready? If you answered no to any of these questions, you need to get to work, and get to work now. Lastly, the major command vice commanders are meeting on a bimonthly basis to review ongoing operational demands, efforts to increase the number of eligible airmen to deploy and rotation cycles. The Air Staff is aware and concerned about the increased operational tempo and is committed to keeping predictability and stability in the lives of our airmen and their families. Our Air Force has always done extraordinary things, and our expeditionary approach to warfighting has only enhanced our ability to succeed. The AEF will surely carry us through this century, but only if we take it upon ourselves to make it work by being prepared.  AEF schedules remaining the same by Tech. Sgt. Scott Elliott WASHINGTON (AFPN) -- The air and space expeditionary force concept was a major topic of discussion at the recent Corona meeting in Colorado Springs, Colo., most notably on the lengths and numbers of existing AEF deployments. Bottom line -- the current AEF deployment alignment will remain the same, said the special assistant to the vice chief of staff for AEFs. This means 10 AEFs divided into five pairs, with 90-day temporary duty assignments for a 15-month total cycle length. The exception to that policy would be for ""stressed"" career fields where some individuals, based upon current requirements, will be told to deploy as long as 179 days. ""Clearly our intent is to fix these stressed career fields as soon as possible so that the 90-day policy is a reality for all,"" said Maj. Gen. Timothy Peppe said. ""We are expeditionary,"" Peppe said. ""We need to be ready to deploy -- ready to project our forces anywhere, any time.""   5  Important June dates in founding a diverse military 1899  Benjamin O.

""There is no American race; there's only an American creed. This creed of freedom and quality has lifted the lives of millions of Americans, of citizens by birth and citizens by choice. This creed draws our friends to us, it sets our enemies against us, and always inspires the best that is within us. In this 226th year of our independence, we have seen that American patriotism is still a living faith. We love our country only more when she's threatened."" --President George W. Bush ""To laugh often and much; to win the respect of intelligent people and the affection of children; to earn the appreciation of honest critics and endure the betrayal of false friends; to appreciate beauty; to find the best in others; to leave the world a bit better, whether by a healthy child, a garden patch or a redeemed social condition; to know even one life has breathed easier because you have lived. This is to have succeeded. "" --Ralph Waldo Emerson, writer and philosopher (1803-1882)   6  Caution urged using nutritional supplements By Lt. Gen. B. B. Bell, commanding general U.S. Army Headquarters III Corps and Fort Hood, Texas FORT HOOD, Texas -- Recently, a soldier died tragically here during physical training from an apparent fatal cardiac event. He was likely taking a nutritional supplement containing a combination of the herbs Ma Huang and Guarana. Also, another soldier was treated in the Darnall Emergency Dept. from a heat related injury during physical training. That soldier was taking a similar supplement. Nutritional supplements marketed as weight loss products, performance enhancers, or ""fat burners"" may contain potentially dangerous ingredients, that given the right conditions may result in permanent injury or death. Of particular concern is the use of these substances with strenuous exercise. Unfortunately, nutritional supplements are unregulated by the Food and Drug Administration. Of concern are the supplements containing Ma Huang or Ephedra, which is a naturally occurring form of the drug Ephdrine. These two are powerful stimulants to the heart, our metabolism and the central nervous system. Guarana, another stimulant, is a naturally occurring caffeine-line substance. Both Ma Huang and Guarana, either alone or in combination, can induce fatal heart rhythms under the right conditions. They have been associated with a number of deaths, including a soldier here several years ago. Ephedra also interferes with the body's temperatureregulating mechanism, predisposing users to heatrelated injuries. Clinical studies have shown that this combination significantly increases heart rate, body core temperature, and blood pressure; a potentially dangerous combination, according to the medical journal, American Family Physician, the Journal of the American Medical Association, and others. I ask commanders and leaders at all levels to identify their soldiers (and airmen) using these supplements and strongly discourage their use under any circumstances. They absolutely should not be used during strenuous activity, and/or in elevated heat conditions. The combination could be fatal. I encourage you to contact your unit's command surgeon (or air surgeon) for further information. You may also visit http://familydoctor.org for further information related to supplements. In the end the best approach to physical conditioning is the old fashioned way  hard and supervised physical readiness trainin g with no  no -- artificial stimulants/enhancers.  Officials launch online Gulf War research library WASHINGTON (AFPN) -- Officials from the Department of Defense, Department of Veterans Affairs and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, an agency of the Department of Health and Human Services, announced the launch of an Internet site June 18 called Medsearch, a central repository of Gulf War-related medical research. Medsearch can be found on the Internet at http://www.GulfLINK.osd.mil/medsearch ""This Web site, a cooperative effort in support of Gulf War veterans and their families, reflects the commitment of all three agencies to learning more about deployment-related illnesses and sharing what we learn,"" said Dr. William Winkenwerder Jr., assistant secretary of defense for health affairs. In July 2001, the DOD, VA and CDC agreed to combine their resources to create this one-stop source of research information. The development team worked with veterans and researchers to ensure that Medsearch was user-friendly. Developers designed the Web site to serve the needs of both the layperson and the researcher. The site is indexed with plain language topic headings so that anyone can readily locate information. Those headings include topics of particular interest to Gulf War veterans that may not be featured in other sources, such as pesticides and depleted uranium. Scientists who want more specific data will find it on Medsearch as well. The goal of Medsearch's creators is to place all the federally funded research into the illnesses of Gulf War veterans in one centralized place. The site will be updated frequently to ensure it contains the most recent and complete information available.   7  VA contacting Project SHAD veterans From Armed Forces News WASHINGTON -- The Department of Veterans Affairs is contacting participants in military tests involving biological and chemical warfare materials during the 1960s about medical care and benefits to which they may be entitled. Initial notifications went to 622 of some 4,300 veterans identified so far as participants in Project SHAD (Shipboard Hazard and Defense). The SHAD tests were conducted to determine the effectiveness of shipboard detection and protective measures against chemical and biological threats and to determine the potential risk to American forces. Medically significant information from twelve tests has been declassified and released to the VA: Autumn Gold, Copper Head, Shady Grove, Eager Belle (phases I and II), and Scarlet Sage, Fearless Johnny, Flower Drum (phases I and II), DTC Test 68-50, DTC Test 6932, and Purple Sage. Additional letters will be sent as more test reports are declassified. Veterans concerned should call 1-800-749-8387 or e-mail shadhelpline@vba.va.gov.  TRICARE Operation Fraud Watch From Armed Forces News WASHINGTON -- Since 1998, the Program Integrity Office and the Office of the Inspector General Defense Criminal Investigative Service (DCIS) have worked together to identify and prosecute cases of TRICARE fraud, waste and abuse. For 2001, the dollar amount recovered and returned to DoD as a result of successful prosecution of fraudulent TRICARE payments made to providers was $11.3 million. The TMA Program Integrity Office refers its provider fraud cases to the DCIS and collaborates with other federal, state and local government agencies to provide technical assistance and expert witness testimony as required for cases being prosecuted. TRICARE beneficiaries are also key players in assisting the Defense department with wiping out fraud, waste and abuse. A provision of the Federal Civil False Claims Act known as ""qui tam,"" allows private citizens to file lawsuits in the name of the U.S. government to recover lost revenue as a result of fraud. To report TRICARE fraud, beneficiaries can write to: TRICARE Management Activity Attn: Program Integrity Office 16401 East Centertech Parkway Aurora, CO, 80011-9043; or send a fax to (303) 676-3981. Additional information on TRICARE fraud, waste and abuse is available on the TRICARE Website.  New rule to expedite claims appeals for oldest vets By Tanya N. Ballard, Government Executive Magazine WASHINGTON -- Older veterans with pending benefit claims appeals could find their files pushed to the top of the stack, under a proposed rule published by the Veterans Affairs Department in the Federal Register last week. Veterans who find fault with the Veterans Benefits Administration's decisions on disability compensation, pensions and survivors' benefits can appeal the decisions to the Board of Veterans' Appeals. According to VA, appeals are handled on a ""first come, first served"" basis, a method that may not best serve the oldest veterans. Under the proposed rule, VA would allow the Board of Veterans' Appeals to push pending appeals for veterans age 75 and older to the top of the docket. VA officials chose to focus on that age bracket because those veterans have shorter life expectancies. ""It represents a segment of the veteran population 18 percentlarge enough to provide meaningful relief, but not so large as to dilute the general rule of first come, first served,"" the agency said in the notice. ""This change is necessary to speed the appellate process for the large group of aging veterans."" VBA has long been criticized for its speed in processing claims. Based on recommendations from a special task force, VBA last November created a special ""tiger team"" to close out claims more than 1 year old. By the end of May, the team had processed more than 10,000 claims, the majority of them for veterans older than 70.   8  War on terrorism ""From the very beginning, the President has made clear that there is no neutral ground in the fight against terror. Those who harbor and support terrorists are themselves guilty of terrorism, and they can expect to be held accountable. This lesson has already been learned in Afghanistan, where the terror camps have been destroyed, and the Taliban regime is out of business, permanently. Afghanistan, however, is only the beginning of a long and unrelenting effort. For the same reason we are vigilant at home, we must be resolute abroad. It is not fast or easy work to confront a terror network that has cells in 60 or more countries. We have to do this job with the tools of diplomacy, finance, intelligence, law enforcement, and military power. But we are going to shut down terrorist camps wherever they are ... and disrupt terrorist plans ... and find the terrorists one by one, and bring them to justice."" --Vice President Dick Cheney ""The threat posed by Al Qaeda will test the international community... to the limit."" --Rohan Gunaratna, author of Inside Al Qaeda: Global Network of Terror ""Terrorist groups seek biological weapons. We know some rogue states already have them. It is important that we confront these real threats to our country and prepare for future emergencies. Protecting our citizens against bioterrorism is an urgent duty of America."" --President George W. Bush ""The road ahead will be long and sometimes bumpy. Deadly attacks may take place again at any time. Like those Americans who gathered in Philadelphia in 1776 to sign the Declaration of Independence, Americans today are united and ready to make the sacrifice necessary to defend our liberties and the enemy -- from the enemies of freedom."" -- Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld ""We're in for a long struggle in this war on terror. And there are people that still want to harm America. And we have an obligation to our citizens to work together to do everything we can to protect the people. That commitment is shared by Republican and Democrat alike, and I'm thankful for the leadership that the members here have shown. And I'm thankful for the good ideas that have been shared with our administration as we developed our vision of the Department of Homeland Security."" --President George W. Bush ""We must eliminate the threat that he (Iraq dictator Saddam Hussein) poses to the region and our own security. I stand ready to work with this administration to build an effective policy to terminate the threat posed by this regime."" --House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo. ""So many people put the world now in `pre-9/11' and `post 9/11.' There have been extraordinary changes since 9/11 with that exact intent -- to prevent future attacks on Americans. There is increased coordination and fusion of the intel gathering and how it is used an d how it is analyzed. There is increased security at our borders and ports around the country.

The Air Force Campaign Medal will recognize significant direct contributions to wartime operations, according to Secretary of the Air Force Dr. James G. Roche. ""The awarding of campaign medals to specially recognize people and units who fight our wars is a longstanding military tradition,"" Roche said. ""Historically, the Department of Defense's criteria for such awards have centered on geography to define the area of combat operations,"" he said. ""In light of the expeditionary aerospace force environment and the transformation in the way the Air Force carries out its missions today, such criteria doesn't allow us to appropriately recognize our people who contribute directly and significantly to the success of wartime campaigns from outside the area of combat operations."" Therefore, in accordance with DOD policy, Roche authorized the creation of a medal to be given to Air Force people who are not eligible for a DOD campaign medal but directly supported combat operations from a location outside the geographic area of operations. The secretary said he also wants to ensure units are properly recognized for their actions in support of wartime efforts and has established two new Air Force unit awards. The first award, the Gallant Unit Citation, will recognize units for their significant combat heroism below that currently required for the Presidential Unit Citation. The second, the Meritorious Unit Award, will honor units for their outstanding achievement in direct support of combat operations. The specific design and criteria for the new medal and awards are currently being reviewed, and a final decision on what they will look like and who is authorized to wear them will be reached in the next few months, Roche said.   10  July UTA Schedule of Events Uniform  Short sleeve blue shirt Saturday Time 0730-0745 0800-0830 1130-1200 1400-1445 1500-1600 1615  13 July 2002 -- Duty Hours: 0730-1615 Activities Roll Call SAV planning meeting Lunch Awards Ceremony Physical conditioning Dismissal Location Conference Room Conference Room Dining Hall Building 8 Track Building 9 Awards NCO Officer/NCO First Sgt.

Pentagon Comptroller Dov Zakheim and a task force of defense leaders came up with 25 recommendations, all of which must be approved by the Office Management and Budget and Pentagon lawyers. Some would also need Congressional action. Civil laws already on the books let the Pentagon go after proven a b u s e r s fo r pe n a lt ie s of u p t o $5,000. The task force focused on two types of cards: the government purchase card with which, typically, employees can buy single items $2,500 or less, and the travel card, used to pay for things like hotels and meals during official travel. As of April, 3.4 percent of purchase cards are delinquent and 6.9 percent individual travel cards are delinquent--double the typical 3 percent to 4 percent delinquent commercial accounts. About 1.4 million defense employees hold individual travel cards, and in fiscal 2001, racked up $2.1 billion in charges. The use of purchase cards has saved the department about $900 million over the past eight years by cutting out the middleman and letting end-users buy directly from vendors"

The USCG, along with the 210th Rescue Squadron of the Alaska Air National Guard, the U.S. Air Force, and the fishing vessels Glacier Bay, Blue Pacific, and Clipper Express, searched for over 50 hours for the two missing men before the USCG suspended its search at 7 p.m. Tuesday, 22 October 2002. Tragically, a crewman from the Clipper Express, assisting in the 6 Mariners Weather Log   Galaxy Explodes  The USGC Cutter Jarvis based in Honolulu Hawaii, was in the area and sent its H-65 ""Dolphin"" helicopter to assist in the rescue. As the weather turned foul during the rescue, it soon became apparent that the helicopter would be unable to return to the Jarvis, so the H-65's crew landed in St. Paul and spent the night. Details regarding what caused the explosion had not been released at the time this issue was in production.  The Galaxy still smokes from the fire that engulfed it.

Grisafe, USCG (907) 463-2000 NOAA SATELLITES HELP SAVE MAN, SON, AND THEIR DOG FROM GULF OF ALASKA WATERS A father, his son, and their dog were rescued from a life raft floating in the Gulf of Alaska, 90 miles southeast of Cordova, Alaska, on Friday thanks to environmental satellites in the international Search and Rescue Satellite-Aided Tracking Program, Cospas-Sarsat, and to the U.S. Coast Guard. The three had abandoned their sinking fishing vessel. Satellites operated by the Commerce Department's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and by the Russian government, detected a distress signal from the vessel. The vessel was sinking after striking a large object, and the people and dog onboard were adrift in a life raft when a Coast Guard helicopter from Cordova, Alaska came to their aid. As the vessel sank, its 406 MHz emergency position-indicating radio beacon (EPIRB) was manually activated. The signal was detected by the Cospas-Sarsat system, and NOAA's U.S. Mission Control Center notified the Coast Guard. The Coast Guard received the EPIRB signal from NOAA at 5:04 a.m., alerting them of a possible distress in the Gulf. Using the upto-date information registered to the activated EPIRB, the Coast Guard determined that Jim Bingman, 39, his son Justin Bingman, 13, and their dog Honey were steaming from Kodiak to Ketchikan in their 32-foot fishing vessel, Reaper. A Kodiak-based helicopter crew, staged in Cordova, launched at 6:30 a.m. to search for the three. ""Because they had current registration information, we were able to quickly determine the route they (Bingmans) were taking, the number of people on board, and their vessel's description,"" said Petty Officer Doug Green, of the 17th Coast Guard District Rescue Coordination Center in Juneau. ""You'd be amazed at how much having that information helps us do our job."" All EPIRBs in the United States must be registered with NOAA's search and rescue program office. - more -   -2The helicopter crew located the Bingmans in a life raft at 7:40 a.m. The crew lowered 22-year-old rescue swimmer Petty Officer Chris Mann to conduct his first rescue. Mann rescued the three from their life raft and swam them to the rescue basket one at a time as Petty Officer Jeff Kaschalk hoisted them into the helicopter. ""The dog was the most difficult to rescue out of the three,"" said Mann. ""He didn't want to get in the water. I grabbed a hold of the dog, he put his paws on my arm, and I swam him to the rescue basket,"" said Mann. ""The Bingmans did 90 percent of the work of being prepared by having a registered 406 EPIRB, having survival suits on, and having their life raft ready,"" said Coast Guard pilot Lt. Cmdr. Guy Pearce. ""When you see that, it takes a lot of stress out of the rescue because it means these guys are well prepared."" ""The Search and Rescue satellite system is truly a humanitarian program,"" said Ajay Mehta, manager of NOAA's Sarsat program. ""To date over 14,000 lives have been saved from boating and aviation accidents around world."" The Cospas-Sarsat system uses a constellation of satellites in geostationary and polar orbits to detect and locate emergency beacons on vessels and aircraft in distress. NOAA's National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NOAA Satellite and Information Service) represents the United States in this program, providing satellite platforms and ground equipment, and operating the U.S. Mission Control Center. NOAA's Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES) can instantly detect emergency signals. The polar-orbiting satellites in the system detect emergency signals as they circle the Earth from pole to pole. Emergency signals are sent to the U.S. Mission Control Center at NOAA's facility in Suitland, Md., then automatically sent to rescue forces around the world. Today there are 35 countries participating in the system. September of this year marks the 20th anniversary of the first Sarsat rescue. NOAA's Satellite and Information Service is the nation's primary source of space-based meteorological and climate data. NOAA's Satellite and Information Service operates the nation's environmental satellites, which are used for weather forecasting, climate monitoring, and other environmental applications such as fire detection, ozone monitoring, and sea surface temperature measurements. NOAA's Satellite and Information Service also operates three data centers, which house global data bases in climatology, oceanography, solid earth geophysics, marine geology and geophysics, solar-terrestrial physics, and paleoclimatology.

GX031-60-6451491	CIVIL AIR PATROL HISTORY AND MISSIONS            AN AVIATION ORIENTED     ORGANIZATION FOR MEN,   WOMEN, BOYS AND     GIRLS                               Welcome  to the history/missions page of       the Civil Air Patrol Aerospace Education Web Site. My name is Lt. Col.       Peter Morris. I am the commander of Group 1 which includes all Search and       Rescue Squadrons in southern, Arizona.  I have been chosen to be your       guide for a brief tour of the history of the Civil Air Patrol.  Welcome       Aboard! .            The Civil Air Patrol was organized on December 1, 1941,       as part of the U.S. Office of Civilian Defense. During World War II, its       members provided orientation flights to thousands of prospective aviation       cadets and recruits. Members flew more than 24 million miles on coastal       patrol. They summoned help for 91 ships in distress and 363 survivors of       submarine attacks. Patrol crews spotted 173 enemy submarines, dropped       bombs or depth charges on 57 of them and received credit for sinking or       seriously damaging at least two. Others were destroyed by planes and ships       summoned by Civil Air Patrol radios.            Civil Air Patrol crews flew many other wartime missions,       including a courier service for airlift of personnel and light cargo;       target-towing and tracking flights for training anti-aircraft gunners;       power line and pipeline surveillance; forest fire patrol; and patrol along       the southern U.S. border. Sixty-four members died while performing wartime       operations.            The organization became a permanent peacetime       institution on July 1, 1946. On that date, President Harry S. Truman       signed Public Law 476 of the 79th Congress, incorporating Civil air Patrol       in its present form.            Civil Air Patrol became a permanent civilian auxiliary       of the U.S. Air Force in May 1948 with the enactment of Public Law 557 of       the 80th Congress.            MISSIONS            As the official auxiliary of the Air Force, Civil Air       Patrol has three principal missions-emergency services including       communications, aerospace education and training, and a cadet training and       motivation program.            EMERGENCY SERVICES            This is the Civil Air Patrol's best know activity. It       entails air search and rescue, local disaster relief, as well as       cooperation with the assistance to civil defense agencies. Civil Air       Patrol members fly three out of every four hours flown on search and       rescue missions directed by the Air Force Rescue and Coordination Center       at Scott Air Force Base, Ill. The center coordinates search and rescue       efforts within the inland search and rescue region (48 contiguous states).       Civil Air Patrol is also active in Alaska where it is directed in its       search operations by the Alaskan Air Command Rescue Coordination Center.       In Hawaii, the patrol works under the direction of the Pacific Air Forces       Joint Rescue Coordination Center. In Puerto Rico, Civil Air Patrol works       in cooperation with the U.S. Coast Guard and local civil authorities.            In the last five years, Civil Air Patrol crews have been       involved in nearly 5,000 search and rescue or other emergency service       missions. during this time, these volunteers were credited with saving the       lives of approximately 400 persons and with locating the objects of their       searches nearly 2,500 times. These missions required more than 91,000       hours of flying time.            Civil Air Patrol, as well as members who fly their own       airplanes on these missions, are reimbursed by the Air Force for fuel, oil       and communications expenses. In addition, the air force now provides some       reimbursement for maintenance costs for these as well as for certain       authorized training missions.            Often, Civil Air Patrol members also help out in       disaster relief work as well as search and rescue. These missions may       involve airlifting blood, medication and civil or relief officials to       disaster areas. The missions may also involve air surveillance of disaster       areas, as well as the air evacuation of the stranded, sick or injured.       Rescue work and aid are provided during floods, hurricanes and other       emergencies.            Civil Air Patrol also maintains a nationwide network of       short-wave radio stations. The network provides an invaluable backup to       state and local civil defense communications. Locally, the stations       support state disaster plans includes Civil Air Patrol communications,       search and rescue and other disaster relief missions.            AEROSPACE EDUCATION            Civil Air Patrol aerospace education programs help       inform the public about air and space matters. Over the past 30 years,       Civil Air Patrol has supported about 4,000 aerospace education workshops       for teachers and education officials at more than 250 colleges and       universities around the country. these programs have prepared nearly       200,000 teachers to teach aerospace education courses in their schools or       to use information on these subjects to enrich the usual classroom       subjects.            Other important services offered to the educational       community include assistance in curriculum planning at all levels and       educational materials for use by teachers in their classrooms. Civil Air       Patrol's Center for Aerospace Education Development develops, publishes       and distributes materials to teachers. These materials range from       pamphlets and activity booklets to a complete high school elective course.       They are produced and sold at cost far below commercially available       products.            Civil Air Patrol keeps in close contact with education       departments at all levels and with agencies such as the Federal Aviation       Administration, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, National       Air and Space Museum and the Air Force Association. these contacts promote       and expand aerospace education in the nations schools. Also, the patrol       provides yearly scholarship funds to cadet and senior members. These funds       help finance college studies in engineering, the humanities, education,       science and other fields relating to air and space.            THE CIVIL AIR PATROL     CADET PROGRAM            The cadet program is designed to inspire the country's       youth to become leaders and dynamic American citizens through an interest       in flying. Young men and women who are American citizens or permanent       residents may become Civil Air Patrol cadets and participate in the cadet       program. They must have completed the sixth grade or be at least 13 years       old to become members. The maximum age for entering the cadet program is       18.            Cadets take part in a number of programmed and special       activities. From these they develop the knowledge, skills and attitudes       needed to understand the total impact of air and space operations on       society. They learn discipline by studying leadership and by learning       military drill and courtesies. They face critical issues of the times       through discussion and debate, and they become and remain physically fit       through a special physical training program.            Through studies and other activities, cadets work their       way through a series of 15 achievements. As cadets progress, they earn       increased rank, ribbons or certificates. They also become eligible for       nationally sponsored special activities and may compete for academic       scholarships.            Cadets are assigned to squadrons staffed by senior       members who guide and assist them through the program. A popular activity       is the flying program. It promotes an interest in aviation by providing       orientation flights and scholarships to cover flight training through solo       qualification.            The most sought-after activity of advanced cadets is the       International Air Cadet Exchange. Each summer, about 160 cadets and their       adult escorts travel to one or the other of some 20 foreign countries. In       return, cadets from foreign lands visit the United States as guests of       Civil Air Patrol and the Air Force. Such trips promote goodwill and       understanding among the world's youth who share a common interest in       aviation.            Additional activities include cadet summer encampments       at more than 50 U.S. military bases and a cadet officer school. there are       also familiarization courses at Air Training command bases, para-rescue       training, survival training and cadet competitions.            SENIOR MEMBER TRAINING            The senior member training program is a five-level,       structured training and education program designed to prepare seniors to       accomplish Civil Air Patrol's missions by filling leadership positions and       performing specific functions within each unit.             Adult members can learn about flight and air navigation,       public affairs and first aid. Initial training includes aerospace concepts       and moral leadership. Later, senior members can upgrade their skills       through officer training and home study courses. These cover writing and       speaking, principles of learning, methods of managing and teaching and       related subjects.            ORGANIZATION            Civil Air Patrol has a national headquarters at Maxwell       Air Force Base, Alabama, and eight geographical regions, each with from       five to nine wings. There are 52 wings in all, one in each state plus       Puerto Rico and the district of Columbia. Wings are divided into groups,       squadrons and sometimes flights. there are about 1,900 individual units.            A national board governs the organization. The board       includes the national commander, national vice commander and establishes       organizational policy.            The national executive committee, which consists of the       same members as the national board minus the 52 wing commanders, meets at       least twice a year. The committee conducts most of the patrol's affairs.            The executive director, who manages the day-to-day       affairs of the organization at the national level, is an Air Force general       officer named by the secretary of the Air Force. The director has a staff       of Air Force military and civilian personnel, known as Headquarters,       CAP-USAF, which serves as a staff at Civil Air Patrol National       Headquarters, serving in an advisory capacity. They are assigned to Air       Training command.            In addition, some 78 officers, 78 airmen and 16       civilians, all Air Force personnel, are assigned to the 60 regional and       wing offices for liaison duty with Civil Air Patrol. They provide advice       and help the patrol perform its missions.            PERSONNEL            Civil Air Patrol has about 60,000 volunteer members.       They include nearly 23,000 teenage cadets. They wear a uniform similar to       that of the Air Force but with special Civil Air Patrol insignia.            Members fly some 6,800 privately owned aircraft and more       than 600 aircraft owned by Civil Air Patrol. they drive some 1,700 trucks,       jeeps, ambulances and sedans. They also maintain licensed short-wave radio       stations as part of a network of fixed, mobile and airborne systems across       the nation.            Nearly 12,000 senior members are FAA-licensed pilots.       Thousands more are qualified observers and fly on various civil Air Patrol       missions.            Time served in Civil Air Patrol does not count toward       military service-nor does it obligate members to any active military duty.            AIR FORCE ASSISTANCE                  Besides providing an executive director and liaison       officials, the Air Force provides equipment from Department of Defense       excess items. Examples include aircraft and spare parts, motor vehicles,       office supplies, communications equipment, rescue equipment and training       aids.            When it is possible, the Air Force, Air National Guard       and Air Force Reserve provide airlift for many Civil Air Patrol Programs       and, less often, for cadet orientation flights. Air Force and other DOD       agency housing, , medical and dining facilities, classrooms, offices,       dining aids and teachers are also provided to insure the success of Civil       Air Patrol summer encampments. In addition, Air National Guard and Air       Force Reserve personnel also may serve as instructors and advisors to       Civil Air Patrol units.

Vice                    President, The Centre for Counterintelligence and Security Studies                   CI                    Centre Professor David Major has made a 30-year commitment to                    the practice of counterintelligence, having served in top leadership                    roles at the FBI in counterintelligence as a Supervisory Special                    Agent, as well as on the National Security Council as the Director                    of Counterintelligence, Intelligence and Security Programs (photos).                    Major was the first FBI official ever to be appointed to the                    NSC.                                                                                                          During his                  employment at the FBI from 1970 to 1993, Major became a nationally                  recognized counterintelligence and security/countermeasures technical                  expert, strategic planner, practitioner, advocate and spokesman                  for national counterintelligence and security countermeasures                  programs. During his time with the NSC from 1985 to 1987, he was                  involved in every aspect of these disciplines, with extensive                  operational experience at the highest level of government.                                   Major handled                  many joint Department of Defense and FBI double agents in support                  of DoD Special Planning Activities. He handled defectors and the                  recruitment of foreign intelligence officers and agents. Major                  investigated, supervised and was directly or indirectly involved                  in most of the 100 public espionage cases in the last 25 years.                                   While at the                  NSC, Major was responsible for formulating the policies and programs                  which led to the first and only mass expulsion of Soviet intelligence                  officers (80 KGB and GRU) from the United States in October 1986.                  The successful strategic counterintelligence program is recounted                  in ""Operation FAMISH: The Integration of Counterintelligence                  into the National Decisionmaking Process"" (Defense Intelligence                  Journal, Spring 1995).                                   Following                  his work at the NSC, Major returned to the FBI where he was in                  charge of the section within the Intelligence Division of FBI                  Headquarters responsible for managing all intelligence and counterintelligence                  strategic and operational analysis, policy and plans formulation,                  budget formulation, resource management, automated data processing,                  and counterintelligence training of FBI, DoD and counterintelligence                  community personnel.                                   To ensure                  that the counterintelligence programs were integrated into the                  Executive Agencies' decision making process, Major served as the                  architect for the Counterintelligence Operations Board in 1989                  (now known as the National Counterintelligence Operations Board).                  This interagency board is responsible for all strategic counterintelligence                  operational planning and threat assessments for the Intelligence                  Community. Its membership included the Directors for Counterintelligence                  from the DoD/OSD, NCS, FCA, AFOSI, Chief of the CIA/CIC, and the                  FBI.                                    From 1988                  until his retirement in 1993, Major was the FBI's principal representative                  in the national intelligence policy formulation process. As such,                  he was the principal FBI drafter for the National Security Review                  (NSR) 18 and National Security Directive (NSD) 47. Signed by President                  Bush in October 1990, NSD 47 set forth the nation's counterintelligence                  and security countermeasures policy and plans to address the intelligence                  threat in the 1990s. Major also worked as the FBI's representative                  to the NSD 47 Working Group to ensure the full implementation                  of this executive directive.                                   Major was                  the principal architect of the National Security Threat List (approved                  by the Attorney General in December 1991) to meet the ever-changing                  challenges of the foreign intelligence threat in the 1990s. The                  National Security Threat List strategy became the primary document                  which directly governs all DoD counterintelligence programs.                                   Major's deep                  and persistent commitment to training future counterintelligence                  professional leaders from the DoD, FBI and CIA to think strategically                  about counterintelligence led him to formulate a new counterintelligence                  community course, ""Strategic Approaches to Counterintelligence.""                  This course was the first step in the development of a diverse                  gamut of courses Major later designed and currently conducts for                  the Intelligence Community.                                   As President                  of Major, Capps & Associates, Inc. parent company of The Centre                  for Counterintelligence and Security Studies, Major has committed                  himself to increasing the number of personnel who have a broad                  and in-depth understanding of the counterintelligence discipline                  within the Intelligence and National Security Communities, various                  federal agencies, Congress, media, academic, corporate sector,                  and among the public. Through the CI Centre, Major has worked                  vigorously to conduct research, analysis, training and direct                  strategic counterintelligence planning to assist in expanding                  awareness of key strategic concepts.                                   Major has                  published numerous articles on counterintelligence. He served                  as an adjunct professor for the Institute of World Politics in                  Washington, DC where he designed and taught from 1992 to 2000                  the graduate-level course ""Counterintelligence in a Democratic                  Society"". He also lectured at the ""Intelligence and                  Policy"" and ""Intelligence and Protective Security in                  the Post-Cold War Era"" courses at the Institute.                                   Major is the                  host of CI-TV, an internal government counterintelligence TV series                  with over 131 episodes. He has been extensively interviewed by                  print, radio and TV media from all over the world on counterintelligence                  issues, cases (such as the Hanssen case) and events. He serves                  as a consultant and advisor to producers of documentaries, books                  and movies dealing with spies and espionage. Major is on the Board                  of Advisors of the International Spy Museum which opened in Washington,                  DC in 2002.                                   Major is a                  graduate of Syracuse University and served as a US Army Captain                  in the Chemical Corps and then the Armor Branch from 1966 to 1968.                                  _______________________________________________________                                                                                                         Bill Neugent                                                                 Chief Engineer                    for Cybersecurity,                    The MITRE Corporation                   Bill                    Neugent works for MITRE, which is a not-for-profit organization                    chartered to work in the public interest.

SealedMedia                  Dr Martin                  Lambert, who has successfully created and delivered cutting-edge                  technologies throughout his career, began developing the SealedMedia                  technology in 1996 after he recognized that persistent protection                  of digital content was required before the potential of the Internet                  could be realized for the distribution of commercially sensitive                  or valuable content.                                                                       Dr Lambert                  has become one of the DRM and Information Security industry's                  foremost thought leaders. Many of the issues addressed in his                  initial product design have proven to be major differentiators                  that have led to SealedMedia's DRM technology being the first                  to achieve repeatable, wide-scale deployments in a crowded marketplace.                  The successful use of his DRM solution and the varied business                  problems his technology is addressing gives Dr Lambert a unique                  view of this important emerging segment.                 Prior to founding                SealedMedia, Dr Lambert had been the senior software engineer of                Imperial Software Technologies Ltd in the UK, where he created complex                Java-development applications. He joined IST after leading development                projects at Hughes Network Systems Inc in the US and Smith Associates                Ltd in the UK. A graduate of St John's College at Oxford University,                Dr Lambert was awarded his doctoral degree from the Department of                Engineering Science at Oxford University.                  _______________________________________________________                                                                                                              Dr. Cy Ardoin                                                               Senior.

Gillert     American Forces Press Service     SAN ANTONIO, Texas -- The staff at Wilford Hall Medical Center knew the cute but   withdrawn 4-year-old girl had been sexually abused, but law enforcement   authorities needed her to tell someone.     ""I think she was too embarrassed to talk about it, so she kept quiet,"" Air Force   Maj. Margaret Kohut said. ""Then, I brought Max in. He crawled up on her lap, and   she told him.""    Remarkable things happen sometimes when Max, a silky-coated brown dachshund, and   other dogs and cats come prowling the halls and wards of this massive Air Force   hospital at Lackland Air Force Base. Like the time a comatose man responded to   the cold nose and warm fur of a visiting pet.    But mostly the animals bring smiles to the faces of bedridden patients,   especially little boys and girls who have been isolated here by their rebellious   and broken bodies. Like 3-year-old Alizabeth Watson, in for one of several   operations she needs for a kidney problem. A visit Nov. 19 by Max, Roscoe and a   playful pug, Sammy, made her forget for a while the tubes taped to her arm.    ""Animals don't care what you look like, what your state of mind is or if you're   disfigured,"" said Kohut, a clinical social worker who steers the pet therapy   program here on a volunteer basis. ""They give love unconditionally."" Twice a   week, on Wednesdays and Thursdays, Kohut and others take their pets to Wilford   Hall, and for a few hours lighten the loads of patients and staff alike.     ""We'll be here Thanksgiving Day to visit all the patients, from children to   geriatrics,"" Kohut said. ""At Christmas, we'll not only visit the hospital but   also the basic trainees not able to go home for the holidays, the people staying   at the Fisher House [a temporary home for families of patients], even the   correctional custody inmates."" And on normal visiting days when she's completed   her ward rounds, Kohut takes Max to the pharmacy, where people stoop to pet and   talk with the good-natured dachshund, forgetting for a while how long they may   have been waiting in line.    ""Bringing the pets here reduces patients' stress, lowers their blood pressure,""   Kohut said. ""For awhile, they can forget about their problems and pressures.""    The Animal Assisted Therapy Program has been on the books here since 1994, but   nobody brought pets in until Kohut revitalized the program this summer. Since   July, six dogs, one cat and a rabbit have been coming weekly to cheer patients.   Next month, Kohut's husband will bring his cockatoo in. Nobody yet has   volunteered a pet snake.    Before getting their ""dog tags,"" the pets must be certified by a veterinarian as   free of diseases and parasites. The animals must be well groomed, good-natured   and undisturbed by elevators, crowded halls and the typical clutter of a   hospital bed. Max, Sammy and Roscoe fit the bill perfectly, seeking and   submitting patiently to rubs, scratches, pats and strokes from hands big and   small.    A couple times a month, volunteers meet for pet therapy training and obedience   classes. They learn that the animals must remain close to people most of the   time to stay well socialized. And they learn not to force their visits upon   anyone, although few can resist the wagging tails and alert, upturned faces of   the friendly pets.     Kohut said she's aware of a similar program at the hospital at Wright-Patterson   Air Force Base, Ohio, where someone's actually assigned full-time to head pet   therapy. And Tripler Army Medical Center, Hawaii, reported a similar program   last year. She doesn't know if other military hospitals use pets but said the   practice is widespread in the civilian community.     She thinks all hospitals should try the program. ""Therapy animals provide an   emotional connection without judgment, criticism, fear or distaste for the   medical condition of the patient,"" she said. The patients' smiles attest to the   program's worth.                 Three-year-old Alizabeth Watson, daughter of Army Pfc. William  Watson of Fort Hood, Texas, enjoys a happy moment with Roscoe. The cat and his  owner, Airman Tean Carter, participate in the Assisted Animal Therapy Program at  Wilford Hall Medical Center, Lackland Air Force Base, Texas. Twice a week,  Roscoe and other pets visit hospital patients to cheer them up and reduce their  stress. Douglas J. Gillert          Monique Delgado, 9, daughter of Navy Petty Officer William and  Jocelyn Delgado, enjoys a visit from Sammy and his owner, Airman 1st Class Karen  Foust, at Wilford Hall Medical Center, Lackland Air Force Base, Texas.

Terry Kline. Douglas J. Gillert          Wide-eyed Devia DeCora, 6, daughter of Air Force Technical Sgt.  Janice DeCora, enjoys a visit from Max the dachshund and his owner, Maj.

""Look at the dogs!""  Melvina Brown, 5, exclaimed as she rushed to pet a ""therapy  dog"" at DoD's Family (Casualty) Assistance Center here. Her  little brother, Robert Russell III, 2, eagerly followed.    Later, Kelli Lynch, 2, stunned her father by petting the  dogs.   ""I didn't realize what they were here for until my daughter  started playing with them,"" said Paul Lynch of Waldorf, Md.  ""She doesn't have a dog. She's actually terrified of them,  so it's surprising that she's playing with these dogs.""  Tears started streaming down his cheeks.    ""My father has two dogs at the house, and anytime either  one of them makes a move toward her, she turns around and  runs and screams and cries. But she's petting these dogs  right now,"" Lynch said.   His father, James Lynch, was a civilian employee in the  Navy Command Center at the Pentagon. His office was in the  direct path of the hijacked airliner that crashed into the  building on Sept. 11.    The therapy dogs, a variety of breeds, gave tail-wagging  greetings to anyone who entered their space. The four- footed therapists are part of Therapy Dogs International  Inc., a volunteer organization that provides qualified  handlers and their dogs for visits to hospitals, nursing  homes and other places where the dogs might help make  residents and patients smile.    Group officials pointed out researchers have clinically  proven that petting, touching and talking to the animals  lowers patients' blood pressure, relieves stress and eases  depression.   ""We're here at the family assistance center for the  families, volunteers, staff, military, security --  everybody,"" said Sue Peetoom of Fredericksburg, Va.,  chairwoman of the group's local chapter, Spirit keepers.  ""We have our dogs available at any time to be petted and  hugged for comfort for the families to remember the pets  they've left at home while they're here.""    ""The dogs are like a magnet, people are just drawn to  them,"" said Peetoom's husband, Lee. ""A lot of families,  counselors, clergy and other members of support groups  stopped by to pet the dogs. We also took them to the kids  rooms where children were kept while the parents were  taking care of business.""   ""We were asked to come here because we have a chapter in  Oklahoma City that helped people dealing with the disaster  there,"" Sue Peetoom said.   Certified therapy dogs must be trained, tested and  evaluated before they're allowed into action, she noted.   ""They must be 'bombproof,'"" she said. ""That is, they can't  react adversely to any situation. They have to be able to  be pulled, prodded, hugged, in large crowds, loud noises.  They have to be able to deal with anything that happens to  them. We have dogs of all shapes, sizes, breeds -- and  mixed breeds. The only requirement is that they have to be  a year old and have excellent temperaments, love people and  get along with other dogs, because we're always in groups.""   They're all family pets of the people on the other end of  the leash, she noted.    A steady stream of people visit the dogs every day, Peetoom  said. ""We have dogs in the lobby, upstairs, in the  children's room. The dogs are not only for the families,  though. Everybody working here is stressed as well, and  they're coming by just for a minute or to smile, touch the  dogs, decompress and go back to work.""

Kozaryn   American Forces Press Service     BISHKEK, Kyrgyzstan, April 27, 2002 -- The people of Afghanistan are in  far better circumstances today because Kyrgyzstan opened Manas  International Airport to U.S. and coalition forces, Defense Secretary  Donald H. Rumsfeld said here this morning.    The secretary met with President Askar Akaev and other Kyrgyz officials  to thank them for their support in the global war on terrorism.    Using Manas as a transportation hub has been ""exceedingly helpful and  valuable"" to Operation Enduring Freedom, he said. About 2,000 U.S. and  coalition forces from eight nations are flying missions from the air  base.    ""Afghanistan is, of course, a landlocked nation,"" Rumsfeld said.  ""Everything the United States and coalition forces have been able to do  has had to be done by air. Whether it means bringing in troops,  aircraft, supplies and equipment, or humanitarian assistance, it all  has to start from an air base some distance from Afghanistan.    ""Aircraft are able to fly over Afghanistan, and to be refueled and  conduct security operations to prevent al Qaeda and Taliban from  gathering and threatening the Afghan government,"" he added. At the same  time, the Manas facility is crucial to get humanitarian assistance to  the people of Afghanistan, he said.    U.S. relations with Kyrgyzstan, a member of NATO's Partnership for  Peace, existed before the war on terrorism began and will continue  after the war is over, Rumsfeld said. He said the relationship is not  only based on military cooperation, but economic and political  cooperation as well, ""and thereby is a healthy and strong one.""    Akaev welcomed Rumsfeld and said he was greatly honored by the  secretary's visit. ""Undoubtedly, this visit will provide new impetus to  our relationship,"" the president said.    After meeting to discuss the situation in Afghanistan and the peaceful  development of Central Asia, the two men held a press conference. Akaev  told reporters he'd told Rumsfeld a story. He said history has shown  that those who enter Afghanistan by way of Kyrgyzstan are successful.  Since American and coalition forces were flowing through Kyrgyzstan,  the U.S. led effort would succeed just as did Alexander the Great and  Babar, the first Mongol emperor of India.    The United States and Kyrgyzstan share the same goals for Afghanistan,  Rumsfeld said: ""that it be a peaceful country, a successful country  economically; that it no longer be a haven for terrorists or terrorist  training camps; that its neighbors permit it to grow, prosper and  recover from drought, war and the difficulties it has faced.""    ""So it is quite clear that the interests of the United States are  notably different from those of Alexander the Great,"" he said, drawing  laughter from the Kyrgyz leader.

Rumsfeld said the people of Afghanistan are in far better circumstances today because Kyrgyzstan opened Manas International Airport to U.S. and coalition forces.
