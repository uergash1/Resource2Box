It produced commercial quantities of oil which were shipped in wooden barrels by barge on the Cumberland River. Through 2001, there have been over 156,000 known wells drilled in Kentucky associated with oil and gas production.   The Department of Mines and Minerals, which is under the Cabinet For Public Protection and Regulation, began permitting oil and gas wells in 1948 but only those wells drilled in coal producing areas. The Kentucky General Assembly ratified the Interstate Oil Compact in 1942. The Division of Oil and Gas (DOG) was created by acts of the 1960 General Assembly and charged with the duties of fostering conservation of all mineral resources, encouraging exploration of such resources, protecting the correlative rights of land and mineral owners, prohibiting waste and unnecessary surface loss and damage, and encouraging the maximum recovery of oil and gas from all deposits. DOG began permitting all oil and gas related wells at that time. Groundwater protection regulations began in 1978 through an administrative regulation for protection of freshwater zones. Regulation of plugging and abandonment procedures began in 1961, including regulations for wells drilled through both non-coal-bearing strata and coal-bearing strata. Bonding requirements and penalty provisions were established in 1966 and increased in 1990.   Oil and gas are produced from more than 1,500 pools in Kentucky from rocks of Cambrian to Pennsylvanian age. Most oil is produced from Mississippian limestone and sandstone in Eastern and Western Kentucky or from Ordovician limestone and dolomites in Southern Kentucky. Most natural gas is produced from the Devonian black shale in Eastern Kentucky.   The Division of Oil and Gas has developed a well history database for each well that can be utilized daily. At present, there are approximately 115,225 wells stored on-line for which we have data relative to the permit, operator, well location, pertinent dates and well completion.   At the close of 2002, the Oil and Gas Division had 13 field inspectors, 3 field supervisors and 7 employees on its administrative staff.   Available to the public is a weekly publication of permits issued identifying the permit number, operator name, farm name, county, Carter Coordinates, and target formation. This information is updated weekly on the link below.   Permitting and Well Transfers   During 2002, the Division issued 1202 new permits primarily for new wells, but also includes permits for the deepening or reopening of existing wells. The top five counties receiving the most permits are in descending order as follows: Pike, Metcalfe, Letcher, Clinton and Knox. These counties accounted for 44% of the permits issued. Oil and gas operators transferred wells from one operator to another for a total of 2216 wells. There were 285 new bonds posted totaling $614,400.00. A total of $349,000.00 was released as a result of proper abandonment or transfer to a successor operator.   For more detailed information regarding the Division please see the Annual Report online.   Compliance And Forfeitures   The Division inspectors conducted 3105 inspections throughout 2002, which resulted in 875 violations. Of these, 170 were corrected and cleared, 81 were forfeited, and the remaining is in a pending status of either having been granted an extension, or in the process of forfeiture. The amount of forfeited bonds was $83,000.00. The Division plugged 321 abandoned wells with funds from the abandoned well plugging fund for a total of $690,592.50. This resulted in an average plugging cost for the year of $2,151.38 per well.   Conservation Activities   At the close of 2002, the Oil and Gas Division had 13 field inspectors, 3 field supervisors and 7 employees on its administrative staff.   The Division staff operates a customized Microsoft Sequel Server database on an in-house server. We have developed well history data for each well that can be utilized daily. At present, there were 115,225 wells stored on-line for which we have data relative to the permit, operator, well location, pertinent dates and well completion.

Across the country, the Bureau had begun establishing experiment stations, each specializing in a different extraction industry - coal, metals, clay, and other minerals - and each located close to the major centers of each resource.  Now, the Bureau announced its intent to establish a petroleum experiment station somewhere in the United States.                                   MORE INFO                                                    For a more complete history, go to: Bartlesville Energy Research Center, Birthplace of Petroleum Technology                                                      Choosing a suitable location, however, was not easy.  John D. Rockefeller's mega-monopoly, the Standard Oil Trust, broken up five years earlier in a landmark Supreme Court decision, had based its operations on Pennsylvania and Ohio oil.  Refineries had been built in New Jersey and New York.  But the nation's surging demand for gasoline had led petroleum companies to widen their search for new oil resources.  New discoveries in Oklahoma and Texas had begun to shift the U.S. oil industry westward.         Local oil men in Bartlesville, Oklahoma, were determined to convince the Bureau that their community was the logical choice as the center of the domestic oil universe.  Already fiercely independent, the executives believed the new station would provide an endorsement of their intensively competitive brand of business, in stark contrast to the monopolistic era of Standard Oil.           Through the Chamber of Commerce, the oil men pledged $50,000 to assist the government in construction.  One of the town fathers, George Keeler, promised to donate a plot of land for the station.  The next year, 1917, oil discoveries in the Osage Indian Nation directly to the west of Bartlesville catapulted Oklahoma to the forefront of the burgeoning mid-continent oil industry.  The Bureau of Mines accepted the city's offer and made Bartlesville the site of the nation's first petroleum experiment station.         In 1918, the Bartlesville Experiment Station was created.  Headed by J.O. Lewis, appointed as the station's first Superintendent, headed a staff of six.  The station's initial operations paralleled an upswing in oil research throughout the industry.  A handful of engineering graduates from Stanford University began to concentrate on methods to improve drilling equipment; the University of Pennsylvania began a program in petroleum chemistry.          As the 1920s unfolded, oil exploration moved further westward.  Wyoming soon became another industry hotspot, and in 1922, the Bureau of Mines established another petroleum field station at Laramie, Wyoming.  For the next 60 years, the sister stations at Bartlesville and Laramie would collaborate on petroleum research problems, often exchanging personnel (in fact, the longest serving director of the Bartlesville center, John S. Ball -- who served from 1963 to 1978 -- had been a former employee of the Laramie center).         The 1930s created new issues about the role of Federal petroleum research.  Huge discoveries of crude oil in Texas, plus reduced demand brought about by the Great Depression, created an oil glut and drove prices to as low as 10 cents per barrel.  Federal oil research budgets were cut (in 1931, the federal budget for the Bartlesville station was reduced from $101,000 to $94,000 while the state appropriation was cut from $62,500 to $57,500).           To many, the oil glut had rendered research into improving recovery meaningless.  But it also increased industry's interest in new technologies for detecting rates of production and the overall size of underground reserves.  With oil prices plummeting and all but the largest producers facing an economic crisis, many producers had petitioned the courts for legal means to set production limits as a way of creating a floor price for crude oil.  But the courts refused, citing production limits as illegal restraints of trade.  Many in the oil industry hoped that better information on the size of underground reservoirs and the rates at which they were declining would give them a better case to argue that production limits were in the best interest of national resource conservation.         Petroleum research survived during the 1930s primarily by concentrating on studies of reservoir pressures, the behavior of fluids under different conditions in a reservoir, measurements of oil saturations in reservoir sands, and several other areas which could help resolve the problems of overproduction.          With the United States on the brink of war, the availability of petroleum again became a major concern.  Speaking to the annual API meeting in San Francisco on November 5, 1941, Interior Secretary Harold Ickes said:        ""Do not forget that petroleum is an exhaustible and irreplaceable natural resource.  Not only does our commerce and our industry and our husbandry and our pleasure depend upon it, this war demonstrates that the possession of an abundance of petroleum and its products is a matter of life and death to a nation.  And our own nation would be negligent of its duty, recreant to its trust, if it permitted any industry to waste such a valuable natural resource.""          To a nation now seeking to boost its domestic oil supplies, the research sustained at the Bureau of Mines experimental stations at Bartlesville and Laramie throughout the ""oil glut"" of the 1930s now proved its worth.  Studies of oil field waterflooding would allow some fields to maintain or increase production.  Research into drilling muds which would lubricate and protect drill bits would save much steel for the war effort.  Studies of fire hazards, evaporation losses, and the corrosive effects of water would improve petroleum transportation and storage.            War time would add two new efforts to the Federal petroleum research, primarily at the Bartlesville station - the study of high octane aviation gasoline and a means for converting hydrocarbons into synthetic rubber. In 1942, the Bureau established a thermodynamics research section at Bartlesville to develop basic data on converting butane and butene gases to butadiene, the basic component of general purpose synthetic rubber. Although by war's end this thermodynamics group had barely gotten underway, it symbolized a new direction for the station in the post-war era.          By the mid-1950s, the Bartlesville thermodynamics laboratory had become a major center for the generation of basic data on hydrocarbons and sulfur and nitrogen compounds, and was known throughout the world. Coupled with the chemistry and refining work related to the aviation fuel program, this petroleum thermodynamics activity helped to move Bartlesville in the direction of a research center rather than an experiment station.          The postwar oil industry in America faced a new set of challenges.  The war had caused a major upsurge in petroleum demand, and the nation's new found prosperity continued to increase oil consumption.  In 1947-48, for the first time, the nation imported more petroleum than it exported.  At the same time, production from the once-prolific fields of Oklahoma and Kansas was peaking and beginning to decline.  Producers and state commissions in these states began to look for ways to halt the declining production.  Interest developed in ""secondary recovery"" - ways to sustain production as the effectiveness of primary recovery means, i.e., field pressures or artificial lifts, began to decline.         For more than a decade after the war, the Bureau of Mines at Bartlesville hosted ""waterflood tours"" to give small independent producers, and some specialists from larger companies, a first-hand look at a promising new approach for keeping oil fields in production.  As many as 125 cars, carrying 400 to 500 participants and escorted by the Oklahoma Highway Patrol, would visit several waterflood projects - a traveling technology transfer convention.          At Bartlesville, research into secondary recovery in the 1950s included: locating abandoned wells through use of metal detectors, study of water-conditioning plants, analyses of the effects of dissolved gases on corrosion of metal, studies of rates and pressures of water injection, core and water analysis, and uses of radioactive isotopes as tracers in secondary recovery projects.         Users of tracers to study the flow characteristics and patterns of crude oil and brines through reservoir rock extended in the 1960s under joint funding from the Bureau and the Atomic Energy Commission.  By the mid-1960s, the use of radioactive tracers in petroleum secondary recovery operations had become generally routine and much of Bartlesville's pioneering work was widely accepted.           For much of the Government's mainline petroleum research, however, the 1960s proved to be a struggle.  The Nation's major oil companies had seen the benefits of research into new oil production and refining technologies, and most had established major research capabilities.  In Bartlesville, for example, work at the federal center was largely overshadowed by research at the much larger Phillips Research Center, run by the Bartlesville-based Phillips Petroleum Company.         The 1970s were to dramatically reshape America's views about energy.  But even before the 1973-74 Arab oil embargo shocked the American economy, oil and energy were rapidly on their way to becoming, as Daniel Yergin put it in  The Prize,  ""the hottest cauldron in national politics.""  In 1971, in line with the Nixon Administration's growing emphasis on national energy issues, the Bureau of Mines changed the designation of the Bartlesville and Laramie centers again - this time renaming them from ""petroleum"" to ""energy"" research centers.  Yet, the Bartlesville center largely remained focused on petroleum matters, and in fact, the name change caused considerable internal uncertainty as to how diversified the center's research portfolio should become.         The Federal Government, however, was changing its posture on research with the private sector.  Rather than the primary activity being experiments at federal laboratories, the bulk of the funding was to ""pass through"" the sites to industry partners working in the Nation's oil fields. In 1974, the Bartlesville center opened major contracts in chemical flooding of oil fields already exhausted by waterflood techniques.  From 1974 to 1982, more than $96 million in government funding for advanced oil recovery projects was more than matched by private sector outlays of $130 million.  In addition, new projects studying aspects of chemical and thermal enhanced oil recovery were added, sending federal funds to a wide range of universities and private companies across the Nation.         In 1975, when the Energy Research and Development Administration began operations, both the Bartlesville and Laramie Energy Research Centers were transferred from the Bureau of Mines into the new agency.

GX004-73-8082060	"Chapter 8: Fossil Fuels - Coal, Oil and Natural Gas       Where Fossil Fuels Come From       There are three major forms of fossil fuels: coal, oil and natural gas. All three were formed many hundreds of millions  of years ago before the time of the dinosaurs - hence the name fossil fuels.  The age they were formed is  called the Carboniferous Period.  It was part of the Paleozoic Era. ""Carboniferous"" gets its name from carbon, the basic element in coal and other fossil fuels.                 The Carboniferous Period occurred from about 360 to 286 million years ago.  At the time, the land was covered with swamps filled with huge trees, ferns and other large leafy plants, similar to the picture above.  The water and seas were filled with algae - the green stuff that forms on a stagnant pool of water.  Algae is actually millions of very small plants.       Some deposits of coal can be found during the time of the  dinosaurs.  For example, thin carbon layers can be found during  the late Cretaceous Period (65 million years ago) - the time of  Tyrannosaurus Rex .  But the main deposits of fossil fuels are from the Carboniferous Period.  For more about the various geologic eras, go to  www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/help/timeform.html        As the trees and plants died, they sank to the bottom of the swamps of oceans. They formed layers of a spongy material call peat.  Over many hundreds of years, the peat was covered by sand and clay and other minerals, which turned into a type of rock called sedimentary.          More and more rock piled on top of more rock, and it weighed more and more.  It began to press down  on the peat.  The peat was squeezed and squeezed until the water came out of it and it eventually, over millions of years, it turned into coal, oil or petroleum, and natural gas.       Coal    Coal is a hard, black colored rock-like substance. It is made up of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen and varying amounts of sulphur.  There are three main types of coal - anthracite, bituminous and lignite.  Anthracite coal is the hardest and has more carbon, which gives it a higher energy content. Lignite is the softest and is low in carbon but high in hydrogen and oxygen content. Bituminous is in between.  Today, the precursor to coal - peat - is still found in many countries and is also used as an energy source.         The earliest known use of coal was in China. Coal from the Fu-shun mine in northeastern China may have been used to smelt copper as early as 3,000 years ago. The Chinese thought coal was a stone that could burn.          Coal is found in many of the lower 48 states of U.S. and throughout the rest of the world.  Coal is mined out of the ground using various methods.  Some coal mines are dug by sinking vertical or horizontal shafts deep under ground, and coal miners travel by elevators or trains deep under ground to dig the coal.  Other coal is mined in strip mines where huge steam shovels strip away the top layers above the coal. The layers are then restored after the coal is taken away.      The coal is then shipped by train and boats and even in pipelines. In pipelines, the coal is ground up and mixed with water to make what's called a slurry.  This is then pumped many miles through pipelines. At the other end, the coal is used to fuel power plants and other factories.          Oil or Petroleum           Oil is another fossil fuel.  It was also formed more than 300 million years ago.  Some scientists say that tiny diatoms is the source of oil.  Diatoms are sea creatures the size of a pin head.  They do one thing just like plants; they can convert sunlight directly into stored energy.       In the graphic on the left, as the diatoms died they fell to the sea floor (1).  Here they were buried under sediment and other rock (2).  The rock squeezed the diatoms and the energy in their bodies could not escape.  The carbon eventually turned into oil under great pressure and heat. As the earth changed and moved and folded, pockets where oil and natural gas can be found were formed (3).      Oil has been used for more than 5,000-6,000 years.  The ancient Sumerians, Assyrians and Babylonians used crude oil and asphalt (""pitch"") collected from large seeps at Tuttul (modern-day Hit) on the Euphrates River.  A seep is a place on the ground where the oil leaks up from below ground.  The ancient Egyptians, used liquid oil as a medicine for wounds, and oil has been used in lamps to provide light.       The Dead Sea, near the modern Country of Israel, used to be called Lake Asphaltites. The word asphalt was derived is from that term because of the lumps of gooey petroleum that were washed up on the lake shores from underwater seeps.      In North America, Native Americans used blankets to skim oil off the surface of streams and lakes.  They used oil as medicine and to make canoes water-proof.  During the Revolutionary War, Native Americans taught George Washington's troops how to treat frostbite with oil.      As our country grew, the demand for oil continued to increase as a fuel for lamps.  Petroleum oil began to replace whale oil in lamps because the price for whale oil was very high. During this time, most petroleum oil came from distilling coal into a liquid or by skimming it off of lakes - just as the Native Americans did.         Then on August 27, 1859, Edwin L. Drake  (the man standing on the right in the black and white picture to the right), struck liquid oil at his well near Titusville, Pennsylvania.  He found oil under ground and a way that could pump it to the surface.  The well pumped the oil into barrels made out of wood.  This method of drilling for oil is still being used today all over the world in areas where oil can be found below the surface.           Oil and natural gas are found under ground between folds of rock and in areas of rock that are porous and contain the oils within the rock itself. The folds of rock were formed as the earth shifts and moves.  It's similar to how a small, throw carpet will bunch up in places on the floor.      To find oil and natural gas, companies drill through the earth to the deposits deep below the surface. The oil and natural gas are then pumped from below the ground by oil rigs (like in the picture). They then usually travel through pipelines or by ship.                 Oil is found in 18 of the 58 counties in California. Kern County, the County where Bakersfield is found, is one of the largest oil production places in the country. But we only get one-half of our oil from California wells.  The rest comes from Alaska, and an increasing amount comes from other countries.  In the entire U.S., more than 50 percent of all the oil we use comes from outside the country...most of it from the Middle East.      Oil is brought to California by large tanker ships. The petroleum or crude oil must be changed or refined into other products before it can be used.        Refineries            Oil is stored in large tanks until it is sent to various places to be used.  At oil refineries, crude oil is split into various types of products by heating the thick black oil.         Oil made into many different products - fertilizers for farms, the clothes you wear, the toothbrush you use, the plastic bottle that holds your milk, the plastic pen that you write with. They all came from oil.  There are thousands of other products that come from oil. Almost all plastic comes originally from oil. Can you think of some other things made from oil?        The products include gasoline, diesel fuel, aviation or jet fuel, home heating oil,  oil for ships and oil to burn in power plants to make electricity. Here's what a barrel of crude oil can make.        In California, 74 percent of our oil is used for transportation -- cars, planes, trucks, buses and motorcycles. We'll learn more about transportation energy in   Chapter 18.                        Source: American Petroleum Institute (www.api.org). Figures are based on 1995 average yields for U.S. refineries. One barrel contains 42 gallons of crude oil. The total volume of products made is 44.2 GALLONS - 2.2 gallons greater than the original 42 gallons of crude oil. This is called ""processing gain,"" where other chemicals are added to the refining process to create the products.                  Natural Gas     Sometime between 6,000 to 2,000 years BCE (Before the Common Era), the first discoveries of natural gas seeps were made in Iran. Many early writers described the natural petroleum seeps in the Middle East, especially in the Baku region of what is now Azerbaijan. The gas seeps, probably first ignited by lightning, provided the fuel for the ""eternal fires"" of the fire-worshiping religion of the ancient Persians.        Natural gas is lighter than air. Natural gas is mostly made up of a gas called methane. Methane is a simple chemical compound that is made up of carbon and hydrogen atoms. It's chemical formula is CH4 - one atom of carbon along with  four atoms hydrogen. This gas is highly flammable.         Natural gas is usually found near petroleum underground. It is pumped from below ground and travels in pipelines to storage areas.  The  next chapter  looks at that pipeline system.        Natural gas usually has no odor and you can't see it. Before it is sent to the pipelines and storage tanks, it is mixed with a chemical that gives a strong odor. The odor smells almost like rotten eggs. The odor makes it easy to smell if there is a leak.         Energy Safety Note!  If you smell that rotten egg smell in your house, tell your folks and get out of the house quickly.  Don't turn on any lights or other electrical devices.  A spark from a light switch can ignite the gas very easily.  Go to a neighbor's house and call 9-1-1 for emergency help.           Saving Fossil Fuels     Fossil fuels take millions of years to make. We are using up the fuels that were made more than 300 million years ago before the time of the dinosaurs. Once they are gone they are gone.         So, it's best to not waste fossil fuels. They are not renewable; they can't really be made again.

Smith    INSTITUE OF CLEAN AIR COMPANIES    www.icac.com         November 15, 2001                    Good morning, Mr. Chairman.    I am Jeff Smith, Executive Director, Institute of Clean Air Companies (“ICAC” or “the Institute”).    The Institute is the nonprofit, national association of companies that supply air pollution control and monitoring technology for all types of stationary sources, including coal-fired power plants that are the subject of this hearing.    Members supply the complete spectrum of competing control technologies for emissions of mercury, sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ) and nitrogen oxide (NO x ), along with all other criteria pollutants and the 189 hazardous air pollutants identified to-date.    Thus the Institute speaks for the entire industry, not just one technology.    We do not, however, supply technology for CO 2  control and I will therefore not address CO 2 .    For more on the Institute, see www.icac.com.    I have submitted detailed testimony for the record, but in the few minutes I have here this morning, I will begin with the “bottom-line.”            I.    Summary         The air pollution control technology industry has the technology to achieve the NO x , SO 2 , and mercury reductions contemplated by Sen. Jefford’s bill (S. 556), and the resources to deliver that technology within the time frames the bill contemplates.    Of course there will be site-specific issues, but in the 31-year history of the Clean Air Act the air pollution control technology industry has always delivered on the charge this Committee has given it.    There is no reason to believe this time will be any different.    A multi-pollutant approach makes sense both technically and cost-wise.    And experience strongly suggests that a multi-pollutant bill will be the Committee’s one chance to achieve the twin goals of an adequate energy supply and clean air.    Here is why we feel this way.            II.    Discussion                    Well-Demonstrated, Conventional Control Technologies Exist to Reduce SO 2 , NO x , and PM 2.5  Emissions .     There is no real debate that reliable, demonstrated-in-practice control technology exists for coal-fired power plants to remove 95% of sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ) emissions, 99.9% of particulate matter (PM) emissions, and 90+% of nitrogen oxide emissions (NO x ).    Members of our industry are guaranteeing these removal levels today.    The harder question is what can be done to control mercury emissions, and I will focus my testimony on that question.                    Air Pollution Control Technology Markets Have Worked Well .    The 31-year history under the Clean Air Act shows that clear, enforceable standards yield cost-effective compliance options.    Study after study shows a strong link between establishment of regulatory drivers and technical performance and cost improvement.    This is true even when control options have been limited or untested at the time the rules were introduced.    The advanced state of technologies for controls of sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ) and nitrogen oxide (NO x ) emission was reached after (not before) regulatory drivers were adopted. Total costs (capital and O&M) fall dramatically as control technology moves from research and development to full-scale commercialization.     In the case of selective catalytic reduction – widely used to remove NO x  emissions from coal-fired boilers -- the costs in $/ton removed fell 80-90% from 1989 to 1998.     See ,  e.g .,  Environmental Regulation and Technology Innovation: Controlling Mercury Emissions from Coal-Fired Boilers , Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management, Boston, September 2000.                    Technology users (e.g., electric utility industry) and suppliers have proven to be more innovative than one may expect at the outset of a regulatory program.    Electric utility users are outstanding in their ability to use control technology effectively.    The air pollution control technology industry, like nature herself, is extremely competitive, “red in tooth and claw.”    This is good for technology users and government regulators, because it yields increasingly cost-effective solutions; if your competitor discovers a way to reduce emissions more cost-effectively, you will be out of business quickly if you do not improve as well.    And many have exited our industry for that reason.                    The key to well-functioning markets is regulatory certainty .    If the goal is technological innovation, then issue a clear, certain, performance-based mandate .                               Dollars spent on compliance with clean air mandates, such as S. 556, are not lost down a black hole, either.    They are recycled in the economy, generating jobs in construction and materials fabrication, in addition to jobs in air pollution control technology companies.    Indeed, compliance with the NO x  SIP Call alone is creating 25,392 person-years of employment a year during 1999-2005, less than 10% of which is in the air pollution control technology industry.    (Appendix III).                        Although we do not have expertise in macroeconomic models, we note that just last month the utility industry’s own North American Electric Reliability Council (NERC) reported that generating capacity margins in the U.S. will increase markedly over the next five years, peaking at more than 20% in 2004.    NERC says 138,000 MW of the 245,000 MW of proposed new merchant generation will come on-line by 2005, far outstripping a projected 63,800 MW increase in electricity demand.    (For more details, go to www.nerc.com).    Whatever the relevance of the NERC report, however, we believe as discussed below that control technology exists to allow this Nation to continue to burn coal and cost-effectively achieve the NO x , SO 2 , and mercury emission reduction goals of S. 556.                     Development of Mercury Removal Technologies Will Be No Different .    It is reasonable to assume that the traditional, successful workings of the air pollution control market will apply to the development and enhancement of mercury emission controls.    The technology supplier industry is more competitive that ever.    Utilities are increasingly sophisticated as customers of technology, and more demanding of cost-effectiveness in a deregulated environment.    The development focus for mercury controls is in many areas on optimizing controls already demonstrated for other pollutants (e.g., SO 2 , PM, NO x ), so the learning curve is not as steep.    Financial incentives for our industry are sufficient to invest in research and development, particularly once a clear, certain regulatory goal is set.    Even in the absence of a legislative directive, there are a large number of mercury control demonstrations underway along with significant investment by both technology suppliers and end-users (Appendix II).    Indeed, we have already seen cost estimates of mercury- and multi-pollutant control by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and others fall dramatically.                                A Multi-Pollutant, Performance-Based Approach Is Sensible from a Technology-Development Standpoint .    The Institute applauds and confirms S. 556’s approach.    It allows both utilities and technology suppliers like ourselves to develop integrated compliance plans and maximizes incentives for innovation and competition.            ICAC also supports performance-based approaches, which harness market mechanisms.    As Sen. Smith noted at the Committee’s recent hearing on November 1 st , original estimates of the cost of removing SO 2  in the acid rain program were $7 billion, but the actual cost was about $1 billion.    This is a dramatic example of the market’s power, as well as the positive effects of regulatory certainty on cost and performance improvements of air pollution control technology.         A Multi-Pollutant, Performance-Based Approach Is Sensible from Policy and Cost-Effectiveness Standpoints Too .    This multi-pollutant approach has the potential to lead to simultaneous compliance with numerous regulatory programs, including acid rain, ozone attainment (both the one-hour and eight-hour), regional haze, and fine particulate (PM 2.5 ).    We feel insufficient attention has been given to the benefits of PM 2.5  reductions that S. 556 would achieve by lowering SO 2  and NO x  levels (which contribute to PM 2.5  formation in the atmosphere).    Indeed, by default PM 2.5  is the fifth pollutant controlled in this bill.            The effect of this multi-pollutant approach is to lower the evaluated cost for each individual pollutant that may otherwise be addressed in a separate regulatory program.    For example, if a scrubber is installed to control acid rain and PM 2.5 , but it reduces mercury emissions as well, only a portion of its cost should be attributed to compliance with the mercury reduction requirements.    Cost estimates for mercury controls should therefore be scrutinized carefully for how they allocate technology costs among various regulatory elements of a multi-pollutant bill .         Conventional Emissions Controls Are Removing Mercury Without Even Trying .    As EPA’s data shows (see Appendix I), existing controls are already removing mercury, and in some cases large amounts of mercury, as a side-benefit of the removal of other pollutants.     For example, controls to remove SO 2  may significantly reduce mercury and PM 2.5  (precursor) emissions as well.    Mercury removal efficiencies depend on numerous factors.    Among the biggest is whether the coal burned is bituminous or sub-bituminous.                    Control Technology Demonstrated Today Can Achieve Mercury Removal of 90% on Bituminous Coals, and 70% on Sub-Bituminous Coals .    Of course there may be site-specific issues, but in general the industry believes technology available  today  can achieve total mercury reductions of 90% on bituminous coals, and 70% on sub-bituminous coals.    This conclusion is supported by measurement programs the electric utility industry conducted for EPA (Appendix I).     What is the most cost-effective approach will differ for site-specific reasons, such as the type of control equipment currently being used.            Research on mercury control technology has been underway in the U.S. for a decade, and the enactment of a multi-pollutant bill will, as discussed above, stimulate more R&D and results.    Appendix II is a  partial  list of on-going R&D projects. They are in general designed for 50-70% mercury removal by 2005, and 90% removal by 2010, with the additional objective of cutting costs by 50-75% by 2010.     The important point here is that the R&D is maturing to the point of full-scale demonstrations today and covers a wide range of coal types and existing equipment configurations.    Note that many of these project teams include utility end-users as well as technology developers, which indicates the wide-ranging, cooperative effort underway.    By the required compliance deadline, therefore, we believe this R&D, along with already-demonstrated technology, will yield a variety of increasingly cost-effective options for achieving the NO x , SO 2  and mercury removal requirements of S. 556.         (A question for the Committee, however, is whether it makes sense to base the level of required control on what can be guaranteed today, or rather what history and other factors show will likely be available in seven or ten or twelve years when compliance is required.    This is particularly appropriate since as discussed below it is not likely that this program will be amended mid-stream, and indeed the premise of certainty in this multi-pollutant approach is that the rule will not be amended. An answer is suggested by hockey great Wayne Gretsky, who said a reason for his success was that he skated to where the puck was going to be, not to where it was.)         The Committee does not have to pick technology winners and losers; the marketplace is adept at doing so.    The course of technology development is too unpredictable to say what the best approach will be in 7 or 10 or 12 years for each unique application.    Industry experience strongly indicates that there will not be one universal approach.    We suggest you must simply have a reasonable assurance that technology markets are working and that you have provided an incentive for development.    As I have said, these markets will continue to work well, and S. 556 provides the requisite incentives for technology development by providing clear goals without specifying the precise compliance technology.            This Is Likely the Committee’s One Chance to Assure Twin Objectives of Adequate Energy Supply and Clean Air .    For now and the near future, an adequate energy supply arguably depends on burning coal.    Coal-burning electric utilities are the largest industrial source of air pollution, with adverse health effects well-documented by scientific and medical authorities.    Fortunately, air pollution control technology, if required, can allow coal to be consistent with human health and environmental imperatives.    This, it should be noted, is likely the Committee’s one chance to assure these goals are met.    The history of the Clean Air Act shows that it is not easily amended, and indeed the premise of certainty in this multi-pollutant approach is that the law will in fact not be amended mid-stream.         III.                Conclusion         The multi-pollutant, performance-based approach reflected in the Jeffords    bill (S. 556) makes sense from a technical and cost viewpoint.    The required reductions for NO x , SO 2 , and mercury are achievable assuming, in the case of sub-bituminous coals, continued technological progress with control technology, which is a reasonable assumption.    Control technology markets have worked well and will continue to do so, yielding progressively more cost-effective compliance solutions.    Therefore, the issue of control technology should not determine whether the NO x , SO 2 , and mercury removal requirements in this bill, or a similar one, are enacted.    History under the Clean Air Act suggests strongly that consideration of a multi-pollutant bill is likely to be the Committee’s one chance to assure our Nation’s twin goals of adequate energy and clean air over the foreseeable future.                     Thank you for this opportunity to testify.    I look forward to your questions.              Appendix I              The Mercury Reductions Conventional Controls Can Achieve on     Coal-Fired Power Plants (Without Even Trying)    ( average mercury control, percentage )                   Technology*                     Bituminous Coal               Sub-bituminous Coal                             CS-ESP                             29 (18)                               3 (9)                        HS-ESP                             11 (9)                                0 (12)                        FF                                    89 (6)                                73 (6)                        SDA+ESP                          45 (3)                                0 (9)                        SDA+FF                            93+ (9)                               23 (9)                        CS-ESP+Wet FGD              78 (6)                                 16 (9)                        HS-ESP+Wet FGD              39 (9)                                8 (9)                        FF+Wet FGD                      97 (6)                                --              * CS-ESP=cold-side ESP;

This partial list illustrates the wide-range of on-going research based only on an expectation of a legislative directive. Note that many of these project teams include utility end-users as well as technology developers, which indicates the market forces driving development.    (For more information, go to the press releases dated June 18, 2001 and October 16, 2001, at www.f e .doe.go v /).         ·           McDermott Technology, Alliance, Ohio         Project Summary:    The goal is to commercialize a method for enhanced control of mercury emissions from Michigan South Central Power Agency’s 55 MW Endicott Station and Cinergy’s 1,300 MW Zimmer Station (OH) equipped with wet FGD systems.    The two specific objectives are demonstration of 90% total mercury removal (stack emission versus mercury in the coal burned) and annual levelized costs 50-75% less than commercial available, activated carbon mercury removal technologies.         ·           ADA-Environmental Solutions, Littleton, CO         Project Summary:    This project involves testing on a plant owned by Alabama, a plant owned by Wisconsin Electric power company, and two PG&E sites.    The company’s technology requires minimal equipment and minimal downtime for installation.    Flue gas is injected with a sorbent of activated carbon which combines with the mercury so that it can be removed with a filter.            ·           The Energy & Environmental Research Center at the University of North Dakota, Grand Forks, ND         Project Summary: The Energy & Environmental Research Center at the University of North Dakota, Grand Forks, ND, will develop an advanced hybrid particulate collector (AHPC) that promises to remove 90 percent of all mercury emissions at a price lower than today's estimates. The AHPC combines the best features of electrostatic precipitators and baghouses in a configuration that boosts efficiency between particulate collection and dust disposal. By doing so, the problem ESPs generally have in collecting excessive fine particulates is solved as is re-collecting dust in conventional baghouses. The system is to be bench-scale batch tested so that new work is tied to earlier results; the AHPC would also undergo larger, pilot-scale testing on a coal-fired combustor. The technology could be retrofitted to ESP-equipped plants, installed in a new plant or applied to industrial boilers requiring mercury control. Partners are W.L. Gore & Associates, Elkton, MD, and the Otter Tail Power Company, Fergus Falls, MN, which will host field tests.          ·           URS Group, Inc., Austin, TX         Project Summary: URS Group, Inc., Austin, TX, will pilot test mercury-oxidation catalysts already identified as being effective through earlier, smaller-scale research funded by DOE. The project's pilot tests, conducted at plants using wet flue gas desulfurization systems and particulate collection systems, are on a larger scale and will be conducted for longer periods to provide data for future, full-scale designs.    Mercury-oxidation potential will be measured continually to provide longer-term catalyst life data. The project is applicable to about 90,000 megawatts of generation capacity. Project partners are the Electric Power Research Institute, Palo Alto, CA, which will co-manage and co-fund the pilot tests, and two utilities.         ·           CONSOL, Inc., Library, PA         Project Summary: CONSOL, Inc., Library, PA, will construct a pilot-plant facility producing flue gas from a coal-fired utility to test technologies that remove not only mercury, but will reduce nitrogen, sulfur and carbon dioxide emissions as well. The facility will be composed of an air preheater, an electrostatic precipitator (ESP) to collect fine particulates, and an alkaline-sorbent injection system to control sulfur condensation. An alkaline additive is injected into the air heater, which will operate at 200-250 o  F, to neutralize the sulfur. Mercury will be collected with the fly ash in the ESP. The work addresses several    utility issues: mercury removal at lower-than-normal temperatures, using spray cooling to lower temperatures, and the additive's effects on specific plant components performance.         ·           Southern Research Institute, Birmingham, AL         Project Summary: Southern Research Institute will test the effectiveness of calcium-based sorbents and oxidizing agents in controlling mercury from coal plants by using a technique that combines mercury oxidation with adsorption. Incorporating mercury oxidation along with lime and silica lime additives produces more efficient sorbents that remove sulfur dioxide in addition to mercury. Pilot-scale studies will be performed on a coal-combustion system using a recirculating fluidized bed for multi-pollutant control. Lime and silica lime sorbents will be tested because they are chemically similar to wastes produced by dry    scrubbers. Using calcium-based sorbents could lower mercury removal costs by almost 50 percent from current estimates. Project partners are ARCADIS Geraghty & Miller Inc., Denver, CO; Southern Company Services, Birmingham, AL; and the Tennessee Valley Authority, Knoxville, TN.         ·           Powerspan Corp., Durham, NH         Project Summary: Powerspan Corp. will pilot test a multi-pollutant technology that converts mercury into mercuric oxide, nitrogen oxide to nitric acid and sulfur dioxide to sulfuric acid from coal-fired flue gas streams with gas flow rates up to 4,000 cubic feet/minute. Fine particulates will also be collected. Mercury capture is to exceed 90 percent, and an understanding of what influences mercury removal is to be investigated. The project will be conducted at FirstEnergy Corporation's R.E. Burger Generation Station in Akron, OH.         ·           Apogee Scientific Inc., Englewood, CO         Project Summary: Apogee Scientific Inc. will assess up to a dozen carbon-based and other sorbents that are expected to remove more than 90 percent of mercury and cost 40 to 75 percent less than commercial sorbents because they feature inexpensive precursors and simple activation steps. Six to 12 sorbents will undergo fixed-bed adsorption tests with the most promising three to six being further evaluated by injecting them into a pilot-scale electrostatic precipitator and baghouse. Commercial flue gas desulfurization activated carbon will provide the baseline for comparisons. A portable pilot system will be constructed and would accommodate a slipstream ESP or baghouse at minimal cost. Tests will be conducted at Wisconsin Electric's Valley power plant in Milwaukee, WI, and Midwest Generation's Powerton Station in Pekin, IL.    The project team consists of URS Radian, Austin, TX; the Electric Power Research Institute, Palo Alto, CA; the Illinois State Geological Survey, Champaign, IL; ADA Environmental Solutions, Littleton, CO; and    Physical Sciences Inc., Andover, MA.         ·           CONSOL Energy Inc, South Park, PA         Project Summary:    CONSOL will demonstrate a multi-pollutant system to reduce NO x , SO 2 , mercury , acidic gases, and fine particles from smaller coal plants for less money than it costs to control NO x  and SO 2  separately.    Among the innovations CONSOL plans to install at the AES Greenridge Power Plant near Dresden, NY, is a catalytic NO x  reduction technology that works inside the plants ductwork, a low-NO x  combustion technology that burns coal mixed with biomass, and a flue gas scrubber that is less complex and half the cost of conventional systems.         ·           The Energy and Environmental Research Center at the University of North Dakota, Grand Forks, ND         Project Summary:    The project addresses the impact that SCR, SNCR, or flue gas conditioning systems have on total mercury emission and on the speciation of mercury.    The completion date for the final report is June 30, 2002.

SIP-call and Section 126 Petitions over the 7-year period 1999-2005.    It does not include effects from other market influences such as new gas turbine/combined cycle plants, new coal-fired units, refinery/process heaters, industrial boilers, IC engines, and other industrial sources (e.g., cement, steel), which would substantially increase the labor figures given.    Also not included are effects from other regulatory drivers such as ozone attainment controls outside the SIP Call region (e.g., California, Texas), new source review, regional haze, and multi-pollutant.    ·           The figures are based on assumptions and analysis from a March 1994 study prepared by H&W Management Science Consultants (co-sponsored by ICAC) for the U.S. EPA entitled, “Employment Created by NO x  Control and Continuous Emission Monitoring Requirements of Title IV of 1990 Clean Act Amendments.”    This study developed labor factors associated with specific NO x -control technologies in terms of labor hours per kW based on in-depth interviews with air pollution control industry stakeholders.    These factors were applied to projections of affected megawatts.       ·           The above table assumes that the SIP Call will generate 110 GW of SCR, 24 GW of SNCR/Reburn, and 34 GW of low NO x  burner (LNB) and other activity from 1999-2005.    These assumptions are consistent with ICAC and H&W’s “Air Pollution Control Equipment Market Forecasts,” Issue No. 20, September 2001.    After applying the labor factors, in terms of labor hours, SCR, SNCR, and LNB account for 84%, 6%, and 10% respectively.    ·           This analysis assumes 2,080 person-hours in a year.    It further assumes the technology costs from the March 1994 study, i.e.: $60/kW for SCR, $20/kW for SNCR/Reburn, and $20/kW for LNB/Other combustion modifications.    Higher (lower) costs will inflate (deflate) employment figures proportionately.    ·          Economists frequently multiply the number of direct person-hours by two, and sometimes three, to estimate indirect employment.    The purchase power associated with goods and services provided by direct labor is called “the multiplier effect”.    To be conservative, we applied a ratio of two indirect jobs for each direct job in this analysis.              B.        Employment in the Air Pollution Control Technology Industry                         Dollars spent on compliance are recycled in the economy, generating jobs in construction and materials fabrication, in addition to jobs in air pollution control technology companies.    According to

Worldwide, motor vehicles emit well over 900 million metric tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) each year, accounting for more than 15 percent of global fossil fuel-derived CO2 emissions.1 In the industrialized world alone, 20-25 percent of GHG emissions come from the transportation sector. The share of transport-related emissions is growing rapidly due to the continued increase in transportation activity.2 In 1950, there were only 70 million cars, trucks, and buses on the world's roads. By 1994, there were about nine times that number, or 630 million vehicles. Since the early 1970s, the global fleet has been growing at a rate of 16 million vehicles per year. This expansion has been accompanied by a similar growth in fuel consumption.3 If this kind of linear growth continues, by the year 2025 there will be well over one billion vehicles on the world's roads.4 In a response to the significant growth in transportation-related GHG emissions, governments and policy makers worldwide are considering methods to reverse this trend. However, due to the particular make-up of the transportation sector, regulating and reducing emissions from this sector poses a significant challenge. Unlike stationary fuel combustion, transportation-related emissions come from dispersed sources. Only a few point-source emitters, such as oil/natural gas wells, refineries, or compressor stations, contribute to emissions from the transportation sector. The majority of transport-related emissions come from the millions of vehicles traveling the world's roads. As a result, successful GHG mitigation policies must find ways to target all of these small, non-point source emitters, either through regulatory means or through various incentive programs. To increase their effectiveness, policies to control emissions from the transportation sector often utilize indirect means to reduce emissions, such as requiring specific technology improvements or an increase in fuel efficiency. Site-specific project activities can also be undertaken to help decrease GHG emissions, although the use of such measures is less common. Sample activities include switching to less GHG-intensive vehicle options, such as electric vehicles (EVs) or hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). As emissions from transportation activities continue to rise, it will be necessary to promote both types of abatement activities in order to reverse the current emissions path. This Resource Guide focuses on site- and project-specific transportation activities. Over the last decade, efforts to reduce GHG emissions in the U.S. have led to the creation of a number of voluntary programs for registering and crediting project-specific World Resources Institute, Proceed With Caution: Growth in the Global Motor Vehicle Fleet, http://www.wri.org/trends/autos.html. 2 ""Good Practice Greenhouse Abatement Policies: Transport Sector,"" OECD and EIA Information Papers prepared for the Annex I Expert Group on the UNFCCC. OECD and IEA, Paris, November 2000. Emissions exclude land-use change and forestry, and bunker fuels. Annex I countries are those countries that have undertaken binding emission reduction targets under the Kyoto Protocol of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). 3 American Automobile Manufacturers Association (AAMA), World Motor Vehicle Data 1993 (AAMA, Washington, D.C., 1993), p. 23, and American Automobile Manufacturers Association (AAMA), Motor Vehicle Facts and Figures 1996 (AAMA, Washington, D.C., 1996). 4 World Resources Institute, Proceed With Caution: Growth in the Global Motor Vehicle Fleet, http://www.wri.org/trends/autos.html. 1  Overview  1   GHG reduction activities undertaken by individual project developers. Similarly, several international programs have been implemented, including efforts that allow for trading in GHG emission reduction activities. As a result, a small but growing market for the trade in GHG emission reduction credits has emerged, creating an additional incentive for project developers in the transportation sector to undertake GHG reduction projects. Given that EVs and HEVs both emit less GHG emissions compared to conventional vehicles, projects that lead to the introduction of EVs and HEVs could register with the many voluntary GHG reporting programs and may be able to sell the associated GHG reduction credits on the market. However, to participate in these efforts, project developers must be familiar with the procedures for developing and estimating the GHG emissions benefits resulting from the various types of projects. This National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) publication, ""Battery-Powered Electric and Hybrid Electric Vehicles to Reduce Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions: A Resource Guide for Project Development"" provides national and international project developers with a guide on how to estimate and document the GHG emission reduction benefits and/or penalties of battery-powered and hybrid-electric vehicle projects. This primer also provides a resource for the creation of GHG emission reduction projects for the Activities Implemented Jointly (AIJ) Pilot Phase and in anticipation of other marketbased project mechanisms proposed under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Though it will be necessary for project developers and other entities to evaluate the emission benefits of each project on a case-by-case basis, this primer will provide a guide for determining which data and information to include during the process of developing the project proposal. The resource guide first provides an overview of the various technology options for both EVs and HEVs. Sections 1 and 2 briefly summarize the types of EVs and HEVs available and review their performance and estimated costs. These introductory sections are followed by Section 3, which provides an overview of the emerging regulatory frameworks promoting the use of EV and HEVs, including relevant domestic and international climate change policy developments. Section 4 discusses the procedures for estimating GHG emission reductions from EV and HEV projects. This includes a summary of the GHG emissions associated with EVs and HEVs, an overview of studies analyzing potential climate change-related benefits, a description of EV and HEV projects previously implemented, and a discussion of the common procedures required to participate in project-based GHG reduction systems. Finally, section 5 presents a hypothetical case study on how to develop a baseline and estimate the resulting GHG benefits from an EV or HEV project.  2  Overview   1  Hybrid Electric Vehicle Technology Options  HEVs combine the internal combustion engine of a conventional vehicle with the battery and electric motor of an electric vehicle. This combination offers the extended range and rapid refueling that consumers expect from a conventional vehicle, with a significant portion of the energy and environmental benefits of an electric vehicle. The practical benefits of HEVs include improved fuel economy and lower emissions of the full host of criteria pollutants, as well as CO2, compared to conventional vehicles. The inherent flexibility of HEVs will allow them to be used in a wide range of applications, where electric-only vehicles cannot, from personal and public transportation to commercial hauling. As with electric vehicles and conventional vehicles, the main factors that can be used to rate one vehicle over another are: Range: how far can the vehicle travel between refueling? Refueling time: how long does it take to refuel? Refueling infrastructure: how available are refueling stations? Efficiency or fuel economy or gas mileage: how far can the vehicle travel for a given unit of fuel energy, measured in miles per gallon for HEVs and conventional vehicles? Performance: how well does the vehicle handle? Power: what acceleration can the engine deliver? What speeds can it maintain? Safety: how vulnerable is the vehicle to collision? How quickly can it brake? and Cost. These are the elements and questions to keep in mind when considering the relative merits of one vehicle type over another. In general, HEVs typically compare well with their conventional counterparts. They have increased range and mileage, and comparable power, safety and performance. Their main hindrance to mass commercial deployment has been their cost, but this too is becoming more and more competitive. The following paragraphs briefly discuss some of the basic characteristics of HEVs, and more detailed specifications can be found in Appendix 1.  1.1  Types of Vehicles  Many configurations are possible for HEVs. Essentially, a hybrid combines an energy storage system, a power unit, an electric motor, and a vehicle propulsion system. The primary options for energy storage include batteries, ultracapacitors, and flywheels. Although batteries are by far the most common energy storage choice, other possibilities are being researched. Hybrid power units are typically spark ignition internal combustion engines (similar to those employed in conventional vehicles) for light-duty hybrid vehicles and diesel engines for heavy-duty hybrids. Other ""power plant"" options for hybrids include spark ignition direct injection engines (SIDI), gas turbines, and fuel cells. There are two main system types for propulsion, which define the two main branches of hybrid-electric technology: The series configuration, in which the propulsion comes solely from an electric motor. In this case the engine is used to continually repower the battery, and  1 HEV Technology Options  3   The parallel configuration, in which the role of the engine is to provide direct mechanical input to drive the vehicle in parallel with the electric motor, and also to charge the battery. A hybrid's efficiency and emissions depend on the particular combination of subsystems, how these subsystems are integrated into a complete system, and the control strategy that integrates the subsystems. Hybrid vehicle fuel economy ranges from 10 to 15 percent higher than conventional vehicles (for ""mild hybrids"") to between 200 and 300 percent higher for the most advanced systems where increase in fuel efficiency is optimized. The potential gains in fuel efficiency by hybrids are dependent on the type of driving the vehicle is typically used for--higher gains are possible in congested urban driving than highway driving. 1.1.1 Commercially Available Vehicles  Currently, there are only two original equipment manufacturers (OEM) with HEVs on the U.S. market: Honda and Toyota (Honda has two, the Insight and a new Civic Hybrid, and Toyota has one, the Prius). The Honda Insight was the first HEV to be available for public purchase  the two-seat model was introduced across the country in late 1999. The Insight uses an Integrated Motor Assist (IMATM) system, which combines the world's lightest 1.0-liter, 3-cylinder gasoline automobile engine with an ultra-thin electric motor. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has rated the Insight as having a gas mileage of 61-mpg city/70-mpg highway. The cost of the Insight is around $19,000.  Honda Insight, 2002  The Prius was introduced shortly after the Insight and seen far more success in terms of overall sales, although still limited to about 2000 per month5. The main difference is that the Prius seats four and has the exterior of a standard sedan, which makes it more or less interchangeable with conventional passenger vehicles and makes users feel less like they are driving a concept car wherein performance and/or safety might be unreliable. As a result of the increased space and weight, the Prius' gas mileage is lower than that of the Insight, with an EPA rating of 52-mpg city/45-mpg highway. However, the success of the Prius, and the prospect for hybrids in general (especially those that are interchangeable with larger conventional vehicles), have prompted Honda to release a new hybrid model of its popular Civic. It too is a four-door sedan, and gets lower mileage Washington Post Article, ""Half Gas, Half Electric, Total California Cool; Hollywood Gets a Charge Out of Hybrid Cars.""

The cost of both the Prius and Civic hybrid are about $20,000. In the near future, additional HEVs, including Sport Utility HEVs and other large models, are expected from General Motors, Ford, DaimlerChrysler, and others.  Toyota Prius, 2002  1.2  Vehicle Performance  As mentioned previously, well-designed hybrid-electric vehicles have similar capabilities with regard to speed, safety and handling compared to conventional vehicles. In fact, hybrids have the same or greater range than traditional internal combustion engine vehicles  Honda's Insight can go about 700 miles on a single tank of gas, while the Toyota Prius can go about 500 miles  and achieve about twice the fuel economy of their conventional counterparts. The following table compares the characteristics of the Toyota Prius with a conventional automobile of a similar size class: the Honda Civic Sedan DX. For more detail, refer to Appendix 1.

May-June, 2002.  6  1 HEV Technology Options  5   Anecdotally, in terms of operating a new type of vehicle, some drivers have reported needing some time to get used to the fact that the energy-saving engines of some HEVs are designed to shut off automatically when the vehicle is braking or stopped at a red light.  6  2 Battery-Powered EV Technology Options   2  Battery-Powered Electric Vehicle Technology Options  Battery operated electric vehicles are powered by an electric motor that draws on stored electricity from the on-board batteries. Battery operated electric vehicles are sometimes referred to as ""zero emission vehicles"" (ZEVs) (and are classified as such under certain regulatory regimes), because there are no tailpipe emissions (there is no tailpipe), nor are there emissions associated with fuel evaporation, refining, or transport. The designation of ZEV can be misleading, as there are a number of indirect emissions that can be associated with the vehicle--namely during the production of the electricity at the power plant. However, the fact that no emissions come from the vehicle itself has enormous significance in the context of urban air pollution and issues associated with the usage of gasoline and diesel, such as fuel security.  2.1  Types of Vehicles  EVs come in two basic types: ""full function"" EVs that are the equivalent of conventional light-duty vehicles, and ""neighborhood EVs"" that are small, typically two-seater vehicles with limited speed (top speed of 25 mph) and operating range (typically 30 miles) intended for use for short trips on non-highway roads. Neighborhood vehicles, which are recharged at the users' home, can satisfy short-trip transportation needs on local community roads that are not major thoroughfares. It should be noted that neighborhood EVs are not classified as or considered appropriate for use as typical passenger vehicles, nor do they meet the same safety standards as full function EVs and conventional vehicles. However, to date, 34 U.S. states and the District of Columbia have authorized their use on roads with 35 mph speed limits, for which there is a significant niche market. The full function light-duty EVs offered for sale include two two-seater cars, one mid-size station wagon, one pickup truck, one small SUV, and a service van. Ford offers its Th!nk two-seater that has an operating range of 53 miles. General Motors offers their EV1, which has an operating range of up to 90 miles when lead-acid batteries are used, and up to 130 miles when nickel-metal hydride batteries are used. Nissan offers an electric version of their Altra station wagon to customers in California only. The Altra has an operating range of 80 miles using lithium-ion batteries. Ford has an electric version of their small pickup (Ranger) that has a range of 73 miles using lead-acid batteries. Toyota has an electric version of their RAV4 small SUV with an operating range of 126 miles using nickel-metal hydride batteries. The RAV4-EV is only sold to fleet customers in California.  2.2  Vehicle Performance  The driving ranges of battery-operated electric vehicles typically vary from 50 to 130 miles, depending on a vehicle's weight, its design features, and the type of battery it uses.7 Drivers can refuel a battery-operated vehicle by simply plugging it into a special recharging outlet at home, which is both convenient in the sense of allowing drivers to 7 ""Just the Basics: Electric Vehicles, Transportation for the 21st Century,"" Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Office of Transportation Technologies, U.S. Department of Energy.  2 Battery-Powered EV Technology Options  7   refuel overnight at home, and inconvenient, due to the fact that it can take extended periods of time to charge the vehicle. The recharging time depends on the voltage of the recharging station, the ambient air temperature, the size and type of the battery pack, and the remaining electrical energy in storage. Typically, the process takes several hours, but batteries are being developed that can be recharged more quickly. Electric vehicles can be more efficient than conventional vehicles on a purely fuel to motive energy conversion basis, because electric motors are more efficient at low speeds unlike internal combustion engines, and because they do not use any power when coasting or at rest.8 Adding to the efficiency of battery-powered electric vehicles is the technique of regenerative braking. Regenerative braking is the process of slowing and stopping a vehicle by converting its mechanical energy to electric energy, which can then be returned to the vehicle's on-board battery. In a conventional vehicle, this energy is simply wasted as heat. (Many hybrid vehicles also incorporate regenerative braking which contributes significantly to their efficiency improvements.) Typical figures for electric vehicle efficiencies range from 0.2 to 0.4 kWh per mile traveled. To compare the GHG emissions from an electric vehicle to that of a conventional vehicle, one must first know the source of the electricity used to power the electric vehicle. Electricity derived from hydropower, wind power or other renewable resources would have no GHG emissions, while electricity derived from a coal plant would have nearly identical CO2 emissions as that of a conventional 26 mpg gasoline passenger car9. Therefore a conventional car with above-average efficiency, say of 30 mpg or better, will produce less CO2 than an EV powered by coal-derived electricity. On the other hand, an EV using electricity produced from a source other than coal, such as natural gas, will produce less CO2 emissions. This topic is discussed further in section 4.  2.3  Vehicle Costs  Electric vehicles are about twice as expensive as their conventional fuel counterparts. For example, the EV1 is advertised to cost about $40,000. However, all the major auto manufacturers require that their EVs be leased instead of bought, since manufacturers are uncomfortable selling them at this time, given relative inexperience with maintenance, service, and recharging. The Altra wagon, RAV4-EV, and Ford Ranger EV all lease for $599 per month. Neighborhood electric vehicles range in price from $6,000 to as much as $20,000 depending on amenities and battery technology. For a sample study, completed by Argonne National Laboratory, analyzing the lifecycle costs of EVs versus conventional vehicles please refer to Appendix 4.  It should be noted that when the electricity to be used in an EV is generated inefficiently, the resulting electric vehicle efficiency can often be worse than that of a conventional vehicle. 9 Based on the following assumptions: electric vehicle efficiency of 0.3 kWh/mile (various sources report a range from 0.2 to 0.4 kWh/mile); gasoline vehicle efficiency of 26 miles per gallon; heat rate at coal plant of 9,750 BTU/KWH (35% efficiency); coal carbon content of 26.8 kg Carbon/GJ (IPCC); gasoline carbon content of 2.42 kg C/gallon (EIA).  8  8  2 Battery-Powered EV Technology Options   3  Regulatory and Policy Frameworks Promoting Electric and Hybrid Electric Vehicles Over the past decade, a number of regulatory policies have been introduced in the U.S. to promote the use of EVs and HEVs. Many of these policies are directed toward addressing urban air pollution and reducing fuel use, and not directly geared toward the reduction of GHG emissions. However, by promoting the adoption of more alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs),10 such as EVs and HEVs, they indirectly contribute to the goal of reducing GHG emissions from the transportation sector. In the following discussion, this chapter considers a number of relevant regulations, policies, and programs that encourage the adoption and procurement of EVs and HEVs. A wide variety of direct and indirect regulatory and policy drivers work to promote the broader use of AFVs in the United States, and encourage the development of EV/HEV projects. These measures typically include the following: Regulatory incentives, such as a tax credit or deduction, for the purchase or government procurement of an AFV or AFV-related equipment; Mandates and directives to both public and private fleet operators to purchase AFVs; Emissions standards for AFVs, low emission, or zero emission vehicles that encourage market shifts towards increased development and deployment of AFVs in the automobile market; Special regulations that provide advantages to AFV owners, such as access to high occupancy vehicle lanes, parking lanes, or simplified vehicle registration; and Fuel economy requirements for conventional vehicles that encourage development of more fuel efficiency technologies and vehicles, such as AFVs. Each of these policy approaches has varying impacts on the promotion of AFVs. The chapter addresses federal and state regulatory policies that more directly promote the adoption of EVs and HEVs, primarily considering incentives, procurement mandates, and emissions and technology standards. This chapter is structured to first include an overview of Federal policies and programs targeting EVs and HEVs. The discussion begins with an overview of federal policy, primarily including tax incentives and AFV procurement mandates. Next, the discussion addresses major state policies and programs introduced to encourage the use of EV and HEVs, including California's low 10 The term ""alternative fueled vehicle"" is defined as any dedicated vehicle or a dual fueled vehicle. (EPAct 301.) As provided in EPAct, the term ""alternative fuel"" is defined as: methanol, denatured ethanol, and other alcohols; mixtures containing 85 percent or more (or such other percentage, but not less than 70 percent, as determined by the Secretary, by rule, to provide for requirements relating to cold start, safety, or vehicle functions) by volume of methanol, denatured ethanol, and other alcohols with gasoline or other fuels; natural gas; liquefied petroleum gas; hydrogen; coal-derived liquid fuels; fuels (other than alcohol) derived from biological materials; electricity (including electricity from solar energy); and any other fuel the Secretary determines, by rule, is substantially not petroleum and would yield substantial energy security benefits and substantial environmental benefits.  3 Regulatory and Policy Frameworks  9   emission and zero emission vehicle regulations. Finally, this section concludes with a discussion of the relevant domestic and international climate change policies and programs that are likely to have an influence on the development of EV and HEV markets. It should be noted that while gas and diesel HEV technologies are considered to be AFVs in certain contexts, neither are eligible for the majority of the Federal and state incentives presented below, and therefore the majority of the discussion with regard to incentives will pertain to EVs only. On the other hand, both EVs and HEVs figure prominently in some of the emerging regulations.  3.1  Federal Policies and Programs  Many of the most relevant elements of Federal policy to promote the development and use of alternative fuels in the transportation sector were introduced with the passage of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPAct).11 The primary motivations behind promoting alternative fuels under EPAct included reducing the nation's dependence on foreign oil and increasing the nation's energy security through the use of domestically produced alternative fuels. To do so, EPAct established a goal of replacing 10 percent of petroleum-based motor fuels in the United States by the year 2000 and 30 percent by the year 2010. As discussed below, EPAct addresses EVs and HEVs in two principal ways: first, by providing tax credits and deductions for the purchase of EVs and development of EV infrastructure, and second, by mandating Federal, State, and private ""alternative fuel provider""12 fleets to purchase AFVs (excluding HEVs).13 3.1.1 Federal Tax Incentives for Electric Vehicles  The Federal government introduced two forms of tax incentives relating to EVs under EPAct: a Federal tax credit available to individuals and businesses purchasing qualified EVs;  Energy Policy Act of 1992, Public Law 102-486. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, an alternative fuel provider is defined as: [an entity] that owns, operates, leases, or otherwise controls 50 or more lightduty vehicles (LDVs) in the U.S. that are not on the list of EPAct Excluded Vehicles [such as emergency or law enforcement vehicles]; least 20 of those LDVs are used primarily within a Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA)/Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area (CMSA); those same 20 LDVs are centrally fueled or capable of being centrally fueled. LDVs are centrally fueled if they capable of being refueled at least 75% of the time at a location that is owned, operated, or controlled by any fleet, or under contract with that fleet for refueling purposes. An alternative fuel provider is covered under EPAct if its principal business involves one of the following: producing, storing, refining, processing, transporting, distributing, importing, or selling any alternative fuel (other than electricity) at wholesale or retail; generating, transmitting, importing, or selling electricity at wholesale or retail; or produces and/or imports an average of 50,000 barrels per day or more of petroleum, as well as 30% or more of its gross annual revenues are derived from producing alternative fuels. http://www.ott.doe.gov/epact/alt_fuel_prov.shtml. 13 Although HEVs are fuel efficient and produce low levels of emissions, they do not count as ""alternative fuel vehicles"" because the HEVs on the market today use gasoline rather than alternative fuels. There has been some discussion on including HEVs as AFVs in the future, but no final decision has been made to date. http://www.ott.doe.gov/hev/faqs.html.

Electric Vehicle Tax Credit EPAct established a tax credit for individuals or businesses purchasing qualified EVs that have been put into service between December 20, 1993 and December 31, 2004.14 IRS Form 8834 can be used to determine the credit for qualified electric vehicles placed in service during the year. The tax credit is 10 percent of the purchase price, up to a maximum of $4,000, for qualified EVs placed in service before 2002. Beginning in 2001, the size of the credit is reduced by 25 percent of the original amount per year until the credit is fully phased out. Thus, the tax credit for each vehicle placed in service during 2002 is 7.5 percent of the cost of the qualified EV, up to a maximum credit of $3,000. Credits will be reduced by 50 percent for 2003 vehicles and by 75 percent for 2004 vehicles (see Table 3.1). Table 3-1 Summary of Tax Credits for Qualifying Electric Vehicles Date Dec. 20, 1993 - 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 Deduction Available up to $4,000 up to $3,000 up to $2,000 up to $1,000 None - credit fully phased out  A qualified EV is defined as any motor vehicle that is powered primarily by an electric motor drawing current from rechargeable batteries, fuel cells, or other portable sources of electrical current, was manufactured primarily for use on public streets, roads, and highways, and has at least four wheels. All dedicated, plug-in-only EVs qualify for the tax credit. The credit does not apply to vehicles primarily used outside the United States, vehicles used by any governmental body or agency or any foreign person or entity, or vehicles used by a tax-exempt organization.15 All series and some parallel HEVs meet the aforementioned qualifications, although HEVs that are not powered primarily by an electric motor, such as the Honda Insight or Toyota Prius, do not qualify as EVs. However, part of the cost of these parallel HEVs (up to $2,000 for a vehicle with a gross vehicle weight rating that does not exceed 10,000 pounds) may qualify for the deduction for clean-fuel vehicles, even if they are not used for business purposes. Clean Fuel Vehicle Deduction Similar to the EV tax credit, EPAct established a tax deduction for the purchase of a new OEM qualified clean fuel vehicle, or for the conversion of a vehicle to use a clean-burning fuel.16 EPAct made available a Federal income tax deduction of between $2,000 and $50,000 (per vehicle) for the incremental cost to purchase or convert qualified clean fuel vehicles, including EVs, and for certain kinds of refueling property (see below). The deductions are available for vehicles put into service between December 20, 1993 and December 31, 2004. Like the EV tax credit, the deduction will be reduced by 25 EPAct, Title XIX-Revenue Provisions, Sec. 30, Credit for Qualified Electric Vehicles.

The amount of the tax deductions for qualified clean fuel vehicles is based on the gross vehicle weight and type of vehicle. The tax deduction for clean fuel vehicles is available for any applicable business or personal vehicle, except EVs eligible for the federal EV tax credit. The deduction is not amortized and must be taken in the year the vehicle is acquired.17 As provided in Table 3-2, the tax deduction for trucks or vans with gross vehicle weight of between 10,000 and 26,000 lbs is $5,000 per vehicle. The deduction is $50,000 per vehicle for trucks and vans over 26,000 lbs, or buses with seating capacity of 20 or more adults. Other clean fuel vehicles may qualify for a $2,000 credit. Table 3-2 also provides the maximum deductions for vehicles put into service after 2001 and through 2004, the final year the deduction may be taken before it is fully phased out. Table 3-2.

It also includes the battery itself.18  U.S. Department of Energy, Alternative Fuel Vehicle Fleet Buyer's Guide, http://www.fleets.doe.gov/cgi-bin/fleet/main.cgi?17357,state_ins_rep,5,468050; see also IRS Publication 535. 18 Alternative Fuel Vehicle Fleet Buyer's Guide, http://www.fleets.doe.gov/cgibin/fleet/main.cgi?17357,state_ins_rep,5,468050; see also IRS Publication 535.  17  12  3 Regulatory and Policy Frameworks   Exemption of EVs from Luxury Taxes In addition to the tax incentive provisions under EPAct, the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 (P.L. 105-34) amended the Internal Revenue Code to exempt EVs from Federal excise ""luxury"" taxes and from ""luxury"" depreciation schedules.19 3.1.2 Alternative Fuel Vehicle Requirements for Federal, State, and Alternative Fuel Provider Fleets  EPAct Procurement Requirements for AFVs in Federal Fleets In addition to the tax provisions established under EPAct, the law mandated Federal, state, and ""alternative fuel provider"" fleets to purchase AFVs, including EVs. These provisions have been underscored by a series of Executive Orders that further the commitments of Federal agency fleets to adopt AFVs. Likewise, state and alternative fuel provider fleets must meet the requirements outlined in the Alternative Fuel Transportation Program, Final Rule under the EPAct implementing regulations.20 Section 303 of EPAct requires Federal agencies to acquire a specified number of AFVs, starting in 1993. Under the Act, the Federal Government was required to acquire at least 5,000 light duty AFVs in FY1993, 7,500 light duty AFVs in FY1994, and 10,000 light duty AFVs in FY1995. Following FY1995, all Federal fleets consisting of 20 or more light duty motor vehicles must meet a specific percentage requirement for AFVs, including: 25 percent in FY1996, 33 percent in FY1997, 50 percent in FY1998, and 75 percent in FY1999 and thereafter.21 These requirements are summarized in Table 3-3 below. (See ""Success of the EPAct AFV Program for Federal Fleets"" later in this section for a summary of the success of the EPAct AFV directives.) Table 3-3. Summary of EPAct Requirements for Federal Government Acquisition of Light Duty AFVs Applicable Fleet Entire Federal Government Number of AFVs Required 5,000 total, Government-wide 7,500 total, Government-wide 10,000 total, Government-wide 20% of each fleet Each Federal fleet with 20 or more light duty vehicles 33% of each fleet 50% of each fleet 75% of each fleet  Fiscal Year Vehicle Acquired FY1993 FY1994 FY1995 FY1996 FY1997 FY1998 FY1999 and thereafter  EPAct established a credit system to aid the different agencies in meeting their AFV targets, whereby vehicle procurement agents may receive a specific number of credits when procuring different types of AFVs. Federal and State government agencies that are unable to meet their requirements, as well as alternative fleet providers, may then purchase credits from those agencies or fleet providers that exceed their procurement requirement (see Table 3-5).22 Furthermore, to encourage and promote the use of AFVs in Federal fleets, EPAct also provides an agency incentive program and a recognition and incentive awards program for Federal agencies. Under the Act, the General See http://www.fourmilab.ch/ustax/www/t26-D-31-A-4001.html. 10 CFR Part 490. 21 EPAct 303.

Both were superceded by Executive Order 13149, signed in April 21, 2000, which further strengthened the Federal government's commitment to promote the use of alternative fuel vehicles in Federal fleets. Executive Order (E.O.) 13149 requires Federal agencies operating 20 or more motor vehicles within the United States to reduce the fleet's annual petroleum consumption by 20 percent below FY1999 levels by the end of FY2005.26 To meet this goal, Federal agencies are given significant flexibility in developing an appropriate strategy to meet the petroleum reduction levels. Agencies are required to use alternative fuels, such as electricity, to meet the majority of the fuel requirements for vehicle fleets operating in ""metropolitan statistical areas,"" i.e., metropolitan areas with populations of more than 250,000 in 1995 according to the Census Bureau. Where feasible, the Order also instructs agencies to consider procuring ""innovative"" alternative fuel vehicles that are capable of large improvements in fuel economy, such as HEVs. Agencies are required to increase the average EPA fuel economy rating of their light-duty vehicle acquisitions by at least one mile per gallon (mpg) by 2002 and 3 mpg by 2005 above 1999 acquisition levels. Agencies are also encouraged to adopt awards and performance evaluation programs that reward federal employees for exceptional performance in implementing the Order.27 Federal fleet requirements under E.O. 13149 are summarized in Table 3-4.  Table 3-4.

As established under EPAct (described above), credits received for the acquisition of AFVs (by government or non-governmental entities) are freely transferable among fleet owners and others required to acquire AFVs under the Act.28 Fleet owners that do not meet the EO acquisition requirements for AFVs may thus purchase credits from fleet owners with a surplus of AFVs credits. Under the Order, agencies receive: (1) one credit for each light-duty AFVs acquired; (2) two credits for each light-duty AFV that exclusively uses an alternative fuel and for each ZEV (see section 3.2 below for a discussion of ZEVs); (3) three credits for dedicated medium-duty AFVs; and (4) four credits for dedicated heavy-duty AFVs.29 This provision enhances the credit allowances under EPAct, which awards a single credit for each AFV acquired.30 Table 3-5 summarizes the number of credits available for each type of acquired AFV. Table 3-5 Summary of Credits for Federal Fleet Acquisitions of AFVs under Executive Order 13149 Type of AFV Each light-duty AFV Each light-duty AFV exclusively using an alternative fuel Each ZEV Each dedicated medium-duty AFV Each dedicated heavy-duty AFV Number of Credits Awarded 1 credit 2 credits 2 credits 3 credits 4 credits  In order to provide for adequate access to refueling infrastructure, Federal agencies are directed under E.O. 13149 to ""team with state, local, and private entities to support the expansion and use of"" public refueling stations for AFVs.31 State, local, and private groups may also establish non-public alternative fuel stations if no commercial infrastructure is available in their territory.32 Success of the EPAct AFV Program for Federal Fleets According to the Department of Energy (DOE) Clean Cities Report Federal Fleet AFV Program Status, dated June 2, 1998, as of 1998, of more than 570,000 vehicle acquisitions overall, the estimated cumulative total AFV acquisitions in Federal agencies totaled more than 34,000 vehicles between FY1991 and FY1998. This represented about 80 percent compliance with the 44,600 required AFV acquisitions under EPAct. Only several hundred of the AFVs acquired were qualified EVs.33 EPAct 508.

As stated in the report: Of the 34,000+ AFVs acquired by Federal agencies, approximately 10,000 (30 percent) have been M-85 (methanol mixed with gasoline) flexible fuel vehicles, 6,000 (17 percent) have been E-85 (ethanol mixed with gasoline) flexible fuel vehicles, and 18,000 (52 percent) have been compressed natural gas (CNG) vehicles. Several hundred each of electric and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG or propane) vehicles have also been acquired. Projections for future Federal AFV acquisitions, based on discussions with Federal 29 28  3 Regulatory and Policy Frameworks  15   In January 2002, three environmental organizations filed a lawsuit in Federal court against 17 Federal agencies for allegedly failing to comply with the AFV acquisition requirements imposed under EPAct.34 The plaintiffs claim that all 17 agencies have failed: (1) to meet their AFV acquisition requirements; (2) to file the necessary compliance reports with Congress; and (3) to make these reports available to the public. The complaint also alleges that DOE failed to complete a required private and municipal AFV fleet rulemaking. As a remedy, the plaintiffs request that the court order the agencies to comply with these requirements, and to require the agencies to offset their future vehicle purchases with the number of AFVs necessary to bring them into compliance with EPAct's acquisition requirements for 1996 through 2001. A decision on the case is pending.35 EPAct Procurement Requirements and Incentives for AFVs in Alternative Fuel Provider and State Fleets In addition to Federal fleet requirements, EPAct established the State and Alternative Fuel Provider (S&FP) Program, a DOE regulatory program that requires covered state and ""alternative fuel provider"" fleets to purchase AFVs as a portion of their annual light duty vehicle acquisitions.36 It is important to note, as mentioned above, that HEVs do not qualify as AFVs under the program because they are not primarily powered by the electric motor.37 As required by EPAct, DOE has developed a mandatory vehicle schedule for acquiring light duty AFVs, including electric vehicles, for alternative fuel providers and states. The mandatory acquisition schedule for alternative fuel provider fleets is: 30 50 70 90 percent percent percent percent for for for for model model model model year year year year 1997; 1998; 1999; and 2000 and thereafter.38  The AFV regulations cover a state agency if it owns or operates 50 or more light-duty vehicles, at least 20 of which are used primarily within a metropolitan area.39 States are required to prepare plans for implementing an AFV program and various policy incentives that may be used to encourage the adoption of AFVs.40 The mandatory acquisition schedule of AFVs for state government fleets is: 10 percent for model year 1997; 15 percent for model year 1998; agencies' procurement personnel and manufacturers, indicate that flexible fuel E-85 vehicles will be the most common AFV procured by agencies' to comply with EPACT, followed by CNG.

As with the Federal AFV program, states and alternative fuel providers that exceed EPAct requirements receive additional credits, while those that are unable to meet the requirements by acquiring AFVs may purchase credits from those holding them.42 As of FY2002 (MY2001), states and alternative fuel provider fleets have collectively acquired more than 60,000 AFVs since the launch of the program, exceeding the program quota.43 According to the 2001 Annual Report, only about 9% of the S&FP fleets had failed to comply with program requirements. About 4.5% of AFVs acquired were qualified electric vehicles.44 Box 3-1 Calculating the Petroleum Equivalency Factor (PEF)  The PEF methodology was developed by DOE to compare the fuel economy of EVs with that of conventional gasoline vehicles. The PEF equation is: PEF = Eg * 1 / 0.15 * AF * DPF Where: Eg = average fossil fuel electricity generation efficiency * average electricity transmission efficiency * refining and distribution efficiency * watt-hours energy per gallon gasoline conversion factor = gasoline-equivalent energy content of electricity factor 1/0.15 AF DPF = Fuel content factor = Petroleum-based accessory factor = Driving pattern factor  3.1.3  Petroleum Equivalency Factors for Electric Vehicles  One significant regulatory development has been the determination of petroleumequivalent fuel economy values for EVs. These factors can be used by automobile manufacturers in the total calculation of a manufacturer's corporate average fuel economy (CAFE), according to regulations prescribed by EPA and the Department of Transportation. On June 12, 2000, DOE released the final calculation to be used to determine the petroleum-equivalency factor (PEF) for EVs. This procedure is described further in Box 3-1. Under the final PEF calculation, an EV achieving 0.24 kWh/mile and having no petroleum-fueled accessories (e.g., a diesel-fired heater or defroster) would receive a petroleum-based fuel economy value of 335.24 mpg.45  10 CFR 490.201.

The most prominent of these are the Securing America's Future Energy Act of 2001 (HR 4), and the Advanced Motor Vehicle Technology and Alternative Fuels Consumer Incentives Act (S. 760). Both would extend the Federal tax credit of $4,000 for the purchase of light-duty EVs to 2007, with HR 4 providing an additional $1,000 tax credit for EVs with a driving range of 70 miles or higher for a single charge, and S. 760 providing an additional $2,000 tax credit for EVs with a driving range of 100 miles or higher for a single charge. Higher tax credits are available for heavier-duty BEVs. S. 760 would also provide a 10 percent tax credit of up to $4,000 for purchase of neighborhood EVs. Base tax credits of $4,000 are available for fuel cell vehicles in both bills with up to an additional $4,000 depending on the fuel economy increase over conventional vehicles. The credits for fuel cell vehicles are dependent on meeting Tier 2, Bin 5 emission standards. Tax credits for fuel cell vehicles under both bills would extend through 2011. Tax credits for HEVs in S. 760 are dependent on the power of the electric drive portion of the powertrain, and the increase in fuel economy relative to conventional vehicles, and on meeting Tier 2, Bin 5 emission standards starting in 2004. A maximum of $4,000 in tax credits would be available for HEVs in S. 760. HR 4 has very similar provisions except that it does not have an emissions requirement, and it adds a ""conservation credit"" of up to $500 dependent on the lifetime fuel savings of the HEV. In total, an HEV could get up to $5,000 under HR 4. HR 4 would also extend tax deductions available for development of clean fuel infrastructure through 2007.  3.2 3.2.1  State Policies and Programs California  Low Emission Vehicle (LEV) and Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) Regulations With the exception of the State of California, Section 209(a) of the Federal Clean Air Act (CAA) prohibits states from adopting or enforcing standards for new motor vehicles or new motor vehicle engines.46 In response to California's severe air pollution problems, CAA Section 209(b) grants the State the explicit authority to set its own standards for vehicular emissions, so long as the standards are equal to, or more stringent than, those set by the CAA and are approved by EPA.47 State studies have found that about half of smog-forming pollutants are produced by gasoline and diesel-powered vehicles, and that only alternative technologies would help California reduce motor vehicle air pollution that will result from increasing driving rates in the State.48 As provided in the Clean Air Act, other states are permitted to follow California so long as any motor vehicle emissions regulations adopted by those states are identical to California's.49 Since California introduced its LEV standards in 1990, four other States-- New York, Massachusetts, Maine, and Vermont--have adopted the California emissions requirements for a percentage of motor vehicles sold in those states (see Section 3.2.2).  42 U.S.C. 7609(a). 42 U.S.C. 7609(b). 48 See California's Zero Emission Vehicle Program, CARB, http://www.arb.ca.gov/msprog/zevprog/factsheet/evfacts.pdf. 49 42 U.S.C. 7507. 47  46  Fact  Sheet,  12/06/01  18  3 Regulatory and Policy Frameworks   LEV I Regulatory Program The flexibility provided to California under the CAA paved the way for sweeping regulation that has established extensive standards for low and zero emissions vehicles sold in the State. Under CAA authority, in 1990 the California Air Resources Board (CARB) adopted regulations to require automobile manufacturers to introduce lowemission vehicles (LEVs)--and ZEVs--to the automobile market in the State. The regulations would require manufacturers to sell a certain percentage of these vehicles each year. Known as LEV I, the new standards promised to introduce EVs, HEVs, and various other low emission vehicles, and to affect the entire automobile market in California. LEV I standards are based on the introduction of four classes of vehicles with increasingly more stringent emissions requirements. These include: transitional low emissions vehicles (TLEVs); low-emission vehicles (LEVs); ultra-low-emission vehicles (ULEVs); and zero emissions vehicles (ZEVs)50. Under the LEV I requirements, as of 1994 manufacturers are permitted to certify vehicles in any combination of the LEV categories through 2003 in order to satisfy the LEV standard.51 It should be noted that under current regulations, auto manufacturers are also required to comply with a fleet-based average Non-Methane Organic Gas standard (NMOG), which introduces more and more stringent standards with each model year.52 LEV II Regulatory Program Following a hearing in November 1998, the CARB amended the LEV I regulations and adopted LEV II, the second-generation LEV program. While the first set of LEV standards covered 1994 through 2003 models years, the LEV II regulations cover 2004 through 2010 and represent continued emissions reductions. The LEV II amendments were formally adopted by the CARB on August 5, 1999 and came into effect on November 27, 1999.53 The more stringent LEV II regulations were adopted in part to keep up with changing passenger vehicle fleets in the state, where more sport utility vehicles (SUVs) and pickup trucks are used as passenger cars rather than work vehicles. The LEV II standards were a necessary step for the state to meet the Federally-mandated CAA goals that address ambient air quality standards as outlined in the 1994 State Implementation Plan (SIP).54 LEV II increased the stringency of the emission standards for all light- and medium-duty EVs provide the only automobile technologies available today that can meet the ZEV standard.

California's fleet average NMOG mechanism ""requires manufacturers to introduce an incrementally cleaner mix of Tier 1, TLEV, LEV, ULEV and ZEV vehicles each year, with the fleet average NMOG value for passenger cars and lighter light-duty trucks decreasing from 0.25 gram/mile in the 1994 model year to 0.062 gram/mile in the 2003 model year.""

In addition, fleet average durability standards are extended from 100,000 to 120,000 miles. LEV II also allows manufacturers to receive credits for vehicles meeting near-zero emissions, such as fuel cell HEVs, and a new category of vehicles called super ultra-low emissions vehicles (SULEVs).57 The LEV II standards were also designed to respond to some delays and ""inertia"" the LEV program had been facing, and pushed back the starting year of the program to 2003. Under LEV II, manufacturers may certify vehicles under one of five emission standards, listed in order from least to most stringent: transitional low emissions vehicles (TLEVs) low-emission vehicles (LEVs); ultra-low-emission vehicles (ULEVs); super ultra-low emissions vehicles (SULEVs); and zero emissions vehicles (ZEVs). Some examples of LEV I and LEV II emissions standards for the different vehicles types are provided in Tables 3-6 and 3-7.

This requirement, known as the ""ZEV Mandate"" requires that a specific minimum percentage of passenger cars and the lightest light-duty trucks marketed in California by large or intermediate volume manufacturers be ZEVs. (As noted below, requirements differ based on the manufacturer's volume of sales.)60 To initiate the process for car manufacturers to begin to adapt to the new ZEV requirements, the program at first required car manufacturers to implement a number of small demonstration fleets of ZEVs in the early 1990s and then to gradually implement efforts to market ZEVs to the general public starting in 2003. With the adoption of the newer LEV II regulations, ZEVs considered in the program now include: Pure ZEVs (ZEVs)--vehicles with no tailpipe emissions whatsoever; Partial ZEVs (PZEVs)--vehicles that qualify for a partial ZEV allowance of at least 0.2 (before an additional ""early introduction phase-in multiplier"" or ""highefficiency multiplier"" are applied to the allowance); and Advanced Technology PZEVs (AT PZEVs)--any PZEV with an allowance greater than 0.2.61 Pure ZEVs must produce zero exhaust emissions of any criteria or precursor pollutant under any and all possible operational modes and conditions. AT PZEVs include compressed natural gas, HEVs, and methanol fuel cell vehicles. In order to qualify as a PZEV, the AT PZEVs would also have to meet the SULEV tailpipe emissions standard, achieve zero evaporative emissions and include a 150,000-mile warranty for emission control equipment.62 The Executive Officer of CARB is responsible for certifying new 2003 and all subsequent model year (MY) ZEVs.63 The total required volume of a manufacturer's production and delivery for sale of Passenger Cars (PCs) and Light-Duty Trucks 1 (LTD1s) is based on the average from the previous three-year period. The production average is used only for the ZEV requirement. The manufacturer may also choose an alternative to the three-year averaging approach by choosing to base production volumes on an annual basis, using the first year in the three year period and every year thereafter, respectively. The original LEV I regulations required that specific percentages of all PCs and LDT1s, MY1998 and later, be certified as ZEVs. Under the original rulemaking, the required percentages were: 2 percent of the total volume of a manufacturer's production and delivery for sale for 1998-2000 model year vehicles, 5 percent of the total volume for 2001-2002 model year vehicles, and 10 percent of the total volume for 2003 and subsequent model year vehicles. See California Air Resources Board, Notice Of Public Hearing To Consider The Adoption Of Amendments To The Low-Emission Vehicle Regulations, November 15, 2001. 61 California Air Resources Board, California Exhaust Emission Standards and Test Procedures for 2003 and Subsequent Model Zero-Emission Vehicles, and 2001 and Subsequent Model Hybrid Electric Vehicles, in the Passenger Car, Light-Duty Truck, and Medium-Duty Vehicle Classes. (Amended: April 12, 2002), pages A,B-1 to A,B-2. (hereinafter California Exhaust Emission Standards and Test Procedures). Qualified PZEVs meet SULEV, evaporative emissions, and onboard diagnostic standards, and offer an extended warranty of 15 years or 150,000 miles, whichever occurs first.

These amendments significantly reduce the number of full function ZEVs that will be required in the initial years of the program, but nevertheless institute a gradual increase in the minimum required percentage of ZEVs in sales fleets-- from 10 percent in 2003 up to 16 percent in 2018.66 As of Summer 2002, these most recent June 1, 2001 amendments are still pending, but are expected to be adopted without significant additional changes.67 LEV II requirements are compared with the LEV I requirements in Table 3-6. Unlike the previous regulations, the most recent amendments require large and intermediate volume manufacturers to meet different percentage of sales requirements for pure ZEVs, PZEVs, and AT PZEVs.68 Under the latest proposals, major automakers (those selling 35,000 or more passenger cars and light-duty trucks annually in California) could meet the 10 percent requirement for ZEVs sold in the State by selling 20% of their ZEV vehicles as pure ZEVs, 60% as PZEVs, and 20% as AT PZEVs. Intermediate automakers (those selling 4,501 to 35,000 passenger cars and light-duty trucks annually in California) could meet their entire ZEV requirement with PZEV credits, and manufacturers selling fewer than 4,500 vehicles annually would not have to meet any ZEV requirement.69 Table 3-8 summarizes these requirements. (Small and independent low volume manufacturers are exempt from the ZEV requirements but can acquire credits for the sale of ZEVs or PZEVs).

Beginning in 2007, automobile manufacturers must also include heavier SUVs, pickup trucks, and vans in the sales figures used to calculate each automaker's ZEV requirement. In other words, in order to sell more SUVs and other heavier vehicles, each automaker must also sell more ZEVs.73 Finally, in order to ensure effective cooperation between the State of California and auto manufacturers in implementing the LEV regulatory program, and to encourage continued research and development, demonstration, and commercialization of low and zero emission vehicle technologies, the State entered a separate memorandum of agreement (MOA) with each of the seven largest auto manufacturers. Each MOA represents a commitment between the auto manufacturer and the CARB to ensure the successful  California Exhaust Emission Standards and Test Procedures, page C-2.

Like the Federal Alternative Fuel Vehicle program, the California program includes a range of credits that provide incentives for the development of ZEV vehicles with improved range and refueling capacity. The amended California ZEV program envisions awarding additional credits for ZEVs introduced ahead of schedule. Automakers will receive four times the normal number of credits for each ZEV introduced in 2001-2002, and 1.25 times the normal number of credits for each ZEV introduced between 2003 and 2005. The provisions also reduce the minimum number of extra credits available for ZEV models with extended ranges of 50 or more miles to 100 or more miles, and provide 10 credits for ZEVs with ranges of 275 or more miles. Extra credits are also awarded for vehicles that can refuel or charge in less than 10 minutes for a 60-mile range. Credits available for small, neighborhood EVs (NEVs) with limited speed and range are increased from one credit per vehicle to: 4.0 credits for each NEV introduced in 2001-2002; 1.25 credits in 2003; and 0.625 credit for 2004-2005; and 0.15 credit thereafter. ZEVs that remain on the road in California for more than three years also receive additional credits.76 Grants. The CARB recently took steps to complement recent regulatory amendments to the LEV II program with financial incentives that would encourage consumers to purchase ZEVs prior to the mandated start year of 2003. The CARB is setting up a $38 million program to provide incentives to consumers who are interested in buying or leasing ZEVs. This would add to the $20 million in the Governor's 2001-2002 budget and $18 million already planned for incentives. To help consumers defray the cost of some types of ZEVs, the incentive programs will provide grants of up to $9,000 over three years for ZEVs leased prior to 2003. Grants of up to $5,000 would be available thereafter.77 A significant number of State and local government grant programs provide additional financial incentives to consumers for the purchase of ZEVs.78 Carpool Lanes. An added incentive for the use of ZEVs, ULEVs, and SULEVs was the recent adoption of a law in California that allows single-occupant use of High Occupancy Vehicle (HOVs) lanes by certain electric and AFVs. Use of these lanes normally requires that vehicles have at least two occupants. In order to use these lanes with only one occupant, eligible vehicle owners must obtain an identification sticker from the California Department of Motor Vehicles. Although HEVs such as the Toyota Prius and Honda Insight do not qualify for the special use of HOV lanes, over 55 ZEVs, ULEVs, SULEVs, and compressed natural gas vehicle models do.79  http://www.arb.ca.gov/msprog/zevprog/factsheet/moa.htm.

Without explicit direction in the California Building Standards governing the proper installation of electric vehicle charging and supply equipment (California Code of Regulation, Title 24), there were inconsistent requirements imposed by building departments from different jurisdictions that oversee electricity usage and EV charging infrastructure.80 As a result of these concerns, the CARB has recently adopted a series of rules to standardize and create incentives for the development of EV infrastructure. Regulations going into effect in 2006 require ""on-board conductive charging"" as the standardized charging system for EVs in California. ZEVs qualifying for one or more credits and all grid-connected HEVs (referred to as extended range HEVs in California regulations) will need to be equipped with a conductive connector vehicle inlet.81 A number of demonstration programs are currently being implemented in the State to identify opportunities for effective EV infrastructure development.82 Regulation of Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Motor Vehicles On July 11, 2002, the California Legislature passed landmark legislation to propose adopting the first GHG emission regulations on motor vehicles in the United States. AB 1493, expected to be signed into law by the Governor of California at the time of publication of this report, could significantly enhance the objectives of the State's LEV and ZEV program. The law requires the CARB to adopt regulations for carbon dioxide emissions from passenger cars, light trucks, and SUVs by January 1, 2005. The bill directs the CARB to adopt regulations ""that achieve the maximum feasible reduction of GHGs emitted by passenger vehicles and light-duty trucks and any other vehicles"" 83 in the state. The law would take effect January 1, 2006 and would apply to vehicles manufactured in the 2009 model year and after. One interesting condition in the final legislation is to require CARB to develop regulations that specifically do not: (1) impose additional fees or taxes on motor vehicles, fuel, or miles traveled; (2) ban the sale of any vehicle category in the state; (3) require reductions in vehicle weight; (4) limit speed limits; or (5) limit vehicle miles traveled. AB 1493 would also require the California Climate Action Registry to develop procedures by July 1, 2003, in consultation with CARB, for the reporting and registering of vehicular GHG reductions to the Registry. (The California Registry is described in greater detail in Section 3.3) As stipulated in the Clean Air Act, once AB 1493 is signed into law, other states would be able to follow California in adopting equally stringent regulation of carbon dioxide emissions from automobiles. 3.2.2 Adoption of California LEV II Standards in Northeastern States  As discussed, California is the only State with the ability to adopt motor vehicle emissions standards that exceed those of the CAA.84 However, under Section 177 of the CAA other States are permitted to adopt any regulations to address motor vehicle emissions that are enacted and adopted by California, so long as the regulations are no more stringent than California's standards and a two-year lead-time is provided prior to the date the regulations come into effect. In the early 1990s, New York, Massachusetts, Maine, and Vermont adopted the California LEV standards. 80 81 82 83 84  http://www.afdc.doe.gov/altfuel/ele_standard.html.

In 2000 and 2001, respectively, New York and Massachusetts took the further steps of adopting California's LEV II regulations, as amended.86 Vermont has yet to adopt the most recently amended LEV II regulations, but is expected to do so in 2002. Beginning in model year 2005, New York also will require the LEV II program for medium-duty vehicles, including larger pickup trucks and SUVs weighing between 8,500 and 14,000 pounds.87 To date, New York and Massachusetts have adopted regulations that would provide automobile manufacturers greater flexibility in complying with the ZEV mandate. Manufacturers can choose to comply with either the California ZEV mandate beginning in model year 2005, or can opt into what is called the northeast states' ZEV Alternative Compliance Plan (ACP) in model year 2004, as explained in Table 3-9 below. In either case, manufacturers will be required to implement the full California ZEV mandate in model year 2007.88 Table 3-11 Model Year 2004 2005  Summary of Alternative Compliance Plan for ZEVs in New York and Massachusetts89 Type of Vehicle PZEVs PZEVs AT PZEVs or pure ZEVs PZEVs AT PZEVs pure ZEVs PZEVs Percentage Requirements 10% of all vehicle sales 9% of all vehicle sales 1% of all vehicle sales 7% of all vehicle sales 2% of all vehicle sales 1% of all vehicle sales 6% of all vehicle sales 2% of all vehicle sales 2% of all vehicle sales  2006  2007  AT PZEVs pure ZEVs  Any manufacturer opting to use the ACP will be required to submit a projected compliance report at the beginning of each model year.

More than ten states now have laws in place that provide tax incentives to individuals or businesses for the purchase of AFVs, including EVs. In addition to the California LEV II regulations, typical state regulations include the following (note, state abbreviations are provided for each applicable regulation below): 90 access to HOV lanes for HEVs, EVs, and other LEVs at any time, and regardless of the number of people occupying the vehicle (AZ, GA, UT, VA); exemptions for EVs from parking and other fees (HI); individual or business tax incentives, including tax credits or deductions, for the purchase of AFVs and LEVs, including EVs (AZ, GA, KS, LA, ME, MD, NY, OK, OR, UT, VA); individual or business tax incentives, including tax credits or deductions, for the construction of AFV and LEV fuel delivery systems (AZ, LA, RI, VA); tax incentives, including tax credits or deductions, for manufacturers of AFVs and LEVs (AK, MI); tax credits for each job created in manufacturing clean fuel vehicles or converting vehicles to operate on clean fuels (VA); exemption of state and/or local sales tax for the purchase of AFVs or AFV conversion equipment (AZ, NH, PA); adjustments to fuel taxes to reflect use of AFVs (HI); grants to businesses, individuals, local governments, and non-profit organizations towards the purchase of AFVs or AFV fleets (AZ, CA, PA); regulations to facilitate the commercialization of AFVs, including EVs and HEVs (NH); requirements for state and municipal fleets to acquire AFVs and LEVs, to convert fleets to AFVs, to meet specific clean fuel standards, or to develop AFV infrastructure (DC, LA, MA, MI, MO, NV, NH, NM, NY, OK); exemption for certain AFVs or LEVs from emissions inspections and other motor vehicle registration fees and requirements (AZ); regulations addressing clean fuel vehicle identification labels or decals (CA); exemptions from vehicle registration requirements for AFVs, including EVs, neighborhood electric vehicles (NEVs), and electric motor golf carts (AZ); permission for certain types of AFVs, such as electric scooters, to be ridden on public streets (CA); special requirements for public utilities to adopt and/or promote LEVs (CA); and research programs for the study of AFV technologies (SC, TN).  3.3  Relevant Domestic and International Climate Change Policy and Market Developments  U.S. and international climate change policy could have a dramatic influence on the development of EVs and HEVs and their expanded use throughout the world. Significant international attention has been given to the adoption of the Kyoto Protocol--the binding international framework for implementing specific actions to reduce a country's GHG emissions--by parties to the UNFCCC. Excluding the U.S., most parties to the UNFCCC have either ratified or have expressed commitments to ratify the Kyoto Protocol. However, in 2001, President Bush announced complete U.S. withdrawal from the Kyoto Protocol, instead offering that the U.S. would develop an alternative approach to reducing For a full list of States with related laws and regulations, and a description of each, see EVAA, State Laws and Regulations Impacting Electric Vehicles (January 2002), http://www.evaa.org. 90  28  3 Regulatory and Policy Frameworks   domestic GHG emissions. At the time of publication of this report, many of the details of that domestic policy are still under development, but generally include the following key components: a commitment to reduce GHG emissions intensity--the ratio of GHG emissions to economic output--by 18 percent over ten years; improvements to the U.S. national GHG emissions registry (reporting) program, known as the Voluntary Reporting of GHGs ""1605(b)"" Program (established under Section 1605(b) of EPAct), now implemented by the Energy Information Administration (EIA) in DOE; protection and provision of transferable credits for GHG emission reductions under a future climate change regime; and a commitment of financial and technical resources for the continued research of climate change and innovative new technologies to reduce GHG emissions.91 In addition to policy developments at the national level, a number of U.S. States and local communities have introduced various legislative initiatives to reduce GHG emissions. These initiatives often reach even further than the measures proposed by the Bush Administration. Most of the policies implemented to date, target the electricity sector by capping emissions from power plants (Massachusetts and New Hampshire) or by setting emissions standards for new facilities (Oregon).92 However, as described in Section 3.2.1, the State of California recently passed a bill to reduce GHG emissions from the transportation sector, mandating improved efficiency standards. This bill is the first policy initiative in the U.S. to directly influence GHG emissions from the transportation sector. As such, it is likely to have a significant impact on the direction of GHG policy initiatives in the rest of the country and on the future adoption of EVs and HEVs. With respect to GHG registries, a number of efforts are already under way that may contribute to the development of the national GHG emissions reporting program suggested by the President. In addition to the 1605(b) Program, the State of California recently established the California Climate Action Registry, an independent, non-profit organization dedicated to working with industries, power generators, governmental bodies, and others operating in the State of California to develop a systematic and effective GHG emissions reporting system. The newly formed reporting system is designed to include reporting for GHG emissions reductions from clean transportation, such as the adoption of EVs and HEVs in motor vehicle fleets, in addition to industrial combustion activities and electricity consumption. Various other State GHG emissions registries have also been proposed, as well as an alternate Federal registry under the new EPA Climate Leaders Program.93  President Announces Clear Skies & Global Climate Change Initiatives, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Silver Spring, Maryland, February 14, 2002), available at: http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2002/02/20020214-5.html. 92 On January 2, 2002, the New Hampshire House passed HB 284--the New Hampshire Clean Power Act. This multi-pollutant legislation affects six units at three different facilities and includes the following emission reduction requirements by 2006: a 75% reduction in SO2 (3.0 lb/MWh); a 70% reduction in NOX (1.5 lb/MWh); and, a 3% reduction in CO2 compared to 1990 levels. In April, 2001, Massachusetts passed a bill requiring the state's 6 highest emitting power plants to: 1) cap their CO2 emissions at historical levels, and 2) lower their emissions rate to 1,800 lb CO2/MWh by 2006 or 2008, with a goal of reducing total plant emissions by 10%. In 1997, the State of Oregon required all new power plants to comply with a CO2 emission standard, specifying that all new natural gas facilities must have an emissions rate that is at least 17% below the most efficient base load gas plant operating in the U.S. Power plants in all three states are allowed to purchase emission offsets from third-party entities to satisfy these requirements. 93 Id.  91  3 Regulatory and Policy Frameworks  29   With regard to federal support for technology research and development, increased funding levels could potentially lead to advances in HEV, EV, fuel cell, and related clean fuel technologies that help reduce GHG emissions from motor vehicles. The President's budget in FY2003 provides for $4.5 billion for global climate change-related activities, a $700 million increase over previous years.94 It is important to note that, in addition to these recent domestic policy activities, increased international activity to implement the Kyoto Protocol could be a potentially important driver for increased development and implementation of EVs and HEVs in overseas markets. This, in turn, could have meaningful effects on the relative availability and cost of EV and HEV products that can subsequently be used in the U.S.--particularly in States pursuing the California LEV II program. 3.3.1 Greenhouse Gas Registries and Reporting Programs  Over the last decade, various initiatives to register, document and promote voluntary GHG emission reduction measures have been introduced in the U.S. The goal of these programs is to encourage public and private entities to participate in GHG reduction activities and to test procedures for GHG emissions accounting. Each program afford individual project developers with the opportunity to register and document activities that help reduce GHG emissions and to possibly use the registered emission reductions for participation in a future emissions trading regime. The different programs range in scope and project type, and do not all include activities related to transportation. However, three U.S.-based voluntary programs encourage developers of transportation projects to report the environmental benefits of their activities and submit project ideas: DOE's 1605(b) Voluntary Reporting of Greenhouse Gases Program, the California Climate Action Registry, and the U.S. Initiative on Joint Implementation (USIJI). Each of these programs is described below. Appendix 3 also lists several new and proposed State initiatives to register GHG emission reductions, many of which are designed to encourage the development of GHG reduction measures such as the increased use of EVs and HEVs. U.S. Department of Energy's 1605(b) Voluntary Reporting of Greenhouse Gases Program Managed by DOE's EIA, the 1605(b) Voluntary Reporting of Greenhouse Gases Program (created under Section 1605(b) of EPAct) affords any company, organization, or individual with the opportunity to establish a public record of their GHG emissions, emission reductions, and/or sequestration achievements in a central and public database. The program first began accepting reports on GHG reduction activities during calendar year 1995 and is thus among the world's first registries set up to track voluntary GHG activities. Like other registries, 1605(b) lays the foundation for maintaining information about individual projects, and standardizing GHG emissions accounting methodologies, which in turn makes possible the creation of a market wherein GHG emission reduction credits can be traded. Participants generally participate in the program to gain recognition for environmental stewardship, demonstrate support for voluntary approaches to achieving environmental policy goals, support information exchange, and inform the general public about GHG reduction activities. If the participant has the emissions reductions certified by an independent third party entity, and the reductions meet the standards of a given emissions trading regime, then the participant may trade the certified credits within that regime and reap the financial benefits associated with the sale of those credits at market 94  Id.  30  3 Regulatory and Policy Frameworks   price. One example of such a regime, although still in its infancy, is the Chicago Climate Exchange, described in Section 3.3.2. Data from the most recent 1605(b) reporting cycle, covering activities through 2000, were released by EIA in February 2002 and include considerable information on real-world transportation projects. Of the 72 transportation projects reported to the program, fifteen were EV projects involving emissions reductions of roughly 3,923 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2E). Appendix 4 presents summary information on these projects, including the entities that undertook and reported the project, the name, scope and general description of each project, and the methods used to estimate the achieved GHG emission reductions. The data reported to the program is publicly available on DOE's website and may be useful for educational and project replication purposes.95 For more information, contact the 1605(b) Program Communications Center at: 1-800-803-5182 or visit http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/1605/frntvrgg.html. The 1605(b) program will likely receive increased attention in the future, as the Bush Administration is redesigning and grooming it to be the main national system for tracking emissions and emission reduction activities, and perhaps establishing credits. Thus, the standards and methodologies that it establishes may become the default national standard that other registries and reporting programs, such as those mentioned below, will derive from and comply with it. California Climate Action Registry As established under State Senate Bill 1771, the State of California chartered in September, 2002, the California Climate Action Registry--a non-profit organization providing a central and standardized system for reporting annual GHG emissions reductions, including those reductions from motor vehicle activities. In return for voluntary registration of GHG emissions, the Registry promises to use its best efforts to ensure that participating organizations receive appropriate consideration under any future international, federal, or state regulatory regimes relating to GHG emissions.96 Given the steps, described in Section 3.2.1, that California is taking to address vehicular GHG emissions, the registry may gain increased prominence for transportation related activities. For example, the bill directs the California Climate Action Registry to develop procedures for reporting and registering vehicular GHG reductions to the Registry. In contrast to the 1605(b) program, entities participating in the California Registry have to report on all their emissions and emission reductions. At this point in time, the Registry does not accept reports that only include project-specific activities. Companies that wish to report on their transportation-related activities therefore also have to complete an inventory of company-wide emissions before submitting a report to the Registry.

U.S. Initiative on Joint Implementation (USIJI) The U.S. Initiative on Joint Implementation (USIJI) is designated as the official U.S. Government institution accepting jointly implemented GHG emission reduction projects  See http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/1605/frntvrgg.html for more information.

Any U.S. private sector firm, non-governmental organization, government agency, or individual is eligible to submit a project proposal to USIJI,98 including developers of EV and HEV projects. The application criteria for participating in USIJI are outlined in Appendix 5. Proposals must be submitted in partnership with foreign host country participants, including any citizen or entity recognized by a host country, which has signed, ratified or acceded to the UNFCCC. To date, the USIJI has approved 50 projects in 26 countries,99 and while no transportation projects have been approved, representatives of the program have indicated a particular interest in receiving projects that involve emission reductions from this sector. At the time of writing this report, the status of USIJI has been put on hold pending a U.S. government review of how it fits within the Administration's overall climate change strategy. 3.3.2 Emerging Markets for Trading in GHG Credits  Another development, that is likely to have a significant impact on the development of GHG-related transportation projects and the increased market penetration of EVs and HEVs,is the emergence of a new market for trading in GHG emission reduction credits. Though few governments have imposed binding restrictions on GHG emissions, many companies have already begun exploring the benefits and challenges of GHG trading.100 Even without government-imposed restrictions, emission reduction credits still have market value as long as there is a demand for the purchase of these credits. This demand exists and is steadily increasing, driven in part by the anticipation of one or more regulatory regimes, and by the desire to earn a reputation as an environmentally conscious entity. As a result, a small but growing market for the sale and transfer of credits based on GHG reduction activities has evolved over the past few years. As this market continues to grow, opportunities for selling and trading credits derived from GHG reduction activities in the transportation sector will also increase. Potential GHG reduction opportunities that could be generated and sold for credit on the GHG market include projects promoting the use of cleaner vehicle options, such as EVs and HEVs. Trading activities have evolved in concert with a series of project-based mechanisms set up to gain experience and explore ways to address the climate change issue costeffectively. These programs and initiatives include USIJI; Ontario, Canada's multiThe UNFCCC introduced the concept of joint implementation (JI), which refers to arrangements through which an entity in one country partially meets its domestic commitment to reduce GHG levels by financing and supporting the development of a project in another country. To test the concept of JI, the Activities Implemented Jointly (AIJ) Pilot Phase was established at the first Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC (COP-1), held in Berlin in 1995. Projects initiated during this phase were called ""activities implemented jointly"" to distinguish them from the fullyfledged JI projects the Convention may allow in the future. The goal of the AIJ Pilot Phase was to provide developing nations with advanced technologies and financial investment while allowing industrialized nations to fulfill part of their reduction commitment at the lowest cost. Because of the temporary pilot status of this program, it was decided that project developers cannot receive credit or other monetary incentives for projects developed and approved as part of this initiative. 98 For further information on the USIJI program and project criteria, contact USIJI, 1000 Independence Avenue SW, Washington DC 20585, USA.

The European Union is developing the rules for an EU-wide GHG trading program, which is expected to enter into operation in 2005. 97  32  3 Regulatory and Policy Frameworks   stakeholder Pilot Emissions Reduction program (PERT); [not a trading or credit program] the Dutch government's Emission Reduction Unit Procurement Tender (ERUPT); and the World Bank's Prototype Carbon Fund (PCF). Since there is no central recording entity for tracking GHG emissions trades, the actual size of the market is not fully known. However, it is estimated that approximately 65 inter-company transactions have occurred since 1996, involving roughly 50 to 70 million metric tons of CO2E emissions reductions.101 This number may be conservative as several companies are reluctant to make their trading activities public. The price of these trades has ranged between $0.60 and $3.50 per metric ton of CO2E. Most of these trades have been between buyers and sellers in Europe and North America. The majority of these trades have been verified by third party, independent entities. The most popular trading activities have included fugitive gas capture from landfills, fuel switching, energy efficiency, and co-generation.102 None of the trades have involved reductions from transportation activities, highlighting the lack of experience with generating project-based GHG emission reductions in the transportation sector. However, as it is fairly straightforward to monitor and demonstrate ownership for this type of reductions it is likely that the types of activities traded will expand to include emission reductions from transport projects. Chicago Climate Exchange The Chicago Climate Exchange is emerging as one of the key organizations for helping to generate a viable trading market for GHG emissions reduction credits. In June 2001, 33 companies with assets in the midwestern United States (including the Ford Motor Company) announced the formation of the Chicago Climate Exchange (CCX). Led by Environmental Financial Products and the Kellogg Graduate School of Management at Northwestern University, under a grant from the Joyce Foundation, the group will explore the potential for a regional GHG trading exchange in order to achieve a specified level of emission reductions. The companies have indicated in letters to CCX that they will consider trading on the exchange if effective rules are designed. The CCX has proposed that participating companies voluntarily commit to emissions reductions and trading in six GHGs.103 Participants would commit to reducing their GHG emissions by 2 percent below 1999 levels by 2002 and reduce them 1 percent annually thereafter. Credits would be given for domestic and international emissions offsets projects after particular monitoring, verification, tracking and reporting requirements have been fulfilled. Potential emission reduction activities that could receive credit under the Chicago Climate Exchange include projects that reduce emissions from the transportation sector. Sample project types suggested by the CCX include fuel switching and vehicle efficiency improvement projects. The CCX hopes to have the exchange up and running by the third quarter of 2002 for participants in seven states: Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, and Wisconsin. In 2003, the CCX aims to have commitments and trading among participants in the entire United States, Mexico and Canada, and to expand the exchange to include international participants in 2004. 101  Richard Rosenzweig, Matthew Varilek, Ben Feldman, Radha Kuppalli, and Josef Jansen.

The following subsections provide an overview of the issues related to estimating and reporting on the potential GHG emission reductions achieved by replacing conventional internal combustion engine vehicles with EVs or HEVs. This section first discusses the types of domestic and international transportation-related GHG reduction projects that have been undertaken and for which data has been reported. Next is a discussion of the types and sources of GHG emissions associated with both EVs and HEVs, followed by an overview of some of the studies and models that may be helpful for estimating emission reductions from vehicle projects. Finally, this section briefly summarizes the most common rules and procedures for estimating and reporting on GHG emission reduction activities under project-based GHG mitigation programs.  4.2  Projects Deploying EV and HEV Technologies to Reduce GHG Emissions  There are five main types of activities that can be undertaken to reduce GHG emissions in the transportation sector. These include: Changing vehicle fuel type: sample activities include switching from gasoline/diesel to biodiesel, natural gas, electric batteries, fuel cells, and other alternative fuels; Changing vehicle fuel efficiency: for example, improving fuel economy, traffic management/infrastructure changes and/or vehicle scrappage programs; Mode switching to less GHG-intensive transportation options: increased public transportation, light rail systems, etc.; Reducing transportation activity: this could involve improved transit systems, road pricing, or telecommuting; and Increasing vehicle occupancy rate: activities may include car sharing, telematic systems for freight, or subsidized public transport. Each option focuses on different ways to reduce emissions, ranging from behavioral changes to direct substitution of transport technologies. Hence, the procedures for estimating and accounting for emission reductions are different for each of the five activity types. For the individual electric and hybrid electric vehicle project developer, the first option is the most relevant, as it refers to activities that can be undertaken directly by the individual fleet manager. For example, by replacing a fleet of one hundred gasoline-powered vehicles with one hundred electric battery-powered vehicles, a fleet manager can reduce GHG emissions by using a less GHG intensive fuel. The other four transportation activity  4 GHG Emissions  35   types would mostly involve behavioral or regulatory changes that would likely be implemented by public authorities, automobile manufacturers, or private companies seeking to reduce the transport activities of their employees. Because this guide is targeted towards GHG reduction projects involving the deployment of electric and hybrid electric vehicles by individual fleet managers, we will focus on estimating emissions from vehicle technology and/or fuel switching projects. There is little international experience with developing and implementing vehicle fuel switching projects specifically with the purpose of reducing GHG emissions.104 Of the 157 projects registered with the UNFCCC Secretariat as AIJ pilot projects, only one takes place in the transportation sector.105 This project, known as the RABA/IKARUS Compressed Natural Gas Engine Bus project, is funded by Dutch investors and hosted in Hungary. The project involves the development and testing of a new compressed CNG engine to be installed by the companies of RABA and Ikarus in new buses.106 No EV or HEV projects have been reported to the UNFCCC Secretariat. In the U.S., the number of voluntary actions to reduce GHG emissions in the transportation sector is also low. In 2000, there were 72 transportation related GHG emissions reduction projects reported to the DOE Voluntary Reporting of Greenhouse Gases Program--a small number compared to the 462 electricity generation, transmission, and distribution projects reported for the same year.107 Nearly half (31) of these transportation projects involved AFVs and 15 involved the use of EVs. The AFV project developers reported an average estimated emissions reduction of 505 metric tons of CO2E per project for 2000. (A more detailed description of these projects is provided in Appendix 4.) Concerned with the lack of transportation sector projects, national joint implementation offices have been promoting their development. For example, DOE issued a grant in the fall of 2000 to the Washington D.C.-based Center for Sustainable Development in the Americas (CSDA) to create an AIJ project using natural gas vehicles in Santiago, Chile.  4.3  GHG Emissions Associated with EVs and HEVs  The GHGs most closely identified with the transportation sector include CO2, N2O, and CH4. Each GHG contributes differently to global warming, and this difference can be expressed by the global warming potential (GWP) of each gas. The GWP of a GHG is the degree to which that gas will enhance the overall effect of global warming. It is a function of the gas' direct or indirect radiative forcing potential (or how well the gas transmits visible radiation and traps infrared radiation). GWP is expressed in relative terms, with CO2 as the base, for a given period of time. The Table 4-1 Global Warming Potentials concept of GWP allows us to of Selected GHGs compare the emissions of different GHGs, such as CH4 Greenhouse Global Warming Potential (100 and N2O, using a common unit: Years) Gas kg of CO2-equivalent (CO2-E).

In the case of EVs and HEVs, CO2 is the major GHG emitted. Both hybrid and battery-powered electric vehicles can result in considerable GHG emission reductions compared to conventional petroleum-fueled vehicles. However, the associated emission reductions vary, depending on the power generation mix used to charge the electric batteries and the fuel type used for fueling the hybrid vehicle. Because vehicle efficiency of EVs and HEVs is determined by several factors, including fuel type and propulsion system, no single value for potential emission reductions can be provided. Emission estimates will have to be determined for each vehicle model and fuel type used.

GHG emissions are the sum of emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O, weighted by their GWPs, but, as Figure 4-1 illustrates, with the exception of ethanol and natural gas vehicles, CO2 accounts for nearly all of the vehicles GHG emissions. The HEV options examined include grid-independent (GI) HEVs fueled with California gasoline (RFG2), gridindependent HEVs fueled by clean diesel, and grid-connected HEVs powered by a California electricity mix. Grid-independent HEVs use the engine to recharge their batteries while grid-connected vehicles are required to be plugged into a stationary power Argonne National Laboratory.

To complement Figure 4-1, which shows GHG reductions as a percentage decrease compared to conventional gasoline vehicles, Table 4-2 lists typical CO2 emissions associated with EVs and HEVs, as well as three conventional vehicles. It should be emphasized that the information presented in Table 4-2 are directly proportional to several factors that may have a wide degree of variation (such as vehicle efficiency and electricity fuel mix), and are therefore presented only to provide a relative order of magnitude.

In Figure 4-1 above, the emission estimates are calculated based on the electric generation mix of California (CA), Northeast U.S. (NE US) and the national U.S. mix. The largest reductions occur for EVs with the California electric generation mix, where 48 percent of electricity is produced from hydropower plants. A more detailed discussion of the emissions from EVs and HEVs is provided in the following sections. In general, EVs and HEVs reduce GHG emissions by more than 40 percent, mainly because of their efficiency gains. 4.3.1 GHG Emissions From EVs use batteries as the sole source of power generation, the and estimating GHG benefits of EVs is different from hybrid vehicles. Battery-powered electric vehicles have no tailpipe local air pollutants, but there are emissions associated with  Because electric vehicles procedures for measuring electric and conventional emissions of GHGs and  38  4 GHG Emissions   generating electricity for battery recharging. There are also some emissions associated with producing and scrapping the batteries. However, these emissions represent a small share relative to the total. Figure 4-2 shows that more than 90 percent of the GHGs emitted from EVs come from the process of producing, transporting, and storing fuel. The remaining GHG emissions are emitted during the feedstock-related stage, which includes feedstock recovery, transportation, and storage. No GHG emissions are associated with the vehicle operation stage, covering vehicle refueling and operations. Figure 4-3 is included for comparison, showing the share of fuel-cycle energy use and emissions of conventional gasoline vehicles by stage. Figure 4-3 shows that more than 80 percent of GHGs emitted from gasoline vehicles come from vehicle operation. Another 15 percent is emitted during the fuel production, transport, and storage stages.

Depending on the power generation mix in use for the area where an electric vehicle is recharged, the overall emissions can be much less than those from conventional gasoline vehicles. If the battery of the electric vehicle is recharged in a region with a very coal intensive electricity generation mix, GHG emissions will be higher than if the battery is recharged with electricity from mainly renewable or natural gas-based electricity. EVs may have nearly zero total emissions when recharged with electricity generated by nuclear power or renewable sources. As illustrated in Figure 4-1 above, EVs recharged in California result in much lower emissions than EVs recharged in Northeastern U.S. The GHG benefits of California vehicles are even higher if compared with EVs recharged with electricity similar to the U.S. average fuel mix.

To assist project developers in the US with estimating emission benefits of GHG reduction activities, EIA has developed state average electricity emission factors that can be used to determine region-specific CO2 emissions per unit electricity used.111 (Specific emissions factors for each state and major city are listed in Appendix 6.) The EIA electricity emission factors were developed to provide reporters to the EIA 1605(b) Voluntary Reporting of Greenhouse Gases program with a means to convert their energy savings estimates into emission reduction estimates. Essentially, CO2 emissions for all utility power plants over a three-year period were summed across all plants and then divided by the total generation of the plants to yield state-wide average emission factors.112 Project developers who wish to use more localized electricity emission factors--either for the purpose of higher accuracy or because they are located outside the US--should contact the local utility to obtain information on the electricity mix in the area where the EVs will be recharged. This information can then be used to derive local electricity emission factors (specified, e.g., in pounds of greenhouse gas (gas) per kWh), according to the following basic equation: EEF =  [ (FCi) (FFEFi) ] / G i=1  Tot  n  t  where: EEF FCi 110 111  = electricity emission factor (pounds gas per kWh) = total fuel consumed of type i (kcal, Btus or J)  Id.

However, these considerations do not affect the basic functional form of the equation, or the appropriate values for the fossil fuel emission factors.113 Generally recognized fossil fuel emission factors, such as have been developed by IPCC and other recognized bodies, can applied in the above equation. The fossil fuel emission coefficients used by the EIA 1605(b) Voluntary Reporting Program are listed in Appendix 7 of this report. Once local- or state-wide emission factors have been derived--typically expressed in terms of lbs of CO2E per kWh--the vehicle owner can then determine emissions of an individual vehicle type by multiplying the vehicle efficiency (kWh/mile) by the emission factor (lbs of CO2E per kWh). After emissions per distance traveled have been established for the electric vehicle, a comparison can be made with the emissions per distance traveled of a conventional gasoline vehicle to determine the actual emission reductions attributable to the EVs. The emission factor for gasoline, listed in Appendix 7, is estimated at 19.564 lbs of CO2 per gallon. 4.3.2 GHG Emissions From HEVs  HEVs run on conventional fuels, and thus the vast majority of their GHGs are emitted from the tailpipe during vehicle operation, as is the case with conventional vehicles. Figure 4-4, above, shows the share of GHG emissions during each stage of the HEV fuel use cycle, using grid-independent HEVs fueled by gasoline.114 The figure illustrates that at least 80 percent of GHGs emitted are released during the vehicle operation stage. Similar to the case with gasoline vehicles, another 15 percent of GHGs are emitted during the fuel production, transport, and storage stages. Advanced HEVs, such as fuel cell vehicles using hydrogen, are like EVs in that some or all of their GHG emissions may be produced during the fuel production and distribution stages.  4.4  Studies and Measurements of GHG Emission Benefits of EVs and HEVs  As GHGs are only regulated in a few countries, only a limited number of studies and publicly available resources are available to offer assistance in estimating GHG emissions from vehicles. The following summaries provide an overview of the major information sources on emissions benefits from EVs and HEVs.  In the above equation, the fuel consumption and fossil fuel emission factors should always be expressed in energy units (calories, Btus, or joules) rather than physical units (e.g., tons, barrels, or cubic feet). As long as this basic rule is followed, the uncertainty surrounding the fossil fuel emission factors will be minimized because within any given fuel type, the variability in the relationship between heat content and carbon content is very limited. In general, the heat content of a given fuel depends primarily on the fuel's carbon content. There are other chemical components of fuels that also contribute to the fuel's heat content including sulfur and, most notably, hydrogen. However, these other chemical constituents tend to represent only a small fraction of the fuel's chemical makeup relative to carbon. Hence the variations in the ratio of carbon to heat content, for a given type of fuel, are likewise small. And since a fuel emission factor is simply the ratio of the fuel's carbon to heat content, the uncertainty range surrounding the factor is small. 114 Argonne National Laboratory.

The GREET model was developed by the Argonne National Laboratory to make calculations of the GHG emissions of light duty conventional vehicles and alternative fueled vehicles in the U.S. All the GHG emissions from vehicle use and upstream from fuel production, are included. Three GHGs (CO2, N2O and CH4) are combined with their GWPs to calculate CO2-E GHG emissions. GREET also evaluates criteria pollutant emissions, and compares fuel efficiency and emissions for EVs and HEVs relative to conventional gasoline vehicles. Users are able to change the default values to accommodate their specific situation. The GREET model is free of charge and can be downloaded from http://www.transportation.anl.gov/ttrdc/greet. It should be emphasized that the model is based on U.S. conditions and energy infrastructure. Users from other countries should be careful to adopt model inputs, which are relevant to country-specific conditions. These should include country-specific assumptions regarding fuel use and GHG emissions during the production, refining, and transportation of fuels and the national electricity mix used for electricity generation.  115 Argonne National Laboratory. August 1999. Total GHG emissions also include fuel recovery, production, and distribution to the vehicle. However, the emissions associated with these steps are relatively small compared to the emissions emitted during operation of the vehicle.  42  Pe  4 GHG Emissions   4.4.2  Canada's Transportation Climate Change Table  In May 1998, Canada's federal, provincial, and territorial Ministers of Transportation established the Transportation Climate Change Table as part of the national process to develop a climate change strategy.116 The Table was comprised of transportation sector experts from a broad cross-section of business and industry, government, environmental groups and non-governmental organizations. It was mandated to identify specific measures to mitigate GHG emissions from Canada's transport sector. The Transportation Climate Change Table submitted its Options Paper, ""Transportation and Climate Change: Options for Action"" to the Ministers of Transportation and the National Climate Change Secretariat in November 1999. The Options Paper assesses the costs, benefits and impacts of over 100 measures. The Transportation Table undertook 24 studies in support of the Options Paper. As part of one of these studies, several alternatives to gasoline, including EVs, were compared for their potential for reductions in GHG emissions.117 Table 4-3 summarizes the findings regarding the relative energy efficiency, GHG emissions, and costs of alternative fuels. As can be seen from the ""Net GHG Ratio"" column of Table 4-3, EVs emit considerably fewer GHGs than conventional vehicles. However, review of the information provided in the study indicates that the GHG benefits projected for EVs are based on the assumption that relatively little of the electricity is generated from the combustion of fossil fuels, as is typically the case in Canada. This assumption may not be appropriate for most areas in the U.S. As illustrated in Appendix 6, some U.S. states are heavily reliant on coal for their electricity generation. Hence, in some areas of the U.S., the GHG benefits could be less dramatic depending on the fuel mix of the particular state in question. The second column of the table is labeled ""Relative Vehicle Efficiency"". The values in the column represent the distance traveled per BTU of fuel consumed for each fuel relative to gasoline. The third column of the table, labeled ""Upstream GHG Ratio,"" shows estimates of how the GHG emissions associated with production of alternative fuels and alternatively fueled vehicles compare to gasoline and gasoline-fueled vehicles. In the case of EVs, GHG emissions from the upstream process is higher (1.08) than the emissions from conventional gasoline vehicles (1.00). This is because most of the emissions from EVs are produced during the production of electricity for the batteries, whereas emissions from gasoline vehicles are emitted during operation of the vehicle itself and are therefore not included in this column. The fourth column of Table 4-2 is labeled ""Net GHG Ratio"", reflecting the combined effects of ""upstream"" GHG emissions differences and changes in GHG emissions per unit distance of vehicle travel. Once both vehicle operation (tail pipe emissions) and upstream processes are combined, EVs are shown to emit far fewer GHGs (0.30) than conventional gasoline vehicles (1.00) (with the assumed electricity producing fuel mix). The fifth column of Table 4-3 is labeled ""Gasoline Equivalent Fuel Cost"" and represents the relative price of the alternative fuel per unit of energy. The sixth and seventh columns in Table 4-3 contain the ""Vehicle Price Change"" for 2010 and 2020. These columns show the change in Retail Price Equivalent  116 For more information on Canada's Transportation Climate Change Table visit the website at: http://www.tc.gc.ca/envaffairs/english/climatechange/ttable/ or email: TCCTable@tc.gc.ca. 117 Alternative and Future Fuels and Energy Sources For Road Vehicles.

The EPA also has a model (MOBILE6), which allows fleets to calculate the emissions reductions they can expect in real-world operation when using AFVs. MOBILE6 is a computer program that estimates HC, CO, and NOX emission factors for gasoline and diesel fueled highway motor vehicles, as well as for AFVs such as natural gas and electric vehicles that may be used to replace them. MOBILE6 calculates emission factors for 28 individual vehicle types in low- and high-altitude regions of the United States. MOBILE6 emission factor estimates depend on various conditions, such as ambient temperatures, travel speeds, operating modes, fuel volatility, and mileage accrual rates. Many of the variables affecting vehicle emissions can be specified by the The RPE is defined as the average ""retail manufacturer to remain economically viable over fixed costs (e.g., engineering, facilities, tooling), labor), manufacturer markup (to cover overhead a described as follows: RPE = ((Fixed Cost/Unit Markup. 119 118  price equivalent"" that must be achieved for the the longer term.

MOBILE6 will estimate emission factors for any calendar year between 1952 and 2050, inclusive. Vehicles from the 25 most recent model years are assumed to be in operation in each calendar year by MOBILE6. Some states, such as California, have similar software which are specific to their unique climate and driving characteristics. Estimates of emissions reductions are often needed for AFV owners to apply for and receive grants from incentive programs. EPA is undertaking an effort to develop the next generation of modeling tools for the estimation of emissions produced by on- and off-road mobile sources, which includes the New Generation Model. The design of this modeling system is guided by four broad objectives: (a) the model should encompass all pollutants (including HC, CO, NOX, PM, air toxics, and GHGs) and all mobile sources at the levels of resolution needed for the diverse applications of the system; (b) the model should be developed according to principles of sound science; (c) the software design should be efficient and flexible; and (d) the model should be implemented in a coordinated, clear, and consistent manner. EPA views the New Generation Model as a logical next step in the continuing effort to improve mobile source emissions models to keep pace with new analysis needs, new modeling approaches, and new data.  4.5  Procedures for Estimating GHG Emissions Benefits from EV and HEV Projects  During the past decade, a series of project-based programs have been introduced to gain experience and harness the power of markets in order to address the issue of climate change in a cost-effective manner. Each of these programs is governed by a unique set of rules. However, they exhibit some common elements that constitute a de facto (though non-binding) set of minimum quality criteria that govern the creation of credible emission reductions. Leading examples of these programs and initiatives include USIJI; the AIJ Pilot Phase, Canada's Pilot Emissions Reduction Trading Program (PERT) in Ontario; Oregon's Climate Trust; the Emission Reduction Unit Procurement Tender (ERUPT) of the Dutch government; and the World Bank Prototype Carbon Fund (PCF). The following rules and procedures are common elements of project-based systems. They provide a framework for project developers interested in developing GHG reduction projects. 4.5.1 GHG Emissions Baseline  The emissions baseline is an integral part of the GHG reduction project proposal as the baseline is used to estimate emissions benefits of the project and will be used as the basis for awarding credits to the project. Many project-based programs measure emission reductions by comparing the emissions performance of a credible ""without project"" baseline against the ""with project"" emissions.  4 GHG Emissions  45   Figure 4-5  Sample Project A--Static Baseline Project A: 1) Static baseline 2) Real project emission reductions  Emissions (tons/year)  Historic Emissions  Emissions W ithout Project Net Project Benefits Emissions W ith Project  Project Start Date  Time (years)  The baseline typically refers to the process of developing an understanding of the ""without project"" emissions performance scenario--either static or dynamic--which can then be used for comparison with the emissions of the project. The challenge of developing emission baselines stems from the problem of projecting what will happen in a given economy 10, 20, or 30 years down the line. Static baselines rely on historical information to fix emissions at a set level, such as an entity or project's physical emissions in a given year. This same emissions level is then maintained every year throughout the life of the project. An example of a static emission baseline is provided in Figure 4-5. Dynamic baselines are emission baselines that try to take into account changes that are likely or expected to happen during the life of the project. As such, dynamic baselines are linked to particular variables and may be revised upward and downward depending on project and entity characteristics such as output levels, growth rates, efficiency rates, and peer group benchmarks. For example, changes that could happen include future laws mandating use of a similar technology or fuel option, increased demand for transportation leading to increased vehicle usage, expected commercialization of a similar vehicle type, and so on. If such changes are taken into account, it will no longer be sufficient to use historical data for deriving the ""without project"" scenario, and some assumptions and adjustments regarding emissions levels in future years will have to be made. Figure 4-6 illustrates what a dynamic baseline might look like. It should be noted that dynamic baselines do not always involve an increase in emissions. In some cases, a general adoption of cleaner and more efficient technologies may lead to lower emissions in the ""without project"" scenario. In this case, the dynamic baseline would have a downward sloping curve and credits would only be awarded to projects that improve the emissions performance even further. Regardless of which baseline scenario is selected, project developers must be careful to describe all assumptions used and explain exactly why a particular methodology is utilized.  46  4 GHG Emissions   Figure 4-6  Sample Project B--Dynamic Baseline Project B: 1) Dynamic baseline 2) Real project emission reductions Emissions W ithout Project  Emissions (tons/year)  Historic Emissions Net Project Benefits  Emissions W ith Project  Project Start Date  Time (years)  Once the baseline has been determined, the estimate of emissions ""with the project"" can be developed. To determine project emissions the same assumptions and time frames used for the ""without project"" baseline should be applied. Most project cases lead to real emission reductions. However, as illustrated in Figure 4-7, it is sometimes possible that emissions ""with the project"" will continue to rise above historical emissions. Such projects may still be able to obtain GHG reduction credits, as long as the reported project emissions performance continues to fall below the emissions associated with the baseline scenario.

To date, no GHG crediting program has developed specific guidance for estimating GHG benefits from vehicle projects. However, some useful indicators for how to calculate emissions can be derived from the WRI/WBCSD Greenhouse Gas Protocol Initiative, which is a multi-stakeholder initiative between industry, government, and nongovernmental organizations, to develop generally accepted accounting practices for measuring and reporting corporate GHG emissions.120 The resulting standard and guidance are supplemented by a number of user-friendly GHG calculation tools, which can be accessed on the GHG Protocol website (www.ghgprotocol.org).121 Although the GHG Protocol focuses on corporate emissions, the proposed accounting standards and reporting instructions serve as an indicator of how project-specific emission reductions could be calculated.122 According to the GHG protocol, there are two general methodologies for calculating emissions from vehicle projects: fuel-based and distance-based.123 The preferred method, known as the ""fuel-based"" approach, is based on previously aggregated fuel consumption data to determine emissions. Following this approach, fuel consumption is multiplied by the CO2 emission factor for each fuel type in order to derive CO2 emissions. The fuel emission factor is developed based on the fuel's heat content, the fraction of carbon in the fuel that is oxidized, and the carbon content coefficient. To calculate emissions the following equation should be used: CO2 Emissions = Fuel Used x Heating Value x Emission Factor  In the case that project developers do not have access to site-specific information, default emission factors and heating values for different transportation fuels are listed in the guidance for using the GHG Reporting Protocol. Fuel use data can be obtained from several different sources including fuel receipts, financial records on fuel expenditures, or direct measurements of fuel use. If specific information on fuel consumption is not available, information on vehicle activity data (i.e. distance traveled) and fuel economy factors (such as miles per gallon) can be used to calculate fuel consumption, using the following equation: The Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard. WRI/WBCSD. Washington, D.C. 2000. Under the GHG Protocol, corporate transportation emissions take the form of either direct or indirect emissions. Direct emissions refer to emissions that are associated with owned or controlled sources, such as company owned vehicle fleets and corporate aircraft. Indirect emissions refer to all other company-related emissions, including employee commuting, short-term vehicle rentals, and upstream/downstream transportation emissions. If companies purchase electricity for owned or operated EVs, the related emissions should be reported as indirect emissions and should use guidance developed in the `Stationary Combustion Tool' for calculating emissions. For all other vehicles, including HEVs, companies should use the methodologies developed for calculating direct emissions from mobile sources. 121 Only transportation-related CO2 emission estimates are included in this tool. According to the GHG Protocol, accounting for N2O and CH4 emissions is optional at the discretion of the user. This is because N2O and CH4 emissions comprise a relatively small proportion of overall transportation emissions. 122 The WRI/WBCSD is also in the process of developing a GHG project accounting model with the aim of developing general guidance for emission reduction and land use, land-use change and forestry projects. This module will include accounting procedures for transportation projects. 123 ""Calculating CO2 Emissions from Mobile Sources"" WRI/WBCSD GHG Protocol Initiative. www.GHGprotocol.org. 120  48  4 GHG Emissions   Fuel Use = Distance x Fuel Economy Factor  The GHG Protocol also includes default fuel economy factors for different types of mobile sources and activity data. The second methodology, the ""distance-based"" approach, should only be used in case information on fuel use cannot be obtained. In the distance-based method, emissions are calculated by using distance based emission factors to calculate emissions. Activity data could be expressed in terms of vehicle-kilometers (or miles) traveled, passengerkilometers (or miles), and so on. This information is then multiplied by a default distancebased emission factor124 according to the following equation: CO2 Emissions = Distance Traveled x Distance-Based Emission Factor  Default distance-based emission factors are provided in the guidance for the GHG Protocol. The distance-based approach is less accurate than the fuel-based approach, and is thus recommended as the last resort for corporate GHG accounting purposes. As accuracy is an extremely important issue in terms of developing and crediting GHG reduction projects, the fuel-based approach is also the preferred approach for project-specific GHG reduction activities. 4.5.2 Environmental Additionality  The requirement of environmental additionality is linked closely to the process of developing the GHG emissions baseline. The concept of environmental additionality refers to the notion that the emission reductions achieved by the project must be proven not to have occurred in the absence of the project. That is, it is important that the credits awarded to the project developers must stem from emission reduction activities undertaken in addition to the business-as-usual scenario. Otherwise, the credits claimed from the project will not result in true, long-term environmental benefits, and the project developers will be awarded credits for emission reductions that never really took place. Hence, a major part of the additionality criterion involves proving that emission reductions were not a result of general technology improvements or activities undertaken to comply with existing regulations. To be credible, baselines should therefore take into account any laws, regulations, or technology improvements that may have a direct or indirect impact on GHG emissions. In the case of EVs, the question of additionality is pretty straightforward due to the general lack of EV market penetration and limited prospects for increased market penetration in the near future. Because of the limited use of EVs, it is pretty safe to argue that the purchase of such vehicles would not have happened without the specific EV project in question--unless of course the purchase of such vehicles were mandated by an existing law or regulation. However, in the case of HEVs it becomes a little more tricky to argue for the additionality of a potential HEV project. In some countries, such as Japan and the U.S., HEVs have reached a very limited market penetration. In these countries, the existing level of market penetration should be accounted for in the ""without 124 A sample default distance-based emission factor could be 0.28 kg CO2 per mile traveled for a small petrol car with no more than a 1.4 liter engine. ""Calculating CO2 Emissions from Mobile Sources"" WRI/WBCSD GHG Protocol Initiative. www.GHGprotocol.org.  4 GHG Emissions  49   project"" emissions scenario, unless the project developer is able to clearly demonstrate that such vehicles would not have been purchased by the individual fleet manager in the absence of the HEV project. 4.5.3 Leakage  Another common criterion requires that the project developers provide evidence that the emissions reductions achieved at the project site do not lead to increases in emissions outside the boundaries of the project (i.e., emissions ""leakage""), or that the calculation of claimed emissions reductions quantifies and accounts for leakage. Switching to electric vehicles is a good example of a project type with potential for leakage. If the boundary of the project is limited to an analysis of tailpipe emissions alone, the emissions will be reduced to zero, when in fact significant emissions may be produced at the power plant in the generation of the electricity for powering the electric vehicle. These power plant emissions would have ""leaked"" from the accounting system. 4.5.4 Monitoring and Verification  Another common requirement is that project developers develop a plan or procedures for how emission reductions are monitored throughout the life of the project. The measured reductions must then be verified by an independent third party, who certifies that monitored reductions and/or the proposed method for calculating emissions performance can be or has been audited to provide a credible quantitative assessment of actual project performance. Both the monitoring and verification requirements involve guidelines for validating and verifying that no leakage will take place and that the GHG emissions baseline is estimated correctly (i.e. that the reductions meet the environmental additionality requirement). 4.5.5 Ownership  Finally, most programs require that the project proponent has a legitimate claim to ownership of the reductions generated by the project and that other potential claimants are identified. Ownership can be demonstrated through documents certifying and dividing ownership clearly among all project participants. If necessary, supporting documents by local or national government authorities can be included to verify the validity of claimed ownership. The issue of ownership is an important consideration for transportation projects. In many countries, buses and taxis are owned by individual vehicle operators rather than one single fleet operator. When the ownership of a transportation project covering 200 vehicles is divided among a similar number of owners, contractual and other issues may become very complicated. One solution may be to form an association representing all the vehicle owners, which could then be listed as the owner of the project.  50  4 GHG Emissions   5  Case Study on Quantifying GHG Emissions from Battery-Powered Electric Vehicles  5.1  Introduction  The following case study is based on a hypothetical project that involves the deployment of 125 electric battery charged taxis to replace 125 gasoline-fueled taxis. The case study focuses on the process of developing an emissions baseline and estimating net GHG emission benefits of an individual project. The following subsections provide a brief summary of the project case study, outline the general criteria for developing a GHG reduction project based on current market-based proposals for GHG control, develop the project based on these criteria, and estimate the emissions baseline and net project benefits. Three sample baseline scenarios are provided to illustrate how different project characteristics may influence the baseline estimate. The three baselines include: (1) a static baseline assuming that the 125 new electric vehicles are purchased instead of 125 new conventional gasoline powered vehicles; (2) a dynamic baseline assuming that the 125 new electric vehicles will replace 125 aging conventional gasoline vehicles with an estimated average life time of eight years; and (3) a static full fuel cycle baseline, including fuel production and refining along with vehicle operation, that assumes that the 125 new electric vehicles are purchased instead of 125 new conventional gasoline powered vehicles.  5.2  Emission Reduction Project for Taxis  This case study is based on a hypothetical project in a country called the Clean Cities Republic.125 Although the Clean Cities Republic is a developing country, it does not represent any country or region in particular. It should be emphasized that the numbers used for this case study are fictional. The data provided for estimating the emissions baseline have been developed to illustrate how to quantify potential emission benefits. The data should not be used as an indicator of the specific emissions potential of an electric vehicle project. Electric vehicle project developers should obtain their own GHG emission data for both the conventional vehicles to be replaced and the new alternative fuel vehicles to be introduced. 5.2.1 Republic of Clean Cities Background Information  The Republic of Clean Cities is a country with a population of 45 million people. Gross domestic product (GDP) is US$190 billion per year, with an annual growth rate of 5 to 6 percent over the last 10 years. As a result of this economic expansion, the country is The hypothetical country example of the Republic of Clean Cities was first introduced at the 6 National Clean Cities Conference for illustrating a similar case study on estimating the GHG benefits of a natural gas vehicle project.

Currently, transportation activities account for 32 percent of energy related CO2 emissions, although this share is expected to grow significantly over the next few decades as the transportation sector continues to expand. The project will be located in the capital of the Republic of Clean Cities, which is a city of 8 million people with a population growth of 5 percent per year. On average, there are 7 people per motor vehicle, compared to 1.3 per vehicle in the U.S. The total number of vehicles on the road is growing by 7 percent annually. The capital is experiencing serious local environmental pollution problems and is among the 20 most polluted cities in the world. The concentration of total suspended particulates (TSP) in the air is 8 times higher than the proposed World Health Organization (WHO) standards. The majority of the capital's pollution problems are caused by transportation emissions. To alleviate some of these environmental problems, the government has introduced tax incentives for switching to alternative fueled vehicles. In addition, a recently passed law mandates that all new cars should drive on unleaded gasoline. Currently, 40 percent of all gasoline sold in the country is leaded. The local government has also introduced a car use reduction plan to curb the rapid growth of new vehicles in the capital area. Finally, a new domestic regulation was put in place this year for reductions in vehicle tailpipe emissions of criteria pollutants. To date, no electric vehicles have been purchased in the capital and there are no domestic manufacturers or dealers supplying electric vehicles.  5.3  The Project Case Study  As part of the project, 125 dedicated electric vehicles (sedans) will be purchased to either replace 125 existing or new conventional gasoline taxis of a similar size. To develop a supporting infrastructure, vehicle accessible electrical outlets will be provided at the site where these taxis are parked, including at the homes of the taxi drivers. Moreover, an extensive training course will be provided for the fleet mechanics. The lifetime of the project is estimated conservatively, at 12 years. Each taxi is expected to drive an average of 70,000 miles per year. The energy use of the electric vehicles is 1.46 kwh/mile and the mileage of the conventional gasoline vehicles that would have been purchased in the absence of the project is 26 miles per gallon of gasoline. The project participants include the Capital City Transportation Department, a local taxi fleet operator, and a U.S.-based electric vehicle manufacturer. The electric vehicle project has been approved by the Republic of Clean Cities' National Climate Change Office, which has been authorized by the Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Energy, and Environment, to evaluate and certify internationally sponsored GHG reduction projects. The National Climate Change Office, administered by the Ministry of Environment, has provided written documentation of project approval. The project reduces CO2 emissions by reducing the need for oil recovery, gasoline refining, and fuel transportation, which produces more CO2 emissions than recharging the electric batteries. The carbon intensity of electricity generated in the capital region is relatively low, as more than 35 percent of the generating capacity comes from hydropower. The remaining electricity is generated from a mix of coal and diesel. A comparison of N2O and CH4 emissions will not be included in the emissions baseline because these do not significantly contribute to projected emissions.  52  5 Case Study   5.4  Project Additionality  Determining the additionality of the EV project is relatively straightforward. As mentioned earlier, there are no electric vehicles in the capital and the technology is not yet commercially available on the domestic market. One major impediment for the introduction of EVs is the considerable higher cost of the vehicles and the lack of knowledge about the technology. Although tax incentives are provided for owners of AFVs there are no laws or regulations requiring public or private vehicle fleet owners to purchase alternative fuel vehicles, such as EVs. It is therefore unlikely that electric vehicles will be introduced in the country in the near future. The EV project is clearly additional and would likely qualify for credit under any market based GHG reduction program. If, on the other hand, a law were in place mandating that 15 percent of all public and private fleets must consist of zero emission vehicles, such as electric vehicles, the issue of additionality would be less straightforward. In this case, the project developer would not be able to claim GHG emission reduction credits for EVs purchased to meet the 15 percent requirement. Only vehicles purchased to exceed the mandated zero emission requirements would receive credit. Hence, a fleet owner with 200 conventional gasoline taxis--who replaces 40 old conventional gasoline vehicles with 40 new EVs--would only be able to obtain emission reduction credits for 10 of the new EVs. The other 30 vehicles would go towards meeting the 15 percent mandate for zero emission vehicles. However, for the purposes of the following case studies it is assumed that no such laws have been put in place.  5.5  Estimating the Emissions Baseline  Since the introduction of the concept of cooperatively implemented GHG reduction projects, little experience has been gained regarding the development and evaluation of transportation-related GHG reduction projects. As mentioned earlier, only one transportation project has been approved under the UNFCCC's AIJ Pilot Phase. One project, however, does not provide enough precedent to be used for the development of standardized methodologies for analyzing transportation projects. For this type of project it should be sufficient to include information about CO2 emissions only, instead of covering all GHGs, simply because CO2 emissions account for most of the GHG emissions from the project. Clearly, the analysis should include a comparison of upstream emissions because the project emissions are dependent on the fuel mix used for generating the electricity used in the batteries. This case study will provide three sample baseline scenarios to illustrate how different project characteristics may influence the baseline estimate. The three baselines include: 1. 2. 3. A static baseline assuming that the 125 new electric vehicles are purchased instead of 125 new conventional gasoline powered vehicles. These vehicles are purchased to meet growing demand for taxi services. A dynamic baseline assuming that the 125 new electric vehicles will replace 125 aging conventional gasoline vehicles with an estimated average lifetime of eight years. A static baseline assuming that the 125 new electric vehicles are purchased instead of 125 new conventional gasoline powered vehicles. This analysis includes a full fuel cycle analysis similar to that provided in the GREET model.  The purpose of presenting these different baseline scenarios is two-fold. One is to advance the discussion on some of the issues that must be resolved in order to establish  5 Case Study  53   clear guidelines for the documentation and approval of transportation-related projects. The other purpose is to provide potential project developers with an idea of the issues that must be considered during the development of an emissions baseline for a transportation project. Project developers can then choose between or combine the different baseline scenarios depending on the purpose and requirements of the program to which the project participants will be applying for credit. Factors that may determine the choice of baseline scenarios, include: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. The transportation technology used for the project; Availability of full fuel cycle and tailpipe emissions data; Individual GHG program requirements; The risk tolerance and level of accuracy desired by project developers and investors; and The acceptable level of transaction costs.  The three baseline scenarios are outlined in the following subsections. Each version of the baseline scenarios involves three quantification steps. These include a calculation of: (1) the project reference case, (2) project-related emissions, and (3) net emission benefits of the project. The first quantification step entails estimating what the emissions would have been without implementing the project. This step is also known as the emission baseline or the project reference case and should include data for the entire life of the project. Because the potential project emission benefits are derived by comparing project emissions to the reference case, accuracy in the development of the reference case is very important. However, estimating future emissions is a difficult process. It is almost impossible to factor in everything that may or may not happen 10 to 20 years down the road. Moreover, many different results can be achieved depending on which assumptions are used to derive the future emissions scenario. GHG reduction programs and project developers planning to receive credit for their projects under a future market-based GHG reduction program must be careful to develop baseline criteria that would be stringent enough to be accepted under any program. Given the differences between the various initiatives to credit GHG reduction activities, developers should consult the preliminary guidelines of each of the proposed programs before developing a project, and be careful to detail all assumptions and emission sources when quantifying the potential emission benefits. The examples provided in the following case study are less comprehensive and should only be used as an indicator of the types of data and quantification procedures that could be required from the different GHG reduction programs. The third quantification step involves estimating emissions from the project itself. The data provided should include an estimation of all relevant project emissions throughout the life of the project. During this process, project developers should be careful to define the boundary of the project and detail all the assumptions and emission sources included in the estimate. The fourth and final quantification step is rather simple. It entails calculating the net benefits of the project. To derive the net benefits, the project developer must subtract the project emissions from the emissions estimated for the reference case. The difference will represent the net benefits of the project. 5.5.1 Emission Baselines: Version 1  The first scenario is based on a static emissions baseline. This means that the current level of business as usual emissions are assumed to remain constant throughout the life of the project. This scenario does not take into consideration changes that may occur  54  5 Case Study   over the life of the project such as declining vehicle efficiency or improvements in new vehicle technology. In version 1, the method used to calculate emission reductions is based on a comparison of fuel usage and the corresponding fuel emissions factors. Step 1: The Reference Case The reference case represents what would happen if the GHG reduction project were not implemented. In this case, it is assumed that without the GHG reduction project, 125 new conventionally fueled gasoline vehicles would have been purchased to satisfy the growing demand for taxi services. Because version 1 of the case study assumes that emissions of the project are static, the GHG emissions rate of each taxi is assumed to remain the same over the next 12 years. In this version of the case study, the formula for calculating emissions of the gasoline vehicles is: Emissions over the project lifetime = (miles driven per year) / (vehicle efficiency in miles per gallon, mpg) x (emission factor of gasoline) x (number of vehicles) x (number of project years)  The emission factor for gasoline is assumed to be 19.564 lbs CO2/gallon (8.873 kg CO2/gallon).126 Hence emissions without the project would have been: Project lifetime emissions = (70,000 miles) / (26 mpg) x (8.873 kg CO2/gallon) x (125 vehicles) x (12 years) = 35,833 metric tons CO2 over the 12 year project lifetime Step 2: The Project Case The project case represents the actual emissions of the project itself. In this instance, the project case refers to the emissions of the 125 electric vehicle taxis over the 12-year life of the project. In this version of the case study, the formula for calculating emissions of the electric vehicles is: Emissions over the project lifetime = (miles driven per year) x (vehicle efficiency in kWh per mile) x (emission factor of electricity generation in kg CO2 per kWh) x (number of vehicles) x (number of project years)  The emission factor for electricity generation in the capital area is assumed to be 0.178 kg CO2/kWh. Hence emissions with the project would be: Project lifetime emissions (over 12 years) = (70,000 miles) x (1.46 kWh per mile) x (0.178 kg CO2/kWh) x (125 vehicles) x (12 years) = 27,287 metric tons CO 2  U.S. Department of Energy, Energy Information Administration (EIA), Instructions for the Voluntary Reporting of Greenhouse Gases Program.  126  5 Case Study  55   Step 3: Deriving Net Project Benefits The net project emission benefits are derived by subtracting the project case from the reference case. As illustrated below, the net project benefits of version 1 of the case study are 8,545 metric tons of CO2. Reference case - project case = Net project benefits 35,833 - 27,287 = 8,545 metric tons of CO 2  Figure 5-1  Project Emission Reductions Relative to Baseline-- Version 1 of Case Study Static Emissions Baseline  3,500  Metric Tons CO2 Emissions per Year  3,000 2,500 2,000 1,500 1,000 500 1 2 3 4 5 6  Project Emission Reductions  Baseline Emissions  Project Emissions  Net Project Benefits = 8,545 Metric Tons of CO2  7  8  9  10  11  12  Project Year  5.5.2  Emission Baselines: Version 2  The second scenario for the electric vehicle project relies on a dynamic emissions baseline. A dynamic baseline takes into account the changes that may happen to emissions and equipment as the vehicles age over time. In this version of the case study, it is assumed that the 125 new electric vehicles will replace an equal number of aging gasoline vehicles. However, as the old vehicles only have an estimated average lifetime of 8 years left, it must also be assumed that a similar number of new gasoline vehicles would be purchased after 8 years to replace the old vehicles as they are taken out of service. Therefore, in this version of the case study the mileage of the old gasoline vehicles is assumed to be considerably lower than the mileage of the new gasoline vehicles that are projected to be purchased 8 years into the future. Step 1: The Reference Case The reference case represents what would happen if the GHG reduction project were not implemented. As this is a dynamic baseline that takes into account the fact that the old gasoline vehicles are expected to be taken out of service after an average of 8 years-- and be replaced with new gasoline vehicles--the reference case will be calculated in two steps. First, the emissions of the old vehicles during the first 8 years of the project are calculated, then the emissions of the new vehicles used during the last 4 years of the  56  5 Case Study   project lifetime will be estimated. The two numbers are then added together and will represent the emissions of the reference case. It is assumed that the mileage of the old gasoline vehicles is 21 gallons per mile while the mileage of the new vehicles will be 28 miles per gallon. It should be noted that additional layers of ""dynamics"" could be added, such as estimating the mileage of each vehicle from year to year to account for declining efficiencies as the vehicles age. However, for the sake of simplicity and a diminishing return on accuracy, a simple two tiered assumption is used: one tier for eight years of the old vehicles, and one tier for four years of the new vehicles. The formula for calculating emission reductions is the same as in version 1 of the case study: Emissions over the project lifetime = (miles driven per year) / (vehicle efficiency in miles per gallon, mpg) x (emission factor of gasoline) x (number of vehicles) x (number of project years)  The emission factor for gasoline is assumed to be 19.564 lbs CO2/gallon (8.873 kg CO2/gallon).127 Hence emissions without the project would have been: Emissions (old vehicles; 8 year time scale) = (70,000 miles) / (21 mpg) x (8.873 kg CO2/gallon) x (125 vehicles) x (8 years) = 29,589 metric tons CO2 Emissions (new vehicles; 4 year time scale) = (70,000 miles) / (28 mpg) x (8.873 kg CO2/gallon) x (125 vehicles) x (4 years) = 11,096 metric tons CO2 Emissions of all gasoline vehicles over 12 year project lifetime = 29,589 + 11,096 = 40,685 metric tons CO 2  Step 2: The Project Case The project case represents emissions of the project itself. In this situation, the project emissions remain the same as version 1 of the case study. Hence, project emissions are 27,287 metric tons CO2. Step 3: Deriving Net Project Benefits The net project emission benefits are derived by subtracting the project case from the reference case. As illustrated below, the net project benefits of version 2 of the case study are 13,398 metric tons of CO2 equivalent. Reference case - project case = Net project benefits 40,685 - 27,287 = 13,398 metric tons of CO 2  U.S. Department of Energy, Energy Information Administration (EIA), Instructions for the Voluntary Reporting of Greenhouse Gases Program.  127  5 Case Study  57   Figure 5-2  Project Emission Reductions Relative to Baseline-- Version 2 of Case Study Dynamic Emissions Baseline  4,000  Metric Tons CO2 Emissions per Year  3,500 3,000 2,500 2,000 1,500 1,000 500 1  Baseline Emissions Project Emission Reductions Project Emissions  Net Project Benefits = 13,398 Metric Tons of CO2  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  Project Year  5.5.3  Emission Baselines: Version 3  The third version of the emission baseline for the electric vehicle project relies on a static emission baseline, but uses a different model for quantifying the emissions benefits. In the previous two versions of the case study, emissions benefits were estimated by comparing fuel usage of the different vehicle types. However, this method does not account for the entire emissions scenario of the project. A more accurate analysis of emission benefits would analyze the entire project life cycle, including emissions from the production, transportation, processing, and combustion of the fuel used. However, this type of analysis is very complicated and would be costly to undertake for the individual project developer. For projects in the United States, it would be possible to undertake this type of analysis by using the GREET model developed by Argonne National Laboratory.128 As part of this model, emissions have been computed for a number of different vehicle types and models based on a detailed analysis of the energy production and usage of the entire transportation sector. Project developers can apply data regarding a specific vehicle model to the GREET model and calculate the potential GHG and other emissions reductions from a project. However, this model only applies to the transportation sector in the U.S. No similar studies have been undertaken in other countries. In particular, developing countries lack the adequate data and resources to undertake such studies of life cycle emissions. The following version of the case study applies hypothetical electric vehicle data to the GREET model to illustrate how emissions would be calculated using this model. The baseline in this case study is more detailed than the two previous versions; that is, emissions data is presented for three stages of the fuel cycle. These stages include feedstock (production, transportation, and storage of primary energy feedstock), fuel  Michael Wang, ""Greenhouse Gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy Use in Transportation (GREET)"". Argonne National Laboratory. www.transportation.anl.gov/ttrdc/greet.  128  58  5 Case Study   (production, transportation, storage and distribution of energy source), and vehicle operation (fuel combustion or other chemical conversion). Step 1: The Reference Case The reference case represents what would happen if the GHG reduction project were not implemented. As in the first version of this case study, it is assumed that 125 conventional gasoline taxis would have been purchased instead of the electric vehicles. The assumptions for the annual emissions from one gasoline vehicle, based on hypothetical data, are as described in Table 5-1. Table 5-1 Feedstock 19  Version 3 of Case Study--Annual CO2 Emissions Without the Project (grams/mile/year) Fuel 86 Vehicle Operation 402 Total 507  Emissions over 12 yrs = 0.507 kg CO2 /mi x 70,000 mi x 125 cars x 12 yrs = 53,249 metric tons of CO Step 2: The Project Case As in the previous versions of this case study, the project case refers to the emissions of the 125 electric vehicle taxis over the 12-year life of the project. It is assumed that emissions of the electric vehicles will remain constant over the life of the project. Hence, a static baseline is used. The assumptions for the annual emissions from one electric vehicle, based on hypothetical data, are as described in Table 5-2. Table 5-2 Feedstock 21 2  Version 3 of Case Study--Annual CO2 Emissions with the EV Project (grams/mile/year) Fuel 237 Vehicle Operation 0 Total 258  Emissions over 12 yrs = 0.258 kg CO2 /mi x 70,000 mi x 125 cars x 12 yrs = 27,097 metric tons of CO Step 3: Deriving Net Project Benefits The net project emission benefits are derived by subtracting the project case from the reference case. As illustrated below, the net project benefits of version 3 of the case study are 26,152 metric tons of CO2. Reference case - project case = Net project benefits 53,249 - 27,097 = 26,152 metric tons of CO2 2  5 Case Study  59   Figure 5-3  Project Emission Reductions Relative to Baseline-- Version 3 of Case Study Static Emission Baseline Based on Full Fuel Cycle Analysis  5,000  Metric Tons CO2 Emissions per Year  4,500 4,000 3,500 3,000 2,500 2,000 1,500 1,000 500 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12  Baseline Emissions Project Emission Reductions  Project Emissions  Net Project Benefits = 26,152 Metric Tons of CO2  Project Year  5.6  Discussion three different methods for estimating the emission of the three baselines represents a viable means of resulting from the project. Ultimately, the specific or HEV project will determine which methodology is  The previous section presented benefits of an EV project. Each calculating emissions reductions circumstances of a potential EV being used.  In general, there is a tradeoff between the accuracy of a baseline and the cost and effort associated with its calculation. As transportation projects are typically smaller in size and thus reap relatively few GHG emission reduction credits, it will be harder to justify the transaction costs involved with developing a very detailed estimate of projected emissions. As a result, project developers may prefer to use a less stringent baseline estimation procedure. However, as a general rule, project developers should aim to be as conservative as possible when determining emission reduction credits. Investors looking to purchase emission reduction credits want to ensure that the credits purchased are credible and minimize the risk of default in future commitment periods. Hence, they prefer to invest in credits that are based on sound and credible estimation procedures. It is therefore important that project developers clearly describe the baseline methodology and assumptions used, and explain why this approach was preferred over other methods. Moreover, in cases where there might be some uncertainty regarding the exact amount of expected emissions benefits--for example due to an expected decline in EV efficiency which cannot yet be quantified because of little experience with the technology--project developers should select the least optimistic emissions scenario. This type of estimation procedure is much more likely to gain acceptance by current and future GHG crediting programs.  60  5 Case Study   6  Summary and Conclusions  Accurate and verifiable emission reductions are a function of the degree of transparency and stringency of the protocols employed in documenting project- or program-associated emissions reductions. The purpose of this guide is to provide a background for law and policy makers, urban planners, and project developers working with the many GHG emission reduction programs throughout the world to quantify and/or evaluate the GHG impacts of EVs and HEVs. In order to evaluate the GHG benefits and/or penalties of EV or HEV projects, it is necessary to first gain a fundamental understanding of the technology employed and the operating characteristics of these vehicles, especially with regard to the manner in which they compare to similar conventional gasoline or diesel vehicles. Therefore, the first two sections of this paper explain the basic technology and functionality of battery-powered electric and hybrid electric passenger vehicles, but focus on evaluating the models that are currently on the market with their similar conventional counterparts, including characteristics such as cost, performance, efficiency, environmental attributes, and range. Since the increased use of EVs and HEVs, along with alternative fuel vehicles in general, represents a public good with many social benefits at the local, national, and global levels, they often receive significant attention in the form of legislative and programmatic support. Some states mandate the use of EVs and HEVs, while others provide financial incentives to promote their procurement and use. Furthermore, Federal legislation in the form of mandatory standards or incentive programs can have a significant impact on the EV and HEV markets. In order to implement effective legislation or programs, it is vital to have an understanding of the different programs and activities that already exist, so that a new project focusing on GHG emission reduction can successfully interact with and build on the experience and lessons learned of those that preceded it. Finally, most programs that deal with passenger vehicles--and with transportation in general--do not address the climate change component explicitly, and therefore there are few GHG reduction goals that are included in these programs. Furthermore, there are relatively few protocols that exist for accounting for the GHG emissions reductions that arise from transportation and, specifically, passenger vehicle projects and programs. These accounting procedures and principles gain increased importance when a project developer wishes to document in a credible manner, the GHG reductions that are achieved by a given project or program. Section four of this paper outlines the GHG emissions associated with EVs and HEVs, both upstream and downstream, and section five goes on to illustrate the methodology, via hypothetical case studies, for measuring these reductions using different types of baselines. Unlike stationary energy combustion, transportation related emissions from some HEVs and EVs come from dispersed sources and require different methodologies for assessing GHG impacts. This resource guide outlines the necessary context and background for those parties wishing to evaluate projects and develop programs, policies, projects, and legislation aimed at the promotion of HEVs and EVs for GHG emission reduction.  6 Summary and Conclusions  61   Appendices  62  Appendices   A1  Comparison of Electric and Hybrid-Electric Vehicles to Similar-Performance Gasoline-Powered Vehicles  This appendix compares an electric vehicle and a hybrid-electric vehicle to a similarly performing gasoline-powered vehicle. While the text discusses these different technologies in depth, this table format shows side-by-side comparisons of vehicles currently available for purchase or resale. This information was gathered from manufacturers and DOE vehicle emissions class ratings. In this case, the comparison is between the battery-powered GM EV-1, the hybrid-electric Toyota Prius, and the gasoline-powered Honda Civic DX Sedan. All three vehicles have similar body specifications, but contrast in engine types. The major differences are found in performance measures of fuel efficiency, emissions, and range. The hybrid-electric Prius has an particularly notable fuel efficiency, because its city efficiency (52 mpg) exceeds its highway efficiency (45 mpg). In another contrast to conventional vehicles, the range of the hybrid-electric vehicle is also greater for city driving than for highway driving. The electric vehicle boasts no tailpipe emissions and holds the highest emissions rating at ZEV.

Operating costs include energy, battery costs, and maintenance costs. These costs are then converted to per-mile costs, and are comparable with similar costs for a CV. The study considered two cases: one at the time of EV introduction, and another at the time EVs are sold in high volume (more than 100,000 units). In computing the lifecycle costs, several assumptions were made. Vehicle-ownership-related costs such as registration, insurance, and property taxes, are excluded, assuming that these items would be the same for both types of vehicles. Similar annual and lifetime usage of the vehicles at 130,000 miles over a span of 12 years with similar scrappage value at end of their useful lives was assumed. The EV characteristics required for this study included an acceleration of zero to 60 mph in 10-12 seconds, and a battery pack with an energy content of at least 15 kWh (nickel-metal hydride or lead-acid). The EV operating costs included initial and replacement battery packs; routine maintenance costs 20% lower than CVs; and tire cost 11% higher than CVs. The high volume test case accounted for improvements made to EVs, including a 3% reduction in vehicle mass, an 8% power train efficiency improvement, and a 4% discount to the price of replacement battery packs (excluding inflation). Other considerations should be taken into account when comparing CVs and EVs; for example, the dissimilarities in refueling infrastructure and the range between refueling stations. Some researchers have analyzed the perceived negative value held by consumers and translated this utility into a cost equivalent.130  R.M. Cuenca, L.L. Gaines, and A.D.

The energy and maintenance costs, in both cases, are lower for EVs, but the lifetime cost advantage is lost when the price of the battery is added.

Registries also publicly record their progress in reducing emissions and provide public recognition of a company's accomplishments. Registries can also help raise awareness of climate change, promote sharing of lessons learned and success stories, and publicize low-cost mitigation opportunities. This appendix provides a summary of 18 recent states', counties', and regional associations' actions and legislation towards developing GHG registries. Up until recently, a lack of federal leadership on the role of GHG registries (at the state or national level) had prompted many states and regions to begin to take action and resulted in an emerging patchwork of differing requirements and approaches. However, on February 14, 2002, President Bush introduced the Administration's official policy on climate change: Our immediate goal is to reduce America's GHG emissions relative to the size of our economy... Our government will also move forward immediately to create world-class standards for measuring and registering emission reductions. And we will give transferable credits to companies that can show real emission reductions.131 The President's Global Climate Change Policy Book specifically addresses local and national GHG registries: The President directed the Secretary of Energy, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Agriculture, and the Administrator of the EPA, to propose improvements to the current voluntary emission reduction registration program under section 1605(b) of the 1992 Energy Policy Act within 120 days... A number of proposals to reform the existing registry--or create a new registry--have appeared in energy and/or climate policy bills introduced in the past year. The Administration will fully explore the extent to which the existing authority under the Energy Policy Act is adequate to achieve these reforms.132 Many states are reacting to the Administration's policy and are eager to respond to the recommendations expected after 120 days. Project developers should keep abreast to current events with respect to these emerging registry programs.

The California Registry will help various California entities' to establish GHG emissions baselines. Also, the California Registry will enable participating entities to voluntarily record their annual GHG emissions inventories. In turn, the State of California will use its best efforts to ensure that organizations that voluntarily inventory their emissions receive appropriate consideration under any future international, federal, or state regulatory regimes 133 relating to GHG emissions. This bill requires the California Energy Commission to provide guidance to the California Registry on a number of issues, such as, developing GHG emissions protocols, qualifying third-party organizations to provide technical assistance, and qualifying third-party organizations to provide certification of emissions 134 baselines and inventories. This bill requires the Illinois EPA to establish an interstate nitrogen oxide trading program and issue findings that address the need to control or reduce emissions from fossil fuel-fired electric generating plants. The findings are to address the establishment of a banking system, consistent with DOE's Voluntary Reporting of Greenhouse Gases Program for certifying credits for voluntary offsets of emissions of greenhouse gases, or 137 reductions of GHGs. This requires the Department of Environmental Protection to develop rules to create a voluntary registry of GHG emissions. The rules must provide for the collection of data on the origin of the carbon emissions as either fossil fuel or renewable resources, and the collection of data on production activity to allow the tracking of future emission trends.

A3 State Legislation, Policies, and Registries  71   Table A3  U.S. State Registries for Reporting of Greenhouse Gases and State Legislation/Policies to Promote GHG Emission Reductions Directive Date Objective It states, ""the [established] [Maryland Green Buildings] Council shall develop a comprehensive set of initiatives known as the `Maryland Greenhouse Gas Reduction Action Plan;' and The Council shall report annually to the Governor and to the General Assembly on the efforts of State agencies in the implementation of... the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Plan, and other energy efficiency, energy production and sustainability issues or policies 139 the Council may have considered. A November 2001 report by the Council stated, ""Goals [for GHG reductions in Maryland] will be set for both the State facilities and operations as well as statewide reduction goals to be achieved through voluntary 140 initiatives, policies, and programs."" This requires the six highest-polluting power plants in Massachusetts to meet overall emission limits for nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide by October 1, 2004 and begin immediate monitoring and reporting of mercury emissions. For the six affected plants, the rule caps total carbon dioxide emissions and creates an emission standard of 1,800 lbs. of carbon dioxide per megawatt-hour (a reduction of 10 percent below the current average emissions rate). The carbon dioxide limits must be met by October 1, 2006 or October 1, 2008 for plant retrofit or replacement. Plant operators may meet the standard either by increasing efficiency at the plant, or by purchasing credits from other reduction programs approved by the Department of 141 Environmental Protection. This bill to amend the 1994 Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Act calls for declining caps in nitrogen 142 oxides, sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide, and mercury by 2007. The bill has been referred to the Committee on Natural 143 Resources and Environmental Affairs.

The action plan calls for the creation of a regional emissions registry and the exploration of a trading mechanism. This four-pollutant bill is the first in the nation to include carbon 145 dioxide. Emission reduction requirements include 75% of sulfur dioxide by 2006; 70% of nitrogen oxide by 2006; 3% of carbon dioxide by 2006 (1990 levels); and mercury levels are still to be 146 determined by 2004. This bill established a registry for voluntary GHG emission reductions to create an incentive for voluntary emission 147 reductions. Implementation rules were adopted on February 23, 2001. The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection adopted new rules to add provisions to the Open Market Emissions Trading Program for the generation and banking of 148 GHG credits. The GHGs included are: carbon dioxide; methane; nitrous oxide; certain hydro fluorocarbons, per fluorocarbons; and sulfur hexafluoride. The Program was established to provide incentives for voluntary reduction of air contaminant emissions and also provide an alternative means for regulated entities to achieve compliance with air pollution control obligations in a more cost-effective manor.

New York City  New York City Council Bill No. 152 30  Re-introduced January 30, 2002  New York City Council member Peter Vallone Jr. reintroduced a bill that would require the city's power plants to reduce carbon dioxide emissions or face stiff fines. If passed, the bill would reduce carbon dioxide emissions by as much as 20 percent within five years of enactment. Under the terms of the legislation, owners of power plants that produce at least 25 megawatts of electricity for sale would be required to pay high fines for generators that emit levels of carbon dioxide that exceed those 153 established by an independent board. Suffolk County became the first county to pass a resolution limiting carbon dioxide emissions. The resolution seeks to encourage efficiency in existing power plants and future facilities by setting allowable rates for carbon dioxide emissions and penalties for exceeding those limits.

An additional $1 per excess ton would be charged in each consecutive year. The bill contains several alternatives to paying fines including buying emission credits through nationally recognized carbon dioxide trading markets, investing in alternative energy sources or donating penalties to community 154 environmental groups. A carbon dioxide emissions rate of 1,800 lbs/MWh is proposed, along with an allowable County-wide emission rate reduction of 1% for every 100 MW of electric generating capacity installed within the County until the emission rate has been reduced by 20%. Emissions trading would be allowed for compliance. Penalties of $2/ton in the first year and $1/ton each consecutive 155 year would be assessed if the EGU fails to comply. This bill would reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides by 78% by 2009 and sulfur dioxide by 73% by 2013. The bill also directs the North Carolina Division of Air Quality (DAQ) to study the issues for standards of reductions of mercury and carbon dioxide. DAQ is also to develop and adopt a program of incentives to promote voluntary reductions of emissions including, emissions banking and trading and credit for voluntary early action. This bill was sent by the Senate to the House where is has been referred the 156 Committee on Public Utilities This bill established a carbon dioxide standard requiring new utilities to emit 17% less than most energy efficient plant 157 available. The bill capped carbon dioxide emissions at 0.7 pounds of carbon dioxide per kilowatt-hour for base-load natural gas-fired power plants; in 1999 the cap was lowered to 0.675 pounds per kilowatt-hour.

The bill authorizes the Department of Natural Resources to establish systems for registering reductions in fine 162 particulate matter, mercury and other air contaminants. A rule (NR 437) is proposed to establish voluntary emissions reduction registries for GHGs, as well as for mercury, fine particulate matter and other contaminants that cause air pollution. The rule represents a new Department of Natural Resources policy to systematically record and track voluntary emission reductions by industries, electric utility companies, agricultural and forestry interests, and transportation and energy efficiency interests. NR 437 establishes the rules and procedures under which the new registry will operate. The rule also identifies the sources that are eligible to register reductions for GHGs like carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorcarbons and sulfur hexafluoride, as well as for nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, volatile organic compounds, carbon monoxide, mercury, lead and fine particulate matter.

Reported CO2 Equivalent Reduction in 2000 (metric tons)  Reporting Entity  Carryall Vehicle Program  15 Vehicles  Direct:  15.17  Indirect: 796.51 Project Description The Pleasants & Willow Island Power Stations are adjacent coal-fired power generation facilities along the Ohio River near Parkersburg, West Virginia. Plant personnel had used a fleet of pick-up trucks and vans to perform various duties associated with the operation and maintenance of the plant. The number of vehicles in the fleet at the plant totaled 27 at one time. Beginning in 1992, the plant began to evaluate the use of Carryall vehicles to replace the pick-up trucks. These utility vehicles, which are similar to golf carts, were acquired because of the potential to reduce costs to operate and maintain the vehicle fleet through lower purchase price, reduced fuel consumption, and reduced maintenance costs. Both gasoline-powered and electric-powered versions of the Carryall vehicle have been acquired. After a period of demonstration and evaluation, the decision was made in 1996 to retire a portion of the vehicle fleet and to use the Carryall vehicles as the primary vehicles for in-plant transportation. By 1997, the power station complex has added a total of 15 Carryall vehicles to its fleet. There are 12 gasoline-powered vehicles and 3 electric-powered vehicles. Estimation Method Only estimates of changes in CO2 emissions have been included in this report. The 15 pick-up trucks and other vehicles replaced averaged about 350 gallons/truck of fuel consumption annually. The 12 gasoline-powered Carryalls consume about 85 gallons of fuel each on an annual basis. The emissions factor of 19.641 lbs.CO2/gal for each gallon of fuel consumed was applied to the difference in fuel consumption to determine the reduction in CO2 emissions.  A4 Project Reports to 1605(b)  78   The CO2 emitted from the electricity generated to charge the electric Carryalls was subtracted from the difference mentioned above to determine the net reduction in CO2. The electric-powered Carryalls are charged each night for about 10 hours. CO2 emissions for the electricity used are about 1.05 tons/MWh from the Pleasants/Willow Island Power Station complex. The MWh consumption was determined based on information supplied by the vendor. From this information the total CO2 emissions from battery charging can be determined. The vehicle replacement program was considered to be fully implemented in October 1996 when the majority of vehicles were removed from service, so 1996 figures represent 25 percent of annual emissions/reductions. Beginning in 1997, data is reported on an annual basis. DTE Energy/Detroit Edison Electric Vehicle Demonstration Project Project Description 10 vehicles (1994-96); 27 vehicles (1997-98) N/A  Detroit Edison has completed a 30-month Ford Ecostar demonstration program. There were 10 Ecostar electric vans being used in various Company fleet applications. The Ecostars were also displayed in public automotive events and alternative fuel vehicle industry conferences and events. Detroit Edison continues to promote educational efforts to enhance understanding and use of electric vehicles. Sponsoring the 1996 Future Car Challenge, the Hybrid Electric Vehicle Challenges (1993-1995) and past SAE Micro Electric Vehicle Challenges are part of this effort. The Company also sponsored the 1996 EEI Fleet Managers Electric Vehicle Conference and participated in planning and execution of the EV Ready Market Launch Workshop in Detroit. The 10 Ford Ecostar vans were retired in 1997, beginning in September, and Detroit Edison purchased 27 GM S10 electric pickup trucks. The pickups were delivered in June, September and November. Since the vehicles were only utilized for a relatively short time in 1997, the CO2 reductions are expected to be greater during 1998. The fleet of 27 GMC S10 electric pickup trucks were used throughout 1998 but did not result in the anticipated reduction in CO2 emissions because of lower efficiency of these units. In 1999, operation/use of our fleet of electric vehicles was transferred to a local hospital. This precluded accurate record-keeping on electricity used, miles driven and mode of use (e.g., driving vs. standing/idling). Therefore, no report is submitted for 1999 or subsequent years. Detroit Edison's formal involvement with the electric vehicle assessment program concluded at the end of calendar 1998. No further reports will be submitted on this project.  Estimation Method  The electric vehicles replaced various types of internal combustion engine vehicles which had fuel economies of 4 to 20 miles per gallon, depending on application. Fuel savings (gallons gasoline) were estimated according to the fuel economies (miles per gallon) of the vehicles replaced and the actual miles driven by the electric vehicles.  A4 Project Reports to 1605(b)  79   The associated CO2 emissions displaced were calculated by multiplying the gallons of gasoline saved by 19.564 lb CO2/gal. (Appendix B, Form 1605 Instructions) lbs CO2 was then converted to short tons. The electricity consumption from vehicle charging was obtained by metering on-site.

An official program was prepared for submission to the NJDOT. GPU has also undertaken voluntary measures to explore the use of alternatively fueled vehicles for different company functions, including meter reading and shuttle services. Three cars were put into service during 1995, collectively driving 6800 miles. All recorded Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) is mileage by Electric Vehicle that displaced mileage by gasoline fueled vehicles.  A4 Project Reports to 1605(b)  80   Note: The ridesharing portion of this project was discontinued in 1999; therefore the GHG reduction for this project is reduced from past years. Estimation Method Avoided conventional auto travel was recorded for the two components of the program. In 1995, the Corporation's Ridesharing Program resulted in 205,902 avoided travel miles due to car and van pooling and 166,329 avoided miles due to the use of mass transport. The reference case assumes the mass transit services would be operational with or without this program. Consequently, if not for this program 372,231 additional vehicle miles would be traveled. This figure plus the 6800 miles of conventional auto use avoided by the Corporation's electric vehicle testing program were totaled and the Corporate Average Fuel Efficiency rate of 27.5 miles per gallon was used to calculate the motor fuel use avoided. This figure was converted to emissions data using following methodology from the Guidelines: Annual Emissions = (Annual Mileage eliminated x FMij) + (Annual Fuel saved x FFij) where FMij = emissions factor per mile eliminated for GHG i and fuel j FFij = emissions factor per unit of fuel saved for GHG i and fuel j. Fuel type was assumed to be gasoline in all cases. Emissions factors from Guidelines are as follows: FMij (grams/mile): CH4: 0.05 CO2: 2.0 N2O: 0.05 FFij (grams/gallon): CH4: 8.67 CO2: 1.10 x 10e4 N2O: 0.175 For all gases, FMij represents direct emissions, i.e. emission from vehicles. For N20 and CH4, FFij represents indirect emissions, i.e. emissions from upstream processes such as refining. For CO2, FFij includes both tailpipe emissions (direct) and upstream emissions (indirect). A factor for direct emissions was determined using the emission factor from Appendix B in the instructions (19.641 #/gal or 0.891 x 10e4 grams/gal). A factor for indirect emissions was calculated by subtraction, 1.10 x 10e4 - 0.8909 x 10e4 = 0.209 x 10e4 grams/gal. Grams of each GHG were then converted to short tons using the following formula: (grams x 0.001) x 0.001102 (The offsetting emissions associated with the electricity used to recharge vehicle batteries were not estimated.) All employee trip reduction emissions saved are counted as indirect emissions reductions.

The Electric Vehicle Program also includes vehicle service (maintenance) and deployment, infrastructure improvements (installation of charging stations for cars, buses, airport shuttles), mass transit (San Pedro Trolley, Airport Shuttle Buses, including operations, maintenance, and capital outlays), as well as public outreach & education about electric vehicles. The electric vehicle program also encourages EV use in the city and provides subsidies for infrastructure improvements related to the use of EVs.  Estimation Method  Year 2000: Total miles saved (gasoline-powered vehicles) = 1,025,753, which includes vehicle miles eliminated due to carpooling and mass transit ridership of the electric San Pedro Trolley. (1025753 miles)(1 gal gas/20 miles)=51287.65 gals Formula No. 1: Emissions reduced from gasoline-powered vehicles = (51287.65 gallons of gasoline saved) x (19.564 lb CO2 /gal) / 2000 lbs per ton = 501.696 tons CO2 saved. Formula No. 2: Offsetting emissions from power plants = (253200 kWh of electricity used to charge vehicles) / 1,000,000] x (821 short tons CO2 /GWH system emissions factor) = 207.877 tons CO2 emitted. Formula No. 3: Net CO2 reductions = Emissions reduced from vehicles - offsetting emissions from power plants = 501.696 tons - 207.877 tons = 293.82 tons CO2 reduced. NOTE: System emission factors (st of CO2 /GWH) for previous years: 1996 = 968; 1997 = 972; 1998 = 965; 1999 = 856 National Grid USA Direct: 2.89  Electric Vehicles Project Description Estimation Method  2 vehicles, 8151 VMT  Indirect: -1.80  Massachusetts Electric Company has made available for employee use, two Toyota RAV4-EV`s to demonstrate that these zero-emission vehicles are practical, and to encourage their use instead of conventional gasoline-powered cars or pick-up trucks. The two RAV4-EVs together logged 8,151 miles from 2/16 2000 - 2/26/2001. Assumed that each vehicle would have consumed about 1 gallon of gasoline for every 25 miles driven. Utilized the Emission Coefficient from Appendix B of the Instructions for Form EIA-1605 of 19.564 pounds of CO2 per gallon of motor gasoline. Assumed that the RAV4-EVs get 3 miles per ac kWh of charging energy. Therefore: 8,151 miles X 1 gallon MV/25 mpg = 326 gallons. For the electricity associated indirect emission: 1999: (8000 mi) / (3 mi/kWh) / (1000 kWh/MWh) * (0.729 st/MWh) * (2000 lbs/st) = 3888 lbs CO2 2000: (8151 mi) / (3 mi/kWh) / (1000 kWh/MWh) * (0.729 st/MWh) * (2000 lbs/st) = 3961 lbs CO2  A4 Project Reports to 1605(b)  82   Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation Number of vehicles varied between 9 and 52; Alternative Fuel Vehicles Project Description Estimation Method 30 vehicles in 2000 Direct: 22.04  NMPC has been involved in operating and testing alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs) for almost 30 years. The Company also currently has a number of ""Clean Air"" natural gas-fueled buses in operation as part of a cooperative program with the Syracuse, New York Centro transit system. CO2 emission reductions are based on the difference in CO2 emissions between gasoline-fueled vehicles and CNG or electric vehicles. Only direct emission reductions are reported. Emissions estimates are based on a CO2 emission factor for each fuel. For motor gasoline, an emission factor of 19.641 lbs/gallon was used. For diesel fuel, an emission factor of 22.384 lbs/gallon was used. For CNG vehicles, a factor of 120.593 lbs/Mcf was used. These factors are based upon Form EIA-1605, Voluntary Reporting of Greenhouse Gases, Instructions, Appendix B. Fuel and Energy Source Codes and Emission Coefficients: EIA, 1996. For electric vehicles, NYPPs marginal emissions rate of 1.44 lbs/kWh for the years 1991-1995, rate of 1.48 lbs/kWh for 1996, and 1.46 lbs/kWh for 1997 and 1998 were used. These marginal rates were determined based on production simulation modeling (PROMOD IV). NiSource/NIPSCO  Electric Vehicles Project Description  1 vehicle in 1994-1997  N/A  NIPSCO expects to be a force in our region for educating the public on the environmental and efficiency benefits of electric vehicles. We lead by example with one electric truck in our fleet. Ozone is formed through the reaction of two precursor chemicals: Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) and Nitrogen Oxides (NOX). The electric vehicle will reduce emissions of VOCs and NOX and therefore decrease the amount of ozone formed. Additionally, most of the electricity needed to serve this market will be generated during off-peak hours, thereby allowing NIPSCO to benefit from a more efficient use of generating capacity. NIPSCO is currently participating in or will participate on the EPRI Transportation Business Council, the Mid-America Electric Vehicle Consortium, and the Electric Transportation Consortium. In addition, we support the Electric Racing Series and the University of Notre Dame electric car and we are trial marketing ""The Clean Switch"" catalog.

PG&E Corporation Electric Vehicles Project Description 32 vehicles in 1999; 26 vehicles in 2000 Direct: 2661.68  Pacific Gas and Electric Company Clean Air Vehicle Program: In 1990 Pacific Gas and Electric Company received California Public Utility Commission approval to spend up to $50 million by December 31, 1994 to support the development and introduction of electric and natural gas vehicles. By the end of 1993, Pacific Gas and Electric Company was operating 698 natural gas vehicles and 30 natural gas refueling stations. Encouragement took many forms: demonstrating vehicle and station performance, providing natural gas refueling station designs, providing partial funding for vehicle purchases, opening Company stations for public use, etc. After 1994, there was a decreased emphasis on customer financial support. But the Company has continued to promote, facilitate and encourage electric and natural gas vehicle use by its customers. Pacific Gas and Electric Company continues to claim credit for not only its own fuel displacement, but also for displacements that it has encouraged its customers to undertake.  Estimation Method  Electric fuel use reflects an estimate which takes into consideration Pacific Gas and Electric Company records of its own electric vehicle fleet use, and our records of electrical energy demand within electric vehicle tariffs, manufacturer reports of electric vehicles leased or sold to our customers, and our expectations of total energy use by such vehicles. Using the following factors, the Company calculates the CO2 emissions avoided through displaced gasoline. Pacific Gas and Electric Company's average fossil fuel emission rate in 1998 was 0.545 tons CO2 per MWh. The Company believes this to be the appropriate metric for generation to supply electric vehicles because fossil generation is typically at the margin in its energy mix. 0.545 tons CO2 per MWh from Company generation facilities 19.564. lbs CO2 per equivalent gallon of gasoline 7 KWh per gallon of gasoline in PG&E fleet In 1999 a total of 1.05 GWh of electricity was used to displace gasoline. 1,465 tons CO2 gasoline - 572 tons CO2 electricity = 893 tons CO2 avoided.

Public Utility District No. 1 of Snohomish County Electric Car Race Project Description Estimation Method 1 race in 1996 N/A  Snohomish County PUD Sponsored a high school electric car race. Each car had two twelve volt batteries. The winner of the race was determined by who could go around an oval race track the most times in one hour. No emissions estimates were made for this project.  Sacramento Municipal Utility District Ride Electric Project Description 445,452 VMT over 7 years (1994-2000) Direct: 9.07  A key component of SMUDs Ride Electric Program is introduction and practical use of various electric vehicles in fleet service. Between 1990 and 2000, the District has acquired or assisted in acquisition of a large number of electric vehicles for its fleet and other Sacramento area fleets. These vehicles, which replaced gasoline and diesel powered vehicles, have accumulated 440,000 miles of service at SMUD, resulting in significant reductions in fossil fuel use, criteria pollutants and GHGs, to the benefit of the local community and its citizen-ratepayers. Actual Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) are tabulated for each vehicle in operation under the Ride Electric Program from District Vehicle Management System (VMS) records and other records maintained by the District. Gasoline and diesel fuel displacement is calculated by multiplying VMT of the electric vehicles in the District by the fuel use (gal/mile) of an equivalent gasoline or diesel powered vehicle, or in the case of a conversion from internal combustion engine (ICE) power to electric, actual ICE fuel use figures are used for the comparison. Emission rates for gasoline or diesel vehicles replaced by electric vehicles in the Ride Electric program are calculated by multiplying the vehicle fuel use rate (gal/mi) by the VMT by the EIA CO2 rate for the displaced fuel, and converting from lbs. CO2 to short tons of CO2. Emission rates for electric vehicles are calculated by multiplying the vehicle energy use (MWH/mi) by the vehicle miles by the CO2 generation rate (1485 lbs CO2/MWh) of the Districts marginal generating resources. Reductions are the net of these emissions.

During 2000, Southern Company successfully worked to expand the penetration of material handling vehicles, Neighborhood Electric Vehicles (NEV`s), and airport ground support equipment within the service territories. Electric and hybrid electric buses are now in service in Birmingham, and they are to be added in Mobile, Atlanta, and Gadsden. Fast charge projects for forklifts, airport ground support equipment, and buses are being conducted in Atlanta and Birmingham. Southern Company completed its involvement with USABC in 2000 at the conclusion of Phase II of that effort. Through its individual corporate contribution and through its affiliation with EPRI, Southern Company has invested more that $2.1million over the eight year duration of Phases I and II of USABC. Southern Company has also provided management and technical manpower in support of USABC`s efforts to develop advanced batteries for electric transportation and stationary applications. EPRI Electric Transportation Business Unit - Southern Company is the largest individual contributor to the Electric Transportation Business Unit of EPRI. In 2000, Southern Company contributed approximately $590,000 to EPRI in support of a variety of programs to develop and demonstrate EV batteries, charging infrastructure, public transit technologies, and industrial vehicles. In 2001 Southern Company will contribute approximately $400,000 to continue this research. The Commercialization of Electric Transportation - Southern Company supports the commercialization of EV`s through internal purchases, and by supporting commercial and industrial customers in evaluating and purchasing EV`s. Georgia Power Company continues an employee lease program for Southern Company employees in Atlanta by providing the opportunity to lease up to 100 EV`s per year. Alabama and Georgia Power both have successful customer EV loaner programs that have caused customers to lease vehicles based on business case, even though vehicle availability from OEM`s has decreased significantly. In 2000 Southern Company expanded its fleet to approximately 350 EV`s, including cars, trucks, neighborhood electric vehicles, and buses. Electric Vehicle Association of the Americas (EVAA): The mission of the EVAA is to provide a public policy framework that supports development of a widespread, sustainable market for electric vehicles. The EVAA serves as the official information source for electric vehicle technology and facilitates programs for market development. EVAA provides a national directory for electric vehicle recharging facilities and has developed infrastructure and technical reference manuals for EV Ready workshops sponsored by DOE. EVAA, with the support of Southern Company and other members, has been successful in lobbying Congress for significant dollars for airport funding and electric bus projects, as well as legislation that provides federal incentive and tax credit legislation promoting the purchase of electric vehicles.  Estimation Method  The reduction in CO2 due to operation of electric vehicles was calculated as follows: {[(miles driven/vehicle / 22 miles/gal) x 19.564 lb CO2/gal x no. vehicles] - (MWh x coal-fired heat rate x 205.3 lb CO2/MBtu)} / 2204.6 lb/mt Tennessee Valley Authority  Alternate Fuel Vehicles  19,760 VMT (1994)  N/A  A4 Project Reports to 1605(b)  87   Project Description  In 1994, TVA had 31 alternate fuel vehicles operating in its transportation fleet. These included 23 sedans fueled by M-85 (a blend of 85 percent methanol and 15 percent gasoline), 2 compressed natural gas vans, 5 electric pickup trucks, and one electric van. In question 4, the alternate fuel type listed as ""ZZ"" is the M-85. Project results for 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999 and 2000 are not reported as data were not available.  Estimation Method  The direct emissions shown in Part 3 are the emissions used to compute the reported emissions reductions. These are the total emissions from the TVA transportation fleet. The actual CO2 emissions were determined from the fuel consumed and the fuel emissions factor from Appendix B. See the previous project, Transportation Fleet Fuel Efficiency Improvements. The CO2 reductions as a result of alternate fuel vehicle (AFV) operation is the net difference between the modified reference case CO2 emissions and the actual emissions from the AFVs. The modified reference case emissions are the emissions that would have occurred had the miles driven by the AFVs been driven by the conventional fleet. The modified reference case emissions were determined from the actual AFV miles traveled, the average miles per gallon for the comparable conventional vehicles, the heating value of gasoline (125,100 BTU/Gal), and the gasoline emissions factor from Appendix B (157 lb CO2/MM BTU). It was assumed that the electric and CNG vehicles displaced emissions from the conventional 4X2 pickup fleet and the M-85 vehicles displaced emissions from the conventional sedan fleet. The actual emissions for the CNG and M-85 AFVs were determined from the fuel usage, the heating value of the fuel, and the fuel emissions factor. The heating value for CNG is 1000 BTU/Ft3 and for M-85 is 73,590 BTU/Gal. The emissions factor for CNG is 120 lbs CO2/MM BTU and 146 lbs CO2/MM BTU for M-85. To determine the actual emissions for the electric vehicles it was assumed that the energy used to charge the vehicles was generated by the TVA coal fired system. The emissions associated with the charging was determined from the KWH used, the average coal fired system heat rate, and the coal emissions factor from Appendix B. The following table summarizes the operation of the AFVs and the resulting effect on CO2 emissions for 1994. In this table, negative changes, i.e. reductions, are shown in parentheses.

GX215-21-6666751	"INFORMATION COLLECTION REQUEST RENEWAL        FOR THE ACID RAIN PROGRAM        UNDER THE CLEAN AIR ACT AMENDMENTS TITLE IV                        April 8, 1999                  INFORMATION COLLECTION REQUEST RENEWAL      FOR THE ACID RAIN PROGRAM      UNDER THE CLEAN AIR ACT AMENDMENTS TITLE IV      (JANUARY 1999 THROUGH JANUARY 2002)        SUPPORTING STATEMENT          1. IDENTIFICATION OF THE INFORMATION COLLECTION        1.1 Background       Title IV of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (the acid rain title) establishes goals to reduce annual emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NO x ) and to place a national cap on sulfur dioxide emissions beginning in the year 2000.  Emissions reductions are mandated in two phases:        Beginning in 1995 (Phase I), part of the SO2 and NO x  reductions are to be achieved through emissions reduction requirements at 110 of the largest, highest-emitting power plants;        Beginning in the year 2000 (Phase II), the SO2 and NO x  reduction goals are to be reached through more stringent requirements at virtually all fossil fuel power plants.       To help meet emissions reduction goals, Title IV provides for a program that allocates emissions allowances to affected utility units based on a national target for SO2 reductions, and allows market forces to achieve the targeted reductions in the most cost-effective manner.  Under this program, each affected unit receives its allocation of allowances every year.  An affected unit must hold one allowance for each ton of SO2 it emits.  Affected utilities and individuals may buy and sell allowances, or save them for future use or sale.       The ability to buy and sell (or transfer) allowances provides substantial economic benefits, by encouraging the greatest emissions reductions where costs of reductions are lowest.  This concept of allowance transfers cannot be implemented, however, unless regulations governing emissions monitoring and permitting of acid rain sources are in place as well.  To ensure compliance with the emissions reduction requirements and to provide the national consistency needed to foster the allowance market, sections 408 and 412 of Title IV require the designated representative of the owners and operators of each affected acid rain source to obtain an operating permit for the affected source and to certify that an approved emissions monitoring system has been installed and is properly operated at each affected unit's source of emissions.         Emissions monitoring and reporting is the foundation upon which the allowance trading system is based.  Without accurate monitoring and reporting of emissions, the integrity of the allowance system would be undermined, and there would be no assurance that emissions had been reduced.        Acid rain permits will allow sources the flexibility to comply with the emissions reduction requirements of Title IV by employing one or more compliance options for SO2.  The procedures specified in the acid rain permits regulations, including the use of standardized forms,  ensure that the intended flexibility and accountability is preserved as the Acid Rain Program is implemented nationwide by different permitting authorities.       Participation in the annual auction is voluntary.  Information will be collected by EPA's Acid Rain Division, or its designated agent, and will be used to conduct and facilitate administration of the auction.  Auction participants must submit a bid form and payment method.       Section 410 of Title IV provides that sources of SO2 emissions that are not regulated, i.e., small utility units and industrial boilers, may elect to ""opt in"" to the allowance allocation and trading program.  To opt in, the source owner or operator must submit an opt-in permit application to EPA.  Sources that opt in (1) will become affected sources, (2) will receive an annual allocation of allowances, and (3) may sell any allowances they do not use for their own emissions.  Because opting in is voluntary, only those unaffected sources that would profit by opting in are expected to do so.       Although the principal purpose of Title IV of the Clean Air Act is to reduce acid rain by requiring reductions in emissions of SO2 and NO x , it is also the purpose of this title to encourage energy conservation and pollution prevention as a long-range strategy for reducing air pollution and other adverse effects of energy production and use.  As an incentive for electric utilities to (1) implement energy conservation measures and (2) use renewable energy, section 404(f) of Title IV establishes provisions for qualifying electric utilities to receive allowances from the Conservation and Renewable Energy Reserve for SO2 emissions avoided through either of these two options.        The NO x  emission reductions will be achieved through maximum allowable emission rates for coal-fired utility boilers.  The allowable rate for a given boiler depends on the type of boiler.  The NO x  regulations for coal-fired boilers are applied to two groups of boilers, as specified by the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA).  Boilers in each group become affected at different times, as described below.  Group 1 boilers are (1) dry bottom wall-fired boilers that do not apply cell burner technology or (2) tangentially fired boilers.  Group 2 boilers are all other types of utility boilers, including (1) wet bottom wall-fired boilers, (2) cyclones, and (3) boilers applying cell burner technology.  In Phase I, which began January 1, 1996 for NO x , NO x  emission limitations apply only to Group 1 boilers that are subject to the Phase I SO 2  limitations.  In Phase II, beginning January 1, 2000, NO x  emission limitations become effective for all boilers (Group 1 and Group 2).       1.2 Information to Be Collected       EPA has developed regulations to implement the emissions reduction provisions of Title IV of the Clean Air Act Amendments that cover        Allowance tracking and transfers (section 403);      Energy conservation and renewable energy incentives (section 404);      Permits (section 408);       Emissions monitoring (section 412);           Auctions (section 416);        Opt-in (section 410 a-g);         Annual Compliance Certification (sections 403 & 408);         Small diesel (section 410 h); and         NO x  permitting.                This Information Collection Request (ICR) addresses the paperwork burden related to (1) transferring and tracking allowances; (2) obtaining and distributing allowances from the Conservation and Renewable Energy Reserve; (3) obtaining and issuing permits and compliance plans (e.g., submitting permit applications); (4) submitting and certifying emissions monitoring plans; (5) the allocation of allowances to small diesel refineries; (6) the opt-in program; (7) annual year-end compliance certification reporting; (8) NO x  permitting, and, (9) all labor associated with recording and reporting emissions data under Title IV of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.  Burden estimates provided in this ICR are for the period from January 31, 1999 to January 31, 2002.  This ICR covers the last year of Phase I, 1999.  The burden and cost of continuous emission monitoring is reflected in this ICR and includes all Phase I and Phase II units.            Allowance Transfers     All participants in the allowance transfer system will be required to complete and submit an allowance transfer form for each allowance transfer. This can be done either electronically or using a paper form. Participants in the transfer system that are not affected sources under Title IV will also be required to file a one time account information application to establish an account in the Allowance Tracking System (ATS).       Conservation and Renewable Energy Reserve     To receive allowances for emissions avoided through the use of energy conservation measures or renewable energy, utilities must submit an application to receive allowances that (1) designates and verifies the measures used to avoid emissions, (2) calculates the tons of emissions avoided, and (3) demonstrates qualification to receive allowances from the Conservation and Renewable Energy Reserve.        Permits     Permit applicants are required to submit an acid rain permit application for each affected source.  The permit application must include, for each unit at the source, (1) general information on the unit, (2) a complete compliance plan for each unit, and (3) the Acid Rain Program standard requirements.       Emissions Monitoring     To meet the emissions monitoring record-keeping and reporting requirements, affected units are required to (1) submit a monitoring plan and certification of monitors, (2) record hourly pollutant and flow monitor data, and (3) submit electronic quarterly reports of their emissions data to EPA.  Operators of new electric generating units of 25 megawatts (MW) capacity or less may receive a CEMS exception if they certify their use of very-low-sulfur fuel.        Submissions Purposes and Procedures     Allowance transfer notifications may be submitted to EPA electronically or on paper.  Emissions reports must be submitted electronically. All Phase II permit applications must be submitted on paper.       The allowance transfer submittal is used to record allowance transfers for compliance purposes and to track the disposition of all allowances in the system.  Applications for allowances from the Energy Conservation and Renewable Energy Reserve provide information on the emissions avoided through the use of energy conservation measures and renewable energy, and are used to allocate allowances from the reserve.       Acid rain permit applications are used to issue operating permits to affected sources under the Acid Rain Program.  Because the permit applications and permits are public documents, they provide an opportunity for the affected public to examine activities undertaken by affected sources.  The designated representative certification, which designates a responsible official through whom the owners and operators of each affected source and each affected unit can trade allowances and obtain and maintain permits, serves to remove EPA from involvement in disputes between owners and operators of affected units.        Monitoring plan submissions are used by EPA to verify that the emissions monitoring system at a unit meets the requirements set forth in Title IV of the Act and in the implementing regulations.  Results of continuous emission monitoring system performance tests allow EPA to certify that monitors perform well enough to produce accurate emissions data.  Emissions data is used to monitor compliance with emissions requirements under Title IV and to provide a basis for analyzing progress in meeting air quality objectives.  Allowance tracking information, emissions data, and the contents of permit applications all provide information for the allowance market and the general public.        Opt-in Program     This ICR also addresses the paperwork burden for small utility units and industrial boilers that opt-in.  The Agency has identified five burden areas associated with a source's opting in to the allowance allocation and trading program.  These areas are (1) completing the permit application, (2) recording and reporting emissions data, (3) compliance reporting, and (4) withdrawing from the program. Estimates for the opt-in program detail the burden for both operating and shut-down opt-ins.       The Opt-in program requires respondents to submit an acid rain permit application.  For all respondents, the application must provide (1) general information about the source, (2) specific data about the source's fuel consumption and operating data for 1985, 1986, 1987, and (3) data on the source's actual and allowable emission rates for 1985, as well as the current allowable emission rate. The permit application and proposed thermal energy compliance plan for sources that opt in and shut down must include information describing the source's plans for the replacement of thermal energy.       To meet emissions monitoring, record-keeping and reporting requirements, sources that opt-in and continue operating will be required to (1) submit a monitoring plan and certification of monitors, (2) record hourly pollutant and flow monitor data, and (3) submit quarterly reports of their emissions data to EPA.  Sources that opt in and shut down will not have to perform tasks associated with emissions monitoring, reporting, and recording.       Meanwhile, to meet requirements for reporting compliance, respondents must submit an annual compliance certification report in which they (1) report their utilization information, (2) report any replacement of thermal energy, and (3) report on allowances transferred as a result of the replacement of thermal energy. Finally, all sources that have opted in and later decide to withdraw will be required to complete withdrawl notification.      Annual Compliance Certification     Compliance with the SO 2  emission limitations is determined annually.  To meet the annual compliance requirements for Phase I, the designated representative for each Phase I affected unit must submit (1) an Annual Compliance Certification Report stating whether the unit was in compliance with all Acid Rain Program requirements for the calendar year, and (2) a Utilization Accounting form that calculates the annual utilization and other operating data.         In addition, if a source is underutilized or claims sulfur-free generation, the designated representative must submit a Dispatch System Data Report that states dispatch system utilization, sales, and emissions rate information.       The designated representative also has the option of submitting an allowance deduction form to identify specific serial numbered allowances to be deducted for annual compliance.       In Phase II, the designated representative for each affected unit must submit an Annual Compliance Certification Report stating whether the unit was in compliance with all Acid Rain Program requirements for the calendar year, and has the option of submitting an allowance deduction form to identify specific serial numbered allowances to be deducted for annual compliance.      NO x  Permitting       An owner or operator of a Phase II, Group 1 unit may meet the requirements of the NO x  regulations through one of three compliance options:        meeting the standard limits      obtaining approval for an emissions averaging plan      obtaining an alternative emissions limitation (AEL)        Two or more units may average their NO x  emissions, as provided for by Title IV.  In an approved NO x  emissions averaging group, the NO x  emission rates of some of the individual units may exceed their respective emission limitations, as long as the Btu-weighted average NO x  emission rate for the entire group is less than or equal to the weighted average of the emission limitations for the individual units.  The ability to average emissions is expected to allow utilities to meet the NO x  requirements at lower cost.       Title IV also provides that an owner or operator of an affected unit may petition EPA for a higher, alternative emission limitation (AEL) if the unit cannot meet the emission limitations even after a retrofit with low NO x  burner technology .  The opportunity to obtain AELs will allow for adjustment of emission limitations for specific units where the technologies on which the limitations were based do not provide the expected level of emission reductions in practice.       Meeting the standard limit is the least burdensome administratively for sources.  All owners and operators of affected units are eligible to comply with the NO x  regulations using this option.  The submission of an application for emissions averaging, or an AEL, or early election is optional and voluntary.       For units that comply by meeting the standard limits or that choose to early elect, applicants were required only to identify the unit.       Applicants seeking approval for emissions averaging are required to identify the units in the group, assign alternative contemporaneous emissions limitations to each unit, and demonstrate that the Btu-weighted average of these alternative limits is less than or equal to the Btu-weighted average of the limits that would apply in the absence of averaging.       All applicants for AELs are required to demonstrate that they are eligible for an AEL, by providing (1) evidence that the appropriate emissions control equipment has been installed, and (2) monitoring data showing that the unit cannot meet the applicable emission rate.          The total  respondent reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to be 1,330,327 hours in 1999, 1,220,183 hours in 2000, and 1,220,156 hours in 2001.  The total burden to EPA is estimated to be 17,477 hours in 1999, 17,174 hours in 2000, and 19,986 hours in 2001.      2. NEED FOR AND USE OF THE COLLECTION       This section describes EPA's need for the information collections described above and the legal authority for conducting collections.  The users of collected information are also described.        2.1 Need/Authority for the Collection       Section 403(b) of Title IV of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 provides for the transfer of allowances among designated representatives of owners and operators of affected sources and any person who holds allowances.  Transfers of allowances will not be deemed effective until written certification of the transfer, signed by a responsible official of each party to the transfer, is received and recorded by EPA.  Section 403(d) of Title IV requires that EPA develop a system for issuing, recording, and tracking allowances (intended to help ensure an orderly and competitive allowance system).      Conservation and Renewable Energy Reserve     Section 404(f) of Title IV establishes provisions for qualifying electric utilities to receive allowances from the Conservation and Renewable Energy Reserve for SO2 emissions avoided through the use of qualifying energy conservation measures or renewable energy.  The allowances will be allocated on a first come, first served basis during the period from January 1, 1992 to December 31, 2000.      Permits     Section 408 of Title IV and Title V of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 require that the designated representative of the owners and operators of each affected source under the Acid Rain Program obtain a permit.  Section 408 also specifies that EPA must issue acid rain permits for Phase I of the Acid Rain Program and that permits must have a term of five years.  In Phase II, the permitting authority, usually a State or local agency, will issue the permits that will also have a term of five  years.       Emissions Monitoring     Section 412(a) of Title IV requires the use of CEM systems (or alternative monitoring systems demonstrated to be equivalent) at each affected unit's source of emissions. Section 504(a) of Title V requires that the results of any required monitoring be submitted to the permitting authority no less often than every six months. The information collection is consistent with satisfying these minimum statutory requirements.  Note that reports are submitted quarterly rather than semiannually. The Acid Rain Advisory Committee recommended that EPA collect emissions data on a quarterly basis and this schedule has proven to allow for effective implementation of the program.      Auctions     Although participation in the annual auction is voluntary, the information to be collected is necessary to operate and administer the program and is required specifically under Title IV, Section 416(d)(2).      Small Diesel Refineries     Section 410(h) of the Act creates a program for allocation of allowances to small diesel refineries for desulfurization of diesel fuel. Each year of the program (1993-1999), eligible refiners will submit information regarding the amount of diesel fuel desulfurized.  This program is voluntary, the benefit of allowance allocations is tied to the submittal of necessary information.      Opt-in     Section 410(a) of Title IV of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 allows the owner or operator of any SO2 source that is not an affected unit under section 403(e), 404, or 405 to elect to designate that source as an affected source and receive allowances under Title IV.  Section 410(a) requires sources opting in to submit a permit application and a compliance plan to the Administrator.         Section 410(b) requires the Administrator to establish a baseline utilization rate for SO2 emissions for opt-in sources based on fuel consumption and operating data for calendar years 1985, 1986, 1987.  Section 410(c) requires the Administrator to establish a limit for SO2 emissions based on the baseline utilization rate and the lesser of the source's actual or allowable 1985 emissions.       Section 410(e) requires that the Administrator issue allowances to sources that become affected sources under Section 410.  The number of allowances is to be based on calculations made under Section 410(c).      NO x  Permitting     Section 408 of Title IV of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 specifies that utility owners and operators of units affected under Title IV must submit permit applications and compliance plans (including NO x  compliance plans), and that EPA must issue permits.             Section 408 provides general authority for the information collections under this ICR related to compliance options.  In addition,          Section 407(e) of Title IV allows the owner or operator of two or more affected units to petition the permitting authority for a NO x  averaging plan.        Section 407(d) provides for AELs for utility units that cannot meet the applicable limitation using low NO x  burner technology or the technology on which the limitation was based.  Section 407(d) specifies that an owner or operator requesting an AEL must show the permitting authority that (1) appropriate control equipment has been properly installed, and (2) the equipment has been properly operated for a period of fifteen months (or another period of time as established by regulation) and operating and monitoring data for such period demonstrate that the unit cannot meet the applicable emission rate.  The owner or operator must also specify an emission rate that the unit can meet on an annual average basis.            2.2 Practical Utility/Users of the Data      Allowance Transfers     Information collected on allowance transfers will be used by EPA or its designated agent to track allowances for the purpose of determining compliance with the Acid Rain Program.  Information on allowance transfers will also be used by participants in the allowance market and the public to evaluate the activities of utilities, and by EPA for program evaluation.        Auctions     EPA or its designated agent will use the information collected for the allowance auction to conduct and facilitate administration of auctions.  The basic information requested will require little evaluation.  Bids submitted for auctions will be ranked to select winning bidders and to conduct transfers of emission allowances.  The auction information results will also be used by participants in the allowance market and by state public utility commissions in evaluating their states' utilities activities.      Conservation and Renewable Energy Reserve     Information collected on the use of energy conservation measures and renewable energy will be used by EPA to issue allowances from the Conservation and Renewable Energy Reserve.        Permits     Acid rain permit applications, including proposed compliance plans, will be used by EPA and permitting authorities to issue operating permits and to allocate allowances.  A permit application will be legally binding on the owners, operators, and designated representative of a source until the actual permit is issued.  This aspect of the permit application reduces significantly the uncertainty imposed on a source due to possible delays at EPA.  EPA will use the acid rain permit as a binding document for determining each unit's compliance with the Acid Rain Program.  Affected sources may rely on the permit for information on the requirements with which they must comply.  Because permit applications and permits will be public documents, they may be used by the public to examine activities undertaken by affected sources.        Emissions Monitoring     Data from emissions monitoring is indispensable to successful implementation of the Acid Rain Program for two reasons:          Title IV of the Act clearly states that its primary purpose is to reduce the adverse effects of acid deposition by reducing annual emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. For sulfur dioxide emissions, the statutory objective is achieved through an emissions trading program. For nitrogen oxide emissions, the statutory objective is achieved through annual emission limitations on certain units.        EPA can only enforce the sulfur dioxide trading program and the nitrogen oxide emission limitation program by having accurate emissions data for each affected unit.       Electric utilities, energy consultants, and power marketing companies can use the Acid Rain program emissions data to project future SO 2  allowance costs and availability.  Academic institutions can perform data modeling to evaluate environmental benefits and estimate health effects of SO 2  reductions.  EPA and other agencies use it to try to correlate the reduction of SO 2  emissions with a decrease in acid precipitation, and also to measure the impacts of other existing and proposed emissions trading programs.       Together, the allowance trading system, operating permits, and emissions data provide the accountability to allow the Acid Rain Program to function without more stringent command and control approaches.      Opt-in     Information collected on opt-in respondents is used by EPA to record which sources are to be designated affected sources, and hence are to be bound by the regulations of the CAAA that are relevant to affected sources.       Opt-in permit applications are used by EPA to issue operating permits.  A permit application is legally binding on the owners, operators, and designated representative of a source until the actual permit is issued.  This aspect of the permit application reduces significantly any uncertainty during the period of time required to issue a permit.  EPA uses the opt-in permit as a binding document for determining each source's compliance with Acid Rain Program.  Fuel usage and emissions rate data in the opt-in application is used to allocate allowances to the opt-in source.       The information on annual utilization and the replacement of thermal energy, if covered by a Thermal Energy Plan, contained in the annual compliance report is used by EPA to determine compliance with the Act.       For respondents who choose to withdraw from the program, the withdrawl notification is essential to notify EPA to discontinue the allocation of allowances to the source and enforcement of the acid rain provisions.      Annual Compliance Certification     This information will be used by EPA to determine annual compliance.      NO x  Permitting     Information collected on NO x  compliance plans will be used by EPA to evaluate these compliance plans.  Information collected on applications for emissions averaging groups or AELs will be used by EPA to determine whether to approve these applications.  This information may also be used by the regulated community and the public to evaluate the activities of utilities, and by EPA for program evaluation.        3. NONDUPLICATION, CONSULTATIONS, AND OTHER COLLECTION CRITERIA       This section describes (1) efforts by EPA to learn whether the information requested is available from other sources, (2) consultations with respondents and data users to plan collections, monitor their usefulness, and minimize the collection burden, (3) effects of less frequent collections, and (4) justification for deviations from OMB's general guidelines.        3.1 Nonduplication       Almost all information requested from respondents under this ICR is required by statute and, in most cases, is not available from other sources.  Review of the proposed forms resulted in the elimination of many redundant requirements.       Where EPA needs information that has already been submitted, EPA is simply requiring a photocopy of the prior submittal.          3.2 Consultations       The data requirements for the Acid Rain Program were developed with the benefit of extensive consultation with the Acid Rain Advisory Committee (ARAC) during five meetings in 1991 lasting two to three days each.  The Committee was composed of representatives of those entities most affected by or interested in the information requirements of the Acid Rain Program.  Representation on the Committee was provided for industry, states, and environmental groups.  Other parties consulted include the Utility Air Regulatory Group (UARG), the State and Territorial Air Pollution Program Administrators (STAPPA), and the Association of Local Air Pollution Control Officers (ALAPCO).       Recommendations provided by ARAC strongly supported the use of standardized reporting forms for acid rain permit applications:        Utilities affirmed that standardized forms reduce uncertainty about what constitutes a complete application and thus reduce the need to supply additional information in a second submission;        States asserted that the use of standardized forms developed by EPA would reduce the time and effort states will need to implement an acid rain permit program; and        Environmental groups argued that the use of standardized forms provides greater assurance that permits will be enforceable in a consistent manner nationwide.       Many ARAC recommendations were incorporated into the acid rain regulations regarding permits and the related standardized forms.         Furthermore, since the beginning of implementation of the Acid Rain Program, representatives from the utility industry, monitoring equipment vendors, software programmers, consultants working together with utilities, and other interested parties have offered comments on the existing rule requirements, standard forms and electronic data reporting formats used to implement the Part 75 program.  The EPA has used these comments to revise the rules, forms and reporting formats, especially changes in the formats to cover a wider group of units.  In particular, the revised forms and electronic data reporting format have been revised in the past to address reporting requirements for gas-fired units and oil-fired units that are using pre-approved monitoring exceptions to the use of CEMS.  Industry groups have also worked together with EPA to revise the recordkeeping and reporting requirements in revisions to Part 75 in 1995 and 1996.  Comments and suggestions from working groups, comprised of UARG, Class of 85 Regulatory Response Group, and the PJM Powerpool also were incorporated in designing the annual compliance forms.       For the current revisions to Part 75, EPA has solicited and obtained input from a number of affected utilities and other interested parties.  The Agency convened an informal workgroup to provide ideas on the revisions during the development stage, released a pre-proposal draft of the revisions and received numerous written comments on that draft.  The Agency also gathered cost information directly from vendors, testing companies, affected utilities and other sources (see Docket A-97-35, Item IV-A-5).  In addition, the Agency received formal comments on the revisions following the publication of the proposed version of revisions in the Federal Register on May 21, 1998 (63 FR 28032).  Most of the rule revisions (and accompanying revisions to the reporting formats) are a result of input from these interested parties.          3.3 Effects of Less Frequent Collection       Collection of allowance transfer information for each transfer of allowances is necessary to effectively implement a system for issuing, recording, and tracking allowances, which is required by statute.        Conservation and Renewable Energy Reserve     Collection of applications for allowances from the Conservation and Renewable Energy Reserve for emissions avoided through the use of conservation measures or renewable energy is required by statute and is vital to (1) determine qualification for these allowances, and (2) establish the sequence for allocating allowances on a first-come, first-served basis.      Permits     The requirement for the designated representatives of owners and operators of affected sources to submit permit applications, including proposed compliance plans, every five years is a statutory requirement.  The periodic compliance reports or notifications required for specific compliance options are essential to (1) enhance enforcement of emissions limitations requirements, and (2) ensure that utilities receiving bonus allowances and extensions comply with the conditions upon which they were granted the allowances.        Emissions Monitoring      Submission of monitoring plans once and submission of the results of any required monitoring to EPA no less often than every six months are required by statute.  More frequent collections of emissions data (i.e., quarterly), however, allows the opportunity to check data for errors and provide rapid feedback on needed adjustments to data collection systems, and thereby promotes accurate and reliable emissions data.  For this same reason, existing federal and state emission monitoring programs often require quarterly reporting, or in some cases, monthly.  Less frequent collection, such as semi-annually or annually, would increase the amount of preparation and review time at the end of the year both for regulated sources and for EPA.  This would slow down the process of true up and end of year verification of compliance.       Records of monitoring information are to be kept at the source for 3 years after the date of creation of the record.  In certain circumstances, fuel flowmeter calibration and Appendix E testing records may have to be kept for up to five years if the owner or operator takes advantage of rule provisions that allow up to five years between tests.  These 5 year recordkeeping requirements only apply if the owner or operator voluntarily elects either of these options as a cost-effective approach for the owner or operator's specific circumstances.      Allowance Allocation & Small Diesel Refiners     Collections under Section 410(h) are necessary for the integrity of the allowance allocation program.  Information collection for the allowance allocations for small diesel refineries must be yearly, through April 2000, to correspond to the congressionally-mandated annual allowance allocations.        Opt-in     Collection of permit applications for the opt-in program occurs only once every five years, thus minimizing the respondent burden.  This collection is necessary for the operation of the program; without it, EPA would not know which sources wanted to opt in, nor their baseline utilization, nor the lower of their 1985 actual or allowable emission rate.  Collection of withdrawal notifications also occurs once; this is also a necessary collection.      Annual Compliance Certification     The Statute indicates that compliance is to be determined annually by comparing the allowances held by the unit to the unit's total annual emissions.      NO x  Permitting     The Agency is required by statute to include NO x  compliance plans as part of the Acid Rain permits.  NO x  compliance plans are not required during the period of this ICR, but some averaging plan revisions are expected.  Permits incorporating approval of compliance plans will be valid for a period  of five years.          3.4 General Guidelines       Section 403(d) of Title IV requires that EPA establish a system for issuing, recording, and tracking allowances.  To track allowances accurately and to help ensure the orderly and competitive functioning of the allowance system, it is essential that participants be able to report information on allowance transfers as they occur.       The general requirement that permit applicants submit information on standard forms is established by Section 502(b) of Title V.  The five-year life of an acid rain permit is established by Section 408(a) of Title IV. This information collection does not violate the guidelines set forth by OMB.   In some cases, records of Part 75, Appendix E test results or fuel flowmeter calibration test results may need to be retained for up to five years, but only if the owner or operator chooses to take advantage of the ability to extend the period between tests up to five years.  In all other circumstances, Part 75 monitoring records must be kept for only three years.             3.5  Confidentiality and Sensitive Questions       Information collected through this activity is not confidential or of a sensitive nature.      4.       THE RESPONDENTS AND THE INFORMATION REQUESTED       This section lists the major categories of businesses that participate in the Acid Rain Program, the data items requested from program participants, and the activities in which the participants must engage to assemble or submit the required data items.        4.1 Respondents/SIC Codes       Title IV applies to ""utility units,"" which are defined to include units that serve a generator producing electricity for sale or that did so in 1985.  Entities owning ""utility units"" that are likely to participate in allowance transactions are electric service providers (SIC code 4911) and selected firms in the non-utility generation industry, such as coal mining service companies (SIC code 1241). Participants in transactions and the annual auctions include security and commodity brokers and dealers (SIC code 62), management and business consulting service organizations (SIC codes 8742 and 8748, respectively), non-profit organizations and natural gas companies (SIC code 1311).  Affected units under Title IV, particularly units affected under Phase II, are the likely applicants for allowances from the Conservation and Renewable Energy Reserve.  Section 405(i)(2) applies to a limited group of ""utility units.""  Entities owning ""utility units"" that will likely submit information under this section are electric service providers, SIC code 4911.      Small Diesel Refiners     Section 410(h) is limited to small diesel refiners who meet the eligibility requirements set out clearly in the Act.  (SIC code 2911)      Emissions Monitoring     Utility units affected under Phase II are required to submit emissions monitoring data under this ICR; the initial list of units affected under Phase II was promulgated on March 23, 1993.  Some additional new units will be affected under the Acid Rain Program and must meet emissions monitoring requirements.      Opt-in     Potential participants in the opt-in program are facilities that emit SO2 but are not designated affected units under Title IV.  Such facilities include utility units that serve an electric generator of less than 25 MW that produces electricity for sale or that did so in 1985.  Entities owning utility units under 25 MW that may participate in the opt-in program are electric service providers (SIC code 4911).  Other potential participants are industrial boilers that are represented in a wide range of SIC categories.           4.2 Information Requested       This section lists the data items requested from affected sources for the collections described in this ICR.  This section also defines the activities in which respondents must engage to assemble, submit, or store these data items.        4.2.1      Data items, Including Recordkeeping Requirements      Allowance Transfers     All participants to allowance transfers will be required to complete and submit an allowance transfer form or provide the following information for each allowance transfer:         Allowance tracking system account number;      Name, phone number, and facsimile number of the authorized account representative, along with the representative's signature and date of submission; and      Serial numbers of allowances to be transferred.      Certificate of Representation     Existing Phase I and Phase II affected sources have been assigned an allowance tracking system number and have appointed a designated representative by submitting a certificate of representation.  New units that are affected must submit the certificate of representation before commencing commercial operation, and will then be assigned an allowance tracking system number.  The data items requested for the certificate of representation are as follows:        Source identification;      Name, address, telephone and facsimile number of the designated representative;      Name, address, telephone and facsimile number of the alternate designated representative;      List of ""owners and operators"" of the source and each unit at the source;       Certification statement;      Signature of designated representative;      Signature of alternate designated representative; and      Date signed.      Notification for Distribution of Proceeds from EPA Auctions     EPA will send one check for each plant represented for the proceeds from the auctions and sales of allowances.  The following information is required for this notification for distribution of proceeds:             Authorized Account Representative (AAR) Identification;        Name of the company the check should be endorsed to;      The company's tax payer identification number;      Plant name and plant code; and             Signature of AAR.      General Account Holders (Allowance Market Participants)     Entities that are not affected sources (such as individuals holding allowances) are required to submit a completed account information application or provide the following information to obtain an allowance tracking system account number, prior to or simultaneous with the first transfer:        Organization or company name (if applicable);       Name, mailing address, phone number, and facsimile number of the authorized account representative;      Name of the alternate authorized account representative (optional);         A list of all persons subject to a binding agreement for the authorized account representative to represent their ownership interest with respect to the allowances held in the account; and      Certification statement and the signatures and date for the authorized account representative, and alternate authorized account representative, if any.      Conservation and Renewable Energy Reserve     In order to receive allowances from the Conservation and Renewable Energy Reserve for emissions avoided, each electric utility must submit an application to EPA.  The application requires the following items:         Name and phone number of the person(s) who completed the application; and name and phone number of contact person.      Demonstration of qualification to receive allowances for emissions avoided;      A list of the qualified energy conservation measures implemented and the qualified renewable energy sources used for purposes of avoiding emissions during the previous calendar year;      Verification of (1) installation of energy conservation measures and the energy savings attained, and (2) plant operation using renewable energy and the energy      generation attributable to renewable energy input;      For utilities using the EPA Conservation Verification Protocol, the information and methodologies used in determining energy savings, including a description of the conservation measures, the dates of claimed savings, the number of installations, the calculations used to determine energy savings, aggregate statistical information needed to calculate confidence levels, and a description of any comparison groups;      Calculations of the number of tons of emissions avoided by implementing conservation measures or using renewable energy; and      Identification of allowance tracking account(s) to which the Reserve allowances are to be allocated.      Permits     To initially obtain a Phase I acid rain permit, applicants for permits were required in the original ICR to submit a certificate of representation and an acid rain permit application for each affected source.          If the designated representative of a unit expects to comply with the applicable emissions limitations by holding the requisite number of allowances and expects to meet the applicable NO x  emissions limitations, no further application information will be required for Phase I.  If the designated representative of a unit elects to use one or more compliance options, specific information to support the use of the proposed options may be required.  These options and the information requirements for each are as follows:      Substitution Plan 72.41        Identification of Table 1 Units      Identification of Substitution Units      (a)  Baseline from NADB version 2.1      (b)  Lesser of actual or allowable 1985 emissions rate per NADB version 2.1      (c)  Product of (a) * (b) / 2000.      Sum of (c) for all substitution units (equals all allowances available annually under Substitution plan) (optional)      Statement that allowances will be allocated annually only to each substitution unit       or      List showing distribution of allowances among Appendix A and substitution units      First and last calendar years for plan       Special provisions       Standard certification       Name and signature of each designated representative        Reduced Utilization Plan 72.43        Unit Identification      Methods to be employed to account for planned reduction in utilization      Designation/identification of compensating units and sulfur-free generators (if any)      For compensating units, allowance calculation      For units not in the utility system, documentation of system directives or contractual agreements to provide power      First and last calendar years of compliance plan (if known)      Special provisions       Standard certification      New Unit Exemption 72.7      Operators of new units that serve generators with a nameplate capacity of 25 MW or less and use fuel with a sulfur content by weight of less than 0.5 percent may obtain an exemption from monitoring, permitting, and allowance requirements if they submit a certification with the following information:        Unit Identification         Nameplate capacity of the generators served by the unit      The fuels currently burned and their sulfur content by weight        Certification that the owners and operators will comply with all necessary requirements      Standard certification at 72.21(d)(2)      Retired Unit Exemption     Operators of affected units that are retired prior to the issuance (including renewal) of a Phase II Acid Rain Permit for that unit may obtain an exemption from monitoring if they submit a certification with the following information:          Unit identification     Certification that the unit is permanently retired and will comply with all necessary requirements     Standard certification at 72.21(d)(2)       Industrial Unit Exemption          Unit identification     Statement that the unit is not a cogeneration unit     List of the current owners and operators of the unit and a statement that the owners and operators principle business is not the sale of electricity     Summary of the terms of the interconnection agreement     A copy of the interconnection agreement     Nameplate capacity of each generator served by the unit     Starting in 1985, actual annual electrical output of each generator, total electricity produced for sale, and total electricity produced and sold under the interconnection agreement     Certification statements        All data items requested from permit applicants must be submitted on standard forms. Most of the information requested in the forms is specifically required by law.      Emissions Monitoring        Emissions monitoring requirements specify that affected sources must (1) submit a monitoring plan for each affected unit at a source, (2) submit data for certification of each monitor, and (3) record hourly operational, pollutant monitor, and flow monitor data for each affected unit and submit quarterly reports of their emissions data to EPA.  Appendices A and B to this ICR contain a list of the data items required by the recordkeeping and reporting provisions of Part 75.       Respondents are required by 40 CFR 75.64 to submit the quarterly emissions data electronically, by direct electronic submission to EPA, and must also include a certification statement by the designated representative of the unit.  All records are to be kept for three years, with two possible exceptions under voluntary options that are discussed in section 3(c) of this ICR.       The Part 75 revisions add or revise a number of recordkeeping and reporting terms.  Many of these are necessary to demonstrate that the unit qualifies for particular exceptions or exemptions that are allowed under the revisions.  Items have been added to support reporting of:  data to qualify units as low mass emitters; data to qualify units as peaking units or gas-fired units; data to qualify units for Appendix I procedures; data to qualify a unit for off-line calibration; and data to qualify units for quality assurance test extensions and exemptions.  Requirements have also been added to support data reporting for units with multiple range analyzers, additional operating load data, reporting of recertification or other events, flow/load checks, moisture data, and fuel flow/load checks.  Provisions have also been included for optional electronic reporting of the designated representative information, certification, and signature.      Auctions     For auctions, participants are required to submit a bid form and payment method at least six days prior to the date of the auction. Sealed bids will be submitted on a standard bid form developed by EPA.  Each bid will provide the following basic information:             Name        Account number (or new account information)        Allowance quantity and price, and        Type of auction       The bid will also specify an acceptable method of payment for the total bid price regardless of the type of auction (spot or advance).  Full payment for allowances -- in an acceptable form -- will be required with the bid at the time of submission.       Allowance Allocations for Small Diesel Refiners     EPA requires that the refinery's annual request for allowances include the following information:             Certification that all motor fuel produced by the refinery for which allowances are claimed shall have met the requirements of subsection 211(i) of the Clean Air Act and EPA implementing regulations;                  For calendar years 1994 through 1999, inclusive, photocopies of Form 810 for each month in the respective calendar year.        All operating and idle petroleum refineries and blending plants in the 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, and other U.S. possessions are required to file EIA (Energy Information Administration) Form 810 on a monthly basis to the Department of Energy.  Although the forms collect data on all of the operations of the refinery, there are specific data requirements that identify the throughput of crude oil and existing and planned data requirements dealing with distillate (diesel fuel) throughput and desulfurization.  These are the pieces of data that Congress intended for EPA to use to evaluate refineries for program eligibility and allowance allocations.       In addition, each refinery which is eligible for these allowances and chooses to receive the allowances must submit a one time Allowance Account Information Form.  This form allows the refinery to be entered into EPA's Allowance Tracking System which will be accessible by the refinery for trading allowances. The requirements for establishing a general account are covered under the Allowance Transfers section of this ICR and in 40 CFR Part 73 Subpart C of the acid rain regulations.      Opt-in     To obtain an opt-in permit, applicants are required to submit a certificate of representation and an opt-in permit application for each source.  For all respondents, the application must provide (1) general information on the source, (2) specific data about the source's fuel consumption and operating data for 1985, 1986, and 1987, and (3) data on the source's actual and allowable emission rates for 1985, as well as the current allowable emission rate.  For permit applicants who plan to opt in  and shut down , the compliance plan is based on a statement describing the source's plans for shutting down and replacing thermal energy.       The general information required of all opt-in sources include the following items, as listed in Section 74.16 or another section as listed below:             Source name and location;        Name, address, telephone and facsimilie number of the designated representative;        Name, address, telephone and facsimilie number of the alternate designated representative;        Statement of certification;        Complete record of fuel consumption and operating data for calendar years 1985, 1986, 1987, or other acceptable baseline;        Actual and allowable emission rates for 1985, or if source was not operating in 1985, for a calendar year to be determined by the Administrator, as well as the current allowable emission rate;        Statement provisions as indicated at 72.9; and        Signature of designated representative and date of signature.       In addition, sources that opt in and continue to operate must meet the emission monitoring requirements that were listed above.       As part of the annual compliance certification report required in Section 74.43 for opt-in units, respondents must report utilization information, and replacement of thermal energy and resulting transfer of allowances.  The following information must be reported, as required in Sections 74.44 and 74.47:          Source name and location;        Name, mailing address, telephone and facsimilie number of source representative;        Benchmark utilization, annual utilization, average utilization, end-of-year determination of reduced utilization, and the calculation of allowances deducted for reduced utilization (if any);        Amount of thermal energy replaced (if the source has shut down or if the utlization rate has fallen due to replacement of thermal energy by another source), and the name and location of the source or sources providing replacement thermal energy;        A calculation of the number of allowances transferred to each source providing replacement thermal energy;        Allowance tracking system account number of the replacement units; and        Dated signatures for all designated representatives.       All respondents who choose to withdraw from the program will be required to notify the Agency of their decision and provide the following information, as required in Section 74.18:          Source account number;        Name, address, telephone and facsimilie number of the designated representative; and        A certification that emissions requirements will be met through Dec. 31 of the current year, and that all remaining allowances will be surrendered at that time.      Annual Compliance Certifcation     As part of the annual compliance certification report required in Section 72.90, the designated representative for a Phase I affected source must provide the following information by March 1, 1999 and March 1, 2000:         Source name, State, and ORIS Code;              Allowance Tracking System account number and general compliance information;         Dispatch System name;             Baseline utilization, annual utilization, and annual generation;          the calculation of allowances deducted for underutilization (if any); and             Dated signatures for the designated representatives.       The designated representative may also need to provide the following information under section 72.92:         Dispatch system baseline and adjusted utilization;           Dispatch system sales (baseline and current year);           Fraction of generation within dispatch system and dispatch system emissions rate;           Fraction of generation from NUGs and NUG emissions rate; and           Dated signatures for all designated representatives.       and the following information under section 72.91(a)(5):         Sulfur-free generator name;           Baseline and calendar year generation;           List of units claiming sulfur-free generation;           Generation available for shifting; and           Dated signatures for all designated representatives.        In addition, if the designated representative chooses to identify the specific serialized allowances to be deducted from the unit's ATS account, then the following information is required:         Allowance Tracking System account number;           Type of deduction;           Serial numbers of the allowance blocks to be deducted; and           Dated signature of the designated representative.            Finally, if a unit is claiming that a reduction in utilization is due to savings from energy conservation or improved unit efficiency measures, then section 72.91(b) requires the designated representative to submit a confirmation report to verify the savings.  The confirmation report requires the following information:         Source name, State, ORIS Code and Boiler number;              Allowance Tracking System account number and dispatch system name;         Verified savings from energy conservation or improved unit efficiency measures;           Estimated savings from energy conservation or improved unit efficiency measures;           Either a certification of the verified savings by the State utility regulatory authority, or other documentation (may be EPA's Conservation Verification Protocol) that verifies the savings;           A calculation of the number of allowances to be credited or deducted; and           Dated signature of the designated representative.        The annual compliance certification report required in Section 72.90, for a Phase II affected source must provide the following information by March 1, 2001 and each year thereafter:            Source name, State, and ORIS Code;         Allowance Tracking System account number and general compliance information;           Dated signatures for the designated representatives.       In addition, if the designated representative chooses to identify the specific serialized allowances to be deducted from the unit's ATS account, then the following information is required:         Allowance Tracking System account number;           Serial numbers of the allowance blocks to be deducted; and           Dated signature of the designated representative.           NO x  Permitting     Regardless of the compliance option selected, the following elements must be included in the compliance plan for each source:        Identification of the source;      Identification of each affected unit at the source that is subject to these regulations;      Identification of the boiler type of each unit; and      Identification of the compliance option proposed for each unit.       For the standard emission limits, the designated representative must simply check a box on the form indicating the appropriate limit.       For an emissions averaging plan, the following information must be submitted:        Identification of each unit in the plan;      Each unit's applicable emission limitation;      The alternative contemporaneous applicable emission limitation for each unit (in lb/mmBtu);      The annual heat input limit for each unit (in lb/mmBtu);      The calculation for the equation outlined in Step 2 of the EPA form for emissions averaging; and      The effective date of the plan.       For an AEL, the designated representative must submit the following information:        AEL Demonstration Period       For an AEL, the designated representative must first submit an application for an AEL demonstration period.  The application must contain the following information in accordance with 40 CFR 76.10(d):        Identification of the unit;      The type of control technology installed.  If low NO x  burner technology incorporating advanced and/or separated overfire air is technically infeasible, a justification including a technical analysis and evaluative report from the vendor of the system or from an independent architectural and engineering firm explaining why;      Documentation that the installed NO x  emission control system has been designed to meet the applicable emission limitation and that the system has been properly installed;      The date the specific unit commenced operation following the installation of the NO x  control equipment, or the date the specific unit became subject to the emission limitations (whichever is later);      The dates of the operating period (minimum of 3 continuous months);      Certification by the designated representative that the unit and the NO x  control equipment were operated during the operating period in accordance with specifications and procedures designed to achieve the applicable emission limitation, with the operating conditions upon which the design of the NO x  control equipment was based, and with vendor specifications and procedures;      A brief statement describing the reason or reasons an AEL demonstration period is required for the specific unit;      For the control technology, load range, O 2  range, coal volatile matter range, and percentage of combustion air introduced through overfire air ports;      Description of planned modifications;      List of parametric tests to be conducted in accordance with 40 CFR 76.15;      Identification of the continuous emission monitoring data submitted pursuant to 40 CFR Part 75 that is to be used in assessing this application;      An interim AEL, in lb/mmBtu; and      The proposed dates of the demonstration period.        Final AEL       After the demonstration period, the owner or operator may petition the permitting authority for a final AEL.  The petition must include the following information in accordance with 40 CFR 76.10(e):        Identification of the unit;      Certification that the affected unit and the NO x  control equipment have been properly operated during the demonstration period;      Certification that the affected unit has installed all emission control equipment, made any operational modifications, and completed any upgrades and/or maintenance to equipment specified in the demonstration period plan;      A clear description of each step or modification taken during the demonstration period;      Engineering design calculations and drawings that show the technical specifications for installation of any additional operational or emission control modifications installed during the demonstration period;      Identification of the continuous monitoring data submitted pursuant to 40 CFR Part 75 that is to be used in assessing this application;      A report, based on the parametric testing, that describes the reasons for the failure of the installed NO x  control equipment to meet the applicable emission limitation;      The minimum NO x  emission rate, in lb/mmBtu, that the affected unit is able to achieve on an annual average basis;      All supporting data and calculations documenting the determination of the proposed AEL; and      For affected units that have installed an alternative technology, demonstration that the annual average reduction of NO x  emissions is greater than 65 percent.           Recordkeeping     All records are to be kept for three years, except for permitting records which are to be kept for the duration of the permit, or up to five years and certain new monitoring provisions.          4.2.2 Respondent activities      Allowance Transfers     Participants in the allowance transfer system that are not affected units are required to perform two tasks:  (1) negotiate an agreement to designate an authorized account representative and file an account information application to open an Allowance Tracking System general account; and (2) complete and submit allowance transfers.  Designating an authorized account representative and filing an account information application is required one time only, prior to or concurrent with conducting the first transfer of allowances.  For each transfer of allowances, participants are required to complete and submit an allowance transfer form or otherwise provide the required information.  Phase I or Phase II units that were required to submit a certification of representation under the initial ICR, must continue to prepare and submit allowance transfer information for each allowance transfer.       General account holders and affected units may change the authorized account representatives by submitting a subsequent allowance account information form or certificate of representation form respectively.      Conservation and Renewable Energy Reserve     The tasks that must be performed by utilities applying for allowances from the Conservation and Renewable Energy Reserve are (1) designate the qualified energy conservation measures implemented and the qualified renewable energy sources used to avoid emissions, (2) verify installation of energy conservation measures or the plant operation using renewable energy, and the resulting benefits, (3) calculate the tons of emissions avoided, and (4) demonstrate qualification to receive allowances for emissions avoided.  Generally, because utilities already perform these tasks to satisfy state requirements, utilities do not need to duplicate these efforts to apply for allowances from the Reserve.  Rather, utilities primarily assemble the information resulting from these activities in an application and submit this application to EPA.      Obtaining a Permit     The primary tasks to obtain a permit are listed below.  These tasks will be performed only by new units during the period covered by this ICR. In general, sources with existing units, must reapply at least 6 months prior to the expiration of an existing permit.  Since most permits will begin expiring late in 2002, the reapplications to the permitting authority will be covered by the next ICR renewal.          Designate a representative of the owners and operators of a source .  Read the designated representative certification procedures.  Negotiate an agreement to designate a representative for each unit at a source.  Complete and submit the certification.  This task is only relevant for a new Phase II source or if a source changes the designated representative.       Prepare the permit application .  Read the permit application instructions, then collect relevant information for the permit application. Complete the Phase II acid rain permit application. Where appropriate, provide specific information to support the use of compliance options for NO x .  Review the information for accuracy and appropriateness and report the information to the permitting authority.      Emissions Monitoring      The primary tasks that are performed by respondents to meet the emissions monitoring requirements are (1) completing and submitting appropriate monitoring plan forms for each affected source and each affected unit at a source; (2) conducting tests to certify the operation of monitors, and submitting test results to EPA; (3) recording hourly emissions data (this activity generally is performed electronically); (4) operation and maintenance activities associated with the monitoring, including quality assurance activities; (5) assuring data quality, preparing quarterly reports of emissions data and submitting these reports to EPA; and (6) responding to error messages generated by EPA.  In addition, respondents must purchase the necessary monitoring hardware (or pay for fuel sampling and analysis in some cases) and purchase the electronic data reporting software (or software upgrades).         Small Diesel Refiners     Small diesel refineries will need to read the preamble and final rule to learn the procedures for qualifying for allowance allocations.  If facility management wishes to participate, a responsible official will need to gather Forms EIA-810 for each month of the previous year and prepare a transmittal letter.      Opt-in     In order to provide the information discussed in the previous section, participants must complete three tasks to participate in the opt-in program: (1) submit a permit application, (2) meet monitoring requirements, and (3) submit annual compliance reports.  Respondents who choose to withdraw will be required to submit a withdrawal notification.       The primary tasks that must be completed to obtain a permit and the activities associated with them are listed below.  These tasks will be performed only once during the period covered by this ICR.             Designate a representative of the owners and operators of a source.  Read the designated representative certification procedures.  Negotiate an agreement to designate a representative for each source.  Complete and submit the certification.        Prepare the permit application.  Read the permit application instructions, then collect relevant information for the permit application.  Complete written forms, including an application for an opt-in permit.  Review the information for accuracy and appropriateness.  Submit the information to EPA, sending copies to the appropriate EPA regional office.        Respondents who opt in and  continue to operate  must also perform the task required under the emissions monitoring section above.  Respondents who opt in  and shut down  do not need to perform any tasks related to monitoring.       To withdraw from the program, respondents must notify EPA of their decision to withdraw.  Notification entails providing EPA with the data items presented in Section 3.2.1..       Opt-in sources covered by a thermal energy plan, must also report information concerning the replacement of thermal energy, including the identification of the source or sources providing replacement thermal energy, and the allowances transferred as a result of the replacement of thermal energy.      Annual Compliance Certification     The respondents will need to read the instructions, collect the relevant information and fill out the appropriate forms.  The tasks associated with compliance reporting in Phase I are (1) certifying compliance by submitting an Annual Compliance Certification Report for the source, (2) reporting utilization information for the past year by submitting a Utilization Accounting form for each Phase I affected unit, (3) supplying dispatch system information, if any Phase I unit in the dispatch system is underutilized, using the Dispatch System Data Report, (4) for reduced utilization plans, providing sulfur-free generator apportionment information, (5) if the designated representative chooses, identifying the serial numbers of allowances to be deducted using the Allowance Deduction Form, and (6) if claiming energy conservation or improved unit efficiency savings, supplying verified data using the Energy Conservation and Improved Unit Efficiency Confirmation Report by July 1.          In addition, any substitution or compensating unit in a State where a state-enforced emission cap applies, the source must submit additional ""State Cap"" information.          Submitting annual compliance certifications is required for all Phase I affected units by March 1, 1999 and March 1, 2000.       The tasks associated with compliance reporting in Phase II are (1) certifying compliance by submitting an Annual Compliance Certification Report for the source, and (2) if the designated representative chooses, identifying the serial numbers of allowances to be deducted using the Allowance Deduction Form      NO x  Permitting     The primary tasks for a NO x  compliance plan are listed below.         Prepare the NO x  compliance plan application .  Read the application instructions, then collect relevant information.  Analyze compliance options and plan compliance.  Complete written forms.  Review the information for accuracy and appropriateness and report the information to the permitting authority. Preparing a NO x  compliance plan application may include interpreting the rule, collecting information and completing and submitting a NO x  extension plan, a NO x  averaging plan, or an AEL petition.       During the period covered by this ICR, tasks for permitting will be performed only by sources choosing to revise NO x  averaging plans in accordance with Section 408.          5. THE INFORMATION COLLECTED -- AGENCY ACTIVITIES, COLLECTION METHODOLOGY, AND INFORMATION MANAGEMENT          The first part of this section describes Agency (EPA) activities related to the acquisition, analysis, storage, and distribution of the information collected from (1) participants in allowance transfers, (2) applicants for allowances from the Conservation and Renewable Energy Reserve, (3) permit applicants, (4) designated representatives of affected sources that are required to submit monitoring plans and emissions data, (5) participants in the annual auction, and (6) participants associated with allocation of allowances to small diesel refineries, (7) the opt-in program, (8) annual compliance certification, and (9) NO x  permitting.  The second part describes the information management techniques employed to increase the efficiency of collections.  The third part discusses the burden or benefits of the collection activities described in this ICR to small entities.  The last part outlines the schedule for collecting information.        5.1 Agency Activities      Allowance Transfers     Collections associated with operating the allowance transfer system requires EPA to (1) track allowance holders and maintain allowance accounts, (2) review allowance transfer information for completeness and ensure that all requirements are met, (3) record allowance transfers, and (4) notify both participants in a transfer whether the transfer was recorded.  EPA has developed a computer system called the Allowance Tracking System (ATS) to track allowances and maintain information on accounts.      Conservation and Renewable Energy Reserve     Activities that must be performed by EPA to distribute  allowances from the Conservation and Renewable Energy Reserve include (1) registering applications and reviewing applications for completeness, (2) performing substantive reviews of applications to determine whether all necessary criteria to receive allowances have been met, (3) transferring allowances from the Reserve or notifying applicants of their failure to qualify for allowances from the Reserve, and (4) for utilities using the EPA Conservation Verification Protocol, verifying the quantified energy savings from conservation measures.       Permits     EPA staff administering the permit program perform the following task:         Review certificates of representation, enter the information in the Allowance Tracking System, and notify the representative .       Permitting authority staff, generally at the state or local level, perform the following tasks:         Review permit applications and issue permits .  Receive and review permit applications and record submissions.  Provide notice to applicants whether permit applications are complete.  Reformat collected data items to constitute proposed and final permits.  Provide opportunities for public comment and participation.      Emissions Monitoring        The major EPA activities related to emissions monitoring and reporting include (1) reviewing monitoring plans and certification applications, and (2) processing, reviewing and evaluating reports of quarterly emissions data from affected units.  EPA has developed a computer system called the Emissions Tracking System (ETS) to track and maintain this information.  EPA also answers respondent questions and conducts audits of data submissions.  To enable sources to perform self-audits of submissions, EPA also has recently developed the Monitoring Data Checking (MDC) software for use by affected sources.  This software should enable sources to run automated quality checks of reports prior to submittal to EPA and reduce the burden of having to respond to EPA generated error messages.       Auctions     The statute allows EPA to delegate or contract out the function of administering auctions.  The EPA has entered into an agreement with the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) whereby the CBOT shall administer the auctions. CBOT will not charge fees for their services, bid for allowances in the auctions, or transfer allowances in the EPA Allowance Tracking System.  EPA is allowing, however, clearing members of the Board of Trade Clearing Corporation (BOTCC) to bid on their own behalf or their customers' without having to submit an EPA letter of Credit Form or certified check.  Payment is being guaranteed through the BOTCC, which provides trade clearance and settlement services for CBOT.  BOTCC members may charge bidders a fee for bidding on their behalf.        CBOT staff administering the auctions (auction agents) need to review procedures and prepare to conduct the auctions on an annual basis.  The CBOT receives the sealed bids and payments, enters the information provided on bid forms into a computer system, and deposits the checks into a designated bank account.  (Collectively, these activities comprise handling of bids and checks.) After bids are recorded, CBOT ranks the bids using a computer program and allocates the allowances.  CBOT announces the results in a press conference/release. Finally, after payment is verified, EPA records the transfer of allowances and transfers the proceeds from the auction to the owners and operators from whom the allowances were withheld.  EPA has developed a computer system to track the payment of proceeds.      Opt-in     EPA staff administering the opt-in permit program perform the following tasks for each opt-in applicant:          Review certification of representation, record information, and notify representative .        Review permit application .  Receive and review permit application and record submission. Provide notice to applicant as to whether permit application is complete.  Reformat collected data items to constitute proposed and final permit.        Notify applicant regarding allowances .  Notify the opt-in permit applicant of the number of allowances the applicant would receive each year as an opt-in source.        Issue permit, notify the public and affected states . Upon notification of the applicant's decision to proceed with the permit application, provide opportunities for public comment and participation.       EPA activities related to withdrawals will be to process the withdrawal notification, and ensure that all unused allowances have been surrendered at the end of the calendar year.      Annual Compliance Certification     EPA activities related to compliance reporting are (1) review end-of-year compliance submissions, (2) calculate and deduct the allowances from each affected unit, and (3) send the designated representatives an allowance reconciliation report.       NO x  Permitting     Agency staff perform the following task.         Review NO x  compliance plan applications .  Receive and review applications and record submissions.  Provide notice to applicants whether applications are complete.        5.2 Collection Methodology and Management        To ensure consistency nationwide and to expedite (1) data entry, (2) the allocation of allowances from Reserves, and (3) permit issuance, EPA requires that standard reporting forms or equivalent formats or standard electronic reporting formats be used to submit all information to be collected under this ICR.  The standard forms are included in Appendix C.         Currently, respondents to collections for allowance transfer information may submit the required information on a standard written form, or using an electronic format.    Permit applications and annual compliance certifications are submitted on standard paper forms, as are certifications for new and retired unit exemptions.   Also to ensure consistency and to expedite data entry, EPA requires that standard electronic data reporting (EDR) formats be used to submit information to be collected under Part 75 and, under the rule revisions, EPA also will require that data be sent via direct electronic submission to EPA beginning in the year 2001.  The revised draft EDR formats (version 2.1) that correspond to the revisions to Part 75 are included as Appendix A to this document.        Several computer systems and associated databases have been developed to (1) track allowances, (2) record quarterly emissions monitoring data, (3) track auction proceed payments, and (4) calculate the number of allowances to be deducted each year.  The systems and databases are designed to coordinate the information for easy access and use by the Agency, states, regulated community, and the public.        EPA has established an Acid Rain Home Page on the Internet, which includes detailed information collected from emissions reports, allowance transfer submissions, auctions, and annual compliance information.  Those without access to the Internet may use the Acid Rain Hotline to request information, including the Annual Compliance Reports or other summary reports.          5.3 Small Entity Flexibility       For the purposes of the Acid Rain Program, EPA has adopted the Small Business Administration's definition of a ""small"" electric power utility as one that generates a total of less than 4 billion kilowatt-hours per year.  Generally, although about two-thirds of the affected sources in Phase II generate a total of less than 4 billion kilowatt-hours per year and are required to participate in some collections under this ICR (e.g., submitting information for certification of monitors and submitting quarterly emissions monitoring reports), the costs to these sources for collections under this ICR are small relative to the revenues they generate.       All affected sources under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 are required to submit permit applications and to respond to other collections under this ICR, according to the same parameters (with the exception of operators of new units of 25 MW or less, who may receive an exemption from the Acid Rain Program requirements if they qualify).  Retired units may also be exempted from some reporting requirements.       The use of standardized forms will enable small entities to understand and complete permit application submissions without the level of staffing which would be necessary in the absence of such forms.       The small diesel program is available primarily to small businesses.  To best accommodate the needs of businesses, small and large, EPA has minimized the collection burden by requiring certified reproductions of already existing information.       In the January 11, 1993 final Acid Rain Core Rules, EPA provided for a conditional exemption from the emissions reduction, permitting, and emissions monitoring requirements of the Acid Rain Program for new units having a nameplate capacity of 25 MWe or less that burn fuels with a sulfur content no greater than 0.05 percent by weight, because of the high cost of monitoring emissions from these sources and the  de minimis  nature of their emissions.       The Part 75 rule revisions also create an additional small unit exception.  This exception incorporates optional reduced monitoring, quality assurance, and reporting requirements into Part 75 for units that combust natural gas and/or fuel oil and that emit no more than 25 tons of SO 2  and no more than 50 tons of NO x  annually and that calculate no more than 25 tons of SO 2  and no more than 50 tons of NO x  annually based on required procedures for calculating and reporting emissions.  Qualifying utilities will no longer be required to keep monitoring equipment installed on (or conduct sulfur-in-fuel sampling for) low mass emissions units, nor will they be required to perform quality assurance or quality control tests.  Moreover, emissions reporting requirements will be significantly simplified for these units.       Even if a gas- or oil-fired unit does not qualify for this ""low mass emissions unit"" exception, the revisions also significantly reduce the costs and burdens associated with fuel sampling and QA activities for these units.  As discussed in the Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) of the final Acid Rain Implementation Regulations (October 19, 1992), smaller utilities are more likely to be dependent on these oil- and gas-fired units, especially very small utilities (see p. 5-14 of that RIA document).       Further reductions in requirements aimed specifically for small entities are limited because of the statutory requirements that all affected units use CEMS (or an equivalent method) to record and report emissions data for Title IV purposes.        5.4 Collection Schedule      Allowance Transactions     There is no specific collection schedule associated with allowance transactions.      Conservation and Renewable Energy Reserve     Submitting applications for allowances from the Conservation and Renewable Energy Reserve is voluntary.  Allowances from the Reserve will be allocated on a first-come, first-served basis during the period from January 1, 1992 to December 31, 2000.      Permits     Each Phase I acid rain permit is effective from January 1, 1995, until December 31, 1999.  Revisions to the permit may be submitted at any time. Phase II permit applications, which were required by January 1, 1996, are covered in the initial ICR.      Emissions Monitoring     Monitoring plans must be submitted only once, although certain elements of the monitoring plan are submitted (and updated as necessary) routinely as part of the EDR format.  The revisions to Part 75 further clarify what monitoring elements need to be submitted in hard copy versus electronic form.       Only new units will have to apply for certification during the 1999-2001 time period.  While some monitors will be required to apply for recertification, there is no set schedule for recertification.       Quarterly reports are due for each quarter during the life of this information collection request.  In addition, EPA has provided for notifications to the Agency for semi-annual or annual quality assurance testing and for situations where a unit will have a revised certification deadline (for example, notifications of unit start-up for new units).  As part of the revisions, EPA will exempt units that have been shutdown from quarterly reporting during the shutdown, even though such units could resume operation after providing notice to EPA.      Auctions     The spot and advance auctions are currently held before March 31 of each year.  The cutoff date for submission of bids is only a few days prior to the auction in order to limit the time EPA holds the bidders' money.      Allowance Allocations & Small Diesel Refiners     For the 410(h) small diesel refiners program, submittals for eligibility can be made at any time.  EPA believes that all eligible small diesel refineries have already submitted the eligibility applications.  Information for the allocation of allowances must be submitted annually.  Submissions are accepted no later than April 1 of the year following the eligible desulfurization.  Allowances for the small diesel refineries program are available from October, 1993 through December, 1999.      Opt-in     Opting in to the allowance program requires just one information collection (although monitoring information for affected sources must be collected quarterly).  Opt-in permit applications may be submitted to EPA and the permitting authority at any time.  Permits must be renewed at that time, and every five years thereafter.  Revisions to the permit may be submitted at any time.      Monitoring plans must be submitted only once, at the time the opt-in permit application is submitted.  The data upon which EPA will base its certification of each emissions monitor may be submitted after the source receives a draft opt-in permit, but must be submitted before the source may be designated an affected source.  (Monitors must be installed, certified by EPA, and operating before the source may be designated an affected source.)  Emissions data to meet reporting requirements are collected quarterly, 30 days after the end of each calendar quarter, beginning at the end of the first quarter in which the source becomes an affected source.      Compliance reports must be sent annually.  Allowance transfer information must be submitted once for each transfer; a certificate of representation needs to be submitted only once, at the same time as the opt-in application.      Withdrawing requires only one information collection.      Annual Compliance Certification     This information is collected annually from March through July for the preceding calendar year.          NO x  Permitting     Revisions to   NO x  averaging palns may be submitted at any time.        6. ESTIMATING THE BURDEN AND COST OF COLLECTIONS       This section estimates the paperwork burden and cost of (1) tracking and transferring allowances, (2) obtaining and distributing allowances from the Conservation and Renewable Energy Reserve, (3) obtaining and issuing permits, (4) submitting monitoring plans, obtaining certification of each monitor, and recording and reporting data from CEM systems, (5) the auction program, (6) allowance allocation to small diesel refineries, (7) the opt-in program, (8) end-of-year compliance activities, and (9) NO x  permitting.         First, assumptions regarding allowance transfers are presented, followed by the annual respondent and Agency burden and cost estimates associated with allowance transfers.  Subsequent sections separately address allowances for energy conservation and renewable energy use, permits, emissions monitoring, auctions, opt-in, and annual compliance.  Finally, aggregate annual burden hour and cost estimates to respondents and to EPA for collections covered by this ICR are presented.      Estimating Labor Costs       To calculate labor costs, EPA used the following amounts: $66.05 per hour for managers, $45.44 per hour for technicians, and $21.20 per hour for clerical workers.  As noted above, these rates were derived by using the rates from the previous ICR and updating them with the Employment Cost Index to June 1998.       The labor cost to the Agency, $42.81 per hour, was also derived by updating the rate from the previous ICR.      6.1 Tracking and Transferring Allowances       Labor burden and costs for collections associated with tracking and transferring allowances are functions of the number of transfers anticipated.  Based on number of transfers recorded by EPA in 1997, EPA is assuming that about 1,500 privately submitted allowance transfers will be made each year, 1999 through 2001.      6.1.1  Estimate of Respondent Burden and Costs for Transfers       Exhibit 1 presents the annual burden and costs to participants in allowance transfers.  Participants that are not affected units are required to negotiate an agreement to designate an authorized account representative and file a new account application; this activity is required only one time, prior to or simultaneous with the participant's first transfer of allowances.  All participants are required to complete and submit allowance transfer information for each transfer of allowances.  EPA estimates about 30 hours to designate an authorized account representative and to open a general account, and about 2 hours to prepare and submit information for an allowance transfer.         Assuming that 1,500 transfers will be made annually, the burden to respondents will be about 4,950 hours annually.   The cost to respondents will be about $260,000 annually.

Allowance Tracking System       The allowance system regulations set the general requirements for the tracking system, which has been developed by EPA. In order to track allowances, the allowance tracking system must include information on (1) allowance allocations for each affected unit, (2) allowance transfers and deductions, and (3) allowance holders.  Also, to allow for the transfer of future year allowances, the allowance tracking system will contain allowance information for thirty years into the future.  EPA has made the information compiled in the allowance tracking system publicly available in several formats on the internet and is continually working to improve electronic access.       EPA incurs annual operation and maintenance (O&M) costs for running an electronic transmission network, system enhancement, general maintenance, and employee salaries.  These O&M costs are estimated at $100,000 to $200,000 per year (or an average of about $150,000 annually).      Allowance Transfer System       Upon receipt of an allowance transfer notification, EPA will (1) review allowance transfer information for completeness and ensure that all requirements have been met, (2) record allowance transfers, and (3) notify both participants to a transfer whether the transfer was recorded.  EPA estimates that it will require an average of one hour to perform these activities for each notification.  Assuming 1,500 transfers will be made each year, the annual burden to EPA will be about 1,500 hours.  The cost to EPA will be about $64,500 annually. Exhibit 2 summarizes the Agency burden and cost estimates for recording and transferring allowances.

EPA is also assuming that only one application for allowances will be submitted by any one utility in a particular year.        6.2.1  Estimate of Respondent Burden and Costs       Exhibit 3 depicts the annual respondent burden and costs associated with obtaining allowances from the Conservation and Renewable Energy Reserve.  Each utility applying for allowances from the Reserve is required to perform the following tasks: (1) designate energy conservation measures implemented and renewable energy sources used to avoid emissions; (2) verify savings from energy conservation measures and/or amount of generation from renewable energy; (3) calculate the tons of emissions avoided; and (4) demonstrate qualification to receive allowances for emissions avoided.  Because most states already collect information on these activities from utilities, the primary burden to utilities will be that associated with assembling and submitting to EPA the application to receive allowances from the Reserve.  Assuming it will take applicants about 46 hours to assemble and submit an application to receive allowances from the Reserve to EPA, and an additional 32 hours if the applicant chooses to assemble and submit the information required in the EPA Conservation Verification Protocol, the total annual burden to respondents will be 952 hours in 1999 and 492 hours in subsequent years.  The total annual cost to utilities applying for allowances from the Conservation and Renewable Energy Reserve will be $45,446 in 1999 and $23,486 in subsequent years.

Tasks performed by EPA related to the distribution of allowances from the Reserve include the following: (1) register applications and review applications for completeness; (2) perform substantive reviews of applications to determine whether all necessary criteria to receive allowances have been met; (3) transfer allowances from the Reserve or notify applicants of their failure to qualify for allowances from the Reserve; and (4) for utilities that choose to use the EPA Conservation Verification Protocol, verify the quantified energy savings from conservation measures.  Assuming it takes EPA about 11 hours to process each application and transfer allowances (or notify applicants), the total annual Agency for distributing allowances from the Reserve is an estimated 125 hours in 1999 and 65 hours each year thereafter.  At a cost of $40 per hour, the total annual cost to EPA will be $5,354 in 1999, and $2,784 in subsequent years.

This analysis estimates the cost and burden only for new sources required to obtain permits for Phase II and for sources changing designated representatives.  The initial submittal of all Phase I and II permit applications for existing sources were covered in the initial information collection request.  Also, because 1999 is the last year of Phase I, EPA assumes that no sources will modify their Phase I permit before it expires on Dec. 31, 1999.       All applicants for permits will be required to submit a general acid rain permit application for each affected source that covers all units at the source.        6.3.1  Estimate of Respondent Burden and Costs for Permiting       Exhibit 5 depicts the burden and costs to respondents for (1) selecting a new designated representative, (2) submitting a Phase II permit application, (3) submitting a retired unit exemption, (4) submitting a new unit exemption, and (5) submitting an industrial unit exemption. Based on the past few years of operation, EPA assumes that each year 60 Certificate of representation forms will be submitted to appoint new designated representatives, 5 new sources will submit Phase II permit applications, 5 units will submit retired unit exemptions, 15 units will submit new unit exemptions, and 5 sources will submit industrial unit exemptions.          The total annual respondent burden is estimated to be 2,435 hours.  The costs associated with the permitting process are estimated at $141,320 annually.                                            6.3.2  Estimate of Agency/Permitting Authority Burden and Costs for Permitting       Exhibit 6 presents the burden and costs to EPA or the permitting authority to review and process permit information.  The primary tasks performed by EPA are reviewing certificates of representation, and reviewing industrial unit exemption submissions.  The primary tasks performed by the permitting authority are reviewing permit applications, notifying the public, and issuing proposed and final permits, and reviewing new and retired unit exemptions.  Reviewing a certificate of representation and determining completeness notice is estimated to require one hour.  Reviewing the permit application, notifying the public, and issuing proposed and final permits is estimated to require 15 hours per occurrence.  The Agency's total annual effort will be about 410 hours.  The total cost to EPA for all permiting activities will be about $17,550.           6.4 Emissions Monitoring Recording and Reporting       This section estimates the paperwork burden and cost of submitting monitoring plans, obtaining certification of each monitoring system, conducting monitor quality assurance activities, and recording and reporting data from CEM systems (or approved alternatives).       The legislative requirements in Title IV require all affected Phase I and Phase II sources to install SO 2  and NO x  CEM systems, opacity monitors (COMS), and flow monitors (or approved alternatives).  Data handling or reporting is required by the law, but not specified.  Under the promulgated regulations, however, EPA imposes data handling, reporting, and recordkeeping requirements.  The EPA requires that all affected units required to install CEM systems use a data acquisition and handling system (DAHS) to record hourly CEM and flow monitor data in the EDR format.  Affected gas- and oil-fired units may elect to use the approved alternative SO 2  monitoring method and record fuel sulfur analysis data, and then use a DAHS to record and report hourly fuel flow values from a fuel flow meter in the EDR format.  In addition, peaking units that burn natural gas and/or fuel oil may use an excepted method for calculating NO x  emission rates.  Under the Part 75 revisions, EPA will allow certain low mass emission units to use assumed emission factors together with operational data to calculate emissions, and will allow certain oil- and gas-fired units to use an optional flow monitoring methodology.       Affected sources are required to complete and submit a monitoring plan and obtain certification of each monitor (on standard forms) for each affected unit at the source.  These plans and certifications, which are only submitted once, have already been submitted for most units.  Sources, however, may need to submit revised plans or even recertify if they change some aspect of their existing plan.  New units will still need to submit plans and certifications for the first time.  In addition, all affected units are required to submit quarterly reports of their emissions data to EPA; these reports include much of the basic monitoring plan data as well.       To develop this renewal ICR, EPA took into account both changes in assumptions about the underlying burdens and costs of Part 75, and the effect of the rule revisions.  The changed assumptions about the baseline burdens and costs reflect EPA's experience in implementing the program as well as information supplied from interested stakeholders.  For the rule revisions, many of the revisions were assumed to be cost neutral.  Most of those changes reflect rule clarifications or minor revisions that were requested by affected utilities.  A few revisions were estimated to increase burdens and/or costs, while several items were estimated to decrease burdens and/or costs.  The items in each of these categories are identified in Table 6-1.      Table 6-1:      Summary of Impacts of Major Rule Revisions          A. Rule Revisions Assumed to Be Cost/Burden Neutral     Clarifications to certification/recertification process      Data validation clarifications      Span/range clarifications      Backup monitoring flexibility changes      Restrictions on number of RATA attempts      Deletion of four month RATA waiting period      Changes to the RATA test procedures      Direct electronic submission of quarterly reports      Appendix H/protocol gas changes      New Appendix I optional flow monitoring method      Gas sampling procedures for Acid Rain units combusting gaseous fuel other than natural gas      Option for electronic signature      Diluent cap provisions      Complex stack provisions      Petition process clarifications      Partial operating hour reporting      QA/QC plan clarifications   B.  Rule Revisions Assumed to Increase Costs/Burdens*      DAHS software changes      Moisture monitoring quality assurance      Flow-to-load test for flow monitors      Flow-to-load test for fuel flowmeters (optional)   C.  Rule Revisions Assumed to Decrease Costs/Burdens      RATA grace periods      RATA flexibility for gas-fired SO 2  CEMS units      Reduced flow monitor RATA requirements      Use of QA operating quarters rather than calendar quarters      Calculation procedures for units with low mass emissions      Reduced Appendix D fuel sampling      Reduced Appendix D flowmeter testing      Elimination of sampling for CO 2  missing data      Deferred unit reporting changes      Elimination of reporting for missing data causes/cures     *In addition to the increase in burden caused directly by the rule, the respondent burden will increase slightly in the first year following the rule revisions due to the additional time necessary to review the rule and debug software.       To assess how the rule revisions affect the respondents' burdens and costs, EPA analyzed existing data reported by the affected units to classify and characterize the affected population.  The result of this analysis characterizes the total number of reporting units into the following model categories (units that will be able to take advantage of the low mass emitter excepted methodology have been subtracted from the numbers below):        Model A (units with SO 2 , flow, NO x , and CO 2  CEMS):  1070 total units.      Model B (units with opacity CEMS as a result of Title IV):  475 total units.      (Note:  these units also are classified under other models for SO 2 , NO x , and CO 2  requirements.)      Model C (oil-fired units with Appendix D for SO 2  and CEMS for NO x /CO 2 ):  39 total units with an estimated 103 fuel flowmeters.      Model D (gas-fired units with Appendix D for SO 2  and CEMS for NO x /CO 2 ):  377 total units with an estimated 1073 fuel flowmeters.      Model E (oil-fired units using both Appendix D and E):  35 total units with an estimated 61 fuel flowmeters.      Model F (gas-fired units using both Appendix D and E):  90 total units with an estimated 216 fuel flowmeters.      Model G (units with moisture monitors necessary for moisture correction):  107 total units.  (Note:  These units are also classified under other models for SO 2 , NO x , and CO 2  requirements.)       These estimates were derived from data reported to EPA by the affected sources.  The analyses of data reported to EPA by the affected sources were also used to develop information on:  units with fewer than 168 operating hours on a quarterly basis; units requiring semi-annual RATAs; average operational hours in which oil is burned; and units combusting gaseous fuel other than natural gas.  All of this information was used to develop estimates of the number of respondents that are expected to be affected by various elements of the rule revisions.       To estimate the burden and/or cost of each incidence of the various rule revisions, EPA had available prior estimates of the costs of various activities, estimates provided by affected utilities in comments to the Agency, cost estimates provided by vendors, testing companies, and utilities, and estimates based on the Agency's experience in implementing the program.  In addition, the hourly labor rates for managerial, technical and clerical staff reflect the labor rates used in the existing ICR but updated to 1998 dollars using the  Employment Cost Index , consistent with Agency ICR guidance.       The following sections 6.4.1, 6.4.2, 6.4.4, and 6.4.5 indicate the respondent burdens and costs of Part 75 implementation.  Section 6.4.3 discusses the Agency burdens and costs.         6.4.1  Estimating Respondent Burden          The primary tasks performed by owners and operators of affected units are (1) reviewing the regulations, forms and instructions, (2) responding to EPA generated error messages, (3) reprogramming a DAHS and debugging the software, (4) completing and submitting monitoring plans for each unit at the source, (5) performing appropriate tests and providing test results to certify each monitor, (6) performing quality assurance testing and maintenance upon monitors, (7) assuring the quality of emissions data, preparing quarterly reports of emissions data, and submitting reports to EPA; and (8) fuel sampling.          (i)  Regulatory Review .  EPA estimates that the time to review instructions and requirements should be 24 manager hours and 24 technician hours per year, per source, in 1999.  This increase reflects the cost of familiarization with the rule revisions and the new EDR version 2.1.  The estimate decreases after the first year to be consistent with the labor estimates used in the previous ICR for years 1997 and 1998 (4 manager hours and 4 technician hours for both 2000 and 2001).        (ii)  Response to Error Messages .  The EPA provides feedback to sources so that suspected errors in submissions by sources are noted and corrected.  With the release of the MDC software, EPA expects the burdens for this activity to decrease over time.  Thus,  for 1999, this ICR uses the same burden estimates as were used for the 1997/1998 period (4 manager hours and 8 technical hours per reporting unit per year), but then decreases those hours to 2 manager and 6 technical hours for the years 2000 and 2001.  In addition, this activity should be inapplicable for the simplified reporting required of low mass emissions units, and, therefore, the total number of respondents for this activity excludes those units.        (iii)  DAHS Upgrade and Debugging .  Each source must purchase (or create) and install computer software designed to implement the electronic data reporting (EDR) formats required under the Acid Rain Program.  Because of the rule revisions, the existing software will have to be upgraded.  The costs of the upgrade are discussed in Section 6.4.2, below.  The Agency estimates that sources will incur 8 manager and 16 technical hours in 1999 to  coordinate the purchase and installation  of the upgraded software.  In addition, consistent with the prior ICR, EPA estimates that each source will have some burdens for debugging the software.  Consistent with the previous ICR, EPA assumes a relatively high burden in the first year of implementing the new, upgraded software followed by only a minor amount of burden in the second and third years (see line 4 of Exhibit 7).  Sources that have only low mass emissions units will not be impacted by these requirements and are excluded from the total number of respondents for these line items in Exhibit 7.        (iv)  Monitoring Plans .  Consistent with the existing ICR, completing and submitting monitoring plans is estimated to require an average of about 20 hours per source initially.  All first-time monitoring plan submissions will be received prior to the time period covered in this revised ICR, except for new units.  Thus, consistent with the existing ICR, EPA is assuming that initial monitoring plans were all prepared prior to the 1999-2001 period.  The burden associated with revising the monitoring plan is included in the time for preparing and submitting each quarterly emissions report.        (v)  Monitor Certification .  In the previous ICR, EPA estimated that performing tests to certify or recertify each monitor and submitting the test results would require hiring a contractor for about 7 days at only a negligible direct labor burden to affected sources.  Based on the information gathered as part of the rule revisions, EPA has modified these assumptions to include labor burdens for this activity and reduce the contractor costs.  Because only recertifications are included in the estimated activities for 1999-2001, the Agency estimates a labor burden of 50 hours and a contractor cost of $3,400 per respondent.  The cost and burden figures exclude the costs and burdens associated with conducting a RATA as part of  the recertification process because those costs are incorporated within the annual QA costs for previously certified monitoring systems.        (vi)  Quality Assurance .  Quality assurance (QA) testing and maintenance upon monitoring systems is the largest burden item under the Acid Rain CEM Program.  Those requirements generally include daily, quarterly and annual QA requirements, depending on the monitoring approach being used.  For reporting units that use a full set of CEMS (SO 2 , flow, NO x  and CO 2 ), the Agency has developed a per unit labor burden based primarily on information gathered from affected sources.  For units that also are required to install and maintain a continuous opacity monitoring system (COMS) as a result of Part 75, additional labor burdens apply.  For units that rely on Appendix D excepted methods for SO 2  but use a NO x  and CO 2  CEMS, reduced labor burden estimates apply because the quality assurance activities for the excepted methods are less than for a CEMS.  The labor burdens for these excepted methods were derived primarily from cost estimates provided by a group of affected utilities (see Docket A-97-35, Item II-D-48).  For units that rely on the excepted methods under both Appendix D and E (i.e., units without CEMS), the burden estimates are reduced further because no CEMS QA is required.  Finally, for the relatively small number of units that require moisture correction, labor burdens for moisture monitoring QA activities have been added based on information supplied by an affected utility (see Docket A-97-35, Item II-D-94).  Using the data discussed above, EPA estimates that the average respondent (using a weighted average for the units that fall under Models A-G) will require approximately 500 labor hours to meet the QA requirements of Part 75.  Consistent with the existing ICR, this labor is expected to be almost entirely technician labor.         (vii)  Quarterly Reports .  Tasks performed by utilities in preparing quarterly reports include: (1) assuring the quality of the data, (2) preparing the quarterly report, (3) revising the monitoring plan, if necessary, (4) preparation of hard copy documentation accompanying the quarterly reports, and managerial review.  The EPA estimates that, taking into account the rule revisions, the requirements to assure data quality, prepare quarterly reports of emissions, revise monitoring plans where appropriate, and submit these reports will require on average about 204 hours per year for each unit (except 16 hours per year for low mass emissions units).       Exhibit 7 summarizes the annual respondent burdens.         6.4.2  Estimating   Respondent Costs        Exhibit 7 summarizes the annual respondent costs.  The following discussion describes how those costs were derived.         (i)  Estimating Labor Costs       In estimation of labor costs, EPA used the following amounts: $66.05 per hour for managers and $45.44 per hour for technicians.  As noted above, these rates were derived by using the rates from the previous ICR and updating them with the Employment Cost Index to June 1998.         (ii)  Estimating Total Capital and Annual Operations and Maintenance Costs       Capital/start-up costs include the cost of installing required CEMS or alternatives.  The Agency has also included a cost for the purchase of monitoring equipment.  These costs were covered in the Regulatory Impact Analysis of the Final Acid Rain Implementation Regulations (October 19, 1992) but were not included in ICRs prior to the effective date of the 1995 revisions to the Paperwork Reduction Act.  The Agency has developed these estimates based on Agency CEM cost models, comments from various affected utilities, and other information gathered during the rulemaking process (see, for example, Docket A-97-35, Item IV-A-5).  The cost estimates vary depending on how many and what type of monitors are required.  A capital cost estimate is included for each of the Models A-G on Exhibit 7.       Operation and maintenance costs (exclusive of labor costs) reflect ongoing costs to a unit and include both contractor costs for the required recertification, diagnostic, and quality assurance (QA) testing, and other direct maintenance-related expenses ( e.g. , spare parts and calibration gases).  These cost estimates have been derived from EPA CEM cost models, existing ICRs, Agency staff experience under the Acid Rain Program, information gathered during development of the Part 75 revisions, and supplemental estimates provided by affected utilities and others related to the various cost items (see, e.g., EPA Air Docket A-97-35, Item II-D-48).  The total cost for these items (other than fuel sampling) is estimated at $30,380 for a unit with a full set of CEMS.  Units using alternate methodologies have reduced costs.  The fuel sampling costs are presented as a separate line item, and are estimated to be $581,100 per year, for all units.  Based on information received from affected utilities, the Agency has included fuel sampling as an O&M cost rather than a source labor burden (see Docket A-97-35, Items IV-A-5 and IV-G-3).         Note that testing contractor costs for certification, recertification and annual RATAs also are presented as other direct costs and are not converted to equivalent source labor hours.  This approach is consistent with the common business practice for obtaining outside contractors to conduct certification/recertification tests and annual relative accuracy test audits.  For initial certification, the certification test costs are commonly bundled with equipment purchase contracts, according to information provided by a range of CEMS equipment vendors.  For RATAs that are conducted either as part of the annual quality assurance requirements or as part of recertification, industry contacts have indicated that RATA testing is usually performed under a fixed price contract basis, except for travel costs that may be billed on an hourly basis beyond the basic contract cost.  For annual RATAs, the sources indicated that an annual contract between a testing company and utility is often used.  One municipal utility representative indicated that the applicable municipal regulations required that outside contracts be on a flat fee, not hourly, basis.         (iii)  Capital/Start-up vs. Operating and Maintenance (O & M) Costs       Capital costs reflect one-time costs for purchase of equipment which will be used over a period of years.  Conversely, operating and maintenance costs are those costs which are incurred on an annual or other scheduled basis.  For instance, costs associated with quality assurance activities, such as spare parts or contractor costs for work, will be incurred on an annual basis.         (iv)  Annualizing Capital Costs       The capital costs of equipment were annualized over a 10-year period, with the average estimated CEM system life based on input from CEM vendors.  Costs were annualized at a discount rate of seven percent.  The annualized cost of the necessary DAHS upgrade purchase associated with the rule revision is $1,658,384 total, per year, for all sources.  The capital costs of purchasing required monitoring equipment were also annualized at a rate of 7%, for a 10 year period.  The annualized cost of CEM systems and fuel flowmeters is estimated to total approximately $90,400,000 per year, for all units.

As in the existing ICR, EPA estimates that an average of 2 hours will be required to perform these tasks for each quarterly data report submitted by an affected source.  Assuming that affected sources will submit 1787 quarterly emissions reports to EPA, the total annual burden incurred by the Agency will be 14,296 hours.  The total annual cost to EPA to process, review, and evaluate 1787 quarterly emissions reports will be $612,012.  Exhibit 8 summarizes the Agency burden and costs associated with emissions reporting.

In addition, EPA estimates that approximately 128 units will recertify per year.  Exhibit 7 shows the total burden and total cost based on this respondent universe.       6.4.5  Bottom Line Burden Hours and Cost Tables        (i)  Respondent Tally       Exhibit 7 summarizes the aggregate burden and cost estimates to respondents from January 1999 through January 2001 for collections associated with implementation of Part 75.        (ii)  The Agency Tally        Exhibit 8 summarizes the aggregate burden and cost estimates to EPA for collection, analysis, and storage of the data.        (iii)  Variations in the Annual Bottom Line       The EPA expects a small variation in the annual bottom line, reflecting the reduced time in 2000/2001 to review instructions, reprogram a DAHS, develop flow-to-load tests and debug computer software.  The variation is not expected to be greater than 25%.      6.5 Auctions        This part presents estimates of the burden and costs to participants and the Federal government associated with the auction program .  EPA has delegated the administration of the auctions to the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT).            Auctions are held only once a year.  No restrictions are placed on the number of allowances for which a participant may bid.  Multiple bids from a given participant are permitted, but each bid is treated individually and requires a separate bid form.  Based on the average number of bids in the six auctions to date, EPA estimates that 220 bids will be received each year.        6.5.1  Estimate of Respondent Burden and Costs        Exhibit 9 depicts the burden and costs to auction participants. Auction participants must complete and submit the bid form along with a certified check or letter of credit.  EPA estimates that the auction bid form takes approximately 30 minutes to prepare, and obtaining a means of payment takes approximately one hour.  This estimate includes time allocated to research the required information, fill out the form, arrange for a certified check or letter of credit, and send the material to EPA.  The burden and cost to auction participants is estimated to be 330 hours and  $20,460 per year respectively.

These estimates are based on 1998 dollars.    b  The 220 bids represents an average number of bids per year based on EPA's experience with the        auction program.           6.5.2  Estimate of Agency Burden and Costs       Exhibit 10 depicts the burden and cost to EPA for the auction program.  The CBOT incurs most of the burden and cost associated with the auction, including; the handling of bids and checks, and tabulation of the results.  The burden and cost to CBOT is not included in this ICR.        Based on past experience, the burden and cost to the Agency will be about the same each year.  Setting up and revising allowance tracking system (ATS) accounts for auction participants is estimated to take 40 hours, checking and announcing the auction results is estimated to take 60 hours, and transferring allowances and proceeds is expected to require 60 hours per year.  As Exhibit 10 shows, the total burden to EPA for auction activities is 160 hours at a cost of $6,850.

Allowance Allocation to Small Diesel Refineries          This information collection activity involves the collection of verification data for eligibility and participation in the voluntary small diesel refiners allowance program.          EPA is assuming that all eligible refineries and units have already reviewed the final rule and preamble.  For the purpose of this analysis, the burden is distributed among the management, technical, and clerical levels.             6.6.1. Estimate of Respondent Burden and Costs        EPA's voluntary small diesel refinery program currently has 19 participating refineries.  The labor burden and costs for this collection are a function of the number of facilities that choose to participate.  EPA is assuming that all 19 refineries currently participating will be eligible and continue to participate each year through 1999.        Exhibit 11 presents the annual burden and costs to participants of applying for allowances.           EXHIBIT 11       ANNUAL RESPONDENT BURDEN/COST ESTIMATES FOR THE       SMALL DIESEL REFINERY PROGRAM a        Task     Burden Hours per Occurrence   Cost per   Occurrence b   Total Burden   Hours c   Total   Costs   Annual Application for Allowances     Managerial     Technical     Clerical              .5     1       .5       $33     $45      $11         9.5     19      9.5         $627     $855      $209     Total   2   $89     38     $1,691      a  Annual burden for years 1999 and 2000, the last year of the program.    b  1998 dollars.    c  Assumes 19 small diesel refineries apply each year.        In each year of the program, an eligible refiner must maintain the monthly EIA Form 810's, total the desulfurized diesel fuel throughput for the year, use the total and the formula contained in the Act to calculate the allowance allocation, and certify the accuracy of the information in an application cover letter to EPA.        EPA expects 19 applications to be submitted in 1999 and 2000 by small diesel refiners.  Since, each application takes about 2 hours to complete, the total burden will be 38 hours per year.           6.6.2. Estimate of Agency Burden and Costs        Exhibit 12 presents the Agency's burden and costs for the program annually.      EXHIBIT 12         ANNUAL AGENCY BURDEN/COST ESTIMATES FOR THE       SMALL DIESEL REFINERY PROGRAM a        Task   Burden Hours per Occurrence   Cost Per   Occurrence b   Total Burden Hours c   Total Costs     Review Annual Applications   2   $86     38   $1,634        a  Annual burden for years 1999 and 2000, the last year of the program.    b  1998 dollars.    c  Assumes 19 small diesel refineries apply each year.        EPA reviews each annual application, submitted by an eligible refiner, and determines whether or not the allowance calculations have been made properly.  EPA then allocates allowances to the eligible refiners at the completion of the annual review process. To assist the refineries, EPA also announces the allocations in a Federal Register notice.        6.7 The Opt-in Program         This subsection describes projections for (1) the number and types of sources that elect to participate in the opt-in program from January 1999 through January 2002, (2) the paperwork burden hours for both respondents and EPA associated with the program, and (3) the total costs of the tasks required by the opt-in program.        Over the three years covered by this ICR, EPA estimates that 3 sources will opt in to the program, all will be operating sources and all will join in 1999.  These figures are based on the number of opt-in applications EPA has received over the past three years.         6.7.1 Respondent Burden/Cost Estimates for The Opt-in Program        The tasks under this program are divided into the major categories of reporting -- permitting, emissions monitoring, and annual compliance certification.  This section includes only the burden for these task categories for opt-in sources.  Those affected sources covered by the mandatory requirements of the Acid Rain Program are covered in previous sections.             A. Opt-in Permit Applications        EPA estimates that 3 opt-in sources will submit permit applications in the first year covered by this ICR.  All will be operating sources.  The sources must select a designated representative, report operating and fuel consumption data from past years, and report the actual and allowable emissions rates for 1985 as well as the current allowable emission rate.  The estimated total respondent burden related to opt-in permit applications is 525 hours, and the estimated total respondent cost is $27,078.  Exhibit 13 presents the respondent burden and costs associated with opt-in permit applications for 1999.        B. Emissions Data Reporting        Emissions reporting is performed only by operating sources.  The tasks for opt-in sources are identical to other affected sources and are listed in Exhibit 7. The burden and costs for emissions reporting from opt-in sources are included in the total in Exhibit 7.        C. Annual Compliance Certification        Annual compliance certification is performed by all opt-in sources.  Each opt-in source is required to submit an annual compliance certification report and opt-in utilization form.  Additionally, if the source is covered by a thermal energy compliance plan, it must submit a thermal energy compliance report.  If an opt-in source has reduced utilization due to energy conservation or improved unit efficiency measures, it has the option of submitting an energy confirmation and improved unit efficiency confirmation report to verify the savings and offset the corresponding reduced utilization.  To date none of the opt-in sources have verified energy conservation or improved unit efficiency measures, so EPA is assuming no sources will do so during the three years covered by this ICR.  Finally, EPA assumes that each opt-in source will submit one optional allowance deduction form, which specifies the serial numbered allowances for deduction.         Total respondent burden and costs for annual compliance certification by opt-in sources are an estimated 962 hours and $47,274,  respectively.  Exhibit 14 presents respondent burden and costs for annual compliance certification by opt-in sources.         6.7.2. Agency Burden/Cost Estimates for the Opt-in Program        In 1999-2002, the Agency's burden includes; processing opt-in applications, processing quarterly emissions reports (which is included in Exhibit 8), and reviewing and certifying annual compliance reports.  The Agency's estimated total burden related to the opt-in program is 308 hours in 1999, and 65 hours in subsequent years.  The estimated total cost is $13,186 in 1999 and $2,782 in subsequent years.

Phase I Sources        Annual compliance certification is performed by all Phase I affected sources in the spring of 1999 and 2000.  Each Phase I affected source, which includes any source with compensating or substitution units, is required to submit an annual compliance certification report for the source and a utilization accounting form for each Phase I affected unit at the source.  Based on the first three years of  the program, EPA estimates that 400 units at 175 sources will be affected in 1998 and 1999 (261 Table 1 units at 110 sources and 139 substitution and compensating units at 65 sources).          If any unit is underutilized or is covered by a reduced utilization plan claiming shifts to sulfur-free generators, then a dispatch system data report must be submitted for the dispatch system containing that unit.  EPA estimates that 25 dispatch systems will need to submit the dispatch system data report each year.            If a unit has a reduced utilization plan covering energy conservation or improved unit efficiency measures, it has the option of submitting an energy confirmation and improved unit efficiency confirmation report to verify the savings and offset the corresponding reduced utilization.  EPA estimates that 2% of the 400 units will verify energy conservation or improved unit efficiency measures.          Affected units have the option of identifying specific serial numbered allowances to be deducted by EPA.  EPA assumes that each unit will submit one optional allowance deduction form each year.         A sulfur-free generator that is claimed by more than one unit under reduced utilization plans will need to submit a sulfur-free generator apportionment form.  EPA estimates that about 20 sulfur-free generators will need to submit this information.          Substitution and compensating units in a State with a ""State-enforced emission cap"" must submit additional information.  This information is to be at the operating company level.  EPA expects a total of eight operating companies located in four different States to submit this information.             Total respondent burden for annual compliance certification by Phase I affected sources is estimated to total 21,339 hours, for a total cost of $1,039,211.  Exhibit 16 presents respondent burden and costs for annual compliance certification.        B. Phase II Sources         Beginning in the spring of 2001, annual compliance certification must be performed by all affected sources.  Each affected source must submit an annual compliance certification report.  In addition to the compliance certification report, affected units have the option of identifying specific serial numbered allowances to be deducted by EPA.  EPA assumes that each unit will submit one optional allowance deduction form each year.   EPA estimates that 2,300 units at 750 sources will be affected in Phase II.          Total respondent burden for annual compliance certification by Phase II affected sources is estimated to total 21,350 hours, for a total cost of $1,066,600.

Agency Burden and Cost Estimates        The three primary tasks performed by the Agency during annual compliance certification are; reviewing and processing the annual form submissions, calculating and deducting allowances, and sending out allowance deduction or reconciliation reports to the source designated representatives.  Based on the estimated 400 Phase I and 2,300 Phase II affected units, EPA expects the annual Agency burden to total 600 hours, and cost $25,200 in 1999 and 2000, and 3,450 hours and $144,900 in 2001.  Exhibit 17 presents the Agency's annual burden and cost for annual compliance certification.

This is the only respondent burden for NO x  permitting for the period covered by this ICR.  Because Phase II No x  permits were due January 1, 1998, most of the burden and costs were incurred under the previous ICR.         In order to estimate the number of expected submissions, EPA estimates that 10% of the roughly 40 averaging plans on file will be revised each year.         6.9.1 Estimate of Respondent Burden and Costs       Exhibit 18 presents the burden and costs to applicants for preparing and submitting a revised NO x  averaging plan.        For each emissions averaging plan, EPA estimates that the applicant will require about 10 hours:  50 percent managerial labor, 40 percent technical labor, and 10 percent clerical labor.  The total respondent burden for NO x  permitting, as shown in Exhibit 18, is estimated to be 40 hours each year.  The costs associated with NO x  permitting are estimated at $2,132 per year.

Worldwide, motor vehicles emit well over 900 million metric tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) each year, accounting for more than 15 percent of global fossil fuel-derived CO2 emissions.1 In the industrialized world alone, 20-25 percent of GHG emissions come from the transportation sector. The share of transport-related emissions is growing rapidly due to the continued increase in transportation activity.2 In 1950, there were only 70 million cars, trucks, and buses on the world's roads. By 1994, there were about nine times that number, or 630 million vehicles. Since the early 1970s, the global fleet has been growing at a rate of 16 million vehicles per year. This expansion has been accompanied by a similar growth in fuel consumption.3 If this kind of linear growth continues, by the year 2025 there will be well over one billion vehicles on the world's roads.4 In a response to the significant growth in transportation-related GHG emissions, governments and policy makers worldwide are considering methods to reverse this trend. However, due to the particular make-up of the transportation sector, regulating and reducing emissions from this sector poses a significant challenge. Unlike stationary fuel combustion, transportation-related emissions come from dispersed sources. Only a few point-source emitters, such as oil/natural gas wells, refineries, or compressor stations, contribute to emissions from the transportation sector. The majority of transport-related emissions come from the millions of vehicles traveling the world's roads. As a result, successful GHG mitigation policies must find ways to target all of these small, non-point source emitters, either through regulatory means or through various incentive programs. To increase their effectiveness, policies to control emissions from the transportation sector often utilize indirect means to reduce emissions, such as requiring specific technology improvements or an increase in fuel efficiency. Site-specific project activities can also be undertaken to help decrease GHG emissions, although the use of such measures is less common. Sample activities include switching to less GHG-intensive vehicle options, such as electric vehicles (EVs) or hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). As emissions from transportation activities continue to rise, it will be necessary to promote both types of abatement activities in order to reverse the current emissions path. This Resource Guide focuses on site- and project-specific transportation activities. Over the last decade, efforts to reduce GHG emissions in the U.S. have led to the creation of a number of voluntary programs for registering and crediting project-specific World Resources Institute, Proceed With Caution: Growth in the Global Motor Vehicle Fleet, http://www.wri.org/trends/autos.html. 2 ""Good Practice Greenhouse Abatement Policies: Transport Sector,"" OECD and EIA Information Papers prepared for the Annex I Expert Group on the UNFCCC. OECD and IEA, Paris, November 2000. Emissions exclude land-use change and forestry, and bunker fuels. Annex I countries are those countries that have undertaken binding emission reduction targets under the Kyoto Protocol of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). 3 American Automobile Manufacturers Association (AAMA), World Motor Vehicle Data 1993 (AAMA, Washington, D.C., 1993), p. 23, and American Automobile Manufacturers Association (AAMA), Motor Vehicle Facts and Figures 1996 (AAMA, Washington, D.C., 1996). 4 World Resources Institute, Proceed With Caution: Growth in the Global Motor Vehicle Fleet, http://www.wri.org/trends/autos.html. 1  Overview  1   GHG reduction activities undertaken by individual project developers. Similarly, several international programs have been implemented, including efforts that allow for trading in GHG emission reduction activities. As a result, a small but growing market for the trade in GHG emission reduction credits has emerged, creating an additional incentive for project developers in the transportation sector to undertake GHG reduction projects. Given that EVs and HEVs both emit less GHG emissions compared to conventional vehicles, projects that lead to the introduction of EVs and HEVs could register with the many voluntary GHG reporting programs and may be able to sell the associated GHG reduction credits on the market. However, to participate in these efforts, project developers must be familiar with the procedures for developing and estimating the GHG emissions benefits resulting from the various types of projects. This National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) publication, ""Battery-Powered Electric and Hybrid Electric Vehicles to Reduce Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions: A Resource Guide for Project Development"" provides national and international project developers with a guide on how to estimate and document the GHG emission reduction benefits and/or penalties of battery-powered and hybrid-electric vehicle projects. This primer also provides a resource for the creation of GHG emission reduction projects for the Activities Implemented Jointly (AIJ) Pilot Phase and in anticipation of other marketbased project mechanisms proposed under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Though it will be necessary for project developers and other entities to evaluate the emission benefits of each project on a case-by-case basis, this primer will provide a guide for determining which data and information to include during the process of developing the project proposal. The resource guide first provides an overview of the various technology options for both EVs and HEVs. Sections 1 and 2 briefly summarize the types of EVs and HEVs available and review their performance and estimated costs. These introductory sections are followed by Section 3, which provides an overview of the emerging regulatory frameworks promoting the use of EV and HEVs, including relevant domestic and international climate change policy developments. Section 4 discusses the procedures for estimating GHG emission reductions from EV and HEV projects. This includes a summary of the GHG emissions associated with EVs and HEVs, an overview of studies analyzing potential climate change-related benefits, a description of EV and HEV projects previously implemented, and a discussion of the common procedures required to participate in project-based GHG reduction systems. Finally, section 5 presents a hypothetical case study on how to develop a baseline and estimate the resulting GHG benefits from an EV or HEV project.  2  Overview   1  Hybrid Electric Vehicle Technology Options  HEVs combine the internal combustion engine of a conventional vehicle with the battery and electric motor of an electric vehicle. This combination offers the extended range and rapid refueling that consumers expect from a conventional vehicle, with a significant portion of the energy and environmental benefits of an electric vehicle. The practical benefits of HEVs include improved fuel economy and lower emissions of the full host of criteria pollutants, as well as CO2, compared to conventional vehicles. The inherent flexibility of HEVs will allow them to be used in a wide range of applications, where electric-only vehicles cannot, from personal and public transportation to commercial hauling. As with electric vehicles and conventional vehicles, the main factors that can be used to rate one vehicle over another are: Range: how far can the vehicle travel between refueling? Refueling time: how long does it take to refuel? Refueling infrastructure: how available are refueling stations? Efficiency or fuel economy or gas mileage: how far can the vehicle travel for a given unit of fuel energy, measured in miles per gallon for HEVs and conventional vehicles? Performance: how well does the vehicle handle? Power: what acceleration can the engine deliver? What speeds can it maintain? Safety: how vulnerable is the vehicle to collision? How quickly can it brake? and Cost. These are the elements and questions to keep in mind when considering the relative merits of one vehicle type over another. In general, HEVs typically compare well with their conventional counterparts. They have increased range and mileage, and comparable power, safety and performance. Their main hindrance to mass commercial deployment has been their cost, but this too is becoming more and more competitive. The following paragraphs briefly discuss some of the basic characteristics of HEVs, and more detailed specifications can be found in Appendix 1.  1.1  Types of Vehicles  Many configurations are possible for HEVs. Essentially, a hybrid combines an energy storage system, a power unit, an electric motor, and a vehicle propulsion system. The primary options for energy storage include batteries, ultracapacitors, and flywheels. Although batteries are by far the most common energy storage choice, other possibilities are being researched. Hybrid power units are typically spark ignition internal combustion engines (similar to those employed in conventional vehicles) for light-duty hybrid vehicles and diesel engines for heavy-duty hybrids. Other ""power plant"" options for hybrids include spark ignition direct injection engines (SIDI), gas turbines, and fuel cells. There are two main system types for propulsion, which define the two main branches of hybrid-electric technology: The series configuration, in which the propulsion comes solely from an electric motor. In this case the engine is used to continually repower the battery, and  1 HEV Technology Options  3   The parallel configuration, in which the role of the engine is to provide direct mechanical input to drive the vehicle in parallel with the electric motor, and also to charge the battery. A hybrid's efficiency and emissions depend on the particular combination of subsystems, how these subsystems are integrated into a complete system, and the control strategy that integrates the subsystems. Hybrid vehicle fuel economy ranges from 10 to 15 percent higher than conventional vehicles (for ""mild hybrids"") to between 200 and 300 percent higher for the most advanced systems where increase in fuel efficiency is optimized. The potential gains in fuel efficiency by hybrids are dependent on the type of driving the vehicle is typically used for--higher gains are possible in congested urban driving than highway driving. 1.1.1 Commercially Available Vehicles  Currently, there are only two original equipment manufacturers (OEM) with HEVs on the U.S. market: Honda and Toyota (Honda has two, the Insight and a new Civic Hybrid, and Toyota has one, the Prius). The Honda Insight was the first HEV to be available for public purchase  the two-seat model was introduced across the country in late 1999. The Insight uses an Integrated Motor Assist (IMATM) system, which combines the world's lightest 1.0-liter, 3-cylinder gasoline automobile engine with an ultra-thin electric motor. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has rated the Insight as having a gas mileage of 61-mpg city/70-mpg highway. The cost of the Insight is around $19,000.  Honda Insight, 2002  The Prius was introduced shortly after the Insight and seen far more success in terms of overall sales, although still limited to about 2000 per month5. The main difference is that the Prius seats four and has the exterior of a standard sedan, which makes it more or less interchangeable with conventional passenger vehicles and makes users feel less like they are driving a concept car wherein performance and/or safety might be unreliable. As a result of the increased space and weight, the Prius' gas mileage is lower than that of the Insight, with an EPA rating of 52-mpg city/45-mpg highway. However, the success of the Prius, and the prospect for hybrids in general (especially those that are interchangeable with larger conventional vehicles), have prompted Honda to release a new hybrid model of its popular Civic. It too is a four-door sedan, and gets lower mileage Washington Post Article, ""Half Gas, Half Electric, Total California Cool; Hollywood Gets a Charge Out of Hybrid Cars."" June 6, 2002. 5  4  2 Battery-Powered EV Technology Options   than the Insight at 51-mpg city/46 mpg highway, but Honda expects the sales to be sharply increased over the Insight and to rival or surpass those of the Prius. The cost of both the Prius and Civic hybrid are about $20,000. In the near future, additional HEVs, including Sport Utility HEVs and other large models, are expected from General Motors, Ford, DaimlerChrysler, and others.  Toyota Prius, 2002  1.2  Vehicle Performance  As mentioned previously, well-designed hybrid-electric vehicles have similar capabilities with regard to speed, safety and handling compared to conventional vehicles. In fact, hybrids have the same or greater range than traditional internal combustion engine vehicles  Honda's Insight can go about 700 miles on a single tank of gas, while the Toyota Prius can go about 500 miles  and achieve about twice the fuel economy of their conventional counterparts. The following table compares the characteristics of the Toyota Prius with a conventional automobile of a similar size class: the Honda Civic Sedan DX. For more detail, refer to Appendix 1.

May-June, 2002.  6  1 HEV Technology Options  5   Anecdotally, in terms of operating a new type of vehicle, some drivers have reported needing some time to get used to the fact that the energy-saving engines of some HEVs are designed to shut off automatically when the vehicle is braking or stopped at a red light.  6  2 Battery-Powered EV Technology Options   2  Battery-Powered Electric Vehicle Technology Options  Battery operated electric vehicles are powered by an electric motor that draws on stored electricity from the on-board batteries. Battery operated electric vehicles are sometimes referred to as ""zero emission vehicles"" (ZEVs) (and are classified as such under certain regulatory regimes), because there are no tailpipe emissions (there is no tailpipe), nor are there emissions associated with fuel evaporation, refining, or transport. The designation of ZEV can be misleading, as there are a number of indirect emissions that can be associated with the vehicle--namely during the production of the electricity at the power plant. However, the fact that no emissions come from the vehicle itself has enormous significance in the context of urban air pollution and issues associated with the usage of gasoline and diesel, such as fuel security.  2.1  Types of Vehicles  EVs come in two basic types: ""full function"" EVs that are the equivalent of conventional light-duty vehicles, and ""neighborhood EVs"" that are small, typically two-seater vehicles with limited speed (top speed of 25 mph) and operating range (typically 30 miles) intended for use for short trips on non-highway roads. Neighborhood vehicles, which are recharged at the users' home, can satisfy short-trip transportation needs on local community roads that are not major thoroughfares. It should be noted that neighborhood EVs are not classified as or considered appropriate for use as typical passenger vehicles, nor do they meet the same safety standards as full function EVs and conventional vehicles. However, to date, 34 U.S. states and the District of Columbia have authorized their use on roads with 35 mph speed limits, for which there is a significant niche market. The full function light-duty EVs offered for sale include two two-seater cars, one mid-size station wagon, one pickup truck, one small SUV, and a service van. Ford offers its Th!nk two-seater that has an operating range of 53 miles. General Motors offers their EV1, which has an operating range of up to 90 miles when lead-acid batteries are used, and up to 130 miles when nickel-metal hydride batteries are used. Nissan offers an electric version of their Altra station wagon to customers in California only. The Altra has an operating range of 80 miles using lithium-ion batteries. Ford has an electric version of their small pickup (Ranger) that has a range of 73 miles using lead-acid batteries. Toyota has an electric version of their RAV4 small SUV with an operating range of 126 miles using nickel-metal hydride batteries. The RAV4-EV is only sold to fleet customers in California.  2.2  Vehicle Performance  The driving ranges of battery-operated electric vehicles typically vary from 50 to 130 miles, depending on a vehicle's weight, its design features, and the type of battery it uses.7 Drivers can refuel a battery-operated vehicle by simply plugging it into a special recharging outlet at home, which is both convenient in the sense of allowing drivers to 7 ""Just the Basics: Electric Vehicles, Transportation for the 21st Century,"" Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Office of Transportation Technologies, U.S. Department of Energy.  2 Battery-Powered EV Technology Options  7   refuel overnight at home, and inconvenient, due to the fact that it can take extended periods of time to charge the vehicle. The recharging time depends on the voltage of the recharging station, the ambient air temperature, the size and type of the battery pack, and the remaining electrical energy in storage. Typically, the process takes several hours, but batteries are being developed that can be recharged more quickly. Electric vehicles can be more efficient than conventional vehicles on a purely fuel to motive energy conversion basis, because electric motors are more efficient at low speeds unlike internal combustion engines, and because they do not use any power when coasting or at rest.8 Adding to the efficiency of battery-powered electric vehicles is the technique of regenerative braking. Regenerative braking is the process of slowing and stopping a vehicle by converting its mechanical energy to electric energy, which can then be returned to the vehicle's on-board battery. In a conventional vehicle, this energy is simply wasted as heat. (Many hybrid vehicles also incorporate regenerative braking which contributes significantly to their efficiency improvements.) Typical figures for electric vehicle efficiencies range from 0.2 to 0.4 kWh per mile traveled. To compare the GHG emissions from an electric vehicle to that of a conventional vehicle, one must first know the source of the electricity used to power the electric vehicle. Electricity derived from hydropower, wind power or other renewable resources would have no GHG emissions, while electricity derived from a coal plant would have nearly identical CO2 emissions as that of a conventional 26 mpg gasoline passenger car9. Therefore a conventional car with above-average efficiency, say of 30 mpg or better, will produce less CO2 than an EV powered by coal-derived electricity. On the other hand, an EV using electricity produced from a source other than coal, such as natural gas, will produce less CO2 emissions. This topic is discussed further in section 4.  2.3  Vehicle Costs  Electric vehicles are about twice as expensive as their conventional fuel counterparts. For example, the EV1 is advertised to cost about $40,000. However, all the major auto manufacturers require that their EVs be leased instead of bought, since manufacturers are uncomfortable selling them at this time, given relative inexperience with maintenance, service, and recharging. The Altra wagon, RAV4-EV, and Ford Ranger EV all lease for $599 per month. Neighborhood electric vehicles range in price from $6,000 to as much as $20,000 depending on amenities and battery technology. For a sample study, completed by Argonne National Laboratory, analyzing the lifecycle costs of EVs versus conventional vehicles please refer to Appendix 4.  It should be noted that when the electricity to be used in an EV is generated inefficiently, the resulting electric vehicle efficiency can often be worse than that of a conventional vehicle. 9 Based on the following assumptions: electric vehicle efficiency of 0.3 kWh/mile (various sources report a range from 0.2 to 0.4 kWh/mile); gasoline vehicle efficiency of 26 miles per gallon; heat rate at coal plant of 9,750 BTU/KWH (35% efficiency); coal carbon content of 26.8 kg Carbon/GJ (IPCC); gasoline carbon content of 2.42 kg C/gallon (EIA).  8  8  2 Battery-Powered EV Technology Options   3  Regulatory and Policy Frameworks Promoting Electric and Hybrid Electric Vehicles Over the past decade, a number of regulatory policies have been introduced in the U.S. to promote the use of EVs and HEVs. Many of these policies are directed toward addressing urban air pollution and reducing fuel use, and not directly geared toward the reduction of GHG emissions. However, by promoting the adoption of more alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs),10 such as EVs and HEVs, they indirectly contribute to the goal of reducing GHG emissions from the transportation sector. In the following discussion, this chapter considers a number of relevant regulations, policies, and programs that encourage the adoption and procurement of EVs and HEVs. A wide variety of direct and indirect regulatory and policy drivers work to promote the broader use of AFVs in the United States, and encourage the development of EV/HEV projects. These measures typically include the following: Regulatory incentives, such as a tax credit or deduction, for the purchase or government procurement of an AFV or AFV-related equipment; Mandates and directives to both public and private fleet operators to purchase AFVs; Emissions standards for AFVs, low emission, or zero emission vehicles that encourage market shifts towards increased development and deployment of AFVs in the automobile market; Special regulations that provide advantages to AFV owners, such as access to high occupancy vehicle lanes, parking lanes, or simplified vehicle registration; and Fuel economy requirements for conventional vehicles that encourage development of more fuel efficiency technologies and vehicles, such as AFVs. Each of these policy approaches has varying impacts on the promotion of AFVs. The chapter addresses federal and state regulatory policies that more directly promote the adoption of EVs and HEVs, primarily considering incentives, procurement mandates, and emissions and technology standards. This chapter is structured to first include an overview of Federal policies and programs targeting EVs and HEVs. The discussion begins with an overview of federal policy, primarily including tax incentives and AFV procurement mandates. Next, the discussion addresses major state policies and programs introduced to encourage the use of EV and HEVs, including California's low 10 The term ""alternative fueled vehicle"" is defined as any dedicated vehicle or a dual fueled vehicle. (EPAct 301.) As provided in EPAct, the term ""alternative fuel"" is defined as: methanol, denatured ethanol, and other alcohols; mixtures containing 85 percent or more (or such other percentage, but not less than 70 percent, as determined by the Secretary, by rule, to provide for requirements relating to cold start, safety, or vehicle functions) by volume of methanol, denatured ethanol, and other alcohols with gasoline or other fuels; natural gas; liquefied petroleum gas; hydrogen; coal-derived liquid fuels; fuels (other than alcohol) derived from biological materials; electricity (including electricity from solar energy); and any other fuel the Secretary determines, by rule, is substantially not petroleum and would yield substantial energy security benefits and substantial environmental benefits.  3 Regulatory and Policy Frameworks  9   emission and zero emission vehicle regulations. Finally, this section concludes with a discussion of the relevant domestic and international climate change policies and programs that are likely to have an influence on the development of EV and HEV markets. It should be noted that while gas and diesel HEV technologies are considered to be AFVs in certain contexts, neither are eligible for the majority of the Federal and state incentives presented below, and therefore the majority of the discussion with regard to incentives will pertain to EVs only. On the other hand, both EVs and HEVs figure prominently in some of the emerging regulations.  3.1  Federal Policies and Programs  Many of the most relevant elements of Federal policy to promote the development and use of alternative fuels in the transportation sector were introduced with the passage of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPAct).11 The primary motivations behind promoting alternative fuels under EPAct included reducing the nation's dependence on foreign oil and increasing the nation's energy security through the use of domestically produced alternative fuels. To do so, EPAct established a goal of replacing 10 percent of petroleum-based motor fuels in the United States by the year 2000 and 30 percent by the year 2010. As discussed below, EPAct addresses EVs and HEVs in two principal ways: first, by providing tax credits and deductions for the purchase of EVs and development of EV infrastructure, and second, by mandating Federal, State, and private ""alternative fuel provider""12 fleets to purchase AFVs (excluding HEVs).13 3.1.1 Federal Tax Incentives for Electric Vehicles  The Federal government introduced two forms of tax incentives relating to EVs under EPAct: a Federal tax credit available to individuals and businesses purchasing qualified EVs;  Energy Policy Act of 1992, Public Law 102-486. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, an alternative fuel provider is defined as: [an entity] that owns, operates, leases, or otherwise controls 50 or more lightduty vehicles (LDVs) in the U.S. that are not on the list of EPAct Excluded Vehicles [such as emergency or law enforcement vehicles]; least 20 of those LDVs are used primarily within a Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA)/Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area (CMSA); those same 20 LDVs are centrally fueled or capable of being centrally fueled. LDVs are centrally fueled if they capable of being refueled at least 75% of the time at a location that is owned, operated, or controlled by any fleet, or under contract with that fleet for refueling purposes. An alternative fuel provider is covered under EPAct if its principal business involves one of the following: producing, storing, refining, processing, transporting, distributing, importing, or selling any alternative fuel (other than electricity) at wholesale or retail; generating, transmitting, importing, or selling electricity at wholesale or retail; or produces and/or imports an average of 50,000 barrels per day or more of petroleum, as well as 30% or more of its gross annual revenues are derived from producing alternative fuels. http://www.ott.doe.gov/epact/alt_fuel_prov.shtml. 13 Although HEVs are fuel efficient and produce low levels of emissions, they do not count as ""alternative fuel vehicles"" because the HEVs on the market today use gasoline rather than alternative fuels. There has been some discussion on including HEVs as AFVs in the future, but no final decision has been made to date. http://www.ott.doe.gov/hev/faqs.html. See also http://www.ott.doe.gov/legislation.shtml. 12  11  10  3 Regulatory and Policy Frameworks   a Federal tax deduction for business expenses related to the incremental cost to purchase or convert to qualified clean fuel vehicles. Electric Vehicle Tax Credit EPAct established a tax credit for individuals or businesses purchasing qualified EVs that have been put into service between December 20, 1993 and December 31, 2004.14 IRS Form 8834 can be used to determine the credit for qualified electric vehicles placed in service during the year. The tax credit is 10 percent of the purchase price, up to a maximum of $4,000, for qualified EVs placed in service before 2002. Beginning in 2001, the size of the credit is reduced by 25 percent of the original amount per year until the credit is fully phased out. Thus, the tax credit for each vehicle placed in service during 2002 is 7.5 percent of the cost of the qualified EV, up to a maximum credit of $3,000. Credits will be reduced by 50 percent for 2003 vehicles and by 75 percent for 2004 vehicles (see Table 3.1). Table 3-1 Summary of Tax Credits for Qualifying Electric Vehicles Date Dec. 20, 1993 - 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 Deduction Available up to $4,000 up to $3,000 up to $2,000 up to $1,000 None - credit fully phased out  A qualified EV is defined as any motor vehicle that is powered primarily by an electric motor drawing current from rechargeable batteries, fuel cells, or other portable sources of electrical current, was manufactured primarily for use on public streets, roads, and highways, and has at least four wheels. All dedicated, plug-in-only EVs qualify for the tax credit. The credit does not apply to vehicles primarily used outside the United States, vehicles used by any governmental body or agency or any foreign person or entity, or vehicles used by a tax-exempt organization.15 All series and some parallel HEVs meet the aforementioned qualifications, although HEVs that are not powered primarily by an electric motor, such as the Honda Insight or Toyota Prius, do not qualify as EVs. However, part of the cost of these parallel HEVs (up to $2,000 for a vehicle with a gross vehicle weight rating that does not exceed 10,000 pounds) may qualify for the deduction for clean-fuel vehicles, even if they are not used for business purposes. Clean Fuel Vehicle Deduction Similar to the EV tax credit, EPAct established a tax deduction for the purchase of a new OEM qualified clean fuel vehicle, or for the conversion of a vehicle to use a clean-burning fuel.16 EPAct made available a Federal income tax deduction of between $2,000 and $50,000 (per vehicle) for the incremental cost to purchase or convert qualified clean fuel vehicles, including EVs, and for certain kinds of refueling property (see below). The deductions are available for vehicles put into service between December 20, 1993 and December 31, 2004. Like the EV tax credit, the deduction will be reduced by 25 EPAct, Title XIX-Revenue Provisions, Sec. 30, Credit for Qualified Electric Vehicles.

The amount of the tax deductions for qualified clean fuel vehicles is based on the gross vehicle weight and type of vehicle. The tax deduction for clean fuel vehicles is available for any applicable business or personal vehicle, except EVs eligible for the federal EV tax credit. The deduction is not amortized and must be taken in the year the vehicle is acquired.17 As provided in Table 3-2, the tax deduction for trucks or vans with gross vehicle weight of between 10,000 and 26,000 lbs is $5,000 per vehicle. The deduction is $50,000 per vehicle for trucks and vans over 26,000 lbs, or buses with seating capacity of 20 or more adults. Other clean fuel vehicles may qualify for a $2,000 credit. Table 3-2 also provides the maximum deductions for vehicles put into service after 2001 and through 2004, the final year the deduction may be taken before it is fully phased out. Table 3-2.

Recharging property includes any equipment used to charge the electric battery of motor vehicle propelled by electricity and includes: low-voltage and high-voltage recharging equipment, quick-charging equipment, and ancillary connection equipment such as inductive chargers. It also includes the battery itself.18  U.S. Department of Energy, Alternative Fuel Vehicle Fleet Buyer's Guide, http://www.fleets.doe.gov/cgi-bin/fleet/main.cgi?17357,state_ins_rep,5,468050; see also IRS Publication 535. 18 Alternative Fuel Vehicle Fleet Buyer's Guide, http://www.fleets.doe.gov/cgibin/fleet/main.cgi?17357,state_ins_rep,5,468050; see also IRS Publication 535.  17  12  3 Regulatory and Policy Frameworks   Exemption of EVs from Luxury Taxes In addition to the tax incentive provisions under EPAct, the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 (P.L. 105-34) amended the Internal Revenue Code to exempt EVs from Federal excise ""luxury"" taxes and from ""luxury"" depreciation schedules.19 3.1.2 Alternative Fuel Vehicle Requirements for Federal, State, and Alternative Fuel Provider Fleets  EPAct Procurement Requirements for AFVs in Federal Fleets In addition to the tax provisions established under EPAct, the law mandated Federal, state, and ""alternative fuel provider"" fleets to purchase AFVs, including EVs. These provisions have been underscored by a series of Executive Orders that further the commitments of Federal agency fleets to adopt AFVs. Likewise, state and alternative fuel provider fleets must meet the requirements outlined in the Alternative Fuel Transportation Program, Final Rule under the EPAct implementing regulations.20 Section 303 of EPAct requires Federal agencies to acquire a specified number of AFVs, starting in 1993. Under the Act, the Federal Government was required to acquire at least 5,000 light duty AFVs in FY1993, 7,500 light duty AFVs in FY1994, and 10,000 light duty AFVs in FY1995. Following FY1995, all Federal fleets consisting of 20 or more light duty motor vehicles must meet a specific percentage requirement for AFVs, including: 25 percent in FY1996, 33 percent in FY1997, 50 percent in FY1998, and 75 percent in FY1999 and thereafter.21 These requirements are summarized in Table 3-3 below. (See ""Success of the EPAct AFV Program for Federal Fleets"" later in this section for a summary of the success of the EPAct AFV directives.) Table 3-3. Summary of EPAct Requirements for Federal Government Acquisition of Light Duty AFVs Applicable Fleet Entire Federal Government Number of AFVs Required 5,000 total, Government-wide 7,500 total, Government-wide 10,000 total, Government-wide 20% of each fleet Each Federal fleet with 20 or more light duty vehicles 33% of each fleet 50% of each fleet 75% of each fleet  Fiscal Year Vehicle Acquired FY1993 FY1994 FY1995 FY1996 FY1997 FY1998 FY1999 and thereafter  EPAct established a credit system to aid the different agencies in meeting their AFV targets, whereby vehicle procurement agents may receive a specific number of credits when procuring different types of AFVs. Federal and State government agencies that are unable to meet their requirements, as well as alternative fleet providers, may then purchase credits from those agencies or fleet providers that exceed their procurement requirement (see Table 3-5).22 Furthermore, to encourage and promote the use of AFVs in Federal fleets, EPAct also provides an agency incentive program and a recognition and incentive awards program for Federal agencies. Under the Act, the General See http://www.fourmilab.ch/ustax/www/t26-D-31-A-4001.html. 10 CFR Part 490. 21 EPAct 303.

Both were superceded by Executive Order 13149, signed in April 21, 2000, which further strengthened the Federal government's commitment to promote the use of alternative fuel vehicles in Federal fleets. Executive Order (E.O.) 13149 requires Federal agencies operating 20 or more motor vehicles within the United States to reduce the fleet's annual petroleum consumption by 20 percent below FY1999 levels by the end of FY2005.26 To meet this goal, Federal agencies are given significant flexibility in developing an appropriate strategy to meet the petroleum reduction levels. Agencies are required to use alternative fuels, such as electricity, to meet the majority of the fuel requirements for vehicle fleets operating in ""metropolitan statistical areas,"" i.e., metropolitan areas with populations of more than 250,000 in 1995 according to the Census Bureau. Where feasible, the Order also instructs agencies to consider procuring ""innovative"" alternative fuel vehicles that are capable of large improvements in fuel economy, such as HEVs. Agencies are required to increase the average EPA fuel economy rating of their light-duty vehicle acquisitions by at least one mile per gallon (mpg) by 2002 and 3 mpg by 2005 above 1999 acquisition levels. Agencies are also encouraged to adopt awards and performance evaluation programs that reward federal employees for exceptional performance in implementing the Order.27 Federal fleet requirements under E.O. 13149 are summarized in Table 3-4.

As established under EPAct (described above), credits received for the acquisition of AFVs (by government or non-governmental entities) are freely transferable among fleet owners and others required to acquire AFVs under the Act.28 Fleet owners that do not meet the EO acquisition requirements for AFVs may thus purchase credits from fleet owners with a surplus of AFVs credits. Under the Order, agencies receive: (1) one credit for each light-duty AFVs acquired; (2) two credits for each light-duty AFV that exclusively uses an alternative fuel and for each ZEV (see section 3.2 below for a discussion of ZEVs); (3) three credits for dedicated medium-duty AFVs; and (4) four credits for dedicated heavy-duty AFVs.29 This provision enhances the credit allowances under EPAct, which awards a single credit for each AFV acquired.30 Table 3-5 summarizes the number of credits available for each type of acquired AFV. Table 3-5 Summary of Credits for Federal Fleet Acquisitions of AFVs under Executive Order 13149 Type of AFV Each light-duty AFV Each light-duty AFV exclusively using an alternative fuel Each ZEV Each dedicated medium-duty AFV Each dedicated heavy-duty AFV Number of Credits Awarded 1 credit 2 credits 2 credits 3 credits 4 credits  In order to provide for adequate access to refueling infrastructure, Federal agencies are directed under E.O. 13149 to ""team with state, local, and private entities to support the expansion and use of"" public refueling stations for AFVs.31 State, local, and private groups may also establish non-public alternative fuel stations if no commercial infrastructure is available in their territory.32 Success of the EPAct AFV Program for Federal Fleets According to the Department of Energy (DOE) Clean Cities Report Federal Fleet AFV Program Status, dated June 2, 1998, as of 1998, of more than 570,000 vehicle acquisitions overall, the estimated cumulative total AFV acquisitions in Federal agencies totaled more than 34,000 vehicles between FY1991 and FY1998. This represented about 80 percent compliance with the 44,600 required AFV acquisitions under EPAct. Only several hundred of the AFVs acquired were qualified EVs.33 EPAct 508.

As stated in the report: Of the 34,000+ AFVs acquired by Federal agencies, approximately 10,000 (30 percent) have been M-85 (methanol mixed with gasoline) flexible fuel vehicles, 6,000 (17 percent) have been E-85 (ethanol mixed with gasoline) flexible fuel vehicles, and 18,000 (52 percent) have been compressed natural gas (CNG) vehicles. Several hundred each of electric and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG or propane) vehicles have also been acquired. Projections for future Federal AFV acquisitions, based on discussions with Federal 29 28  3 Regulatory and Policy Frameworks  15   In January 2002, three environmental organizations filed a lawsuit in Federal court against 17 Federal agencies for allegedly failing to comply with the AFV acquisition requirements imposed under EPAct.34 The plaintiffs claim that all 17 agencies have failed: (1) to meet their AFV acquisition requirements; (2) to file the necessary compliance reports with Congress; and (3) to make these reports available to the public. The complaint also alleges that DOE failed to complete a required private and municipal AFV fleet rulemaking. As a remedy, the plaintiffs request that the court order the agencies to comply with these requirements, and to require the agencies to offset their future vehicle purchases with the number of AFVs necessary to bring them into compliance with EPAct's acquisition requirements for 1996 through 2001. A decision on the case is pending.35 EPAct Procurement Requirements and Incentives for AFVs in Alternative Fuel Provider and State Fleets In addition to Federal fleet requirements, EPAct established the State and Alternative Fuel Provider (S&FP) Program, a DOE regulatory program that requires covered state and ""alternative fuel provider"" fleets to purchase AFVs as a portion of their annual light duty vehicle acquisitions.36 It is important to note, as mentioned above, that HEVs do not qualify as AFVs under the program because they are not primarily powered by the electric motor.37 As required by EPAct, DOE has developed a mandatory vehicle schedule for acquiring light duty AFVs, including electric vehicles, for alternative fuel providers and states. The mandatory acquisition schedule for alternative fuel provider fleets is: 30 50 70 90 percent percent percent percent for for for for model model model model year year year year 1997; 1998; 1999; and 2000 and thereafter.38  The AFV regulations cover a state agency if it owns or operates 50 or more light-duty vehicles, at least 20 of which are used primarily within a metropolitan area.39 States are required to prepare plans for implementing an AFV program and various policy incentives that may be used to encourage the adoption of AFVs.40 The mandatory acquisition schedule of AFVs for state government fleets is: 10 percent for model year 1997; 15 percent for model year 1998; agencies' procurement personnel and manufacturers, indicate that flexible fuel E-85 vehicles will be the most common AFV procured by agencies' to comply with EPACT, followed by CNG.

As with the Federal AFV program, states and alternative fuel providers that exceed EPAct requirements receive additional credits, while those that are unable to meet the requirements by acquiring AFVs may purchase credits from those holding them.42 As of FY2002 (MY2001), states and alternative fuel provider fleets have collectively acquired more than 60,000 AFVs since the launch of the program, exceeding the program quota.43 According to the 2001 Annual Report, only about 9% of the S&FP fleets had failed to comply with program requirements. About 4.5% of AFVs acquired were qualified electric vehicles.44 Box 3-1 Calculating the Petroleum Equivalency Factor (PEF)  The PEF methodology was developed by DOE to compare the fuel economy of EVs with that of conventional gasoline vehicles. The PEF equation is: PEF = Eg * 1 / 0.15 * AF * DPF Where: Eg = average fossil fuel electricity generation efficiency * average electricity transmission efficiency * refining and distribution efficiency * watt-hours energy per gallon gasoline conversion factor = gasoline-equivalent energy content of electricity factor 1/0.15 AF DPF = Fuel content factor = Petroleum-based accessory factor = Driving pattern factor  3.1.3  Petroleum Equivalency Factors for Electric Vehicles  One significant regulatory development has been the determination of petroleumequivalent fuel economy values for EVs. These factors can be used by automobile manufacturers in the total calculation of a manufacturer's corporate average fuel economy (CAFE), according to regulations prescribed by EPA and the Department of Transportation. On June 12, 2000, DOE released the final calculation to be used to determine the petroleum-equivalency factor (PEF) for EVs. This procedure is described further in Box 3-1. Under the final PEF calculation, an EV achieving 0.24 kWh/mile and having no petroleum-fueled accessories (e.g., a diesel-fired heater or defroster) would receive a petroleum-based fuel economy value of 335.24 mpg.45  10 CFR 490.201.

The most prominent of these are the Securing America's Future Energy Act of 2001 (HR 4), and the Advanced Motor Vehicle Technology and Alternative Fuels Consumer Incentives Act (S. 760). Both would extend the Federal tax credit of $4,000 for the purchase of light-duty EVs to 2007, with HR 4 providing an additional $1,000 tax credit for EVs with a driving range of 70 miles or higher for a single charge, and S. 760 providing an additional $2,000 tax credit for EVs with a driving range of 100 miles or higher for a single charge. Higher tax credits are available for heavier-duty BEVs. S. 760 would also provide a 10 percent tax credit of up to $4,000 for purchase of neighborhood EVs. Base tax credits of $4,000 are available for fuel cell vehicles in both bills with up to an additional $4,000 depending on the fuel economy increase over conventional vehicles. The credits for fuel cell vehicles are dependent on meeting Tier 2, Bin 5 emission standards. Tax credits for fuel cell vehicles under both bills would extend through 2011. Tax credits for HEVs in S. 760 are dependent on the power of the electric drive portion of the powertrain, and the increase in fuel economy relative to conventional vehicles, and on meeting Tier 2, Bin 5 emission standards starting in 2004. A maximum of $4,000 in tax credits would be available for HEVs in S. 760. HR 4 has very similar provisions except that it does not have an emissions requirement, and it adds a ""conservation credit"" of up to $500 dependent on the lifetime fuel savings of the HEV. In total, an HEV could get up to $5,000 under HR 4. HR 4 would also extend tax deductions available for development of clean fuel infrastructure through 2007.  3.2 3.2.1  State Policies and Programs California  Low Emission Vehicle (LEV) and Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) Regulations With the exception of the State of California, Section 209(a) of the Federal Clean Air Act (CAA) prohibits states from adopting or enforcing standards for new motor vehicles or new motor vehicle engines.46 In response to California's severe air pollution problems, CAA Section 209(b) grants the State the explicit authority to set its own standards for vehicular emissions, so long as the standards are equal to, or more stringent than, those set by the CAA and are approved by EPA.47 State studies have found that about half of smog-forming pollutants are produced by gasoline and diesel-powered vehicles, and that only alternative technologies would help California reduce motor vehicle air pollution that will result from increasing driving rates in the State.48 As provided in the Clean Air Act, other states are permitted to follow California so long as any motor vehicle emissions regulations adopted by those states are identical to California's.49 Since California introduced its LEV standards in 1990, four other States-- New York, Massachusetts, Maine, and Vermont--have adopted the California emissions requirements for a percentage of motor vehicles sold in those states (see Section 3.2.2).  42 U.S.C. 7609(a). 42 U.S.C. 7609(b). 48 See California's Zero Emission Vehicle Program, CARB, http://www.arb.ca.gov/msprog/zevprog/factsheet/evfacts.pdf. 49 42 U.S.C. 7507. 47  46  Fact  Sheet,  12/06/01  18  3 Regulatory and Policy Frameworks   LEV I Regulatory Program The flexibility provided to California under the CAA paved the way for sweeping regulation that has established extensive standards for low and zero emissions vehicles sold in the State. Under CAA authority, in 1990 the California Air Resources Board (CARB) adopted regulations to require automobile manufacturers to introduce lowemission vehicles (LEVs)--and ZEVs--to the automobile market in the State. The regulations would require manufacturers to sell a certain percentage of these vehicles each year. Known as LEV I, the new standards promised to introduce EVs, HEVs, and various other low emission vehicles, and to affect the entire automobile market in California. LEV I standards are based on the introduction of four classes of vehicles with increasingly more stringent emissions requirements. These include: transitional low emissions vehicles (TLEVs); low-emission vehicles (LEVs); ultra-low-emission vehicles (ULEVs); and zero emissions vehicles (ZEVs)50. Under the LEV I requirements, as of 1994 manufacturers are permitted to certify vehicles in any combination of the LEV categories through 2003 in order to satisfy the LEV standard.51 It should be noted that under current regulations, auto manufacturers are also required to comply with a fleet-based average Non-Methane Organic Gas standard (NMOG), which introduces more and more stringent standards with each model year.52 LEV II Regulatory Program Following a hearing in November 1998, the CARB amended the LEV I regulations and adopted LEV II, the second-generation LEV program. While the first set of LEV standards covered 1994 through 2003 models years, the LEV II regulations cover 2004 through 2010 and represent continued emissions reductions. The LEV II amendments were formally adopted by the CARB on August 5, 1999 and came into effect on November 27, 1999.53 The more stringent LEV II regulations were adopted in part to keep up with changing passenger vehicle fleets in the state, where more sport utility vehicles (SUVs) and pickup trucks are used as passenger cars rather than work vehicles. The LEV II standards were a necessary step for the state to meet the Federally-mandated CAA goals that address ambient air quality standards as outlined in the 1994 State Implementation Plan (SIP).54 LEV II increased the stringency of the emission standards for all light- and medium-duty EVs provide the only automobile technologies available today that can meet the ZEV standard. See the California Health and Safety Code, Sections 39656-39659. 51 See California Air Resources Board, California Exhaust Emissions Standards and Test Procedures for 2001 and Subsequent Model Passenger Cars, Light-Duty Trucks, and Medium-Duty Vehicles, Proposed Amendments (Sept. 28, 2001). 52 1960.1(g)(2). California's fleet average NMOG mechanism ""requires manufacturers to introduce an incrementally cleaner mix of Tier 1, TLEV, LEV, ULEV and ZEV vehicles each year, with the fleet average NMOG value for passenger cars and lighter light-duty trucks decreasing from 0.25 gram/mile in the 1994 model year to 0.062 gram/mile in the 2003 model year.""

In addition, fleet average durability standards are extended from 100,000 to 120,000 miles. LEV II also allows manufacturers to receive credits for vehicles meeting near-zero emissions, such as fuel cell HEVs, and a new category of vehicles called super ultra-low emissions vehicles (SULEVs).57 The LEV II standards were also designed to respond to some delays and ""inertia"" the LEV program had been facing, and pushed back the starting year of the program to 2003. Under LEV II, manufacturers may certify vehicles under one of five emission standards, listed in order from least to most stringent: transitional low emissions vehicles (TLEVs) low-emission vehicles (LEVs); ultra-low-emission vehicles (ULEVs); super ultra-low emissions vehicles (SULEVs); and zero emissions vehicles (ZEVs). Some examples of LEV I and LEV II emissions standards for the different vehicles types are provided in Tables 3-6 and 3-7.

This requirement, known as the ""ZEV Mandate"" requires that a specific minimum percentage of passenger cars and the lightest light-duty trucks marketed in California by large or intermediate volume manufacturers be ZEVs. (As noted below, requirements differ based on the manufacturer's volume of sales.)60 To initiate the process for car manufacturers to begin to adapt to the new ZEV requirements, the program at first required car manufacturers to implement a number of small demonstration fleets of ZEVs in the early 1990s and then to gradually implement efforts to market ZEVs to the general public starting in 2003. With the adoption of the newer LEV II regulations, ZEVs considered in the program now include: Pure ZEVs (ZEVs)--vehicles with no tailpipe emissions whatsoever; Partial ZEVs (PZEVs)--vehicles that qualify for a partial ZEV allowance of at least 0.2 (before an additional ""early introduction phase-in multiplier"" or ""highefficiency multiplier"" are applied to the allowance); and Advanced Technology PZEVs (AT PZEVs)--any PZEV with an allowance greater than 0.2.61 Pure ZEVs must produce zero exhaust emissions of any criteria or precursor pollutant under any and all possible operational modes and conditions. AT PZEVs include compressed natural gas, HEVs, and methanol fuel cell vehicles. In order to qualify as a PZEV, the AT PZEVs would also have to meet the SULEV tailpipe emissions standard, achieve zero evaporative emissions and include a 150,000-mile warranty for emission control equipment.62 The Executive Officer of CARB is responsible for certifying new 2003 and all subsequent model year (MY) ZEVs.63 The total required volume of a manufacturer's production and delivery for sale of Passenger Cars (PCs) and Light-Duty Trucks 1 (LTD1s) is based on the average from the previous three-year period. The production average is used only for the ZEV requirement. The manufacturer may also choose an alternative to the three-year averaging approach by choosing to base production volumes on an annual basis, using the first year in the three year period and every year thereafter, respectively. The original LEV I regulations required that specific percentages of all PCs and LDT1s, MY1998 and later, be certified as ZEVs. Under the original rulemaking, the required percentages were: 2 percent of the total volume of a manufacturer's production and delivery for sale for 1998-2000 model year vehicles, 5 percent of the total volume for 2001-2002 model year vehicles, and 10 percent of the total volume for 2003 and subsequent model year vehicles. See California Air Resources Board, Notice Of Public Hearing To Consider The Adoption Of Amendments To The Low-Emission Vehicle Regulations, November 15, 2001. 61 California Air Resources Board, California Exhaust Emission Standards and Test Procedures for 2003 and Subsequent Model Zero-Emission Vehicles, and 2001 and Subsequent Model Hybrid Electric Vehicles, in the Passenger Car, Light-Duty Truck, and Medium-Duty Vehicle Classes. (Amended: April 12, 2002), pages A,B-1 to A,B-2. (hereinafter California Exhaust Emission Standards and Test Procedures). Qualified PZEVs meet SULEV, evaporative emissions, and onboard diagnostic standards, and offer an extended warranty of 15 years or 150,000 miles, whichever occurs first. See Id., page C-4. 62 Zero Emission Vehicle Program Changes; ARB, Fact Sheet, 12/10/01 http://www.arb.ca.gov/msprog/zevprog/factsheet/zevchanges.pdf. Note, the current Toyota Prius and Insight HEV models do not yet meet all of the requirements needed to earn either PZEV or AT-PZEV credits.

These amendments significantly reduce the number of full function ZEVs that will be required in the initial years of the program, but nevertheless institute a gradual increase in the minimum required percentage of ZEVs in sales fleets-- from 10 percent in 2003 up to 16 percent in 2018.66 As of Summer 2002, these most recent June 1, 2001 amendments are still pending, but are expected to be adopted without significant additional changes.67 LEV II requirements are compared with the LEV I requirements in Table 3-6. Unlike the previous regulations, the most recent amendments require large and intermediate volume manufacturers to meet different percentage of sales requirements for pure ZEVs, PZEVs, and AT PZEVs.68 Under the latest proposals, major automakers (those selling 35,000 or more passenger cars and light-duty trucks annually in California) could meet the 10 percent requirement for ZEVs sold in the State by selling 20% of their ZEV vehicles as pure ZEVs, 60% as PZEVs, and 20% as AT PZEVs. Intermediate automakers (those selling 4,501 to 35,000 passenger cars and light-duty trucks annually in California) could meet their entire ZEV requirement with PZEV credits, and manufacturers selling fewer than 4,500 vehicles annually would not have to meet any ZEV requirement.69 Table 3-8 summarizes these requirements. (Small and independent low volume manufacturers are exempt from the ZEV requirements but can acquire credits for the sale of ZEVs or PZEVs).

Beginning in 2007, automobile manufacturers must also include heavier SUVs, pickup trucks, and vans in the sales figures used to calculate each automaker's ZEV requirement. In other words, in order to sell more SUVs and other heavier vehicles, each automaker must also sell more ZEVs.73 Finally, in order to ensure effective cooperation between the State of California and auto manufacturers in implementing the LEV regulatory program, and to encourage continued research and development, demonstration, and commercialization of low and zero emission vehicle technologies, the State entered a separate memorandum of agreement (MOA) with each of the seven largest auto manufacturers. Each MOA represents a commitment between the auto manufacturer and the CARB to ensure the successful  California Exhaust Emission Standards and Test Procedures, page C-2.

Like the Federal Alternative Fuel Vehicle program, the California program includes a range of credits that provide incentives for the development of ZEV vehicles with improved range and refueling capacity. The amended California ZEV program envisions awarding additional credits for ZEVs introduced ahead of schedule. Automakers will receive four times the normal number of credits for each ZEV introduced in 2001-2002, and 1.25 times the normal number of credits for each ZEV introduced between 2003 and 2005. The provisions also reduce the minimum number of extra credits available for ZEV models with extended ranges of 50 or more miles to 100 or more miles, and provide 10 credits for ZEVs with ranges of 275 or more miles. Extra credits are also awarded for vehicles that can refuel or charge in less than 10 minutes for a 60-mile range. Credits available for small, neighborhood EVs (NEVs) with limited speed and range are increased from one credit per vehicle to: 4.0 credits for each NEV introduced in 2001-2002; 1.25 credits in 2003; and 0.625 credit for 2004-2005; and 0.15 credit thereafter. ZEVs that remain on the road in California for more than three years also receive additional credits.76 Grants. The CARB recently took steps to complement recent regulatory amendments to the LEV II program with financial incentives that would encourage consumers to purchase ZEVs prior to the mandated start year of 2003. The CARB is setting up a $38 million program to provide incentives to consumers who are interested in buying or leasing ZEVs. This would add to the $20 million in the Governor's 2001-2002 budget and $18 million already planned for incentives. To help consumers defray the cost of some types of ZEVs, the incentive programs will provide grants of up to $9,000 over three years for ZEVs leased prior to 2003. Grants of up to $5,000 would be available thereafter.77 A significant number of State and local government grant programs provide additional financial incentives to consumers for the purchase of ZEVs.78 Carpool Lanes. An added incentive for the use of ZEVs, ULEVs, and SULEVs was the recent adoption of a law in California that allows single-occupant use of High Occupancy Vehicle (HOVs) lanes by certain electric and AFVs. Use of these lanes normally requires that vehicles have at least two occupants. In order to use these lanes with only one occupant, eligible vehicle owners must obtain an identification sticker from the California Department of Motor Vehicles. Although HEVs such as the Toyota Prius and Honda Insight do not qualify for the special use of HOV lanes, over 55 ZEVs, ULEVs, SULEVs, and compressed natural gas vehicle models do.79  http://www.arb.ca.gov/msprog/zevprog/factsheet/moa.htm.

Without explicit direction in the California Building Standards governing the proper installation of electric vehicle charging and supply equipment (California Code of Regulation, Title 24), there were inconsistent requirements imposed by building departments from different jurisdictions that oversee electricity usage and EV charging infrastructure.80 As a result of these concerns, the CARB has recently adopted a series of rules to standardize and create incentives for the development of EV infrastructure. Regulations going into effect in 2006 require ""on-board conductive charging"" as the standardized charging system for EVs in California. ZEVs qualifying for one or more credits and all grid-connected HEVs (referred to as extended range HEVs in California regulations) will need to be equipped with a conductive connector vehicle inlet.81 A number of demonstration programs are currently being implemented in the State to identify opportunities for effective EV infrastructure development.82 Regulation of Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Motor Vehicles On July 11, 2002, the California Legislature passed landmark legislation to propose adopting the first GHG emission regulations on motor vehicles in the United States. AB 1493, expected to be signed into law by the Governor of California at the time of publication of this report, could significantly enhance the objectives of the State's LEV and ZEV program. The law requires the CARB to adopt regulations for carbon dioxide emissions from passenger cars, light trucks, and SUVs by January 1, 2005. The bill directs the CARB to adopt regulations ""that achieve the maximum feasible reduction of GHGs emitted by passenger vehicles and light-duty trucks and any other vehicles"" 83 in the state. The law would take effect January 1, 2006 and would apply to vehicles manufactured in the 2009 model year and after. One interesting condition in the final legislation is to require CARB to develop regulations that specifically do not: (1) impose additional fees or taxes on motor vehicles, fuel, or miles traveled; (2) ban the sale of any vehicle category in the state; (3) require reductions in vehicle weight; (4) limit speed limits; or (5) limit vehicle miles traveled. AB 1493 would also require the California Climate Action Registry to develop procedures by July 1, 2003, in consultation with CARB, for the reporting and registering of vehicular GHG reductions to the Registry. (The California Registry is described in greater detail in Section 3.3) As stipulated in the Clean Air Act, once AB 1493 is signed into law, other states would be able to follow California in adopting equally stringent regulation of carbon dioxide emissions from automobiles. 3.2.2 Adoption of California LEV II Standards in Northeastern States  As discussed, California is the only State with the ability to adopt motor vehicle emissions standards that exceed those of the CAA.84 However, under Section 177 of the CAA other States are permitted to adopt any regulations to address motor vehicle emissions that are enacted and adopted by California, so long as the regulations are no more stringent than California's standards and a two-year lead-time is provided prior to the date the regulations come into effect. In the early 1990s, New York, Massachusetts, Maine, and Vermont adopted the California LEV standards. 80 81 82 83 84  http://www.afdc.doe.gov/altfuel/ele_standard.html.

In 2000 and 2001, respectively, New York and Massachusetts took the further steps of adopting California's LEV II regulations, as amended.86 Vermont has yet to adopt the most recently amended LEV II regulations, but is expected to do so in 2002. Beginning in model year 2005, New York also will require the LEV II program for medium-duty vehicles, including larger pickup trucks and SUVs weighing between 8,500 and 14,000 pounds.87 To date, New York and Massachusetts have adopted regulations that would provide automobile manufacturers greater flexibility in complying with the ZEV mandate. Manufacturers can choose to comply with either the California ZEV mandate beginning in model year 2005, or can opt into what is called the northeast states' ZEV Alternative Compliance Plan (ACP) in model year 2004, as explained in Table 3-9 below. In either case, manufacturers will be required to implement the full California ZEV mandate in model year 2007.88 Table 3-11 Model Year 2004 2005  Summary of Alternative Compliance Plan for ZEVs in New York and Massachusetts89 Type of Vehicle PZEVs PZEVs AT PZEVs or pure ZEVs PZEVs AT PZEVs pure ZEVs PZEVs Percentage Requirements 10% of all vehicle sales 9% of all vehicle sales 1% of all vehicle sales 7% of all vehicle sales 2% of all vehicle sales 1% of all vehicle sales 6% of all vehicle sales 2% of all vehicle sales 2% of all vehicle sales  2006  2007  AT PZEVs pure ZEVs  Any manufacturer opting to use the ACP will be required to submit a projected compliance report at the beginning of each model year.

More than ten states now have laws in place that provide tax incentives to individuals or businesses for the purchase of AFVs, including EVs. In addition to the California LEV II regulations, typical state regulations include the following (note, state abbreviations are provided for each applicable regulation below): 90 access to HOV lanes for HEVs, EVs, and other LEVs at any time, and regardless of the number of people occupying the vehicle (AZ, GA, UT, VA); exemptions for EVs from parking and other fees (HI); individual or business tax incentives, including tax credits or deductions, for the purchase of AFVs and LEVs, including EVs (AZ, GA, KS, LA, ME, MD, NY, OK, OR, UT, VA); individual or business tax incentives, including tax credits or deductions, for the construction of AFV and LEV fuel delivery systems (AZ, LA, RI, VA); tax incentives, including tax credits or deductions, for manufacturers of AFVs and LEVs (AK, MI); tax credits for each job created in manufacturing clean fuel vehicles or converting vehicles to operate on clean fuels (VA); exemption of state and/or local sales tax for the purchase of AFVs or AFV conversion equipment (AZ, NH, PA); adjustments to fuel taxes to reflect use of AFVs (HI); grants to businesses, individuals, local governments, and non-profit organizations towards the purchase of AFVs or AFV fleets (AZ, CA, PA); regulations to facilitate the commercialization of AFVs, including EVs and HEVs (NH); requirements for state and municipal fleets to acquire AFVs and LEVs, to convert fleets to AFVs, to meet specific clean fuel standards, or to develop AFV infrastructure (DC, LA, MA, MI, MO, NV, NH, NM, NY, OK); exemption for certain AFVs or LEVs from emissions inspections and other motor vehicle registration fees and requirements (AZ); regulations addressing clean fuel vehicle identification labels or decals (CA); exemptions from vehicle registration requirements for AFVs, including EVs, neighborhood electric vehicles (NEVs), and electric motor golf carts (AZ); permission for certain types of AFVs, such as electric scooters, to be ridden on public streets (CA); special requirements for public utilities to adopt and/or promote LEVs (CA); and research programs for the study of AFV technologies (SC, TN).  3.3  Relevant Domestic and International Climate Change Policy and Market Developments  U.S. and international climate change policy could have a dramatic influence on the development of EVs and HEVs and their expanded use throughout the world. Significant international attention has been given to the adoption of the Kyoto Protocol--the binding international framework for implementing specific actions to reduce a country's GHG emissions--by parties to the UNFCCC. Excluding the U.S., most parties to the UNFCCC have either ratified or have expressed commitments to ratify the Kyoto Protocol. However, in 2001, President Bush announced complete U.S. withdrawal from the Kyoto Protocol, instead offering that the U.S. would develop an alternative approach to reducing For a full list of States with related laws and regulations, and a description of each, see EVAA, State Laws and Regulations Impacting Electric Vehicles (January 2002), http://www.evaa.org. 90  28  3 Regulatory and Policy Frameworks   domestic GHG emissions. At the time of publication of this report, many of the details of that domestic policy are still under development, but generally include the following key components: a commitment to reduce GHG emissions intensity--the ratio of GHG emissions to economic output--by 18 percent over ten years; improvements to the U.S. national GHG emissions registry (reporting) program, known as the Voluntary Reporting of GHGs ""1605(b)"" Program (established under Section 1605(b) of EPAct), now implemented by the Energy Information Administration (EIA) in DOE; protection and provision of transferable credits for GHG emission reductions under a future climate change regime; and a commitment of financial and technical resources for the continued research of climate change and innovative new technologies to reduce GHG emissions.91 In addition to policy developments at the national level, a number of U.S. States and local communities have introduced various legislative initiatives to reduce GHG emissions. These initiatives often reach even further than the measures proposed by the Bush Administration. Most of the policies implemented to date, target the electricity sector by capping emissions from power plants (Massachusetts and New Hampshire) or by setting emissions standards for new facilities (Oregon).92 However, as described in Section 3.2.1, the State of California recently passed a bill to reduce GHG emissions from the transportation sector, mandating improved efficiency standards. This bill is the first policy initiative in the U.S. to directly influence GHG emissions from the transportation sector. As such, it is likely to have a significant impact on the direction of GHG policy initiatives in the rest of the country and on the future adoption of EVs and HEVs. With respect to GHG registries, a number of efforts are already under way that may contribute to the development of the national GHG emissions reporting program suggested by the President. In addition to the 1605(b) Program, the State of California recently established the California Climate Action Registry, an independent, non-profit organization dedicated to working with industries, power generators, governmental bodies, and others operating in the State of California to develop a systematic and effective GHG emissions reporting system. The newly formed reporting system is designed to include reporting for GHG emissions reductions from clean transportation, such as the adoption of EVs and HEVs in motor vehicle fleets, in addition to industrial combustion activities and electricity consumption. Various other State GHG emissions registries have also been proposed, as well as an alternate Federal registry under the new EPA Climate Leaders Program.93  President Announces Clear Skies & Global Climate Change Initiatives, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Silver Spring, Maryland, February 14, 2002), available at: http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2002/02/20020214-5.html. 92 On January 2, 2002, the New Hampshire House passed HB 284--the New Hampshire Clean Power Act. This multi-pollutant legislation affects six units at three different facilities and includes the following emission reduction requirements by 2006: a 75% reduction in SO2 (3.0 lb/MWh); a 70% reduction in NOX (1.5 lb/MWh); and, a 3% reduction in CO2 compared to 1990 levels. In April, 2001, Massachusetts passed a bill requiring the state's 6 highest emitting power plants to: 1) cap their CO2 emissions at historical levels, and 2) lower their emissions rate to 1,800 lb CO2/MWh by 2006 or 2008, with a goal of reducing total plant emissions by 10%. In 1997, the State of Oregon required all new power plants to comply with a CO2 emission standard, specifying that all new natural gas facilities must have an emissions rate that is at least 17% below the most efficient base load gas plant operating in the U.S. Power plants in all three states are allowed to purchase emission offsets from third-party entities to satisfy these requirements. 93 Id.  91  3 Regulatory and Policy Frameworks  29   With regard to federal support for technology research and development, increased funding levels could potentially lead to advances in HEV, EV, fuel cell, and related clean fuel technologies that help reduce GHG emissions from motor vehicles. The President's budget in FY2003 provides for $4.5 billion for global climate change-related activities, a $700 million increase over previous years.94 It is important to note that, in addition to these recent domestic policy activities, increased international activity to implement the Kyoto Protocol could be a potentially important driver for increased development and implementation of EVs and HEVs in overseas markets. This, in turn, could have meaningful effects on the relative availability and cost of EV and HEV products that can subsequently be used in the U.S.--particularly in States pursuing the California LEV II program. 3.3.1 Greenhouse Gas Registries and Reporting Programs  Over the last decade, various initiatives to register, document and promote voluntary GHG emission reduction measures have been introduced in the U.S. The goal of these programs is to encourage public and private entities to participate in GHG reduction activities and to test procedures for GHG emissions accounting. Each program afford individual project developers with the opportunity to register and document activities that help reduce GHG emissions and to possibly use the registered emission reductions for participation in a future emissions trading regime. The different programs range in scope and project type, and do not all include activities related to transportation. However, three U.S.-based voluntary programs encourage developers of transportation projects to report the environmental benefits of their activities and submit project ideas: DOE's 1605(b) Voluntary Reporting of Greenhouse Gases Program, the California Climate Action Registry, and the U.S. Initiative on Joint Implementation (USIJI). Each of these programs is described below. Appendix 3 also lists several new and proposed State initiatives to register GHG emission reductions, many of which are designed to encourage the development of GHG reduction measures such as the increased use of EVs and HEVs. U.S. Department of Energy's 1605(b) Voluntary Reporting of Greenhouse Gases Program Managed by DOE's EIA, the 1605(b) Voluntary Reporting of Greenhouse Gases Program (created under Section 1605(b) of EPAct) affords any company, organization, or individual with the opportunity to establish a public record of their GHG emissions, emission reductions, and/or sequestration achievements in a central and public database. The program first began accepting reports on GHG reduction activities during calendar year 1995 and is thus among the world's first registries set up to track voluntary GHG activities. Like other registries, 1605(b) lays the foundation for maintaining information about individual projects, and standardizing GHG emissions accounting methodologies, which in turn makes possible the creation of a market wherein GHG emission reduction credits can be traded. Participants generally participate in the program to gain recognition for environmental stewardship, demonstrate support for voluntary approaches to achieving environmental policy goals, support information exchange, and inform the general public about GHG reduction activities. If the participant has the emissions reductions certified by an independent third party entity, and the reductions meet the standards of a given emissions trading regime, then the participant may trade the certified credits within that regime and reap the financial benefits associated with the sale of those credits at market 94  Id.  30  3 Regulatory and Policy Frameworks   price. One example of such a regime, although still in its infancy, is the Chicago Climate Exchange, described in Section 3.3.2. Data from the most recent 1605(b) reporting cycle, covering activities through 2000, were released by EIA in February 2002 and include considerable information on real-world transportation projects. Of the 72 transportation projects reported to the program, fifteen were EV projects involving emissions reductions of roughly 3,923 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2E). Appendix 4 presents summary information on these projects, including the entities that undertook and reported the project, the name, scope and general description of each project, and the methods used to estimate the achieved GHG emission reductions. The data reported to the program is publicly available on DOE's website and may be useful for educational and project replication purposes.95 For more information, contact the 1605(b) Program Communications Center at: 1-800-803-5182 or visit http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/1605/frntvrgg.html. The 1605(b) program will likely receive increased attention in the future, as the Bush Administration is redesigning and grooming it to be the main national system for tracking emissions and emission reduction activities, and perhaps establishing credits. Thus, the standards and methodologies that it establishes may become the default national standard that other registries and reporting programs, such as those mentioned below, will derive from and comply with it. California Climate Action Registry As established under State Senate Bill 1771, the State of California chartered in September, 2002, the California Climate Action Registry--a non-profit organization providing a central and standardized system for reporting annual GHG emissions reductions, including those reductions from motor vehicle activities. In return for voluntary registration of GHG emissions, the Registry promises to use its best efforts to ensure that participating organizations receive appropriate consideration under any future international, federal, or state regulatory regimes relating to GHG emissions.96 Given the steps, described in Section 3.2.1, that California is taking to address vehicular GHG emissions, the registry may gain increased prominence for transportation related activities. For example, the bill directs the California Climate Action Registry to develop procedures for reporting and registering vehicular GHG reductions to the Registry. In contrast to the 1605(b) program, entities participating in the California Registry have to report on all their emissions and emission reductions. At this point in time, the Registry does not accept reports that only include project-specific activities. Companies that wish to report on their transportation-related activities therefore also have to complete an inventory of company-wide emissions before submitting a report to the Registry.

U.S. Initiative on Joint Implementation (USIJI) The U.S. Initiative on Joint Implementation (USIJI) is designated as the official U.S. Government institution accepting jointly implemented GHG emission reduction projects  See http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/1605/frntvrgg.html for more information. California Energy Commission, Global Climate Change & California, http://www.energy.ca.gov/global_climate_change/index.html. 96  95  3 Regulatory and Policy Frameworks  31   as part of the UNFCCC AIJ Pilot Phase.97 A key goal of the USIJI program is to influence the technological choices associated with the already substantial private capital flows to developing countries. Any U.S. private sector firm, non-governmental organization, government agency, or individual is eligible to submit a project proposal to USIJI,98 including developers of EV and HEV projects. The application criteria for participating in USIJI are outlined in Appendix 5. Proposals must be submitted in partnership with foreign host country participants, including any citizen or entity recognized by a host country, which has signed, ratified or acceded to the UNFCCC. To date, the USIJI has approved 50 projects in 26 countries,99 and while no transportation projects have been approved, representatives of the program have indicated a particular interest in receiving projects that involve emission reductions from this sector. At the time of writing this report, the status of USIJI has been put on hold pending a U.S. government review of how it fits within the Administration's overall climate change strategy. 3.3.2 Emerging Markets for Trading in GHG Credits  Another development, that is likely to have a significant impact on the development of GHG-related transportation projects and the increased market penetration of EVs and HEVs,is the emergence of a new market for trading in GHG emission reduction credits. Though few governments have imposed binding restrictions on GHG emissions, many companies have already begun exploring the benefits and challenges of GHG trading.100 Even without government-imposed restrictions, emission reduction credits still have market value as long as there is a demand for the purchase of these credits. This demand exists and is steadily increasing, driven in part by the anticipation of one or more regulatory regimes, and by the desire to earn a reputation as an environmentally conscious entity. As a result, a small but growing market for the sale and transfer of credits based on GHG reduction activities has evolved over the past few years. As this market continues to grow, opportunities for selling and trading credits derived from GHG reduction activities in the transportation sector will also increase. Potential GHG reduction opportunities that could be generated and sold for credit on the GHG market include projects promoting the use of cleaner vehicle options, such as EVs and HEVs. Trading activities have evolved in concert with a series of project-based mechanisms set up to gain experience and explore ways to address the climate change issue costeffectively. These programs and initiatives include USIJI; Ontario, Canada's multiThe UNFCCC introduced the concept of joint implementation (JI), which refers to arrangements through which an entity in one country partially meets its domestic commitment to reduce GHG levels by financing and supporting the development of a project in another country. To test the concept of JI, the Activities Implemented Jointly (AIJ) Pilot Phase was established at the first Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC (COP-1), held in Berlin in 1995. Projects initiated during this phase were called ""activities implemented jointly"" to distinguish them from the fullyfledged JI projects the Convention may allow in the future. The goal of the AIJ Pilot Phase was to provide developing nations with advanced technologies and financial investment while allowing industrialized nations to fulfill part of their reduction commitment at the lowest cost. Because of the temporary pilot status of this program, it was decided that project developers cannot receive credit or other monetary incentives for projects developed and approved as part of this initiative. 98 For further information on the USIJI program and project criteria, contact USIJI, 1000 Independence Avenue SW, Washington DC 20585, USA.

The European Union is developing the rules for an EU-wide GHG trading program, which is expected to enter into operation in 2005. 97  32  3 Regulatory and Policy Frameworks   stakeholder Pilot Emissions Reduction program (PERT); [not a trading or credit program] the Dutch government's Emission Reduction Unit Procurement Tender (ERUPT); and the World Bank's Prototype Carbon Fund (PCF). Since there is no central recording entity for tracking GHG emissions trades, the actual size of the market is not fully known. However, it is estimated that approximately 65 inter-company transactions have occurred since 1996, involving roughly 50 to 70 million metric tons of CO2E emissions reductions.101 This number may be conservative as several companies are reluctant to make their trading activities public. The price of these trades has ranged between $0.60 and $3.50 per metric ton of CO2E. Most of these trades have been between buyers and sellers in Europe and North America. The majority of these trades have been verified by third party, independent entities. The most popular trading activities have included fugitive gas capture from landfills, fuel switching, energy efficiency, and co-generation.102 None of the trades have involved reductions from transportation activities, highlighting the lack of experience with generating project-based GHG emission reductions in the transportation sector. However, as it is fairly straightforward to monitor and demonstrate ownership for this type of reductions it is likely that the types of activities traded will expand to include emission reductions from transport projects. Chicago Climate Exchange The Chicago Climate Exchange is emerging as one of the key organizations for helping to generate a viable trading market for GHG emissions reduction credits. In June 2001, 33 companies with assets in the midwestern United States (including the Ford Motor Company) announced the formation of the Chicago Climate Exchange (CCX). Led by Environmental Financial Products and the Kellogg Graduate School of Management at Northwestern University, under a grant from the Joyce Foundation, the group will explore the potential for a regional GHG trading exchange in order to achieve a specified level of emission reductions. The companies have indicated in letters to CCX that they will consider trading on the exchange if effective rules are designed. The CCX has proposed that participating companies voluntarily commit to emissions reductions and trading in six GHGs.103 Participants would commit to reducing their GHG emissions by 2 percent below 1999 levels by 2002 and reduce them 1 percent annually thereafter. Credits would be given for domestic and international emissions offsets projects after particular monitoring, verification, tracking and reporting requirements have been fulfilled. Potential emission reduction activities that could receive credit under the Chicago Climate Exchange include projects that reduce emissions from the transportation sector. Sample project types suggested by the CCX include fuel switching and vehicle efficiency improvement projects. The CCX hopes to have the exchange up and running by the third quarter of 2002 for participants in seven states: Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, and Wisconsin. In 2003, the CCX aims to have commitments and trading among participants in the entire United States, Mexico and Canada, and to expand the exchange to include international participants in 2004. 101  Richard Rosenzweig, Matthew Varilek, Ben Feldman, Radha Kuppalli, and Josef Jansen.

The following subsections provide an overview of the issues related to estimating and reporting on the potential GHG emission reductions achieved by replacing conventional internal combustion engine vehicles with EVs or HEVs. This section first discusses the types of domestic and international transportation-related GHG reduction projects that have been undertaken and for which data has been reported. Next is a discussion of the types and sources of GHG emissions associated with both EVs and HEVs, followed by an overview of some of the studies and models that may be helpful for estimating emission reductions from vehicle projects. Finally, this section briefly summarizes the most common rules and procedures for estimating and reporting on GHG emission reduction activities under project-based GHG mitigation programs.  4.2  Projects Deploying EV and HEV Technologies to Reduce GHG Emissions  There are five main types of activities that can be undertaken to reduce GHG emissions in the transportation sector. These include: Changing vehicle fuel type: sample activities include switching from gasoline/diesel to biodiesel, natural gas, electric batteries, fuel cells, and other alternative fuels; Changing vehicle fuel efficiency: for example, improving fuel economy, traffic management/infrastructure changes and/or vehicle scrappage programs; Mode switching to less GHG-intensive transportation options: increased public transportation, light rail systems, etc.; Reducing transportation activity: this could involve improved transit systems, road pricing, or telecommuting; and Increasing vehicle occupancy rate: activities may include car sharing, telematic systems for freight, or subsidized public transport. Each option focuses on different ways to reduce emissions, ranging from behavioral changes to direct substitution of transport technologies. Hence, the procedures for estimating and accounting for emission reductions are different for each of the five activity types. For the individual electric and hybrid electric vehicle project developer, the first option is the most relevant, as it refers to activities that can be undertaken directly by the individual fleet manager. For example, by replacing a fleet of one hundred gasoline-powered vehicles with one hundred electric battery-powered vehicles, a fleet manager can reduce GHG emissions by using a less GHG intensive fuel. The other four transportation activity  4 GHG Emissions  35   types would mostly involve behavioral or regulatory changes that would likely be implemented by public authorities, automobile manufacturers, or private companies seeking to reduce the transport activities of their employees. Because this guide is targeted towards GHG reduction projects involving the deployment of electric and hybrid electric vehicles by individual fleet managers, we will focus on estimating emissions from vehicle technology and/or fuel switching projects. There is little international experience with developing and implementing vehicle fuel switching projects specifically with the purpose of reducing GHG emissions.104 Of the 157 projects registered with the UNFCCC Secretariat as AIJ pilot projects, only one takes place in the transportation sector.105 This project, known as the RABA/IKARUS Compressed Natural Gas Engine Bus project, is funded by Dutch investors and hosted in Hungary. The project involves the development and testing of a new compressed CNG engine to be installed by the companies of RABA and Ikarus in new buses.106 No EV or HEV projects have been reported to the UNFCCC Secretariat. In the U.S., the number of voluntary actions to reduce GHG emissions in the transportation sector is also low. In 2000, there were 72 transportation related GHG emissions reduction projects reported to the DOE Voluntary Reporting of Greenhouse Gases Program--a small number compared to the 462 electricity generation, transmission, and distribution projects reported for the same year.107 Nearly half (31) of these transportation projects involved AFVs and 15 involved the use of EVs. The AFV project developers reported an average estimated emissions reduction of 505 metric tons of CO2E per project for 2000. (A more detailed description of these projects is provided in Appendix 4.) Concerned with the lack of transportation sector projects, national joint implementation offices have been promoting their development. For example, DOE issued a grant in the fall of 2000 to the Washington D.C.-based Center for Sustainable Development in the Americas (CSDA) to create an AIJ project using natural gas vehicles in Santiago, Chile.  4.3  GHG Emissions Associated with EVs and HEVs  The GHGs most closely identified with the transportation sector include CO2, N2O, and CH4. Each GHG contributes differently to global warming, and this difference can be expressed by the global warming potential (GWP) of each gas. The GWP of a GHG is the degree to which that gas will enhance the overall effect of global warming. It is a function of the gas' direct or indirect radiative forcing potential (or how well the gas transmits visible radiation and traps infrared radiation). GWP is expressed in relative terms, with CO2 as the base, for a given period of time. The Table 4-1 Global Warming Potentials concept of GWP allows us to of Selected GHGs compare the emissions of different GHGs, such as CH4 Greenhouse Global Warming Potential (100 and N2O, using a common unit: Years) Gas kg of CO2-equivalent (CO2-E).

In the case of EVs and HEVs, CO2 is the major GHG emitted. Both hybrid and battery-powered electric vehicles can result in considerable GHG emission reductions compared to conventional petroleum-fueled vehicles. However, the associated emission reductions vary, depending on the power generation mix used to charge the electric batteries and the fuel type used for fueling the hybrid vehicle. Because vehicle efficiency of EVs and HEVs is determined by several factors, including fuel type and propulsion system, no single value for potential emission reductions can be provided. Emission estimates will have to be determined for each vehicle model and fuel type used.

GHG emissions are the sum of emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O, weighted by their GWPs, but, as Figure 4-1 illustrates, with the exception of ethanol and natural gas vehicles, CO2 accounts for nearly all of the vehicles GHG emissions. The HEV options examined include grid-independent (GI) HEVs fueled with California gasoline (RFG2), gridindependent HEVs fueled by clean diesel, and grid-connected HEVs powered by a California electricity mix. Grid-independent HEVs use the engine to recharge their batteries while grid-connected vehicles are required to be plugged into a stationary power Argonne National Laboratory.

To complement Figure 4-1, which shows GHG reductions as a percentage decrease compared to conventional gasoline vehicles, Table 4-2 lists typical CO2 emissions associated with EVs and HEVs, as well as three conventional vehicles. It should be emphasized that the information presented in Table 4-2 are directly proportional to several factors that may have a wide degree of variation (such as vehicle efficiency and electricity fuel mix), and are therefore presented only to provide a relative order of magnitude.

In Figure 4-1 above, the emission estimates are calculated based on the electric generation mix of California (CA), Northeast U.S. (NE US) and the national U.S. mix. The largest reductions occur for EVs with the California electric generation mix, where 48 percent of electricity is produced from hydropower plants. A more detailed discussion of the emissions from EVs and HEVs is provided in the following sections. In general, EVs and HEVs reduce GHG emissions by more than 40 percent, mainly because of their efficiency gains. 4.3.1 GHG Emissions From EVs use batteries as the sole source of power generation, the and estimating GHG benefits of EVs is different from hybrid vehicles. Battery-powered electric vehicles have no tailpipe local air pollutants, but there are emissions associated with  Because electric vehicles procedures for measuring electric and conventional emissions of GHGs and  38  4 GHG Emissions   generating electricity for battery recharging. There are also some emissions associated with producing and scrapping the batteries. However, these emissions represent a small share relative to the total. Figure 4-2 shows that more than 90 percent of the GHGs emitted from EVs come from the process of producing, transporting, and storing fuel. The remaining GHG emissions are emitted during the feedstock-related stage, which includes feedstock recovery, transportation, and storage. No GHG emissions are associated with the vehicle operation stage, covering vehicle refueling and operations. Figure 4-3 is included for comparison, showing the share of fuel-cycle energy use and emissions of conventional gasoline vehicles by stage. Figure 4-3 shows that more than 80 percent of GHGs emitted from gasoline vehicles come from vehicle operation. Another 15 percent is emitted during the fuel production, transport, and storage stages.

Depending on the power generation mix in use for the area where an electric vehicle is recharged, the overall emissions can be much less than those from conventional gasoline vehicles. If the battery of the electric vehicle is recharged in a region with a very coal intensive electricity generation mix, GHG emissions will be higher than if the battery is recharged with electricity from mainly renewable or natural gas-based electricity. EVs may have nearly zero total emissions when recharged with electricity generated by nuclear power or renewable sources. As illustrated in Figure 4-1 above, EVs recharged in California result in much lower emissions than EVs recharged in Northeastern U.S. The GHG benefits of California vehicles are even higher if compared with EVs recharged with electricity similar to the U.S. average fuel mix.  Argonne National Laboratory. GREET 1.5--Transportation Fuel-Cycle Model. Volume 1: Methodology, Development, Use and Results. August 1999. The model assumes that the batteries are recharged with an average U.S. electric generation mix, under which 54 percent of electricity is generated from coal.  109  4 GHG Emissions  G H  V  P  Gs  39   Figure 4-3  Shares of Fuel-Cycle Energy Use and Emissions by Stage: Conventional Gasoline Vehicles110 Contr ibution of Each Stag e : Conv .

To assist project developers in the US with estimating emission benefits of GHG reduction activities, EIA has developed state average electricity emission factors that can be used to determine region-specific CO2 emissions per unit electricity used.111 (Specific emissions factors for each state and major city are listed in Appendix 6.) The EIA electricity emission factors were developed to provide reporters to the EIA 1605(b) Voluntary Reporting of Greenhouse Gases program with a means to convert their energy savings estimates into emission reduction estimates. Essentially, CO2 emissions for all utility power plants over a three-year period were summed across all plants and then divided by the total generation of the plants to yield state-wide average emission factors.112 Project developers who wish to use more localized electricity emission factors--either for the purpose of higher accuracy or because they are located outside the US--should contact the local utility to obtain information on the electricity mix in the area where the EVs will be recharged. This information can then be used to derive local electricity emission factors (specified, e.g., in pounds of greenhouse gas (gas) per kWh), according to the following basic equation: EEF =  [ (FCi) (FFEFi) ] / G i=1  Tot  n  t  where: EEF FCi 110 111  = electricity emission factor (pounds gas per kWh) = total fuel consumed of type i (kcal, Btus or J)  Id.

However, these considerations do not affect the basic functional form of the equation, or the appropriate values for the fossil fuel emission factors.113 Generally recognized fossil fuel emission factors, such as have been developed by IPCC and other recognized bodies, can applied in the above equation. The fossil fuel emission coefficients used by the EIA 1605(b) Voluntary Reporting Program are listed in Appendix 7 of this report. Once local- or state-wide emission factors have been derived--typically expressed in terms of lbs of CO2E per kWh--the vehicle owner can then determine emissions of an individual vehicle type by multiplying the vehicle efficiency (kWh/mile) by the emission factor (lbs of CO2E per kWh). After emissions per distance traveled have been established for the electric vehicle, a comparison can be made with the emissions per distance traveled of a conventional gasoline vehicle to determine the actual emission reductions attributable to the EVs. The emission factor for gasoline, listed in Appendix 7, is estimated at 19.564 lbs of CO2 per gallon. 4.3.2 GHG Emissions From HEVs  HEVs run on conventional fuels, and thus the vast majority of their GHGs are emitted from the tailpipe during vehicle operation, as is the case with conventional vehicles. Figure 4-4, above, shows the share of GHG emissions during each stage of the HEV fuel use cycle, using grid-independent HEVs fueled by gasoline.114 The figure illustrates that at least 80 percent of GHGs emitted are released during the vehicle operation stage. Similar to the case with gasoline vehicles, another 15 percent of GHGs are emitted during the fuel production, transport, and storage stages. Advanced HEVs, such as fuel cell vehicles using hydrogen, are like EVs in that some or all of their GHG emissions may be produced during the fuel production and distribution stages.  4.4  Studies and Measurements of GHG Emission Benefits of EVs and HEVs  As GHGs are only regulated in a few countries, only a limited number of studies and publicly available resources are available to offer assistance in estimating GHG emissions from vehicles. The following summaries provide an overview of the major information sources on emissions benefits from EVs and HEVs.  In the above equation, the fuel consumption and fossil fuel emission factors should always be expressed in energy units (calories, Btus, or joules) rather than physical units (e.g., tons, barrels, or cubic feet). As long as this basic rule is followed, the uncertainty surrounding the fossil fuel emission factors will be minimized because within any given fuel type, the variability in the relationship between heat content and carbon content is very limited. In general, the heat content of a given fuel depends primarily on the fuel's carbon content. There are other chemical components of fuels that also contribute to the fuel's heat content including sulfur and, most notably, hydrogen. However, these other chemical constituents tend to represent only a small fraction of the fuel's chemical makeup relative to carbon. Hence the variations in the ratio of carbon to heat content, for a given type of fuel, are likewise small. And since a fuel emission factor is simply the ratio of the fuel's carbon to heat content, the uncertainty range surrounding the factor is small. 114 Argonne National Laboratory.

The GREET model was developed by the Argonne National Laboratory to make calculations of the GHG emissions of light duty conventional vehicles and alternative fueled vehicles in the U.S. All the GHG emissions from vehicle use and upstream from fuel production, are included. Three GHGs (CO2, N2O and CH4) are combined with their GWPs to calculate CO2-E GHG emissions. GREET also evaluates criteria pollutant emissions, and compares fuel efficiency and emissions for EVs and HEVs relative to conventional gasoline vehicles. Users are able to change the default values to accommodate their specific situation. The GREET model is free of charge and can be downloaded from http://www.transportation.anl.gov/ttrdc/greet. It should be emphasized that the model is based on U.S. conditions and energy infrastructure. Users from other countries should be careful to adopt model inputs, which are relevant to country-specific conditions. These should include country-specific assumptions regarding fuel use and GHG emissions during the production, refining, and transportation of fuels and the national electricity mix used for electricity generation.  115 Argonne National Laboratory. August 1999. Total GHG emissions also include fuel recovery, production, and distribution to the vehicle. However, the emissions associated with these steps are relatively small compared to the emissions emitted during operation of the vehicle.  42  Pe  4 GHG Emissions   4.4.2  Canada's Transportation Climate Change Table  In May 1998, Canada's federal, provincial, and territorial Ministers of Transportation established the Transportation Climate Change Table as part of the national process to develop a climate change strategy.116 The Table was comprised of transportation sector experts from a broad cross-section of business and industry, government, environmental groups and non-governmental organizations. It was mandated to identify specific measures to mitigate GHG emissions from Canada's transport sector. The Transportation Climate Change Table submitted its Options Paper, ""Transportation and Climate Change: Options for Action"" to the Ministers of Transportation and the National Climate Change Secretariat in November 1999. The Options Paper assesses the costs, benefits and impacts of over 100 measures. The Transportation Table undertook 24 studies in support of the Options Paper. As part of one of these studies, several alternatives to gasoline, including EVs, were compared for their potential for reductions in GHG emissions.117 Table 4-3 summarizes the findings regarding the relative energy efficiency, GHG emissions, and costs of alternative fuels. As can be seen from the ""Net GHG Ratio"" column of Table 4-3, EVs emit considerably fewer GHGs than conventional vehicles. However, review of the information provided in the study indicates that the GHG benefits projected for EVs are based on the assumption that relatively little of the electricity is generated from the combustion of fossil fuels, as is typically the case in Canada. This assumption may not be appropriate for most areas in the U.S. As illustrated in Appendix 6, some U.S. states are heavily reliant on coal for their electricity generation. Hence, in some areas of the U.S., the GHG benefits could be less dramatic depending on the fuel mix of the particular state in question. The second column of the table is labeled ""Relative Vehicle Efficiency"". The values in the column represent the distance traveled per BTU of fuel consumed for each fuel relative to gasoline. The third column of the table, labeled ""Upstream GHG Ratio,"" shows estimates of how the GHG emissions associated with production of alternative fuels and alternatively fueled vehicles compare to gasoline and gasoline-fueled vehicles. In the case of EVs, GHG emissions from the upstream process is higher (1.08) than the emissions from conventional gasoline vehicles (1.00). This is because most of the emissions from EVs are produced during the production of electricity for the batteries, whereas emissions from gasoline vehicles are emitted during operation of the vehicle itself and are therefore not included in this column. The fourth column of Table 4-2 is labeled ""Net GHG Ratio"", reflecting the combined effects of ""upstream"" GHG emissions differences and changes in GHG emissions per unit distance of vehicle travel. Once both vehicle operation (tail pipe emissions) and upstream processes are combined, EVs are shown to emit far fewer GHGs (0.30) than conventional gasoline vehicles (1.00) (with the assumed electricity producing fuel mix). The fifth column of Table 4-3 is labeled ""Gasoline Equivalent Fuel Cost"" and represents the relative price of the alternative fuel per unit of energy. The sixth and seventh columns in Table 4-3 contain the ""Vehicle Price Change"" for 2010 and 2020. These columns show the change in Retail Price Equivalent  116 For more information on Canada's Transportation Climate Change Table visit the website at: http://www.tc.gc.ca/envaffairs/english/climatechange/ttable/ or email: TCCTable@tc.gc.ca. 117 Alternative and Future Fuels and Energy Sources For Road Vehicles.

The EPA also has a model (MOBILE6), which allows fleets to calculate the emissions reductions they can expect in real-world operation when using AFVs. MOBILE6 is a computer program that estimates HC, CO, and NOX emission factors for gasoline and diesel fueled highway motor vehicles, as well as for AFVs such as natural gas and electric vehicles that may be used to replace them. MOBILE6 calculates emission factors for 28 individual vehicle types in low- and high-altitude regions of the United States. MOBILE6 emission factor estimates depend on various conditions, such as ambient temperatures, travel speeds, operating modes, fuel volatility, and mileage accrual rates. Many of the variables affecting vehicle emissions can be specified by the The RPE is defined as the average ""retail manufacturer to remain economically viable over fixed costs (e.g., engineering, facilities, tooling), labor), manufacturer markup (to cover overhead a described as follows: RPE = ((Fixed Cost/Unit Markup. 119 118  price equivalent"" that must be achieved for the the longer term.

MOBILE6 will estimate emission factors for any calendar year between 1952 and 2050, inclusive. Vehicles from the 25 most recent model years are assumed to be in operation in each calendar year by MOBILE6. Some states, such as California, have similar software which are specific to their unique climate and driving characteristics. Estimates of emissions reductions are often needed for AFV owners to apply for and receive grants from incentive programs. EPA is undertaking an effort to develop the next generation of modeling tools for the estimation of emissions produced by on- and off-road mobile sources, which includes the New Generation Model. The design of this modeling system is guided by four broad objectives: (a) the model should encompass all pollutants (including HC, CO, NOX, PM, air toxics, and GHGs) and all mobile sources at the levels of resolution needed for the diverse applications of the system; (b) the model should be developed according to principles of sound science; (c) the software design should be efficient and flexible; and (d) the model should be implemented in a coordinated, clear, and consistent manner. EPA views the New Generation Model as a logical next step in the continuing effort to improve mobile source emissions models to keep pace with new analysis needs, new modeling approaches, and new data.  4.5  Procedures for Estimating GHG Emissions Benefits from EV and HEV Projects  During the past decade, a series of project-based programs have been introduced to gain experience and harness the power of markets in order to address the issue of climate change in a cost-effective manner. Each of these programs is governed by a unique set of rules. However, they exhibit some common elements that constitute a de facto (though non-binding) set of minimum quality criteria that govern the creation of credible emission reductions. Leading examples of these programs and initiatives include USIJI; the AIJ Pilot Phase, Canada's Pilot Emissions Reduction Trading Program (PERT) in Ontario; Oregon's Climate Trust; the Emission Reduction Unit Procurement Tender (ERUPT) of the Dutch government; and the World Bank Prototype Carbon Fund (PCF). The following rules and procedures are common elements of project-based systems. They provide a framework for project developers interested in developing GHG reduction projects. 4.5.1 GHG Emissions Baseline  The emissions baseline is an integral part of the GHG reduction project proposal as the baseline is used to estimate emissions benefits of the project and will be used as the basis for awarding credits to the project. Many project-based programs measure emission reductions by comparing the emissions performance of a credible ""without project"" baseline against the ""with project"" emissions.  4 GHG Emissions  45   Figure 4-5  Sample Project A--Static Baseline Project A: 1) Static baseline 2) Real project emission reductions  Emissions (tons/year)  Historic Emissions  Emissions W ithout Project Net Project Benefits Emissions W ith Project  Project Start Date  Time (years)  The baseline typically refers to the process of developing an understanding of the ""without project"" emissions performance scenario--either static or dynamic--which can then be used for comparison with the emissions of the project. The challenge of developing emission baselines stems from the problem of projecting what will happen in a given economy 10, 20, or 30 years down the line. Static baselines rely on historical information to fix emissions at a set level, such as an entity or project's physical emissions in a given year. This same emissions level is then maintained every year throughout the life of the project. An example of a static emission baseline is provided in Figure 4-5. Dynamic baselines are emission baselines that try to take into account changes that are likely or expected to happen during the life of the project. As such, dynamic baselines are linked to particular variables and may be revised upward and downward depending on project and entity characteristics such as output levels, growth rates, efficiency rates, and peer group benchmarks. For example, changes that could happen include future laws mandating use of a similar technology or fuel option, increased demand for transportation leading to increased vehicle usage, expected commercialization of a similar vehicle type, and so on. If such changes are taken into account, it will no longer be sufficient to use historical data for deriving the ""without project"" scenario, and some assumptions and adjustments regarding emissions levels in future years will have to be made. Figure 4-6 illustrates what a dynamic baseline might look like. It should be noted that dynamic baselines do not always involve an increase in emissions. In some cases, a general adoption of cleaner and more efficient technologies may lead to lower emissions in the ""without project"" scenario. In this case, the dynamic baseline would have a downward sloping curve and credits would only be awarded to projects that improve the emissions performance even further. Regardless of which baseline scenario is selected, project developers must be careful to describe all assumptions used and explain exactly why a particular methodology is utilized.  46  4 GHG Emissions   Figure 4-6  Sample Project B--Dynamic Baseline Project B: 1) Dynamic baseline 2) Real project emission reductions Emissions W ithout Project  Emissions (tons/year)  Historic Emissions Net Project Benefits  Emissions W ith Project  Project Start Date  Time (years)  Once the baseline has been determined, the estimate of emissions ""with the project"" can be developed. To determine project emissions the same assumptions and time frames used for the ""without project"" baseline should be applied. Most project cases lead to real emission reductions. However, as illustrated in Figure 4-7, it is sometimes possible that emissions ""with the project"" will continue to rise above historical emissions. Such projects may still be able to obtain GHG reduction credits, as long as the reported project emissions performance continues to fall below the emissions associated with the baseline scenario.

To date, no GHG crediting program has developed specific guidance for estimating GHG benefits from vehicle projects. However, some useful indicators for how to calculate emissions can be derived from the WRI/WBCSD Greenhouse Gas Protocol Initiative, which is a multi-stakeholder initiative between industry, government, and nongovernmental organizations, to develop generally accepted accounting practices for measuring and reporting corporate GHG emissions.120 The resulting standard and guidance are supplemented by a number of user-friendly GHG calculation tools, which can be accessed on the GHG Protocol website (www.ghgprotocol.org).121 Although the GHG Protocol focuses on corporate emissions, the proposed accounting standards and reporting instructions serve as an indicator of how project-specific emission reductions could be calculated.122 According to the GHG protocol, there are two general methodologies for calculating emissions from vehicle projects: fuel-based and distance-based.123 The preferred method, known as the ""fuel-based"" approach, is based on previously aggregated fuel consumption data to determine emissions. Following this approach, fuel consumption is multiplied by the CO2 emission factor for each fuel type in order to derive CO2 emissions. The fuel emission factor is developed based on the fuel's heat content, the fraction of carbon in the fuel that is oxidized, and the carbon content coefficient. To calculate emissions the following equation should be used: CO2 Emissions = Fuel Used x Heating Value x Emission Factor  In the case that project developers do not have access to site-specific information, default emission factors and heating values for different transportation fuels are listed in the guidance for using the GHG Reporting Protocol. Fuel use data can be obtained from several different sources including fuel receipts, financial records on fuel expenditures, or direct measurements of fuel use. If specific information on fuel consumption is not available, information on vehicle activity data (i.e. distance traveled) and fuel economy factors (such as miles per gallon) can be used to calculate fuel consumption, using the following equation: The Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard. WRI/WBCSD. Washington, D.C. 2000. Under the GHG Protocol, corporate transportation emissions take the form of either direct or indirect emissions. Direct emissions refer to emissions that are associated with owned or controlled sources, such as company owned vehicle fleets and corporate aircraft. Indirect emissions refer to all other company-related emissions, including employee commuting, short-term vehicle rentals, and upstream/downstream transportation emissions. If companies purchase electricity for owned or operated EVs, the related emissions should be reported as indirect emissions and should use guidance developed in the `Stationary Combustion Tool' for calculating emissions. For all other vehicles, including HEVs, companies should use the methodologies developed for calculating direct emissions from mobile sources. 121 Only transportation-related CO2 emission estimates are included in this tool. According to the GHG Protocol, accounting for N2O and CH4 emissions is optional at the discretion of the user. This is because N2O and CH4 emissions comprise a relatively small proportion of overall transportation emissions. 122 The WRI/WBCSD is also in the process of developing a GHG project accounting model with the aim of developing general guidance for emission reduction and land use, land-use change and forestry projects. This module will include accounting procedures for transportation projects. 123 ""Calculating CO2 Emissions from Mobile Sources"" WRI/WBCSD GHG Protocol Initiative. www.GHGprotocol.org. 120  48  4 GHG Emissions   Fuel Use = Distance x Fuel Economy Factor  The GHG Protocol also includes default fuel economy factors for different types of mobile sources and activity data. The second methodology, the ""distance-based"" approach, should only be used in case information on fuel use cannot be obtained. In the distance-based method, emissions are calculated by using distance based emission factors to calculate emissions. Activity data could be expressed in terms of vehicle-kilometers (or miles) traveled, passengerkilometers (or miles), and so on. This information is then multiplied by a default distancebased emission factor124 according to the following equation: CO2 Emissions = Distance Traveled x Distance-Based Emission Factor  Default distance-based emission factors are provided in the guidance for the GHG Protocol. The distance-based approach is less accurate than the fuel-based approach, and is thus recommended as the last resort for corporate GHG accounting purposes. As accuracy is an extremely important issue in terms of developing and crediting GHG reduction projects, the fuel-based approach is also the preferred approach for project-specific GHG reduction activities. 4.5.2 Environmental Additionality  The requirement of environmental additionality is linked closely to the process of developing the GHG emissions baseline. The concept of environmental additionality refers to the notion that the emission reductions achieved by the project must be proven not to have occurred in the absence of the project. That is, it is important that the credits awarded to the project developers must stem from emission reduction activities undertaken in addition to the business-as-usual scenario. Otherwise, the credits claimed from the project will not result in true, long-term environmental benefits, and the project developers will be awarded credits for emission reductions that never really took place. Hence, a major part of the additionality criterion involves proving that emission reductions were not a result of general technology improvements or activities undertaken to comply with existing regulations. To be credible, baselines should therefore take into account any laws, regulations, or technology improvements that may have a direct or indirect impact on GHG emissions. In the case of EVs, the question of additionality is pretty straightforward due to the general lack of EV market penetration and limited prospects for increased market penetration in the near future. Because of the limited use of EVs, it is pretty safe to argue that the purchase of such vehicles would not have happened without the specific EV project in question--unless of course the purchase of such vehicles were mandated by an existing law or regulation. However, in the case of HEVs it becomes a little more tricky to argue for the additionality of a potential HEV project. In some countries, such as Japan and the U.S., HEVs have reached a very limited market penetration. In these countries, the existing level of market penetration should be accounted for in the ""without 124 A sample default distance-based emission factor could be 0.28 kg CO2 per mile traveled for a small petrol car with no more than a 1.4 liter engine.

Switching to electric vehicles is a good example of a project type with potential for leakage. If the boundary of the project is limited to an analysis of tailpipe emissions alone, the emissions will be reduced to zero, when in fact significant emissions may be produced at the power plant in the generation of the electricity for powering the electric vehicle. These power plant emissions would have ""leaked"" from the accounting system. 4.5.4 Monitoring and Verification  Another common requirement is that project developers develop a plan or procedures for how emission reductions are monitored throughout the life of the project. The measured reductions must then be verified by an independent third party, who certifies that monitored reductions and/or the proposed method for calculating emissions performance can be or has been audited to provide a credible quantitative assessment of actual project performance. Both the monitoring and verification requirements involve guidelines for validating and verifying that no leakage will take place and that the GHG emissions baseline is estimated correctly (i.e. that the reductions meet the environmental additionality requirement). 4.5.5 Ownership  Finally, most programs require that the project proponent has a legitimate claim to ownership of the reductions generated by the project and that other potential claimants are identified. Ownership can be demonstrated through documents certifying and dividing ownership clearly among all project participants. If necessary, supporting documents by local or national government authorities can be included to verify the validity of claimed ownership. The issue of ownership is an important consideration for transportation projects. In many countries, buses and taxis are owned by individual vehicle operators rather than one single fleet operator. When the ownership of a transportation project covering 200 vehicles is divided among a similar number of owners, contractual and other issues may become very complicated. One solution may be to form an association representing all the vehicle owners, which could then be listed as the owner of the project.  50  4 GHG Emissions   5  Case Study on Quantifying GHG Emissions from Battery-Powered Electric Vehicles  5.1  Introduction  The following case study is based on a hypothetical project that involves the deployment of 125 electric battery charged taxis to replace 125 gasoline-fueled taxis. The case study focuses on the process of developing an emissions baseline and estimating net GHG emission benefits of an individual project. The following subsections provide a brief summary of the project case study, outline the general criteria for developing a GHG reduction project based on current market-based proposals for GHG control, develop the project based on these criteria, and estimate the emissions baseline and net project benefits. Three sample baseline scenarios are provided to illustrate how different project characteristics may influence the baseline estimate. The three baselines include: (1) a static baseline assuming that the 125 new electric vehicles are purchased instead of 125 new conventional gasoline powered vehicles; (2) a dynamic baseline assuming that the 125 new electric vehicles will replace 125 aging conventional gasoline vehicles with an estimated average life time of eight years; and (3) a static full fuel cycle baseline, including fuel production and refining along with vehicle operation, that assumes that the 125 new electric vehicles are purchased instead of 125 new conventional gasoline powered vehicles.  5.2  Emission Reduction Project for Taxis  This case study is based on a hypothetical project in a country called the Clean Cities Republic.125 Although the Clean Cities Republic is a developing country, it does not represent any country or region in particular. It should be emphasized that the numbers used for this case study are fictional. The data provided for estimating the emissions baseline have been developed to illustrate how to quantify potential emission benefits. The data should not be used as an indicator of the specific emissions potential of an electric vehicle project. Electric vehicle project developers should obtain their own GHG emission data for both the conventional vehicles to be replaced and the new alternative fuel vehicles to be introduced. 5.2.1 Republic of Clean Cities Background Information  The Republic of Clean Cities is a country with a population of 45 million people. Gross domestic product (GDP) is US$190 billion per year, with an annual growth rate of 5 to 6 percent over the last 10 years. As a result of this economic expansion, the country is The hypothetical country example of the Republic of Clean Cities was first introduced at the 6 National Clean Cities Conference for illustrating a similar case study on estimating the GHG benefits of a natural gas vehicle project.

Currently, transportation activities account for 32 percent of energy related CO2 emissions, although this share is expected to grow significantly over the next few decades as the transportation sector continues to expand. The project will be located in the capital of the Republic of Clean Cities, which is a city of 8 million people with a population growth of 5 percent per year. On average, there are 7 people per motor vehicle, compared to 1.3 per vehicle in the U.S. The total number of vehicles on the road is growing by 7 percent annually. The capital is experiencing serious local environmental pollution problems and is among the 20 most polluted cities in the world. The concentration of total suspended particulates (TSP) in the air is 8 times higher than the proposed World Health Organization (WHO) standards. The majority of the capital's pollution problems are caused by transportation emissions. To alleviate some of these environmental problems, the government has introduced tax incentives for switching to alternative fueled vehicles. In addition, a recently passed law mandates that all new cars should drive on unleaded gasoline. Currently, 40 percent of all gasoline sold in the country is leaded. The local government has also introduced a car use reduction plan to curb the rapid growth of new vehicles in the capital area. Finally, a new domestic regulation was put in place this year for reductions in vehicle tailpipe emissions of criteria pollutants. To date, no electric vehicles have been purchased in the capital and there are no domestic manufacturers or dealers supplying electric vehicles.  5.3  The Project Case Study  As part of the project, 125 dedicated electric vehicles (sedans) will be purchased to either replace 125 existing or new conventional gasoline taxis of a similar size. To develop a supporting infrastructure, vehicle accessible electrical outlets will be provided at the site where these taxis are parked, including at the homes of the taxi drivers. Moreover, an extensive training course will be provided for the fleet mechanics. The lifetime of the project is estimated conservatively, at 12 years. Each taxi is expected to drive an average of 70,000 miles per year. The energy use of the electric vehicles is 1.46 kwh/mile and the mileage of the conventional gasoline vehicles that would have been purchased in the absence of the project is 26 miles per gallon of gasoline. The project participants include the Capital City Transportation Department, a local taxi fleet operator, and a U.S.-based electric vehicle manufacturer. The electric vehicle project has been approved by the Republic of Clean Cities' National Climate Change Office, which has been authorized by the Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Energy, and Environment, to evaluate and certify internationally sponsored GHG reduction projects. The National Climate Change Office, administered by the Ministry of Environment, has provided written documentation of project approval. The project reduces CO2 emissions by reducing the need for oil recovery, gasoline refining, and fuel transportation, which produces more CO2 emissions than recharging the electric batteries. The carbon intensity of electricity generated in the capital region is relatively low, as more than 35 percent of the generating capacity comes from hydropower. The remaining electricity is generated from a mix of coal and diesel. A comparison of N2O and CH4 emissions will not be included in the emissions baseline because these do not significantly contribute to projected emissions.  52  5 Case Study   5.4  Project Additionality  Determining the additionality of the EV project is relatively straightforward. As mentioned earlier, there are no electric vehicles in the capital and the technology is not yet commercially available on the domestic market. One major impediment for the introduction of EVs is the considerable higher cost of the vehicles and the lack of knowledge about the technology. Although tax incentives are provided for owners of AFVs there are no laws or regulations requiring public or private vehicle fleet owners to purchase alternative fuel vehicles, such as EVs. It is therefore unlikely that electric vehicles will be introduced in the country in the near future. The EV project is clearly additional and would likely qualify for credit under any market based GHG reduction program. If, on the other hand, a law were in place mandating that 15 percent of all public and private fleets must consist of zero emission vehicles, such as electric vehicles, the issue of additionality would be less straightforward. In this case, the project developer would not be able to claim GHG emission reduction credits for EVs purchased to meet the 15 percent requirement. Only vehicles purchased to exceed the mandated zero emission requirements would receive credit. Hence, a fleet owner with 200 conventional gasoline taxis--who replaces 40 old conventional gasoline vehicles with 40 new EVs--would only be able to obtain emission reduction credits for 10 of the new EVs. The other 30 vehicles would go towards meeting the 15 percent mandate for zero emission vehicles. However, for the purposes of the following case studies it is assumed that no such laws have been put in place.  5.5  Estimating the Emissions Baseline  Since the introduction of the concept of cooperatively implemented GHG reduction projects, little experience has been gained regarding the development and evaluation of transportation-related GHG reduction projects. As mentioned earlier, only one transportation project has been approved under the UNFCCC's AIJ Pilot Phase. One project, however, does not provide enough precedent to be used for the development of standardized methodologies for analyzing transportation projects. For this type of project it should be sufficient to include information about CO2 emissions only, instead of covering all GHGs, simply because CO2 emissions account for most of the GHG emissions from the project. Clearly, the analysis should include a comparison of upstream emissions because the project emissions are dependent on the fuel mix used for generating the electricity used in the batteries. This case study will provide three sample baseline scenarios to illustrate how different project characteristics may influence the baseline estimate. The three baselines include: 1. 2. 3. A static baseline assuming that the 125 new electric vehicles are purchased instead of 125 new conventional gasoline powered vehicles. These vehicles are purchased to meet growing demand for taxi services. A dynamic baseline assuming that the 125 new electric vehicles will replace 125 aging conventional gasoline vehicles with an estimated average lifetime of eight years. A static baseline assuming that the 125 new electric vehicles are purchased instead of 125 new conventional gasoline powered vehicles. This analysis includes a full fuel cycle analysis similar to that provided in the GREET model.  The purpose of presenting these different baseline scenarios is two-fold. One is to advance the discussion on some of the issues that must be resolved in order to establish  5 Case Study  53   clear guidelines for the documentation and approval of transportation-related projects. The other purpose is to provide potential project developers with an idea of the issues that must be considered during the development of an emissions baseline for a transportation project. Project developers can then choose between or combine the different baseline scenarios depending on the purpose and requirements of the program to which the project participants will be applying for credit. Factors that may determine the choice of baseline scenarios, include: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. The transportation technology used for the project; Availability of full fuel cycle and tailpipe emissions data; Individual GHG program requirements; The risk tolerance and level of accuracy desired by project developers and investors; and The acceptable level of transaction costs.  The three baseline scenarios are outlined in the following subsections. Each version of the baseline scenarios involves three quantification steps. These include a calculation of: (1) the project reference case, (2) project-related emissions, and (3) net emission benefits of the project. The first quantification step entails estimating what the emissions would have been without implementing the project. This step is also known as the emission baseline or the project reference case and should include data for the entire life of the project. Because the potential project emission benefits are derived by comparing project emissions to the reference case, accuracy in the development of the reference case is very important. However, estimating future emissions is a difficult process. It is almost impossible to factor in everything that may or may not happen 10 to 20 years down the road. Moreover, many different results can be achieved depending on which assumptions are used to derive the future emissions scenario. GHG reduction programs and project developers planning to receive credit for their projects under a future market-based GHG reduction program must be careful to develop baseline criteria that would be stringent enough to be accepted under any program. Given the differences between the various initiatives to credit GHG reduction activities, developers should consult the preliminary guidelines of each of the proposed programs before developing a project, and be careful to detail all assumptions and emission sources when quantifying the potential emission benefits. The examples provided in the following case study are less comprehensive and should only be used as an indicator of the types of data and quantification procedures that could be required from the different GHG reduction programs. The third quantification step involves estimating emissions from the project itself. The data provided should include an estimation of all relevant project emissions throughout the life of the project. During this process, project developers should be careful to define the boundary of the project and detail all the assumptions and emission sources included in the estimate. The fourth and final quantification step is rather simple. It entails calculating the net benefits of the project. To derive the net benefits, the project developer must subtract the project emissions from the emissions estimated for the reference case. The difference will represent the net benefits of the project. 5.5.1 Emission Baselines: Version 1  The first scenario is based on a static emissions baseline. This means that the current level of business as usual emissions are assumed to remain constant throughout the life of the project. This scenario does not take into consideration changes that may occur  54  5 Case Study   over the life of the project such as declining vehicle efficiency or improvements in new vehicle technology. In version 1, the method used to calculate emission reductions is based on a comparison of fuel usage and the corresponding fuel emissions factors. Step 1: The Reference Case The reference case represents what would happen if the GHG reduction project were not implemented. In this case, it is assumed that without the GHG reduction project, 125 new conventionally fueled gasoline vehicles would have been purchased to satisfy the growing demand for taxi services. Because version 1 of the case study assumes that emissions of the project are static, the GHG emissions rate of each taxi is assumed to remain the same over the next 12 years. In this version of the case study, the formula for calculating emissions of the gasoline vehicles is: Emissions over the project lifetime = (miles driven per year) / (vehicle efficiency in miles per gallon, mpg) x (emission factor of gasoline) x (number of vehicles) x (number of project years)  The emission factor for gasoline is assumed to be 19.564 lbs CO2/gallon (8.873 kg CO2/gallon).126 Hence emissions without the project would have been: Project lifetime emissions = (70,000 miles) / (26 mpg) x (8.873 kg CO2/gallon) x (125 vehicles) x (12 years) = 35,833 metric tons CO2 over the 12 year project lifetime Step 2: The Project Case The project case represents the actual emissions of the project itself. In this instance, the project case refers to the emissions of the 125 electric vehicle taxis over the 12-year life of the project. In this version of the case study, the formula for calculating emissions of the electric vehicles is: Emissions over the project lifetime = (miles driven per year) x (vehicle efficiency in kWh per mile) x (emission factor of electricity generation in kg CO2 per kWh) x (number of vehicles) x (number of project years)  The emission factor for electricity generation in the capital area is assumed to be 0.178 kg CO2/kWh. Hence emissions with the project would be: Project lifetime emissions (over 12 years) = (70,000 miles) x (1.46 kWh per mile) x (0.178 kg CO2/kWh) x (125 vehicles) x (12 years) = 27,287 metric tons CO 2  U.S. Department of Energy, Energy Information Administration (EIA), Instructions for the Voluntary Reporting of Greenhouse Gases Program.  126  5 Case Study  55   Step 3: Deriving Net Project Benefits The net project emission benefits are derived by subtracting the project case from the reference case. As illustrated below, the net project benefits of version 1 of the case study are 8,545 metric tons of CO2. Reference case - project case = Net project benefits 35,833 - 27,287 = 8,545 metric tons of CO 2  Figure 5-1  Project Emission Reductions Relative to Baseline-- Version 1 of Case Study Static Emissions Baseline  3,500  Metric Tons CO2 Emissions per Year  3,000 2,500 2,000 1,500 1,000 500 1 2 3 4 5 6  Project Emission Reductions  Baseline Emissions  Project Emissions  Net Project Benefits = 8,545 Metric Tons of CO2  7  8  9  10  11  12  Project Year  5.5.2  Emission Baselines: Version 2  The second scenario for the electric vehicle project relies on a dynamic emissions baseline. A dynamic baseline takes into account the changes that may happen to emissions and equipment as the vehicles age over time. In this version of the case study, it is assumed that the 125 new electric vehicles will replace an equal number of aging gasoline vehicles. However, as the old vehicles only have an estimated average lifetime of 8 years left, it must also be assumed that a similar number of new gasoline vehicles would be purchased after 8 years to replace the old vehicles as they are taken out of service. Therefore, in this version of the case study the mileage of the old gasoline vehicles is assumed to be considerably lower than the mileage of the new gasoline vehicles that are projected to be purchased 8 years into the future. Step 1: The Reference Case The reference case represents what would happen if the GHG reduction project were not implemented. As this is a dynamic baseline that takes into account the fact that the old gasoline vehicles are expected to be taken out of service after an average of 8 years-- and be replaced with new gasoline vehicles--the reference case will be calculated in two steps. First, the emissions of the old vehicles during the first 8 years of the project are calculated, then the emissions of the new vehicles used during the last 4 years of the  56  5 Case Study   project lifetime will be estimated. The two numbers are then added together and will represent the emissions of the reference case. It is assumed that the mileage of the old gasoline vehicles is 21 gallons per mile while the mileage of the new vehicles will be 28 miles per gallon. It should be noted that additional layers of ""dynamics"" could be added, such as estimating the mileage of each vehicle from year to year to account for declining efficiencies as the vehicles age. However, for the sake of simplicity and a diminishing return on accuracy, a simple two tiered assumption is used: one tier for eight years of the old vehicles, and one tier for four years of the new vehicles. The formula for calculating emission reductions is the same as in version 1 of the case study: Emissions over the project lifetime = (miles driven per year) / (vehicle efficiency in miles per gallon, mpg) x (emission factor of gasoline) x (number of vehicles) x (number of project years)  The emission factor for gasoline is assumed to be 19.564 lbs CO2/gallon (8.873 kg CO2/gallon).127 Hence emissions without the project would have been: Emissions (old vehicles; 8 year time scale) = (70,000 miles) / (21 mpg) x (8.873 kg CO2/gallon) x (125 vehicles) x (8 years) = 29,589 metric tons CO2 Emissions (new vehicles; 4 year time scale) = (70,000 miles) / (28 mpg) x (8.873 kg CO2/gallon) x (125 vehicles) x (4 years) = 11,096 metric tons CO2 Emissions of all gasoline vehicles over 12 year project lifetime = 29,589 + 11,096 = 40,685 metric tons CO 2  Step 2: The Project Case The project case represents emissions of the project itself. In this situation, the project emissions remain the same as version 1 of the case study. Hence, project emissions are 27,287 metric tons CO2. Step 3: Deriving Net Project Benefits The net project emission benefits are derived by subtracting the project case from the reference case. As illustrated below, the net project benefits of version 2 of the case study are 13,398 metric tons of CO2 equivalent. Reference case - project case = Net project benefits 40,685 - 27,287 = 13,398 metric tons of CO 2  U.S. Department of Energy, Energy Information Administration (EIA), Instructions for the Voluntary Reporting of Greenhouse Gases Program.  127  5 Case Study  57   Figure 5-2  Project Emission Reductions Relative to Baseline-- Version 2 of Case Study Dynamic Emissions Baseline  4,000  Metric Tons CO2 Emissions per Year  3,500 3,000 2,500 2,000 1,500 1,000 500 1  Baseline Emissions Project Emission Reductions Project Emissions  Net Project Benefits = 13,398 Metric Tons of CO2  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  Project Year  5.5.3  Emission Baselines: Version 3  The third version of the emission baseline for the electric vehicle project relies on a static emission baseline, but uses a different model for quantifying the emissions benefits. In the previous two versions of the case study, emissions benefits were estimated by comparing fuel usage of the different vehicle types. However, this method does not account for the entire emissions scenario of the project. A more accurate analysis of emission benefits would analyze the entire project life cycle, including emissions from the production, transportation, processing, and combustion of the fuel used. However, this type of analysis is very complicated and would be costly to undertake for the individual project developer. For projects in the United States, it would be possible to undertake this type of analysis by using the GREET model developed by Argonne National Laboratory.128 As part of this model, emissions have been computed for a number of different vehicle types and models based on a detailed analysis of the energy production and usage of the entire transportation sector. Project developers can apply data regarding a specific vehicle model to the GREET model and calculate the potential GHG and other emissions reductions from a project. However, this model only applies to the transportation sector in the U.S. No similar studies have been undertaken in other countries. In particular, developing countries lack the adequate data and resources to undertake such studies of life cycle emissions. The following version of the case study applies hypothetical electric vehicle data to the GREET model to illustrate how emissions would be calculated using this model. The baseline in this case study is more detailed than the two previous versions; that is, emissions data is presented for three stages of the fuel cycle. These stages include feedstock (production, transportation, and storage of primary energy feedstock), fuel  Michael Wang, ""Greenhouse Gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy Use in Transportation (GREET)"". Argonne National Laboratory. www.transportation.anl.gov/ttrdc/greet.  128  58  5 Case Study   (production, transportation, storage and distribution of energy source), and vehicle operation (fuel combustion or other chemical conversion). Step 1: The Reference Case The reference case represents what would happen if the GHG reduction project were not implemented. As in the first version of this case study, it is assumed that 125 conventional gasoline taxis would have been purchased instead of the electric vehicles. The assumptions for the annual emissions from one gasoline vehicle, based on hypothetical data, are as described in Table 5-1. Table 5-1 Feedstock 19  Version 3 of Case Study--Annual CO2 Emissions Without the Project (grams/mile/year) Fuel 86 Vehicle Operation 402 Total 507  Emissions over 12 yrs = 0.507 kg CO2 /mi x 70,000 mi x 125 cars x 12 yrs = 53,249 metric tons of CO Step 2: The Project Case As in the previous versions of this case study, the project case refers to the emissions of the 125 electric vehicle taxis over the 12-year life of the project. It is assumed that emissions of the electric vehicles will remain constant over the life of the project. Hence, a static baseline is used. The assumptions for the annual emissions from one electric vehicle, based on hypothetical data, are as described in Table 5-2. Table 5-2 Feedstock 21 2  Version 3 of Case Study--Annual CO2 Emissions with the EV Project (grams/mile/year) Fuel 237 Vehicle Operation 0 Total 258  Emissions over 12 yrs = 0.258 kg CO2 /mi x 70,000 mi x 125 cars x 12 yrs = 27,097 metric tons of CO Step 3: Deriving Net Project Benefits The net project emission benefits are derived by subtracting the project case from the reference case. As illustrated below, the net project benefits of version 3 of the case study are 26,152 metric tons of CO2. Reference case - project case = Net project benefits 53,249 - 27,097 = 26,152 metric tons of CO2 2  5 Case Study  59   Figure 5-3  Project Emission Reductions Relative to Baseline-- Version 3 of Case Study Static Emission Baseline Based on Full Fuel Cycle Analysis  5,000  Metric Tons CO2 Emissions per Year  4,500 4,000 3,500 3,000 2,500 2,000 1,500 1,000 500 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12  Baseline Emissions Project Emission Reductions  Project Emissions  Net Project Benefits = 26,152 Metric Tons of CO2  Project Year  5.6  Discussion three different methods for estimating the emission of the three baselines represents a viable means of resulting from the project. Ultimately, the specific or HEV project will determine which methodology is  The previous section presented benefits of an EV project. Each calculating emissions reductions circumstances of a potential EV being used.  In general, there is a tradeoff between the accuracy of a baseline and the cost and effort associated with its calculation. As transportation projects are typically smaller in size and thus reap relatively few GHG emission reduction credits, it will be harder to justify the transaction costs involved with developing a very detailed estimate of projected emissions. As a result, project developers may prefer to use a less stringent baseline estimation procedure. However, as a general rule, project developers should aim to be as conservative as possible when determining emission reduction credits. Investors looking to purchase emission reduction credits want to ensure that the credits purchased are credible and minimize the risk of default in future commitment periods. Hence, they prefer to invest in credits that are based on sound and credible estimation procedures. It is therefore important that project developers clearly describe the baseline methodology and assumptions used, and explain why this approach was preferred over other methods. Moreover, in cases where there might be some uncertainty regarding the exact amount of expected emissions benefits--for example due to an expected decline in EV efficiency which cannot yet be quantified because of little experience with the technology--project developers should select the least optimistic emissions scenario. This type of estimation procedure is much more likely to gain acceptance by current and future GHG crediting programs.  60  5 Case Study   6  Summary and Conclusions  Accurate and verifiable emission reductions are a function of the degree of transparency and stringency of the protocols employed in documenting project- or program-associated emissions reductions. The purpose of this guide is to provide a background for law and policy makers, urban planners, and project developers working with the many GHG emission reduction programs throughout the world to quantify and/or evaluate the GHG impacts of EVs and HEVs. In order to evaluate the GHG benefits and/or penalties of EV or HEV projects, it is necessary to first gain a fundamental understanding of the technology employed and the operating characteristics of these vehicles, especially with regard to the manner in which they compare to similar conventional gasoline or diesel vehicles. Therefore, the first two sections of this paper explain the basic technology and functionality of battery-powered electric and hybrid electric passenger vehicles, but focus on evaluating the models that are currently on the market with their similar conventional counterparts, including characteristics such as cost, performance, efficiency, environmental attributes, and range. Since the increased use of EVs and HEVs, along with alternative fuel vehicles in general, represents a public good with many social benefits at the local, national, and global levels, they often receive significant attention in the form of legislative and programmatic support. Some states mandate the use of EVs and HEVs, while others provide financial incentives to promote their procurement and use. Furthermore, Federal legislation in the form of mandatory standards or incentive programs can have a significant impact on the EV and HEV markets. In order to implement effective legislation or programs, it is vital to have an understanding of the different programs and activities that already exist, so that a new project focusing on GHG emission reduction can successfully interact with and build on the experience and lessons learned of those that preceded it. Finally, most programs that deal with passenger vehicles--and with transportation in general--do not address the climate change component explicitly, and therefore there are few GHG reduction goals that are included in these programs. Furthermore, there are relatively few protocols that exist for accounting for the GHG emissions reductions that arise from transportation and, specifically, passenger vehicle projects and programs. These accounting procedures and principles gain increased importance when a project developer wishes to document in a credible manner, the GHG reductions that are achieved by a given project or program. Section four of this paper outlines the GHG emissions associated with EVs and HEVs, both upstream and downstream, and section five goes on to illustrate the methodology, via hypothetical case studies, for measuring these reductions using different types of baselines. Unlike stationary energy combustion, transportation related emissions from some HEVs and EVs come from dispersed sources and require different methodologies for assessing GHG impacts. This resource guide outlines the necessary context and background for those parties wishing to evaluate projects and develop programs, policies, projects, and legislation aimed at the promotion of HEVs and EVs for GHG emission reduction.  6 Summary and Conclusions  61   Appendices  62  Appendices   A1  Comparison of Electric and Hybrid-Electric Vehicles to Similar-Performance Gasoline-Powered Vehicles  This appendix compares an electric vehicle and a hybrid-electric vehicle to a similarly performing gasoline-powered vehicle. While the text discusses these different technologies in depth, this table format shows side-by-side comparisons of vehicles currently available for purchase or resale. This information was gathered from manufacturers and DOE vehicle emissions class ratings. In this case, the comparison is between the battery-powered GM EV-1, the hybrid-electric Toyota Prius, and the gasoline-powered Honda Civic DX Sedan. All three vehicles have similar body specifications, but contrast in engine types. The major differences are found in performance measures of fuel efficiency, emissions, and range. The hybrid-electric Prius has an particularly notable fuel efficiency, because its city efficiency (52 mpg) exceeds its highway efficiency (45 mpg). In another contrast to conventional vehicles, the range of the hybrid-electric vehicle is also greater for city driving than for highway driving. The electric vehicle boasts no tailpipe emissions and holds the highest emissions rating at ZEV.

Operating costs include energy, battery costs, and maintenance costs. These costs are then converted to per-mile costs, and are comparable with similar costs for a CV. The study considered two cases: one at the time of EV introduction, and another at the time EVs are sold in high volume (more than 100,000 units). In computing the lifecycle costs, several assumptions were made. Vehicle-ownership-related costs such as registration, insurance, and property taxes, are excluded, assuming that these items would be the same for both types of vehicles. Similar annual and lifetime usage of the vehicles at 130,000 miles over a span of 12 years with similar scrappage value at end of their useful lives was assumed. The EV characteristics required for this study included an acceleration of zero to 60 mph in 10-12 seconds, and a battery pack with an energy content of at least 15 kWh (nickel-metal hydride or lead-acid). The EV operating costs included initial and replacement battery packs; routine maintenance costs 20% lower than CVs; and tire cost 11% higher than CVs. The high volume test case accounted for improvements made to EVs, including a 3% reduction in vehicle mass, an 8% power train efficiency improvement, and a 4% discount to the price of replacement battery packs (excluding inflation). Other considerations should be taken into account when comparing CVs and EVs; for example, the dissimilarities in refueling infrastructure and the range between refueling stations. Some researchers have analyzed the perceived negative value held by consumers and translated this utility into a cost equivalent.130  R.M. Cuenca, L.L. Gaines, and A.D.

The energy and maintenance costs, in both cases, are lower for EVs, but the lifetime cost advantage is lost when the price of the battery is added. Given the study's assumptions about long-term cost reductions potential for the electric drive, and advanced battery performance, the EV could be comparable to the CV.

Registries also publicly record their progress in reducing emissions and provide public recognition of a company's accomplishments. Registries can also help raise awareness of climate change, promote sharing of lessons learned and success stories, and publicize low-cost mitigation opportunities. This appendix provides a summary of 18 recent states', counties', and regional associations' actions and legislation towards developing GHG registries. Up until recently, a lack of federal leadership on the role of GHG registries (at the state or national level) had prompted many states and regions to begin to take action and resulted in an emerging patchwork of differing requirements and approaches. However, on February 14, 2002, President Bush introduced the Administration's official policy on climate change: Our immediate goal is to reduce America's GHG emissions relative to the size of our economy... Our government will also move forward immediately to create world-class standards for measuring and registering emission reductions. And we will give transferable credits to companies that can show real emission reductions.131 The President's Global Climate Change Policy Book specifically addresses local and national GHG registries: The President directed the Secretary of Energy, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Agriculture, and the Administrator of the EPA, to propose improvements to the current voluntary emission reduction registration program under section 1605(b) of the 1992 Energy Policy Act within 120 days... A number of proposals to reform the existing registry--or create a new registry--have appeared in energy and/or climate policy bills introduced in the past year. The Administration will fully explore the extent to which the existing authority under the Energy Policy Act is adequate to achieve these reforms.132 Many states are reacting to the Administration's policy and are eager to respond to the recommendations expected after 120 days. Project developers should keep abreast to current events with respect to these emerging registry programs.

The California Registry will help various California entities' to establish GHG emissions baselines. Also, the California Registry will enable participating entities to voluntarily record their annual GHG emissions inventories. In turn, the State of California will use its best efforts to ensure that organizations that voluntarily inventory their emissions receive appropriate consideration under any future international, federal, or state regulatory regimes 133 relating to GHG emissions. This bill requires the California Energy Commission to provide guidance to the California Registry on a number of issues, such as, developing GHG emissions protocols, qualifying third-party organizations to provide technical assistance, and qualifying third-party organizations to provide certification of emissions 134 baselines and inventories. This bill requires the Illinois EPA to establish an interstate nitrogen oxide trading program and issue findings that address the need to control or reduce emissions from fossil fuel-fired electric generating plants. The findings are to address the establishment of a banking system, consistent with DOE's Voluntary Reporting of Greenhouse Gases Program for certifying credits for voluntary offsets of emissions of greenhouse gases, or 137 reductions of GHGs. This requires the Department of Environmental Protection to develop rules to create a voluntary registry of GHG emissions. The rules must provide for the collection of data on the origin of the carbon emissions as either fossil fuel or renewable resources, and the collection of data on production activity to allow the tracking of future emission trends.

A November 2001 report by the Council stated, ""Goals [for GHG reductions in Maryland] will be set for both the State facilities and operations as well as statewide reduction goals to be achieved through voluntary 140 initiatives, policies, and programs."" This requires the six highest-polluting power plants in Massachusetts to meet overall emission limits for nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide by October 1, 2004 and begin immediate monitoring and reporting of mercury emissions. For the six affected plants, the rule caps total carbon dioxide emissions and creates an emission standard of 1,800 lbs. of carbon dioxide per megawatt-hour (a reduction of 10 percent below the current average emissions rate). The carbon dioxide limits must be met by October 1, 2006 or October 1, 2008 for plant retrofit or replacement. Plant operators may meet the standard either by increasing efficiency at the plant, or by purchasing credits from other reduction programs approved by the Department of 141 Environmental Protection. This bill to amend the 1994 Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Act calls for declining caps in nitrogen 142 oxides, sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide, and mercury by 2007. The bill has been referred to the Committee on Natural 143 Resources and Environmental Affairs.

The action plan calls for the creation of a regional emissions registry and the exploration of a trading mechanism. This four-pollutant bill is the first in the nation to include carbon 145 dioxide. Emission reduction requirements include 75% of sulfur dioxide by 2006; 70% of nitrogen oxide by 2006; 3% of carbon dioxide by 2006 (1990 levels); and mercury levels are still to be 146 determined by 2004. This bill established a registry for voluntary GHG emission reductions to create an incentive for voluntary emission 147 reductions. Implementation rules were adopted on February 23, 2001. The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection adopted new rules to add provisions to the Open Market Emissions Trading Program for the generation and banking of 148 GHG credits. The GHGs included are: carbon dioxide; methane; nitrous oxide; certain hydro fluorocarbons, per fluorocarbons; and sulfur hexafluoride. The Program was established to provide incentives for voluntary reduction of air contaminant emissions and also provide an alternative means for regulated entities to achieve compliance with air pollution control obligations in a more cost-effective manor.

New York City  New York City Council Bill No. 152 30  Re-introduced January 30, 2002  New York City Council member Peter Vallone Jr. reintroduced a bill that would require the city's power plants to reduce carbon dioxide emissions or face stiff fines. If passed, the bill would reduce carbon dioxide emissions by as much as 20 percent within five years of enactment. Under the terms of the legislation, owners of power plants that produce at least 25 megawatts of electricity for sale would be required to pay high fines for generators that emit levels of carbon dioxide that exceed those 153 established by an independent board. Suffolk County became the first county to pass a resolution limiting carbon dioxide emissions. The resolution seeks to encourage efficiency in existing power plants and future facilities by setting allowable rates for carbon dioxide emissions and penalties for exceeding those limits.

An additional $1 per excess ton would be charged in each consecutive year. The bill contains several alternatives to paying fines including buying emission credits through nationally recognized carbon dioxide trading markets, investing in alternative energy sources or donating penalties to community 154 environmental groups. A carbon dioxide emissions rate of 1,800 lbs/MWh is proposed, along with an allowable County-wide emission rate reduction of 1% for every 100 MW of electric generating capacity installed within the County until the emission rate has been reduced by 20%. Emissions trading would be allowed for compliance. Penalties of $2/ton in the first year and $1/ton each consecutive 155 year would be assessed if the EGU fails to comply. This bill would reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides by 78% by 2009 and sulfur dioxide by 73% by 2013. The bill also directs the North Carolina Division of Air Quality (DAQ) to study the issues for standards of reductions of mercury and carbon dioxide. DAQ is also to develop and adopt a program of incentives to promote voluntary reductions of emissions including, emissions banking and trading and credit for voluntary early action. This bill was sent by the Senate to the House where is has been referred the 156 Committee on Public Utilities This bill established a carbon dioxide standard requiring new utilities to emit 17% less than most energy efficient plant 157 available. The bill capped carbon dioxide emissions at 0.7 pounds of carbon dioxide per kilowatt-hour for base-load natural gas-fired power plants; in 1999 the cap was lowered to 0.675 pounds per kilowatt-hour.

The bill authorizes the Department of Natural Resources to establish systems for registering reductions in fine 162 particulate matter, mercury and other air contaminants. A rule (NR 437) is proposed to establish voluntary emissions reduction registries for GHGs, as well as for mercury, fine particulate matter and other contaminants that cause air pollution. The rule represents a new Department of Natural Resources policy to systematically record and track voluntary emission reductions by industries, electric utility companies, agricultural and forestry interests, and transportation and energy efficiency interests. NR 437 establishes the rules and procedures under which the new registry will operate. The rule also identifies the sources that are eligible to register reductions for GHGs like carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorcarbons and sulfur hexafluoride, as well as for nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, volatile organic compounds, carbon monoxide, mercury, lead and fine particulate matter.

Reported CO2 Equivalent Reduction in 2000 (metric tons)  Reporting Entity  Carryall Vehicle Program  15 Vehicles  Direct:  15.17  Indirect: 796.51 Project Description The Pleasants & Willow Island Power Stations are adjacent coal-fired power generation facilities along the Ohio River near Parkersburg, West Virginia. Plant personnel had used a fleet of pick-up trucks and vans to perform various duties associated with the operation and maintenance of the plant. The number of vehicles in the fleet at the plant totaled 27 at one time. Beginning in 1992, the plant began to evaluate the use of Carryall vehicles to replace the pick-up trucks. These utility vehicles, which are similar to golf carts, were acquired because of the potential to reduce costs to operate and maintain the vehicle fleet through lower purchase price, reduced fuel consumption, and reduced maintenance costs. Both gasoline-powered and electric-powered versions of the Carryall vehicle have been acquired. After a period of demonstration and evaluation, the decision was made in 1996 to retire a portion of the vehicle fleet and to use the Carryall vehicles as the primary vehicles for in-plant transportation. By 1997, the power station complex has added a total of 15 Carryall vehicles to its fleet. There are 12 gasoline-powered vehicles and 3 electric-powered vehicles. Estimation Method Only estimates of changes in CO2 emissions have been included in this report. The 15 pick-up trucks and other vehicles replaced averaged about 350 gallons/truck of fuel consumption annually. The 12 gasoline-powered Carryalls consume about 85 gallons of fuel each on an annual basis. The emissions factor of 19.641 lbs.CO2/gal for each gallon of fuel consumed was applied to the difference in fuel consumption to determine the reduction in CO2 emissions.  A4 Project Reports to 1605(b)  78   The CO2 emitted from the electricity generated to charge the electric Carryalls was subtracted from the difference mentioned above to determine the net reduction in CO2. The electric-powered Carryalls are charged each night for about 10 hours. CO2 emissions for the electricity used are about 1.05 tons/MWh from the Pleasants/Willow Island Power Station complex. The MWh consumption was determined based on information supplied by the vendor. From this information the total CO2 emissions from battery charging can be determined. The vehicle replacement program was considered to be fully implemented in October 1996 when the majority of vehicles were removed from service, so 1996 figures represent 25 percent of annual emissions/reductions. Beginning in 1997, data is reported on an annual basis. DTE Energy/Detroit Edison Electric Vehicle Demonstration Project Project Description 10 vehicles (1994-96); 27 vehicles (1997-98) N/A  Detroit Edison has completed a 30-month Ford Ecostar demonstration program. There were 10 Ecostar electric vans being used in various Company fleet applications. The Ecostars were also displayed in public automotive events and alternative fuel vehicle industry conferences and events. Detroit Edison continues to promote educational efforts to enhance understanding and use of electric vehicles. Sponsoring the 1996 Future Car Challenge, the Hybrid Electric Vehicle Challenges (1993-1995) and past SAE Micro Electric Vehicle Challenges are part of this effort. The Company also sponsored the 1996 EEI Fleet Managers Electric Vehicle Conference and participated in planning and execution of the EV Ready Market Launch Workshop in Detroit. The 10 Ford Ecostar vans were retired in 1997, beginning in September, and Detroit Edison purchased 27 GM S10 electric pickup trucks. The pickups were delivered in June, September and November. Since the vehicles were only utilized for a relatively short time in 1997, the CO2 reductions are expected to be greater during 1998. The fleet of 27 GMC S10 electric pickup trucks were used throughout 1998 but did not result in the anticipated reduction in CO2 emissions because of lower efficiency of these units. In 1999, operation/use of our fleet of electric vehicles was transferred to a local hospital. This precluded accurate record-keeping on electricity used, miles driven and mode of use (e.g., driving vs. standing/idling). Therefore, no report is submitted for 1999 or subsequent years. Detroit Edison's formal involvement with the electric vehicle assessment program concluded at the end of calendar 1998. No further reports will be submitted on this project.  Estimation Method  The electric vehicles replaced various types of internal combustion engine vehicles which had fuel economies of 4 to 20 miles per gallon, depending on application. Fuel savings (gallons gasoline) were estimated according to the fuel economies (miles per gallon) of the vehicles replaced and the actual miles driven by the electric vehicles.  A4 Project Reports to 1605(b)  79   The associated CO2 emissions displaced were calculated by multiplying the gallons of gasoline saved by 19.564 lb CO2/gal. (Appendix B, Form 1605 Instructions) lbs CO2 was then converted to short tons. The electricity consumption from vehicle charging was obtained by metering on-site. Emissions from vehicle charging were calculated by multiplying the MWh consumption by Detroit Edison`s annual fossil CO2 emission rate. Annual 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 fossil generation CO2 emission rates: 1.052 short ton/MWh 1.061 short ton/MWh 1.073 short ton/MWh 1.069 short ton/MWh 1.058 short ton/MWh  Note: Electricity consumption for 1997 was estimated by: MWh electricity consumed = Total miles driven / (3 miles per kWh * 1000 kWh per MWh).

Electric Vehicles and Employee Trip Reduction Program Project Description 1,049,106 VMT eliminated/displaced by EV over 6 years 36,012 VMT in 2000 Direct: 12.28 Indirect: 3.06  GPU has undertaken various programs in New Jersey to: encourage ridematching; sponsor vanpooling; and facilitate carpooling as well as the use of mass transit services. An official program was prepared for submission to the NJDOT. GPU has also undertaken voluntary measures to explore the use of alternatively fueled vehicles for different company functions, including meter reading and shuttle services. Three cars were put into service during 1995, collectively driving 6800 miles. All recorded Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) is mileage by Electric Vehicle that displaced mileage by gasoline fueled vehicles.  A4 Project Reports to 1605(b)  80   Note: The ridesharing portion of this project was discontinued in 1999; therefore the GHG reduction for this project is reduced from past years. Estimation Method Avoided conventional auto travel was recorded for the two components of the program. In 1995, the Corporation's Ridesharing Program resulted in 205,902 avoided travel miles due to car and van pooling and 166,329 avoided miles due to the use of mass transport. The reference case assumes the mass transit services would be operational with or without this program. Consequently, if not for this program 372,231 additional vehicle miles would be traveled. This figure plus the 6800 miles of conventional auto use avoided by the Corporation's electric vehicle testing program were totaled and the Corporate Average Fuel Efficiency rate of 27.5 miles per gallon was used to calculate the motor fuel use avoided. This figure was converted to emissions data using following methodology from the Guidelines: Annual Emissions = (Annual Mileage eliminated x FMij) + (Annual Fuel saved x FFij) where FMij = emissions factor per mile eliminated for GHG i and fuel j FFij = emissions factor per unit of fuel saved for GHG i and fuel j. Fuel type was assumed to be gasoline in all cases. Emissions factors from Guidelines are as follows: FMij (grams/mile): CH4: 0.05 CO2: 2.0 N2O: 0.05 FFij (grams/gallon): CH4: 8.67 CO2: 1.10 x 10e4 N2O: 0.175 For all gases, FMij represents direct emissions, i.e. emission from vehicles. For N20 and CH4, FFij represents indirect emissions, i.e. emissions from upstream processes such as refining. For CO2, FFij includes both tailpipe emissions (direct) and upstream emissions (indirect). A factor for direct emissions was determined using the emission factor from Appendix B in the instructions (19.641 #/gal or 0.891 x 10e4 grams/gal). A factor for indirect emissions was calculated by subtraction, 1.10 x 10e4 - 0.8909 x 10e4 = 0.209 x 10e4 grams/gal. Grams of each GHG were then converted to short tons using the following formula: (grams x 0.001) x 0.001102 (The offsetting emissions associated with the electricity used to recharge vehicle batteries were not estimated.) All employee trip reduction emissions saved are counted as indirect emissions reductions.  A4 Project Reports to 1605(b)  81   Los Angeles Department of Water and Power Electric Vehicles Project Description 117 vehicles Direct: 266.55  DWP operates a fleet of electric vehicles (EVs): 66 for general use, 8 for carpools, 17 VIP loaners, plus 26 buses used for the San Pedro Trolley and as shuttle buses during major conventions and local events. The Electric Vehicle Program also includes vehicle service (maintenance) and deployment, infrastructure improvements (installation of charging stations for cars, buses, airport shuttles), mass transit (San Pedro Trolley, Airport Shuttle Buses, including operations, maintenance, and capital outlays), as well as public outreach & education about electric vehicles. The electric vehicle program also encourages EV use in the city and provides subsidies for infrastructure improvements related to the use of EVs.  Estimation Method  Year 2000: Total miles saved (gasoline-powered vehicles) = 1,025,753, which includes vehicle miles eliminated due to carpooling and mass transit ridership of the electric San Pedro Trolley. (1025753 miles)(1 gal gas/20 miles)=51287.65 gals Formula No. 1: Emissions reduced from gasoline-powered vehicles = (51287.65 gallons of gasoline saved) x (19.564 lb CO2 /gal) / 2000 lbs per ton = 501.696 tons CO2 saved. Formula No. 2: Offsetting emissions from power plants = (253200 kWh of electricity used to charge vehicles) / 1,000,000] x (821 short tons CO2 /GWH system emissions factor) = 207.877 tons CO2 emitted. Formula No. 3: Net CO2 reductions = Emissions reduced from vehicles - offsetting emissions from power plants = 501.696 tons - 207.877 tons = 293.82 tons CO2 reduced. NOTE: System emission factors (st of CO2 /GWH) for previous years: 1996 = 968; 1997 = 972; 1998 = 965; 1999 = 856 National Grid USA Direct: 2.89  Electric Vehicles Project Description Estimation Method  2 vehicles, 8151 VMT  Indirect: -1.80  Massachusetts Electric Company has made available for employee use, two Toyota RAV4-EV`s to demonstrate that these zero-emission vehicles are practical, and to encourage their use instead of conventional gasoline-powered cars or pick-up trucks. The two RAV4-EVs together logged 8,151 miles from 2/16 2000 - 2/26/2001. Assumed that each vehicle would have consumed about 1 gallon of gasoline for every 25 miles driven. Utilized the Emission Coefficient from Appendix B of the Instructions for Form EIA-1605 of 19.564 pounds of CO2 per gallon of motor gasoline. Assumed that the RAV4-EVs get 3 miles per ac kWh of charging energy. Therefore: 8,151 miles X 1 gallon MV/25 mpg = 326 gallons. For the electricity associated indirect emission: 1999: (8000 mi) / (3 mi/kWh) / (1000 kWh/MWh) * (0.729 st/MWh) * (2000 lbs/st) = 3888 lbs CO2 2000: (8151 mi) / (3 mi/kWh) / (1000 kWh/MWh) * (0.729 st/MWh) * (2000 lbs/st) = 3961 lbs CO2  A4 Project Reports to 1605(b)  82   Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation Number of vehicles varied between 9 and 52; Alternative Fuel Vehicles Project Description Estimation Method 30 vehicles in 2000 Direct: 22.04  NMPC has been involved in operating and testing alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs) for almost 30 years. The Company also currently has a number of ""Clean Air"" natural gas-fueled buses in operation as part of a cooperative program with the Syracuse, New York Centro transit system. CO2 emission reductions are based on the difference in CO2 emissions between gasoline-fueled vehicles and CNG or electric vehicles. Only direct emission reductions are reported. Emissions estimates are based on a CO2 emission factor for each fuel. For motor gasoline, an emission factor of 19.641 lbs/gallon was used. For diesel fuel, an emission factor of 22.384 lbs/gallon was used. For CNG vehicles, a factor of 120.593 lbs/Mcf was used. These factors are based upon Form EIA-1605, Voluntary Reporting of Greenhouse Gases, Instructions, Appendix B. Fuel and Energy Source Codes and Emission Coefficients: EIA, 1996. For electric vehicles, NYPPs marginal emissions rate of 1.44 lbs/kWh for the years 1991-1995, rate of 1.48 lbs/kWh for 1996, and 1.46 lbs/kWh for 1997 and 1998 were used. These marginal rates were determined based on production simulation modeling (PROMOD IV). NiSource/NIPSCO  Electric Vehicles Project Description  1 vehicle in 1994-1997  N/A  NIPSCO expects to be a force in our region for educating the public on the environmental and efficiency benefits of electric vehicles. We lead by example with one electric truck in our fleet. Ozone is formed through the reaction of two precursor chemicals: Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) and Nitrogen Oxides (NOX). The electric vehicle will reduce emissions of VOCs and NOX and therefore decrease the amount of ozone formed. Additionally, most of the electricity needed to serve this market will be generated during off-peak hours, thereby allowing NIPSCO to benefit from a more efficient use of generating capacity. NIPSCO is currently participating in or will participate on the EPRI Transportation Business Council, the Mid-America Electric Vehicle Consortium, and the Electric Transportation Consortium. In addition, we support the Electric Racing Series and the University of Notre Dame electric car and we are trial marketing ""The Clean Switch"" catalog.

PG&E Corporation Electric Vehicles Project Description 32 vehicles in 1999; 26 vehicles in 2000 Direct: 2661.68  Pacific Gas and Electric Company Clean Air Vehicle Program: In 1990 Pacific Gas and Electric Company received California Public Utility Commission approval to spend up to $50 million by December 31, 1994 to support the development and introduction of electric and natural gas vehicles. By the end of 1993, Pacific Gas and Electric Company was operating 698 natural gas vehicles and 30 natural gas refueling stations. Encouragement took many forms: demonstrating vehicle and station performance, providing natural gas refueling station designs, providing partial funding for vehicle purchases, opening Company stations for public use, etc. After 1994, there was a decreased emphasis on customer financial support. But the Company has continued to promote, facilitate and encourage electric and natural gas vehicle use by its customers. Pacific Gas and Electric Company continues to claim credit for not only its own fuel displacement, but also for displacements that it has encouraged its customers to undertake.  Estimation Method  Electric fuel use reflects an estimate which takes into consideration Pacific Gas and Electric Company records of its own electric vehicle fleet use, and our records of electrical energy demand within electric vehicle tariffs, manufacturer reports of electric vehicles leased or sold to our customers, and our expectations of total energy use by such vehicles. Using the following factors, the Company calculates the CO2 emissions avoided through displaced gasoline. Pacific Gas and Electric Company's average fossil fuel emission rate in 1998 was 0.545 tons CO2 per MWh. The Company believes this to be the appropriate metric for generation to supply electric vehicles because fossil generation is typically at the margin in its energy mix. 0.545 tons CO2 per MWh from Company generation facilities 19.564. lbs CO2 per equivalent gallon of gasoline 7 KWh per gallon of gasoline in PG&E fleet In 1999 a total of 1.05 GWh of electricity was used to displace gasoline. 1,465 tons CO2 gasoline - 572 tons CO2 electricity = 893 tons CO2 avoided.  A4 Project Reports to 1605(b)  84   An identical methodology was applied to year 2000 data. Portland General Electric Co. Electric Fleet Vehicles Project Description Estimation Method 76,000 VMT over 5 years; 16,000 VMT in 2000 Direct: 4.42  PGE purchased two electric vehicles in April 1996 for general fleet use.  We know that 2 vehicles were converted in April of 1996. We assume the fleet vehicles travel 8000 mi/year each, that the gasoline mileage is 20 mi/gal, and that each gasoline vehicle emits 7838 pounds of CO2 per year and each Electric vehicle emits 3895 pounds per year. PPL Corporation 8 vehicles / 10,000 VMT in 1998;  Electric Vehicles  13 vehicles / 12024 VMT in 1999; 5 vehicles / 4625 VMT in 2000  Direct: 0.85  Project Description  In order to foster interest in electric vehicles (EVs) PPL Corporation has established initiatives in the areas of legislation, use, and demonstration. PPL Corporation supports state and national legislation pertaining to electric vehicles. PPL Corporation owns and operates a small fleet of EVs and had 5 electric vehicles in operation in 2000. Under provisions of the Energy Policy Act of 1992, PPL Corporation began using 8 EVs in fleet operations in 1998, and added 5 more in 1999. That EV data is reported here for the 2000 reporting year.

Emission reductions for this project may continue beyond this time, but reporting of future results will be determined by PPL on a case by case basis. Public Utility District No. 1 of Snohomish County Electric Car Race Project Description Estimation Method 1 race in 1996 N/A  Snohomish County PUD Sponsored a high school electric car race. Each car had two twelve volt batteries. The winner of the race was determined by who could go around an oval race track the most times in one hour. No emissions estimates were made for this project.  Sacramento Municipal Utility District Ride Electric Project Description 445,452 VMT over 7 years (1994-2000) Direct: 9.07  A key component of SMUDs Ride Electric Program is introduction and practical use of various electric vehicles in fleet service. Between 1990 and 2000, the District has acquired or assisted in acquisition of a large number of electric vehicles for its fleet and other Sacramento area fleets. These vehicles, which replaced gasoline and diesel powered vehicles, have accumulated 440,000 miles of service at SMUD, resulting in significant reductions in fossil fuel use, criteria pollutants and GHGs, to the benefit of the local community and its citizen-ratepayers. Actual Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) are tabulated for each vehicle in operation under the Ride Electric Program from District Vehicle Management System (VMS) records and other records maintained by the District. Gasoline and diesel fuel displacement is calculated by multiplying VMT of the electric vehicles in the District by the fuel use (gal/mile) of an equivalent gasoline or diesel powered vehicle, or in the case of a conversion from internal combustion engine (ICE) power to electric, actual ICE fuel use figures are used for the comparison. Emission rates for gasoline or diesel vehicles replaced by electric vehicles in the Ride Electric program are calculated by multiplying the vehicle fuel use rate (gal/mi) by the VMT by the EIA CO2 rate for the displaced fuel, and converting from lbs. CO2 to short tons of CO2. Emission rates for electric vehicles are calculated by multiplying the vehicle energy use (MWH/mi) by the vehicle miles by the CO2 generation rate (1485 lbs CO2/MWh) of the Districts marginal generating resources. Reductions are the net of these emissions.  Estimation Method  A4 Project Reports to 1605(b)  86   Southern Company Transportation Research Project Description 484 vehicles Direct: 927  Electric Transportation Technology - Southern Company continues to play a key role among the nation`s electric utilities in the development and demonstration of energy efficient electric transportation technology. During 2000, Southern Company successfully worked to expand the penetration of material handling vehicles, Neighborhood Electric Vehicles (NEV`s), and airport ground support equipment within the service territories. Electric and hybrid electric buses are now in service in Birmingham, and they are to be added in Mobile, Atlanta, and Gadsden. Fast charge projects for forklifts, airport ground support equipment, and buses are being conducted in Atlanta and Birmingham. Southern Company completed its involvement with USABC in 2000 at the conclusion of Phase II of that effort. Through its individual corporate contribution and through its affiliation with EPRI, Southern Company has invested more that $2.1million over the eight year duration of Phases I and II of USABC. Southern Company has also provided management and technical manpower in support of USABC`s efforts to develop advanced batteries for electric transportation and stationary applications. EPRI Electric Transportation Business Unit - Southern Company is the largest individual contributor to the Electric Transportation Business Unit of EPRI. In 2000, Southern Company contributed approximately $590,000 to EPRI in support of a variety of programs to develop and demonstrate EV batteries, charging infrastructure, public transit technologies, and industrial vehicles. In 2001 Southern Company will contribute approximately $400,000 to continue this research. The Commercialization of Electric Transportation - Southern Company supports the commercialization of EV`s through internal purchases, and by supporting commercial and industrial customers in evaluating and purchasing EV`s. Georgia Power Company continues an employee lease program for Southern Company employees in Atlanta by providing the opportunity to lease up to 100 EV`s per year. Alabama and Georgia Power both have successful customer EV loaner programs that have caused customers to lease vehicles based on business case, even though vehicle availability from OEM`s has decreased significantly. In 2000 Southern Company expanded its fleet to approximately 350 EV`s, including cars, trucks, neighborhood electric vehicles, and buses. Electric Vehicle Association of the Americas (EVAA): The mission of the EVAA is to provide a public policy framework that supports development of a widespread, sustainable market for electric vehicles. The EVAA serves as the official information source for electric vehicle technology and facilitates programs for market development. EVAA provides a national directory for electric vehicle recharging facilities and has developed infrastructure and technical reference manuals for EV Ready workshops sponsored by DOE. EVAA, with the support of Southern Company and other members, has been successful in lobbying Congress for significant dollars for airport funding and electric bus projects, as well as legislation that provides federal incentive and tax credit legislation promoting the purchase of electric vehicles.  Estimation Method  The reduction in CO2 due to operation of electric vehicles was calculated as follows: {[(miles driven/vehicle / 22 miles/gal) x 19.564 lb CO2/gal x no. vehicles] - (MWh x coal-fired heat rate x 205.3 lb CO2/MBtu)} / 2204.6 lb/mt Tennessee Valley Authority  Alternate Fuel Vehicles  19,760 VMT (1994)  N/A  A4 Project Reports to 1605(b)  87   Project Description  In 1994, TVA had 31 alternate fuel vehicles operating in its transportation fleet. These included 23 sedans fueled by M-85 (a blend of 85 percent methanol and 15 percent gasoline), 2 compressed natural gas vans, 5 electric pickup trucks, and one electric van. In question 4, the alternate fuel type listed as ""ZZ"" is the M-85. Project results for 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999 and 2000 are not reported as data were not available.  Estimation Method  The direct emissions shown in Part 3 are the emissions used to compute the reported emissions reductions. These are the total emissions from the TVA transportation fleet. The actual CO2 emissions were determined from the fuel consumed and the fuel emissions factor from Appendix B. See the previous project, Transportation Fleet Fuel Efficiency Improvements. The CO2 reductions as a result of alternate fuel vehicle (AFV) operation is the net difference between the modified reference case CO2 emissions and the actual emissions from the AFVs. The modified reference case emissions are the emissions that would have occurred had the miles driven by the AFVs been driven by the conventional fleet. The modified reference case emissions were determined from the actual AFV miles traveled, the average miles per gallon for the comparable conventional vehicles, the heating value of gasoline (125,100 BTU/Gal), and the gasoline emissions factor from Appendix B (157 lb CO2/MM BTU). It was assumed that the electric and CNG vehicles displaced emissions from the conventional 4X2 pickup fleet and the M-85 vehicles displaced emissions from the conventional sedan fleet. The actual emissions for the CNG and M-85 AFVs were determined from the fuel usage, the heating value of the fuel, and the fuel emissions factor. The heating value for CNG is 1000 BTU/Ft3 and for M-85 is 73,590 BTU/Gal. The emissions factor for CNG is 120 lbs CO2/MM BTU and 146 lbs CO2/MM BTU for M-85. To determine the actual emissions for the electric vehicles it was assumed that the energy used to charge the vehicles was generated by the TVA coal fired system. The emissions associated with the charging was determined from the KWH used, the average coal fired system heat rate, and the coal emissions factor from Appendix B.

The unit offsets CO2 emission from gasoline, although these offsets are not cumulative in nature. The truck was removed from service in 2000. The CO2 reductions are all based upon engineering estimates for both total miles driven and the approximate gas mileage for the vehicle. The analysis assumes that electricity for operating the truck was generated by Waverly hydroelectric generating capability.

This has changed dramatically in recent decades, however,          as the U.S. economy has shifted more towards services and technology and          away from traditional energy-intensive industries like raw material extraction,          steel production, and others. Still, the United States remains the largest          energy consumer in the world, and also the world's largest emitter of          energy-related carbon dioxide. With the exception of Australia, most other          industrialized countries rely much less heavily on coal, which is highly          carbon intensive, to meet domestic energy needs than does the United States.                 The United States, Canada and Mexico cooperate in the Commission for          Environmental Cooperation (CEC), a trinational organization established          under the environmental side agreement to the North American Free Trade          Agreement (NAFTA). The CEC addresses environmental concerns associated          with increased trade in North America.  Many energy-related environmental          issues, such as air pollution and ""acid rain,"" transcend international          boundaries         In June 2003, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a          draft ""Report on the Environment,"" which outlined current U.S.          environmental conditions and trends. According to the EPA, this report          provided the first-ever national picture of the U.S. environment. Among          the major conclusions of the report were: 1) ""Over the last 30 years,          total emissions of six principal air pollutants have decreased by nearly          25%, resulting in lower concentrations of these pollutants in ambient          air;"" 2) ""One of the major components of acid rain, wet sulfate          deposition, has declined. Wet sulfate deposition levels for 1999-2001          showed reductions of 20%-30% compared to levels for 1989-1991 over widespread          areas in the Midwest and the eastern U.S., where acid rain has had its          greatest impact; and 3) Air toxics emissions have declined, with the National          Toxics Inventory estimating that nationwide air toxics emissions decreased          almost 24% from baseline levels (1990-1993) to 4.7 million tons annually          in 1996.         Air          Pollution          Motor vehicles represent the single largest anthropogenic (man-made) source          of air pollution in the United States. In recent years, the shift away          from cars towards larger vehicles, such as sports utility vehicles (SUV's),          is responsible for a reversal of years in fuel efficiency improvements          to the U.S. motor vehicle fleet. Fuel efficiency technology improvements          generally have not been sufficient to compensate for the increasing popularity          of SUV's and other relatively fuel-inefficient vehicles. These vehicles          produce, on average, one-third more carbon dioxide per mile than the average          passenger car.         As required by the Clean Air Act (CAA), the U.S. petroleum refining industry          has responded to five major new Federal rules on motor gasoline product          quality in the last 14 years or so: Phase 1 Summer Volatility (RVP) Regulation          (June 1989); Phase 2 Summer Volatility Regulation (May 1992); Oxygenated          Gasoline (November 1992); Reformulated Gasoline Phase 1 (December 1994);          and Reformulated Gasoline Phase 2 (January 2000). Oxygenates were first          required in the wintertime oxygenated gasoline program to reduce exhaust          emissions of carbon monoxide (CO) in 39 areas of the country. The oxygenated          gasoline program requires oxygen at a minimum level of 2.7 weight percent          (equivalent to 15.0 volume percent MTBE or 7.4 volume percent fuel ethanol).                 The reformulated gasoline (RFG) program requires reductions in automobile          emissions of ozone-forming volatile organic compounds during the summer          high-ozone season, and of toxic air pollutants and nitrogen oxides during          the entire year in certain areas of the United States. RFG requires a          minimum 2.1% oxygen by weight when averaging, which corresponds to approximately          11.7 volume percent MTBE or 5.8 volume percent ethanol. While the sale          of Federal reformulated gasoline was mandated for only nine areas in the          nation with the most severe ozone pollution, other areas are allowed to          voluntarily join the Federal RFG program.          The EPA also targeted air pollution from diesel engine-powered highway          vehicles such as trucks and buses. The low-sulfur diesel fuel program,          which began in October 1993, reduced the allowable sulfur level in diesel          fuel from 5,000 to maximum 500 parts per million (ppm). In December 2000,          the EPA issued a final rulemaking that requires further reductions in          the sulfur content of highway diesel fuel, which would in turn require          significant investments by diesel-fuel refiners. The new rulemaking imposes          a sulfur limit of 15 ppm However, pipeline owners are expected to require          refiners to reduce sulfur content below 10 ppm to provide a tolerance          for testing and to offset contamination from other sulfur-bearing products          shipped by pipeline. The new fuel must be available at retail stations          by September 1, 2006, although a phase-in option allows up to one-fifth          of all diesel fuel produced to meet only the 500 ppm limit through early          2010. Because the sharply lower sulfur limit will entail new capital investment          and higher operating costs for refiners, there are concerns that the transition          to ultra-low-sulfur diesel (ULSD) fuel might constrain supplies of diesel          fuel and raise prices.          In late 1999, the EPA released rules on new federal emission standards          (“Tier 2"") for passenger cars, light trucks, and larger passenger          vehicles. The Tier 2 rules, which takes effect on January 1, 2004, are          designed to reduce emissions most responsible for ozone and particulate          matter (PM) impact from these vehicles -- nitrogen oxides (NOx) and non-methane          organic gases (NMOG), consisting primarily of hydrocarbons (HC) and contributing          to ambient volatile organic compounds (VOC). Tier 2 also requires a reduction          in gasoline sulfur to 30 ppm by 2006. The program will, for the first          time, apply the same set of federal standards to all passenger cars, light          trucks, and medium-duty passenger vehicles.         The CAA was amended in 1990, addressing numerous air quality problems          in the United States that were not entirely covered in earlier legislation.          One of these problems is acid rain caused by sulfur dioxide (SO2) and          nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions from fossil-fueled electric power plants          and, to a lesser extent, from other industrial and transportation sources.          The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA90) called for annual emissions          of sulfur dioxide (SO2) by electricity generators to be reduced to approximately          12 million tons in 1996, 9.48 million tons between 2000 and 2009, and          8.95 million tons per year thereafter. Because companies can bank allowances          for future use, however, the long-term cap of 8.95 million tons per year          is not expected to be reached until after 2011. More than 95% of the SO2          produced by generators results from coal combustion and the rest from          residual oil.          CAAA90 called for the reductions to occur in two phases, with larger          (more than 100 megawatts) and higher emitting (more than 2.5 pounds per          million Btu) plants making reductions first. In Phase 1, which began in          1995, 261 generating units at 110 plants were issued tradable emissions          allowances permitting SO2 emissions to reach a fixed amount per year—generally          less than the plant’s historical emissions. Allowances could also          be banked for use in future years. Switching to lower sulfur subbituminous          coal was the option chosen by most generators, as only about 12 gigawatts          of capacity had been retrofitted with scrubbers by 1995.          Nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions from U.S. electricity generation are projected          to fall as new regulations take effect. The required reductions are intended          to reduce the formation of ground-level ozone, for which NOx emissions          are a major precursor. Together with volatile organic compounds and hot          weather, NOx emissions contribute to unhealthy air quality in many areas          during the summer months. CAAA90 NOx reduction program called for reductions          at electric power plants in two phases, the first in 1995 and the second          in 2000. The second phase of CAAA90 resulted in NOx reductions of 0.6          million tons between 1999 and 2000.          On April 21, 2003, the Department of Justice and the EPA announced the          largest CAA enforcement settlement with a power utility. Under the agreement,          Dominion Virginia Power agreed to spend $1.2 billion by 2013 to eliminate          237,000 tons per year of nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide from eight          coal-fired power plants in Virginia and West Virginia. The aim is to bring          the utility into full compliance with New Source Review (NSR) requirements          under the CAA. Despite the settlement, several states attorneys general,          mainly in the Northeast, sued the EPA to prevent it from relaxing NSR          regulations.          On the same date that the Dominion settlement was reached, a study conducted          by the National Academy of Public Administration (NAPA) at the request          of Congress was released. The NAPA study concluded that NSR works well          in controlling air pollution from new power facilities, but not from older          ones. NAPA recommended that the CAA be amended to set up a mandatory,          three-tiered (cap-and-trade, cap-and-net, unit-cap), performance-based          system to control emissions. In addition, the NAPA study recommended that          each tier be based on performance of the cleanest technologies available.                 In July 2002, President Bush submitted his initial ""Clear Skies""          legislation -- first announced in February 2002 -- to Congress. ""Clear          Skies"" would create a mandatory program that aims to reduce power          plant emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and mercury          -- but not carbon dioxide -- by setting a national ""cap and trade""          system for each pollutant. Under the plan, EPA is to issue a final regulation          by December 15, 2004, and require compliance by December 2007. Mercury          is set to be regulated under the CAAA90, which states that ""Maximum          Achievable Control Technology"" (MACT) must be applied, with a goal          of reducing mercury emissions 69% by 2018.          According to the EPA, ""Clear Skies"" was proposed in response          to a growing need for an emission reduction plan that will protect human          health and the environment while providing regulatory certainty to the          industry. The program was reintroduced in the US House of Representatives          (HR 999) and the US Senate (S. 485) as the Clear Skies Act of 2003 on          February 27, 2003. If it becomes law, the plan also would amend NSR regulations,          which critics charge would allow for more pollution from aging, coal-fired          power plants. Critics like the League of Conservation Voters (LCV), however,          charged that the plan would in fact, ""repeal and weaken public health          protections of the current Clean Air Act, while replacing them with standards          that are at best deferred and incomplete.""          MTBE          The blending of methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) into motor gasoline          has increased dramatically since it was first produced 20 years ago. MTBE          usage grew in the early 1980's in response to octane demand resulting          initially from the phaseout of lead from gasoline and later from rising          demand for premium gasoline. The oxygenated gasoline program stimulated          an increase in MTBE production between 1990 and 1994. MTBE demand increased          from 83,000 in 1990 to 161,000 barrels per day in 1994. The reformulated          gasoline (RFG) program provided a further boost to oxygenate blending.          The MTBE contained in motor gasoline increased to 269,000 barrels per          day by 1997.         Unfortunately, because of leaking underground storage tanks or spills          and because MTBE is soluble in water and does not biodegrade easily, there          have been increasing detections of MTBE in ground waters and reservoirs.          Because of the occurrence of MTBE in water supplies, the EPA formed the          Blue Ribbon Panel On Oxygenates in Gasoline. In September 1999, the Panel          issued its final report that included the following recommendations on          MTBE use: 1) ""Reduce the use of MTBE substantially (with some members          supporting its complete phase-out), and action by Congress to clarify          federal and state authority to regulate and/or eliminate the use of gasoline          additives that threaten drinking water supplies;"" and 2) ""The          current Clean Air Act requirement to require 2% oxygen, by weight, in          RFG must be removed in order to provide flexibility to blend adequate          fuel supplies in a cost-effective manner while quickly reducing usage          of MTBE and maintaining air quality benefits.""           In December 1999, the California Air Resources Board approved the California          Phase 3 gasoline regulation, which prohibits the formulation of gasoline          with MTBE after December 31, 2002. In March 2002, Governor Gray Davis          issue and executive order calling for a one-year phaseout of MTBE, with          the process to be completed by December 31, 2003. In addition to California,          16 other states (plus the city of Chicago) have enacted MTBE bans.         Energy Production          The United States produced around 5.7 million barrels per day (bbl/d)          of crude oil in 2002, plus another 1.9 million bbl/d of natural gas liquids.          In addition, the country produced a large volume of natural gas (19 trillion          cubic feet - Tcf) and coal (1.1 billion short tons) in that year. U.S.          crude oil production has fallen from around 9 million bbl/d in 1985, while          natural gas production has risen sharply, from 16.5 Tcf in 1985 to 19          Tcf in 2002. U.S. total coal output has increased from 884 million short          tons in 1985 to 1.1 billion short tons in 2002. Production and transportation          of energy often has significant environmental implications.         The decline in U.S. domestic crude oil output over the past decade or          so has led to calls for opening up additional areas to oil exploration          and production activities. One of the most controversial of these areas          is located in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, or ANWR. In March 2003,          the National Academy of Sciences issues a report stating that oil exploration          in the ANWR had definitely affected the environment in that region since          oil was discovered there in 1968. In April 2003, the U.S. House of Representatives          voted to include an ANWR drilling provision in comprehensive energy legislation,          but the Senate energy bill passed on July 31, 2003 does not permit ANWR          drilling and must be reconciled with the House bill in conference committee.          The legislation is currently being negotiated in a House-Senate Conference          Committee.         Several areas off the U.S. coast are believed to contain significant          oil and natural gas deposits, but have been placed off limits to development.          These areas include Federal waters off the East and West coasts and in          the eastern Gulf of Mexico. In December 2001, a small area south of the          Florida/Alabama border was opened through a lease sale, but another area          off the coast of Florida was put off limits when the Federal Government          agreed to buy back leases from ChevronTexaco, ConocoPhillips, and Murphy          Oil.         Energy          Use and Carbon Emissions          In 2001, the United States consumed 97.1 quadrillion Btu (quads) of energy,          representing 24% of total world primary energy consumption. The United          States emitted 1,883 million metric tons of carbon in that year, accounting          for around 24% of world energy-related carbon emissions. U.S. carbon emissions          actually fell in 2001, by 1.2%, as economic growth and manufacturing activity          slowed, and as relatively warm winter temperatures reduced heating fuel          demand.         Although the Bush Administration announced in March 2001 that it would          not participate in the Kyoto Protoco limiting greenhouse gas emissions,          the U.S. government has introduced a series of alternative measures. In          2001, for instance, President Bush launched three initiatives: the Climate          Change Research Initiative to accelerate science-based climate change          policy development; the National Climate Change Technology Initiative          to advance energy and sequestration technology development; and increased          international cooperation to engage and support other nations on climate          change research and clean technologies.          In July 2002, California became the first state in the country to regulate          carbon emissions from motor vehicles. California ranks second in the country,          behind Texas, in carbon emissions, with 40% coming from passenger vehicles.          Under the law, the California Air Resources Board will develop carbon          emissions standards for vehicles in model year 2009 and beyond. Under          the CAA, California is the only state allowed to set pollution rules overriding          federal law. Partly as a result, California has the strictest air quality          standards in the country. Also under the CAA, any state is allowed to          adopt California's emissions standards in place of weaker Federal rules,          making California an important state both in its own right and also as          a trendsetter for other parts of the country.          In February 2003, the U.S. Department of Energy launched President Bush’s          “Climate VISION” (Voluntary Innovative Sector Initiatives:          Opportunities Now) plan. The program is intended to help meet the President’s          goal of reducing U.S. greenhouse gas intensity (the amount of carbon emitted          per dollar of economic output) by 18% between 2002 and 2012. The program          involves various Federal agencies working with industrial partners to          reduce greenhouse gas emissions voluntarily over the next decade. In late          January 2003, fourteen companies -- including Dupont, Ford, and Motorola          -- established the Chicago Climate Exchange, which will allow for trading          of greenhouse gas emissions credits amongst the companies. President Bush's          Climate VISION program, however, will not actually reduce the absolute          level of U.S. carbon emissions, only the ""intensity"" of emissions.          EIA projects that U.S. carbon emissions will grow by 1.5% annually from          2001 to 2025.         Meanwhile, the attorneys general of seven states (Connecticut, Maine,          Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, and Washington) announced          in February 2003 that they would sue the Bush Administration in order          to force it to take action to curtail carbon emissions from power plants.          In June 2003, the suit was filed by three of those states -- Connecticut,          Maine, and Massachusetts -- in Federal District Court, with the plaintiffs          claiming that that the EPA has a mandatory duty to regulate carbon dioxide          under the Clean Air Act.            Energy          and Carbon Intensity          Historically, the United States relied heavily on energy intensive industries,          but this has changed over the past several decades as the country has          moved towards a more service-oriented, infomation-based economy. In 2002,          U.S. energy intensity (the amount of energy consumed per dollar of GDP)          was 11,047 Btu per $1995 (using purchasing power parity, or PPP, exchange          rates). U.S. energy intensity is well below Canada's (16,452 Btu/$1995),.          but considerably higher than other industrialized nations such as the          United Kingdom (7,628 Btu/$1995), France (8,255 Btu/$1995), and Japan          (7,295 Btu/$1995).          U.S. carbon intensity in 2002 was 0.17 metric tons of carbon per thousand          $1995 (in PPP exchange rates), lower than Canada (0.20 metric tons/$1995)          but higher than most other OECD countries. France, for instance, with          its heavy reliance on nuclear power, emitted only 0.08 metric tons/$1995          in 2002, while Italy and Japan each emitted around 0.10 metric tons/$1995.          The higher U.S. carbon intensity in comparison to many other OECD countries          in part reflects the country's relatively high reliance on carbon-intensive          coal for power generation.         U.S. energy intensity declined at an average annual rate of 2.3% between          1970 and 1986, as oil prices spiked and the economy shifted to less energy-intensive          industries and more fuel efficient vehicles. With the collapse of oil          prices in late 1985/early 1986, followed by years of relative oil price          stability, intensity declines moderated, averaging 1.4% per year between          1986 and 2001. Energy use per person generally declined from 1970 through          the mid-1980s but began to increase as energy prices declined and stayed          relative low during the late 1980s and 1990s.          One factor slowing the decline in U.S. energy intensity is the fact that          newly built homes today are, on average, 18% larger than the existing          housing stock, with correspondingly greater needs for heating, cooling,          and lighting. Under current building codes and appliance standards, however,          energy use per square foot is typically lower for new construction than          for the existing stock. Further reductions in residential energy use per          square foot could result from additional gains in equipment efficiency          and more stringent building codes, requiring more insulation, better windows,          and more efficient building designs.         Energy use for space heating, the most energy intensive end use in the          residential sector, grew by 1.3% per year from 1990 to 1997. Future growth          is expected to be slowed by higher equipment efficiency and tighter building          codes. Building shell efficiency gains are projected to cut space heating          demand by about 9% per household in 2025 relative to the demand in 1997.          A variety of appliances are now subject to minimum efficiency standards,          including heat pumps, air conditioners, furnaces, refrigerators, and water          heaters.          Current standards for a typical residential refrigerator, which became          effective in July 2001, limit electricity use to 478 kilowatthours per          year. Energy use for refrigeration has declined by 1.3% per year from          1990 to 1997 and is expected to decline by about 1.4% per year through          2025, as older, less efficient refrigerators are replaced with newer models.                 The “all other” category, which includes smaller appliances          such as personal computers, dishwashers, clothes washers, and dryers,          has grown by 2.6% per year from 1990 to 1997 and now accounts for 28%          of residential primary energy use.                                   Per Capita Energy Consumption and Carbon Emissions          U.S. per capita energy consumption in 2002 was 338.4 million Btu per person,          below the Canadian level of 410.8 million Btu per person, but higher than          other OECD countries. In 2002, for instance, the United Kingdom consumed          about 164 million Btu of energy per person, France around 182 million          Btu per person, and Japan approximately 172 million Btu per person..                     U.S. per capita carbon emissions of 5.3 metric tons in 2002 were the highest          in the OECD. In comparison, Canada -- with large amounts of hydropower          and nuclear, neither one of which emit carbon -- had estimated per capita          carbon emissions of 5.0 metrc tons. France's per capita carbon emissions          were far lower, at 1.8 metric tons, as were Italy's (2.1) and Japan's          (2.5). U.S. per capita carbon emissions, while decreasing slightly from          their 1977 level of 5.9 metric tons of carbon per person, have remained          fairly steady over the past 20 years.         Renewable          Energy           Renewable resources account for more than 90% of total U.S. energy resources.          Geothermal, solar, and wind resources are particularly plentiful, raising          prospects for their expanded use in the future. However, today renewable          resources -- including hydropower-- account for only about 6% of the country's          commercial energy consumption. Around 92% of renewable power in the United          States today is biomass and hydroelectricity.           Although it currently represents just a tiny fraction of total U.S. energy          consumption, wind energy use is increasing rapidly in the United States.          The American Wind Energy Association (AWEA) estimates that U.S. wind power          capacity will grow by 25% in 2003, from 4,700 megawatts (MW) to 6,000          MW. The AWEA also estimates that by 2020, wind power could supply at least          6% of U.S. electric power needs. One incentive that has been helping to          fuel the recent growth in wind power is the Federal wind production tax          credit (PTC), scheduled to expire on December 31, 2003. The AWEA has stated          that the PTC is crucial to the future of wind power development in the          United States. In addition to the PTC, several states, including big states          like California, New York and Texas, have put in place ""portfolio          standards"" for the use of renewable energy sources such as wind power.          Congress also has been considering the possibility of setting such a standard          nationwide. Even without such incentives, however, the cost of wind power          production has fallen substantially in recent years, with wind turbines          now larger (3.2-3.6 MW each; 262 feet tall), more efficient, and less          costly to operate (an estimated 2.9-3.9 cents per kilowatthour, comparable          to coal and natural gas, according to a 2001 article in  Science  magazine)          than at anytime in the past. As a result, major wind farm projects are          being considered for various locations, including off of Cape Cod, as          well as in the Great Plains and other areas where wind and land are plentiful.         Biomass plays a relatively small role in the U.S. energy picture, with          ""wood, waste, and alcohol"" making up about 2.8% of U.S. energy          consumption in 2002. For the most part, biomass use in the United States          consists of residues from pulp and paper processing being used to generate          electricity and steam. Wood and agricultural residues also are used as          fuels for power production and steam in the U.S. industrial sector. Also,          U.S. demand for ethanol -- a renewable transportation fuel -- is now growing          rapidly, in part because of the bans on MTBE.          In his January 2003 State of the Union Address, President Bush announced          a $1.2 billion hydrogen fuel initiative aimed at developing technologies          to produce, store, and distribute hydrogen as a fuel for power generation          and transportation. Also, the Bush Administration has initiated a program          called ""FreedomCAR"" (Cooperative Automotive Research) which          aims to develop hydrogen fuel cell technology, hydrogen infrastructure,          and advanced automotive technologies such as hydrogen-powered fuel cell          vehicles.         In early September 2003, the United States, along with major oil producing          countries attending the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg,          South Africa, rejected the adoption of firm targets or timetables for          renewable power growth worldwide. The European Union had been pushing          for a 15% target for renewable power by 2010.         Nuclear          Waste          In 2002, over 8% of U.S. energy consumption came from nuclear power. A          byproduct of nuclear power production is spent nuclear material, which          is radioactive and must be stored in secure locations. In July 2002, the          U.S. Senate approved (and President Bush signed) a law making Nevada's          Yucca Mountain the nation's official nuclear waste storage facility, with          the first shipment sof nuclear materials set to start in 2010. In January          2003, however, Nevada filed a constitutional challenge to the law, claiming          that the state would bear an undue burden imposed against its will and          ""in derogation of the sovereignty"" of the state.            Outlook          According to the United States Energy Information Agency's (EIA) ""Annual          Energy Outlook 2003"" (AEO 2003), U.S. energy consumption is expected to          increase at an average annual rate of 1.5% through 2025, to 139.1 quads.          Total carbon emissions also are expected to grow at a 1.5% annual rate,          reaching 2,237 million metric tons by 2025, compared to 1,559 million          metric tons in 2001. Given expected U.S. economic growth of around 3.0%          annually from 2001 through 2025, it is likely that carbon emissions per          dollar of GDP will decline by about 30% over the period but that carbon          emissions overall will keep growing. Carbon emissions per person are projected          to reach 6.6 metric tons per person in 2025, up from 5.6 metric tons per          person in 2001. Also according to the AEO 2003, U.S. natural gas consumption          is expected to grow at an annual rate of 1.8% through 2025, nuclear energy          at a rate of 0.2%, coal at 1.2%, and ""renewables"" (including          hydropower, wind, solar, etc.) at 2.1%.

OIL-AND-GAS RESOURCES OF ALASKA History of Oil-and-gas Exploration and Development Oil seeps in Alaska were first reported by Russian traders over 130 years ago. The first exploratory wildcat well was drilled on the Iniskin Peninsula on the west side of lower Cook Inlet in 1898, and in 1902, the first commercial hydrocarbon discovery was drilled at Katalla, Gulf of Alaska. The Katalla field produced oil until 1931, when the topping plant burned. This plant had supplied refined petroleum products to the Kennicott Copper Mine at McCarthy. The first major oil field in Alaska was discovered in 1951 on the Kenai Peninsula, when the Richfield Oil Company initially drilled the Swanson River field. Other commercial oil-andgas discoveries in the area soon delineated the Kenai Peninsula as a major petroleum-producing province. The Atlantic Richfield Company discovered the supergiant field, Prudhoe Ray, in 1968. At the time of discovery, this field had producible reserves of approximately 9.6 billion barrels of oil and 26 trillion cubic feet of gas.

Since then, oil has moved through the pipeline from Prudhoe Bay to Valdez, where it is loaded onto tankers for shipment to refineries along the west coast.  0 Point Thompson area: Estimates of 350 million barrels of recoverable condensate (very high gravity, highquality oil) and 6 trillion cubic feet of recoverable gas. oLisbume Pool: 3 billion barrels of in-place oil that underlie the producing Sadlerochit reservoir (Prudhoe Bay field); possibly 500 million barrels recoverable. o Milne Point area: 60 million barrels of recoverable oil. OGwydyr Bay area: 30 million barrels of recoverable oil. Other discoveries are in the early stages of delineation: (3 West Sak - Ugnu area: These shallow sands contain large reserves of heavy oil. Fifteen to 25 billion barrels of oil may be in place in the West Sak sands, with as much as 3 to 5 billion barrels ultimately recoverable. Although preliminary hot-water-injection projects are being conducted, commercial production is uncertain. Commercial development of heavy oil in the shallow Ugnu sands (6 to 11 billion barrels in place) is currently beyond the technological capability of industry. 0 Seal Island: produced up 40' gravity cubic feet of ation wells drilled.

Delineare currently being  Current Prospects Approximately 85 percent of the State of Alaska's current revenue is derived from royalties and taxes paid on state-owned oil-and-gas leases. Production from many Cook Inlet fields is declining, and production from the Prudhoe Bay field is expected to substantially decline in the 1990s. Indications from current North Slope oil-and-gas exploration are encouraging. Recently discovered accumulations in the following areas are estimated to total 2.5 billion barrels of recoverable oil. q  Kuparuk field: Approximately 1.2 billion barrels of recoverable oil; currently producing over 190,000 barrels per day. Duck Island - Sag Delta area: 1.1 billion barrels of in-place oil with up to 350 million barrels recoverable, not including an unknown quantity of free and associated gas. Production is from Endicott Group rocks that are not productive in the Kuparuk and Prudhoe Bay fields.  q  2  3   Construction. of North Star Island was completed in 1985.

OColville Delta: In 1985 Texaco announced a discovery well that produced from 414 to 1,076 barrels of oil per day. No estimate of in-place reserves has been made. According to the National Petroleum Council (1981), estimates for undiscovered, conditional, in-place oil resources in Alaska range from 2.5 to 14.6 billion barrels onshore and 4.6 to 24.2 billion barrels offshore (95-percent and 5-percent probability levels, respectively). Between September 1984 and August 1985, exploratory drilling proceeded at a moderate to fast pace. Of nine new wells drilled on state leases, Texaco announced one discovery at Colville Delta No. 1. Nineteen wildcat wells were drilled on federal leases in the St. George Basin, Norton Sound, Navarin Basin, lower Cook Inlet Shelikof Strait, and Beaufort Sea areas, but none encountered commercial-grade hydrocarbon deposits. Additionally, one dry hole was drilled onshore on a federal lease in the National Petroleum Reserve Alaska. Six federal outer continental shelf wells are operating in the state. Additional permitted locations will be drilled during the fall of 1985 or during the 1985-86 winter drilling season. Development activity is extensive in both the Prudhoe Bay and Kuparuk fields. Delineation and development drilling are especially active on the Seal Island and Milne Point accumulations. During the past year, the private sector proceeded with development of the Endicott reservoir at Duck Island and  successfully used the first Concrete Island Drilling System (CIDS).  Resource The map of Alaska (p. 9) identifies the state's hydrocarbon resources based on estimates by the U.S. Geological Survey and National Petroleum Council. These estimates were made in 1981 and were subsequently modified from Ehm (1983) for this document. Resource estimates released in July 1984 by the U.S. Department of Interior Minerals Management Service (Cooke, 1985) are also shown on the map. The Alaska Department of Natural Resources Division of Geological and Geophysical Surveys recently published Special Report 32 (Ehm, 1983), which shows major oil-and-gas basins in Alaska.  Estimates  Oil-and-gas Leasing Program The Alaska Department of Natural Resources is responsible for managing Alaska's oil-and-gas resources. Annually a 5-year schedule for the leasing of state land for oil-and-gas exploration is submitted to the Legislature. The major purpose of this schedule is to facilitate the orderly assessment and development of Alaska's petroleum resources. All Alaskans, including local citizens and governments, environmental groups, the oil-and-gas industry, and the business sector benefit from a fixed and predict5   Gravel pad: containment pit, and drill rig on the North Slope near Prudhoe Bay.

Rawlinson, 1978. able leasing program because an established leasing schedule permits the public to comment on areas that may be leased, allows business and labor to plan employment or business opportunities, permits the petroleum industry to allocate a portion of its resources to petroleum exploration and development, and gives local, state, and federal governments adequate time for presale evaluation, assessment, and mitigation of impacts. The 5-year lease-sale schedule may be obtained from the Alaska Department of Natural Resources Division of Oil and Gas (1985).

ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  SUMMARY: In this action, we are proposing emission standards for new  marine diesel engines at or above 30 liters per cylinder and 2.5 to 30  liters per cylinder on U.S. vessels. Marine diesel engines at or above  30 liters per cylinder are very large marine engines used primarily for  propulsion power on ocean-going vessels such as container ships,  tankers, bulk carriers, and cruise ships. The vessels that use these  engines are flagged in the United States and in other countries.  Nationwide, these engines contribute to ozone and carbon monoxide  nonattainment and to ambient particulate matter levels, particularly in  commercial ports and along coastal areas.     We are proposing emission controls for these engines at or above 30  liters per cylinder on U.S. vessels. We are proposing a first tier that  is equivalent to the internationally negotiated oxides of nitrogen  standards and would be enforceable under U.S. law for new engines built  in 2004 and later. We are also considering adoption of a subsequent  second tier of standards, which would reflect additional reductions  that can be achieved through engine-based controls, and would apply to  new engines built after 2006 or later. In addition, we are proposing  voluntary low-emission engine standards that reflect advanced oxides of  nitrogen emission-control technologies. Meeting these standards would  likely require the use of technologies such as selective catalyst  reduction or fuel cells. If the second tier is promulgated, we would  review the second tier standards prior to their effective date to take  into consideration continued development of new technologies, such as  selective catalyst reduction and water-based emission reduction  techniques, and international activity such as action at the  International Maritime Organization to set more stringent international  standards. Consistent with these factors, EPA is also considering not  adopting Tier 2 standards in this rulemaking, and instead establishing  a schedule for a future rulemaking and addressing Tier 2 standards in  that future rulemaking.     Emissions from all marine diesel engines at or above 30 liters per  cylinder, regardless of flag of registry, currently account for about  1.5 percent of national mobile source oxides of nitrogen emissions.  This contribution can be significantly higher on a port-specific basis  (5 to 25 percent of mobile source emissions in certain key ports by the  year 2020). The standards discussed in this notice, which would apply  only to new engines on U.S. flag vessels, are expected to reduce these  national emissions by about 11 percent by 2030.     The contribution of these engines to national mobile source  hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide inventories is small, less than 0.1  percent, and we are considering standards to ensure that these  emissions do not increase on a engine-specific basis. The contribution  of these engines to the national mobile source particulate matter  inventory is about 2.6 percent. Reductions in particulate emissions  could be obtained from setting a sulfur content standard for the fuels  that are used by these engines, and we request comment on whether we  should adopt such standards and, if so, the level of sulfur that should  be allowed.     We are also proposing new requirements for engines at or above 2.5  liters per cylinder but less than 30 liters per cylinder. The Tier 2  standards finalized for these engines in our 1999 commercial marine  diesel engine rule apply beginning in 2007. Until then, engine  manufacturers are encouraged to voluntarily comply with the Tier 1  standards, which are equivalent to the internationally negotiated  NO X  standards. The international NO X  standards  are not yet enforceable. Given that they have not yet entered into  force, we believe it is appropriate to begin to require engine  manufacturers to certify these engines to the Tier 1 standards,  starting in 2004. We are also proposing to eliminate the foreign trade  exemption for all marine diesel engines, which was available for  engines installed on vessels that spend less than 25 percent of total  operating time with 320 kilometers of U.S. territory.     The proposed standards would apply to engines installed on vessels  flagged in the United States. Recognizing that foreign-flag vessels  constitute a significant portion of emissions from these engines, we  are seeking comment on whether the proposed standards and existing  Category 1 and Category 2 standards should also apply to marine engines  on foreign vessels entering U.S. ports and to no longer exclude such  foreign vessels from the emission standards. If we were to determine  that the standards should apply to engines on foreign vessels that  enter U.S. ports, then all emission standards for marine diesel engines  would apply, including those we finalized for marine diesel engines  less than 30 liters per cylinder in our 1999 rule.

Energy Effects (Executive Order 13211)  I. Introduction  A. Overview      Marine diesel engines can be significant contributors to local  ozone, CO, and PM levels, particularly in commercial ports and along  coastal areas. In recognition of their inventory impact, we recently  set emission standards for new marine diesel engines above 37 kW but  less than 30 liters per cylinder ( 64 FR 73300 , December 29, 1999). The  standards contained in that rule cover emissions of oxides of nitrogen  (NO X ), particulate matter (PM), hydrocarbons (HC), and  carbon monoxide (CO), and go into effect in 2004-2007, depending on  engine size. Those standards are more stringent than the international  standards contained in Annex VI to the International Convention on the  Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973, as Modified by the Protocol  of 1978 Relating Thereto (this convention is also known as MARPOL; the  standards are referred to as the Annex VI NO X  limits).\1\  They also cover more pollutants, as the MARPOL limits are for  NO X  emissions only. As described in Section D, below, the  Annex has not yet gone into force because the requisite number of  countries have not ratified it. Prior to the effective date of the  national standards, engine manufacturers are encouraged to voluntarily  comply with the Annex VI NO X  limits pending entry into force  of Annex VI. We developed a voluntary certification program to enable  engine manufacturers to certify to the Annex VI NO X  limits  prior to the Annex VI requirements entering into force. The national  emission requirements apply only to engines on vessels flagged in the  United States. Marine engines on foreign vessels were not covered by  the rule. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \1\ Annex VI was adopted by a Conference of the Parties to  MARPOL on September 26, 1997, but has not yet entered into force.  Copies of the conference versions of the Annex and the NOx Technical  Code can be found in Docket A-95-50, Document II.B.01. Copies of  updated versions can be obtained from the International Maritime  Organization ( www.imo.org .)   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      We did not set standards for new marine diesel engines at or above  30 liters per cylinder in our 1999 rule. Our analysis at the time  indicated that the Annex VI NO X  limits were appropriate  given the operating characteristics and fuel used by these engines.  Rather than duplicate the Annex VI emission control program in our  federal regulations, we encouraged engine manufacturers to comply with  the Annex VI limits using our voluntary certification program.     We also indicated that we would revisit the need to adopt emission  limits for these engines under the Clean Air Act if the Annex does not  go into effect internationally.     Although more than four years have gone by since Annex VI was  adopted by the Parties to the Convention, it has not yet entered into  force. There is growing concern in the United States that there are no  enforceable standards for these large marine engines. Also, recently  developed inventories suggest that the inventory contribution of these  engines can be very high in individual port areas. We estimate that  these engines account for about 1.5 percent of national mobile source  NO X  emissions. This contribution can be significantly higher  on a port-specific basis. For example, we estimate that these engines  contribute about 7 percent of mobile source NO X  in the  Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSA) of Baton Rouge/New Orleans and  Wilmington NC, about 5 percent of mobile source NO X  in the  Miami/ Fort Lauderdale and Corpus Christi MSAs, and about 4 percent in  the Seattle/Tacoma/Bremerton/Bellingham MSA. In addition, these ships  can have a significant impact on inventories in areas without large  commercial ports. For example, Santa Barbara estimates that engine on  ocean-going marine vessels contribute about 37 percent of total  NO X  in their area. These emissions are from ships that  transit the area, and ``are comparable to (even slightly larger than)  the amount of NO X  produced onshore by cars and truck.\2\  These emissions are expected to increase to 62 percent by 2015. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \2\ Memorandum to Docket A-2001-11 from Jean Marie Revelt,  ``Santa Barbara County Air Qualilty News, Issue 62, July-August 2001  and other materials provided to EPA by Santa Barbara County,'' March  14, 2002. Air Docket A-2001-11, Document No. II-A-47. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      We estimate the contribution of these engines to national PM levels  is about 2.6 percent, but can also be higher on a port-specific area  (see Table 2.6-1 in the draft Regulatory Support Document (RSD) for  this rule and associated text). The estimated contribution of these  engines to national HC and CO emissions is negligible. The inventory  contribution of these engines to national NO X , PM, HC, and  CO levels is expected to increase as emissions from other mobile  sources decrease due to our recently finalized emission control  programs for highway vehicles and heavy-duty trucks. Reductions in the  inventories of these pollutants will lead to health benefits, as  described in Section II.     In addition, manufacturers of diesel engines, including marine  diesel engines, have gained greater experience with the emission  control technologies that can be applied to these engines. Our analysis  indicates that greater emission reductions can be achieved by  optimizing currently available control technologies that are being used  to achieve the Annex VI NO X  limits.     This Notice discusses two tiers of NO X  emission controls  for these engines. The first tier is equivalent to the internationally  negotiated NO X  standards and would be enforceable under U.S.  law for new engines built in 2004 and later. The second tier of  NO X  standards, if implemented, would reflect additional  reductions that can be achieved through engine-based emission controls,  and would apply to new engines built after 2006 or later. We are also  considering standards for HC and CO emissions to ensure that these  emissions do not increase on an engine-specific basis. Particulate  matter emissions from these engines are primarily due to the  characteristics of the fuel they use (residual fuel), and we are  requesting comment on whether we should consider a sulfur content limit  for that fuel. We would review the Tier 2 standards prior to their  effective date to take into consideration continued development of new  technologies, such as selective catalyst reduction and water-based  emission reduction techniques, and international activity such as  action at International Maritime Organization (IMO) to set more  stringent international standards.     Consistent with our 1999 commercial marine diesel engine standards,  this proposal also contains voluntary low emission standards for marine  diesel engines at or above 30 liters per cylinder. As emissions from  most mobile source categories continue to decline, emissions from  marine vessels and associated port equipment are becoming an  increasingly significant source for local, regional, and global  emissions. Because of the slow turnover of vessels and associated  equipment, there is an opportunity and need for the ports, shipping  companies, engine manufacturers, and fuel suppliers to work on a  collaborative effort to expedite and further reduce emissions beyond  the Annex VI NO X  limits and U.S. national standards. Two  components of this proposal can help encourage these actions. The first  is voluntary low emission standards set at  [[Page 37551]]  80 percent below the Annex VI NO X  limits. These standards  can be used in state-based initiatives and are expected to require the  use of advanced technologies such as fuel cells or selective catalyst  reduction. The second is the voluntary Blue Cruise program, in which  participant vessel owners can receive special recognition from EPA for  installing and using technologies that reduce waste and air emissions.     We are also proposing new requirements for engines at or above 2.5  liters per cylinder but less than 30 liters per cylinder. The Tier 2  standards we finalized for these engines in our 1999 commercial marine  diesel rule are effective in 2007. Until then, and pending entry into  force of Annex VI, we encouraged engine manufacturers to voluntarily  comply with Tier 1 standards, which are equivalent to the  internationally negotiated NO X  standards. Because Annex VI  has not gone into force, they remain unenforceable. Due to the  continued uncertainty regarding entry into force of Annex VI, we  believe it is appropriate to begin to require engine manufacturers to  certify these engines to the Tier 1 standards, starting in 2004. We are  also proposing to eliminate the foreign trade exemption for all marine  diesel engines, which was available for engines installed on vessels  that spend less than 25 percent of total operating time with 320  kilometers of U.S. territory. To date, this exemption has not been  requested by engine manufacturers.     The standards discussed in this Notice, which would apply to  engines installed on vessels flagged in the United States, are intended  to help reduce ozone inventories and avoid a range of associated  adverse health effects. The costs of the proposed Tier 1 standards are  negligible and reflect certification and compliance costs only. We do  not anticipate that there will be any engineering or design costs  associated with the Tier 1 standards as manufacturers are already  certifying engines to Annex VI requirements through our voluntary  certification program. The estimated cost to industry of complying with  the Tier 2 standards being considered is about $115,000 per engine,  with an additional estimated cost of about $5,000 annually to maintain  equipment. This represents a 7 percent increase in the total engine  cost and about 0.1 percent increase in the total vessel cost. We  estimate the aggregate costs (annualized over 20 years) of the Tier 2  standards under consideration to be about $1.6 million annually. The  economic impacts and environmental benefits of the proposal and Tier 2  standards under consideration are described in Section VI, below.     The impact of the standards on air quality in specific areas will  depend in part on the characteristics of the fleet of vessels that  operate in that area, particularly on the proportion of foreign-flag  ships to U.S.-flag ships. Recognizing that foreign-flag vessels  constitute a significant portion of emissions from these engines and  that the internationally negotiated NO X  standards for these  engines are not yet enforceable, we are seeking comment on whether the  standards should also apply to marine engines on foreign vessels  entering U.S. ports and to no longer exclude such foreign vessels from  the emission standards under 40 CFR 94.1(b)(3). While EPA's current  standards for marine vessels do not apply to foreign flag vessels, EPA  is inviting comments on whether it should change this approach. If we  were to apply our emission standards to foreign vessels that enter U.S.  ports as part of this rulemaking effort, then the standards would apply  to any marine engine that is manufactured after the standards become  effective and that is installed on such a foreign vessel and would be a  condition of port entry. The standards would also apply to any marine  engine installed on such a foreign vessel that is manufactured (or that  otherwise become new) after the standards become effective. While we  are seeking comment on applying the standards to foreign vessels that  use U.S. ports, we may require such standards for foreign vessels in  2003.  B. How Is This Document Organized?      This document contains ten parts. After this introductory section,  Section II describes the air quality need for this rulemaking and  projected benefits. That section contains a description of the human  health and welfare effects of exposure to ozone, PM, and CO and reports  our inventory estimates for this source for current and future years.  In Section III, we describe the set of engines that would be required  to comply with the proposed standards and our reasoning behind this  scope of application. Sections IV and VII contain the proposed emission  standards and alternatives under consideration, effective dates, and  testing requirements. We also discuss the technological feasibility of  the standards discussed in this Notice, and alternative approaches.  Section V describes various compliance provisions. Section VI  summarizes the projected impacts of the standards and discusses their  benefits. Section VIII describes a voluntary incentive program in which  participant vessel owners can receive special recognition from EPA for  installing and using technologies that reduce waste and air emissions.  Finally, Sections IX and X contain information about public  participation, how we satisfied our administrative requirements, and  the statutory provisions and legal authority for this proposal.  Additional information on many of these topics can be found in the  Draft Regulatory Support Document for this proposal.  C. What Requirements Are We Proposing or Considering?      The NO X  emission standards for marine diesel engines at  or above 30 liters per cylinder (Category 3 marine diesel engines)  would consist of two tiers. Tier 1 would apply to new engines built in  2004 and later and would be equivalent to the Annex VI NO X   limits adopted by the Parties to MARPOL in 1997. We are also  considering Tier 2 NO X  standards that would apply to new  engines built after 2006 or later and consist of a NO X  limit  30 percent below the Tier 1/Annex VI limit. The year that EPA considers  most appropriate at this time is 2007. For both tiers of standards, we  would define NO X  standards as a function of maximum engine  speed, consistent with Annex VI, but are requesting comment on the  merits of defining Tier 2 NO X  standards instead as a  function of engine displacement. Both tiers of standards can be met  through engine-based emission-control technologies. The Annex VI  NO X  limits are based on certification on distillate fuel,  which has a lower nitrogen content than the residual fuel that these  engines are most likely to use in operation. We are proposing numerical  emission limits based on residual fuel, but allow for certification  testing using distillate or residual fuel. In either case, we are  proposing that the test results be adjusted to account for the nitrogen  content of the fuel, and then be compared to the proposed emission  limits. The fuel quality adjustment is described in Section IV.A.2,  below.     In addition to the Tier 2 NO X  limits, we are considering  hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emission limits at 0.4 g/kW-hr and 3.0  g/kW-hr, respectively. These standards would ensure that these  emissions do not increase on an engine-specific basis. We are also  considering adoption of a schedule to review any Tier 2 standards prior  to their effective date to take into consideration continued  development of new technologies, such as selective catalyst reduction  and water-based emission reduction techniques, and international  activity such as action at IMO to adopt more stringent standards  [[Page 37552]]  internationally. We request comment on the hydrocarbon and carbon  monoxide standards.     We are not planning to adopt a Tier 2 standard for particulate  emissions from these engines. Most of the particulate emissions are a  result of the high sulfur and ash content of the fuel used by these  engines, and there is no acceptable measurement procedure for fuels  with these characteristics. We are requesting comment, however, on  whether we should consider a fuel sulfur content limit for the fuels  used by these engines. One option, for example, would be to set a  sulfur content cap equivalent to the limit for fuel used in  SO X  Emission Control Areas provided in Regulation 14 of  MARPOL Annex VI. Pursuant to that regulation, the sulfur content of  fuel used by vessels operating in those areas cannot exceed 15,000 ppm.  The United States could also pursue this option through procedures  contained in Regulation 14 of MARPOL Annex VI. That regulation provides  for the designation of SO X  emission control areas. We  estimate that reducing the sulfur content of residual fuel to 15,000  ppm may decrease the PM inventory of these engines 18 percent and the  SO X  inventory by 44 percent (See Section VI.F, below). In  connection with this option, we are seeking comment as to which areas  of the United States should be considered for designation as  SO X  emission control areas under MARPOL Annex VI, and  whether and how we should seek the cooperation of Canada, Mexico, and  the Carribean in designating these areas. Both of these options are  discussed in Section VI.E, below.     We are also proposing voluntary low emission NO X   standards for Category 3 marine diesel engines. These standards, which  represent an 80 percent reduction from the Annex VI NO X   limits, are intended to encourage the introduction and more widespread  use of low-emission technologies. Manufacturers could be motivated to  exceed emission requirements either to gain early experience with  certain technologies or as a response to market demand or local  government programs. Ship owners could take advantage of these and  other emission reduction technologies to receive special recognition  from EPA for installing and using technologies that reduce waste and  air emissions under our proposed voluntary Blue Cruise program.     To implement these standards for marine diesel engines at or above  30 liters per cylinder in an effective way, we are proposing several  compliance requirements. In general, the proposed compliance program  reflects our traditional manufacturer-based approach. This is in  contrast to the international approach reflected in Annex VI, which  holds the vessel owner responsible for compliance once the engine is  delivered onboard. Many of the proposed compliance provisions,  including certification application, engine labeling, and warranty  requirements, are similar or identical to the compliance provisions  that we finalized in our 1999 rulemaking. In addition, we are including  a post-installation verification provision which would require an  emission test after an engine is installed on a vessel. We are also  proposing a field measurement provision that would apply to engines  with adjustable parameters or add-on emission control devices.  Manufacturers of these engines would be required to equip the engine  with a field measurement device. The owner of a vessel with such an  engine would have to perform a field measurement when the vessel  approaches within 175 nautical miles (200 statutory miles) of the U.S.  coastline from the open sea or when it adjusts an engine parameter  within that distance. The results of this field measurement will  demonstrate that the engine is in compliance with the relevant  standards when it is operated in an area that affects U.S. air quality.  EPA will work with the U.S. Coast Guard to develop procedures to verify  onboard performance of these field measurement provisions, as Coast  Guard has the general authority to carry out such procedures on  vessels.     We are also proposing new requirements for engines at or above 2.5  liters per cylinder but less than 30 liters per cylinder. The Tier 2  standards we finalized for these engines in our 1999 commercial marine  diesel rule are effective in 2007. Until then, and pending entry into  force of Annex VI, we encouraged engine manufacturers to voluntarily  comply with Tier 1 standards, which are equivalent to the  internationally negotiated NO X  standards. Because Annex VI  has not gone into force, they remain unenforceable. While the U.S. is  beginning the ratification process for Annex VI, due to the continued  uncertainty regarding its entry into force of Annex VI, we believe it  is appropriate to begin to require engine manufacturers to certify  these engines to the Tier 1 standards, starting in 2004. We are also  proposing to eliminate the foreign trade exemption for all marine  diesel engines, which was available for engines installed on vessels  that spend less than 25 percent of total operating time with 320  kilometers of U.S. territory. To date, this exemption has not been  requested by engine manufacturers.     The standards discussed above would apply to engines installed on  vessels flagged in the United States. Recognizing that foreign-flag  vessels constitute a significant portion of emissions from these  engines and that the internationally negotiated NO X   standards for these engines are not yet enforceable, we are seeking  comment on whether the standards should also apply to marine engines on  foreign vessels entering U.S. ports and to no longer exclude such  foreign vessels from the emission standards under 40 CFR 94.1(b)(3). If  we were to apply our emission standards to foreign vessels that enter  U.S. ports, then the standards would apply to any marine engine that is  manufactured after the standards become effective and that is installed  on such a foreign vessel. The standards would also apply to any marine  engine installed on such a foreign vessel that is manufactured (or that  otherwise become new) after the standards become effective. As  discussed below, if the standards were to apply to foreign flag  vessels, EPA would consider any significant differences between this  proposed rule and Annex VI.  D. Why Is EPA Taking This Action?      We developed this emission control program to fulfill our  obligations under Section 213 of the Clean Air Act. That section,  described in more detail in Section E, below, requires us to set  standards for new nonroad engines. In addition, there are important  public health and welfare reasons supporting the standards proposed in  this document. As described in Section II.B, Category 3 marine diesel  engines contribute to air pollution which causes public health and  welfare problems. Emissions from these engines contribute to ground  level ozone and ambient PM and CO levels, especially in and near  commercial ports and waterways.\3\ Exposure to ground level ozone, PM,  and CO can cause serious respiratory problems. These emissions also  contribute to other environmental problems, including acid deposition,  eutrophication, and nitrification. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \3\ Ground-level ozone, the main ingredient in smog, is formed  by complex chemical reactions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs)  and NO X  in the presence of heat and sunlight.  Hydrocarbons (HC) are a large subset of VOC, and to reduce mobile- source VOC levels we set maximum emissions limits for hydrocarbon  and particulate matter emissions. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      This action is a departure from the emission control strategy we  finalized in 1999 ( 64 FR 73300 , December 29, 1999) in that we are  considering no longer  [[Page 37553]]  relying solely on MARPOL Annex VI for controlling emissions from  Category 3 marine diesel engines. While the Annex VI NO X   limits apply to engines installed on vessels constructed on or after  January 1, 2000, those standards are not enforceable until the Annex  enters into force. As specified in Article 6 of the Annex, it will  enter into force twelve months after the date on which not less than  fifteen member states, the combined merchant fleets of which constitute  not less than 50 percent of the gross tonnage of the world's merchant  shipping, have ratified the agreement. To date, more than four years  after it was adopted, the Annex has been ratified by only 6 countries  representing 15.8 percent of the world's merchant shipping.\4\ In  addition, the Annex VI NO X  limits no longer reflect the  greatest degree of emission control that can be achieved using newer  technology, given appropriate lead time. Since we finalized our  commercial marine diesel engine standards in 1999 ( 64 FR 73300 ,  December 29, 1999), engine manufacturers continue to make progress in  applying land-based emission control technologies to marine diesel  engines. Improvements in fuel systems and engine cooling can reduce  Category 3 engine emissions even more than the Annex VI NO X   limits would require. Some engine manufacturers are also experimenting  with water emulsification and injection and aftertreatment, including  selective catalyst reduction, for even greater reductions. These  emission control technologies are described in greater detail in  Section IV. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \4\ The countries that have ratified Annex VI are Sweden,  Norway, Bahamas, Singapore, Marshall Islands, and Malawi.  Information about Annex VI ratification can be found at  www.imo.org     (look under Conventions, Status of Conventions--Complete List). ---------------------------------------------------------------------------  E. Putting This Proposal Into Perspective      This proposal should be considered in the broader context of EPA's  nonroad emission-control programs, international activities, including  MARPOL Annex VI, our previous marine emission control program, European  Union (EU) initiatives, and activities at the state level. These  programs and actions are discussed below. 1. EPA's Nonroad Emission-Control Programs     Clean Air Act section 213(a)(1) directs us to study emissions from  nonroad engines and vehicles to determine, among other things, whether  these emissions ``cause, or significantly contribute to, air pollution  that may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or  welfare.'' Section 213(a)(2) further requires us to determine whether  emissions of CO, VOC s , and NO X  from all nonroad  engines significantly contribute to ozone or CO emissions in more than  one nonattainment area. If we determine that emissions from all nonroad  engines are significant contributors, section 213(a)(3) then requires  us to establish emission standards for classes or categories of new  nonroad engines and vehicles that in our judgment cause or contribute  to such pollution. We may also set emission standards under section  213(a)(4) regulating any other emissions from nonroad engines that we  find contribute significantly to air pollution.     We completed the Nonroad Engine and Vehicle Emission Study,  required by Clean Air Act section 213(a)(1), in November 1991.\5\ On  June 17, 1994, we made an affirmative determination under section  213(a)(2) that nonroad emissions are significant contributors to ozone  or CO in more than one nonattainment area. We also determined that  these engines make a significant contribution to PM and smoke emissions  that may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or  welfare. In the same document, we set a first phase of emission  standards (now referred to as Tier 1 standards) for land-based nonroad  diesel engines rated at or above 37 kW. In 1998, we set more stringent  Tier 2 and Tier 3 emission levels for new land-based nonroad diesel  engines at or above 37 kW and adopted Tier 1 standards for nonroad  diesel engines, including marine diesel engines, less than 37 kW. Our  other emission-control programs for nonroad engines are listed in Table  I.E-1. This proposal takes another step toward the comprehensive  nonroad engine emission-control strategy envisioned in the Act by  proposing enforceable emission limits for marine diesel engines at or  above 30 liters per cylinder. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \5\ This study, the Nonroad Engine and Vehicle Emission Study  (NEVES) is available in docket A-92-28.

MARPOL Annex VI     In response to growing international concern about air pollution  and in recognition of the highly international nature of maritime  transportation, the IMO developed a program to reduce NO X   and SO X  emissions from marine vessels.\6\ \7\ The  development of Annex  [[Page 37554]]  VI took place between 1992 and 1997. The Annex VI engine emission  limits cover only NO X  emissions; there are no restrictions  on PM, HC, or CO emissions. They are based on engine speed and apply to  engines above 130 kW. These standards are set out in Table I.E-2.  Originally, these standards were expected to reduce NO X   emissions by 30 percent when fully phased in. EPA inventory analysis,  based on newly estimated emission factors for these engines, indicates  that the expected reduction is on the order of about 20 percent. The  EPA inventory analysis is described in more detail in the Draft  Regulatory Support Document for this proposal. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \6\ The Annex covers a several air emissions from marine  vessels: ozone depleting substances, NO X , SO X ,  VOCs from tanker operations, incineration, fuel oil quality. There  are also requirements for reception facilities and platforms and  drilling rigs.     \7\ To obtain copies of this document, see Footnote 1, above. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      With regard to implementation, the Annex VI NO X  limits  apply to each diesel engine with a power output of more than 130 kW  installed on a ship constructed on or after January 1, 2000, or that  undergoes a major conversion on or after January 1, 2000. The Annex  does not distinguish between marine diesel engines installed on  recreational or commercial vessels; all marine diesel engines above 130  kW would be subject to the standards regardless of their use. The test  procedures to be used to demonstrate compliance are set out in the  Annex VI NO X  Technical Code.\8\ They are based on ISO 8178  and are performed using distillate fuel. Engines can be pre-certified  or certified after they are installed onboard. After demonstrating  compliance, pre-certified engines would receive an Engine International  Air Pollution Prevention (EIAPP) certificate. This document, to be  issued by the Administration of the flag country, is needed by the ship  owner as part of the process of demonstrating compliance with all of  the provisions of Annex VI and obtaining an International Air Pollution  Prevention (IAPP) certificate for the vessel once the Annex goes into  force. The Annex also contains engine compliance provisions based on a  survey approach. These survey requirements would apply after the Annex  goes into force. An engine is surveyed after it is installed, every  five years after installation, and at least once between 5-year  surveys. Engines are not required to be tested as part of a survey,  however. The surveys can be done by a parameter check, which can be as  simple as reviewing the Record Book of Engine Parameters that must be  maintained for each engine and verifying that current engine settings  are within allowable limits. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \8\ To obtain copies of this document, see Footnote 1, above. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      After several years of negotiation, the Parties to MARPOL adopted a  final version of Annex VI at a Diplomatic Conference on September 26,  1997. However, as noted in Section I.C, above, the Annex has not yet  gone into force. Pending entry into force, ship owners and vessel  manufacturers have begun installing compliant engines on relevant ships  beginning with the date specified in Regulation 13: January 1, 2000. In  addition, ship owners must bring existing engines into compliance if  the engines undergo a major conversion on or after that date.\9\ As  defined in Regulation 13 of Annex VI, a major conversion is when the  engine is replaced by a new engine, it is substantially modified, or  its maximum continuous rating is increased by more than 10 percent. To  facilitate implementation while the Annex is not yet in force and to  allow engine manufacturers to certify their engines before the Annex  goes into force, we set up a process for manufacturers to obtain a  Statement of Voluntary Compliance.\10\ An EPA-issued Statement of  Voluntary Compliance should be exchangeable for an EIAPP certificate  once the Annex goes into effect in the United States. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \9\ As defined in Regulation 13 of Annex VI, a major conversion  means the engine is replaced by a new engine, it is substantially  modified, or its maximum continuous rating is increased by more than  10 percent.     \10\ For more information about our voluntary certification  program, see ``guidance for Certifying to MARPOL Annex VI,'' VPCD- 99-02. This letter is available on our website:  http://www.epa.gov/ otaq/regs/nonroad/marine/ci/imolettr.pdf  and in Docket A-2001-11,  Document No. II-B-01. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      The U.S. government is preparing the appropriate documents for the  President to submit Annex VI to the Senate for its advice and consent  to ratification. Besides setting standards for NO X   emissions, Annex VI regulates ozone-depleting emissions, sulfur oxides  emissions and shipboard incineration, and contains other  environmentally protective measures. In transmitting Annex VI to the  Senate, the Administration will work with Congress on new legislation  to implement the Annex. At the same time, the United States government  supports a revision of the Annex VI standards for NO X   emissions, taking into account the emission reduction potential of new  control technologies. By ratifying the Annex, the United States will  continue its leadership in promoting environmentally responsible  international emission standards at the IMO and recognize the role the  IMO plays in protecting the world's marine environment from pollution.  As described in Section I.E.4, below, we have already requested MEPC to  begin consideration of more stringent NO X  emission limits  for marine diesel engines. In addition, once the Annex goes into force,  amendment of NO X  standards will be made easier through the  tacit amendment process that would then apply. 3. EPA's Commercial Marine Diesel Engine Rules     Although we included marine diesel engines in the development of  our 1996 marine rule, we did not finalize standards for these engines  at that time. At the time, we were considering standards based on Tier  1 land-based nonroad diesel emission controls. Emerging emission  control technologies for diesel engines, particularly the Tier 2 land- based nonroad emission control technologies, led us to reconsider our  approach and to defer standards for these engines to a later  rulemaking.     In our 1999 commercial marine diesel engine rule, we distinguished  between different types of marine diesel engines. The three categories  of marine diesel engines, contained in Table I.E-3, were intended to  reflect differences in the land-based counterparts of these engines.              Table I.E-3.--Marine Engine Category Definitions ------------------------------------------------------------------------                                    Displacement per       Land-based             Category                   cylinder           equivalent ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 1...............................  disp. < 5 liters    Agricultural                                    (and power  £      equipment;                                     37 kW).     construction                                                        equipment. 2...............................  5 liters < disp. <  Locomotives.                                    30 liters. 3...............................  disp  £     No mobile source                                    30 liters.          equivalent Power                                                        plant generators. ------------------------------------------------------------------------  [[Page 37555]]      The final standards for Category 1 and Category 2 marine diesel  standards were more stringent than the Annex VI NO X  limits,  reflecting the greater degree of emission control that would be  achievable through the application of technologies that would be used  on the land-based equivalents of these engines to meet the nonroad Tier  2 and locomotive Tier 1 standards. The standards also cover more  pollutants than Annex VI, including standards for HC, CO, and PM as  well as NO X . The emission standards we finalized for  Category 1 and Category 2 marine diesel engines are similar to the  nonroad Tier 2 and locomotive Tier 1 standards, respectively.     We did not finalize standards for Category 3 marine diesel engines  in 1999. Instead, we deferred to the Annex VI NO X  emission  control program. This decision was based on our technological analysis  of control strategies for these engines which indicated that the  appropriate standards should reflect reductions that can be obtained  from injection rate shaping and some timing retard. These control  technologies were consistent with the Annex VI NO X  limits.  While some Category 3 engines were already using Tier 2 engine  technologies including turbocharging, injection improvements,  electronics, and more efficient cooling, these technologies were being  used to increase fuel efficiency and obtain optimal operation. Next- generation technologies such as exhaust gas recirculation (EGR),  selective catalyst reduction (SCR), and water injection were still  under development for marine diesel engines of that size. Because the  Annex VI NO X  limits would likely be implemented  independently of any Clean Air Act requirement, EPA believed that it  would be unnecessary and redundant to adopt the same program under the  Clean Air Act. Vessel owners were anticipated to begin complying with  the Annex VI NO X  limits beginning in 2000, as indicated in  the Annex.     Since 1999, Category 3 marine diesel engine manufacturers have  continued to research emission control technologies and explore ways to  transfer land-based diesel engine technologies to marine diesel  engines. These technologies and emission control strategies are  described in Sections IV and VII below, and in the draft Regulatory  Support Document for this rule. Due to these advances, and due to the  contribution of these engines to ozone and PM levels, we believe it is  now appropriate to consider a second tier of emission limits for  Category 3 marine diesel engines that will achieve greater reductions  than those expected from the Annex VI NO X  limits. 4. Continuing Action at the IMO     At the time the Annex VI NO X  limits were adopted,  several Member States expressed concern that the NO X  limits  would not result in the emissions reductions they were intended to  achieve. Due to the efforts of these Member States, the Conference of  the Parties adopted a resolution that provides for review of the  emission limits with the aim of adopting more stringent limits taking  into account the adverse effects of such emissions on the environment  and any technological developments in marine engines. This review is to  occur at a minimum of five-year intervals after entry into force of the  Annex and, if appropriate, amend the NO X  limits to reflect  more stringent controls.     In March of 2000, the United States requested MEPC to begin  consideration of more stringent emission limits for marine diesel  engines.\11\ EPA's analysis of emission control technology for our 1999  rulemaking indicated that more stringent standards are feasible for all  Category 1 and Category 2 marine diesel engines. Engine manufacturers  were also beginning to apply these emission control strategies to  Category 3 marine diesel engines, as well as more advanced strategies  such as water emulsification and selective catalyst reduction.  Reflecting the potential emission reductions that could be obtained  from applying these strategies to all marine diesel engines, the U.S.  recommended Annex VI Tier 2 NO X  limits be set at 25 to 30  percent below the existing Annex VI NO X  limits for all  engines subject to the regulation (engines above 130 kW), to go into  effect in 2007. This would allow a 7-year period of stability for the  Annex VI NO X  limits, permit engine manufacturers to adjust  their engine designs to include new emission control technologies, and  allow manufacturers of marine diesel engines at or above 30 liters per  cylinder to develop emission control strategies for those large  engines. This recommendation was briefly discussed at the 44th session  of the MEPC (London, March 3-16, 2000), but was not acted on. The  United States will continue to promote more stringent standards at IMO  and encourage MEPC to adopt a second tier of emission limits that will  reflect available technology and reduce the impact of marine diesel  engines on the world's air quality. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \11\ MEPC 44/11/7, Prevention of Pollution from Ships, Revision  of the NO X  Technical Code, Tier 2 emission limits for  marine diesel engines at or above 130 kW, submitted by the United  States.

European Union Actions     In February, 1999, the European Commission D-GXI commissioned a  report to ``consider, analyse and recommend policy options to further  the objective of reducing the harmful environmental impact of  SO X  and NO X  from ships operating in European  waters.\12\ The final report was completed in August 2000. The report  explores two types of regulatory options, regulatory standards and  incentive plans, for both fuel and engine emission controls. The report  is currently under consideration by the Commission. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \12\ Davies, M.

The discussion paper envisions two  products: a Commission Communication and a proposal to amend EU  Directive 1999/32 on the Sulphur Content of Liquid Fuels. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \13\ This discussion paper can be found at  http:// www.europa.eu.int/comm/environment/air/future_transport.htm    (Under  ``pollutant emissions from ships'' then ``new developments''). A  copy of this paper can also be found in Docket A-2001-11, Document  No. II-A-28. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      The discussion paper notes that current inventory analysis  indicates that ships will account for 75% and 60% of EU land  SO X  and NO X  emissions, respectively. A new  inventory study currently being commissioned will shed more light on  these contributions, particularly in-port contributions. The discussion  paper also describes current EU and international regulatory regimes  and the potential for further reductions. Regarding SO X   emissions, EU Directive 1999/32 currently prohibits the use of marine  distillate fuels having more than 2,000 ppm sulfur in Community  territorial waters. While there is an exemption for ships coming from  third countries, those ships must use low sulfur distillate after they  make their first stop at a Community port. There is some concern that  this approach encourages ships to burn heavy fuel  [[Page 37556]]  while in Community waters. Regarding NO X  emissions, the  paper describes the MARPOL Annex VI requirements, the EPA standards  established in 1999, and the U.S. action to encourage IMO to consider  more stringent NO X  limits. The paper does not suggest  potential emission control programs for the EU, but it requests comment  support for more stringent standards. 6. Action By Individual European Countries     In 1996 the Swedish Maritime Administration, the Swedish  Shipowners' Association and the Swedish Ports' and Stevedores'  Association arrived at a Tripartite Agreement to decrease ship nitrogen  oxides and sulphur emissions by 75% within five years. The parties  agreed to establish an environmental program on differentiated fairway  and port dues for NO X  levels and fuel sulphur content. The  program was constructed by first raising the ship related dues (from  Swedish Kroner (SEK) 3.90 per gross tonne (GT) for oil tankers and SEK  3.60 per GT for ferries and other ships to SEK 5.30 and SEK 5.00  respectively) from which the discounts would be subtracted\14\. For use  of low sulphur fuels a credit of SEK 0.90 per GT was given for ships  operating on bunker oils of a sulphur content of less than 0.5 per cent  by weight for ferries and less than 1.0 per cent for other ships. For  low NO X  emissions, if the emission at 75 per cent engine  load is above 12 g/kWh, no NO X  discount is given. Below this  level the discount increases continuously down to a level of 2 g/kWh  where the discount is SEK 1.60 per GT. A maximum discount of SEK 2.50  per GT is possible. The program entered into force January 1, 1998 and  as of 1999, twenty of Sweden's fifty two ports have introduced  environmentally differentiated harbour dues for reduced sulphur fuels,  reduced NO X  emissions or both. Ferries are using new  technologies, including water emulsion systems (20-50% Nox reduction)  and SCR systems (up to 95% NO X  reduction), to achieve the  low emission levels. To overcome initial problems and encourage the  installation of catalytic converters, the Swedish Maritime  Administration agreed to reimburse shipowners for the fairway dues paid  during the first five years of the program (thru 2002). ``Based on  known planned installations, the National Maritime Administration  expects that by 1 January 2001 the scheme will have reduced  NO X  emissions from ships calling at Swedish ports by 40-45  per cent compared to the situation in 1995.''\15\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \14\ One Swedish Kroner (SEK) is about $0.09     \15\ A further detailed discussion of this topic can be found at   http://www.sjofartsverket.se/navigering/htm/frameset.htm .   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      Over the past three years several other localities worldwide have  also incorporated adjustments in port dues based on compliance with  emission levels. The Port of Mariehamn, on the Finnish Island of Aland  differentiates its harbor dues with regard to ships' emissions of  NO X  and sulphur. The proposal in 1999 was to ``give ships  emitting less than 10 g/kWh NO X  a rebate on a linear scale  where the reduction of the port due is 8 per cent for ships emitting  less than 1 gramme, and 1 per cent for ships emitting 9 g/kWh. Ships  using bunker oils with less than 0.5 per cent sulphur (by weight) will  receive an additional reduction of 4 per cent. For vessels meeting the  latter criteria and having NO X  emissions of less than 1 g/ kWh the proposal is to offer an extra rebate of 8 per cent. Such ships  will, if the scheme is adopted, get a total reduction of 20 per  cent.''\16\ The Norwegian government has a program for environmental  differentiation of the tonnage tax (Proposition No. 1 1999/2000). The  differentiation is based on a Ship Environment Index System (SEIS). The  SEIS is based on up to seven different environmental parameters,  including sulphur and NO X  emissions with a maximum of 10  points of which 6 points are from the abatement of NO X  and  sulphur emissions. The program will raise the tonnage tax by 50 per  cent and ships registered according to the environmental index system  will receive rebates in proportion to their environmental score. Ships  that earn 10 points will not pay more than they did before the new  scheme began operating and ships that do not register or do not earn  any points will have to pay the full tax.''\17\ The Green Award  Foundation, with the Port of Rotterdam and some ports in Portugal and  South Africa offers reduced harbor dues for tankers of more than 20,000  DWT. To earn the award, the shipowner and the vessel must comply with  national and international laws and regulations as well as demonstrate  environmental and safety awareness in a number of areas affecting  management and crew competence as well as technical provisions which  includes exhaust emissions. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \16\ A further detailed discussion of this topic can be found at   http://www.sjofartsverket.se/navigering/htm/frameset.htm .       \17\ A further detailed discussion of this topic can be found at   http://www.sjofartsverket.se/navigering/htm/frameset.htm .   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------  7. State Actions: SCAQMD, Alaska and Texas Smoke Requirements     Several states have programs that address smoke emissions from  marine engines. This section summarizes the programs in SCAQMD, Alaska  and Texas.     SCAQMD: California's South Coast Air Quality Management District's  Rule 401 states ``(b)(1) A person shall not discharge into the  atmosphere from any single source of emission whatsoever any air  contaminant for a period or periods aggregating more than three minutes  in any one hour which is: (A) As dark or darker in shade as that  designated No. 1 on the Ringelmann Chart as published by the United  States Bureau of Mines; or (B) Of such opacity as to obscure an  observer's view to a degree equal to or greater than does smoke  described in subparagraph (b)(1)(A) of this rule.''\18\ The Port of  Long Beach has issued literature requiring compliance with the SCAQMD  rules through their Smoke Stack Emissions Program.\19\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \18\ A further detailed discussion of this topic can be found at   http://www.aqmd.gov/rules/html/r401.html .       \19\ A further detailed discussion of this topic can be found at   www.polb.com .   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      The Port of Long Beach and the Port of Los Angeles also require, as  of May 1, 2001, a Voluntary Commercial Cargo Ship Speed Reduction  Program. The ``Air Quality Compliance Zone'' is with a 12 knot speed  restriction beginning 20-nautical miles from Point Fermin to the  boundaries of the existing mandatory Precautionary Area. The purpose is  to reduce air pollution from ships in the South Coast Air Basin.\20\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \20\ A further detailed discussion of this topic can be found at  http://www.polb.com/NavAlert.htm. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      Alaska: Under Alaska's present state law, with some exceptions,  ``ships must keep emissions from reducing visibility through the  exhaust plume by more than 20% while in Alaska waters. Diesel exhausts  and other smoky discharges from ships can create a haze that hangs over  coastal communities. DEC receives regular complaints from coastal  community residents about these emissions. The state has certified  readers who observe the emissions coming from a cruise ship's  smokestack to determine if the standards are being exceeded.''\21\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \21\ A further detailed discussion of this topic can be found at  http://www.state.ak.us/local/akpages/ ENV.CONSERV/press/2001/rel-- 1115.htm. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      Texas: The Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission Chapter  111 of the document on Control of Air Pollution From Visible Emissions  and Particulate Matter contains requirements of visible emissions from  [[Page 37557]]  ships. The document, section 111.111(a)(6)(A) and (B), state that ``(A)  Visible emissions shall not be permitted from any railroad locomotive,  ship or any other vessel to exceed an opacity of 30% for any five- minute period, except during reasonable periods of engine start-up. (B)  Compliance with subparagraph (A) of this paragraph shall be determined  by applying the following test methods, as appropriate: (i) Test Method  9, (40 CFR part 60, Appendix A), or (ii) equivalent test method  approved by the executive director and EPA.''

The Air Quality Need  A. Overview      This proposal contains a regulatory strategy for Category 3 marine  diesel engines on U.S. vessels. Marine diesel engines at or above 30  liters per cylinder are very large marine engines used primarily for  propulsion power on ocean-going vessels such as container ships,  tankers, bulk carriers, and cruise ships. The vessels that use these  engines are flagged in the United States and in other countries.  Category 3 engines have not been regulated under our nonroad engine  programs. Nationwide, these engines are a significant source of mobile  source air pollution. As described in Section II.C, below, emissions  from all Category 3 marine diesel engines, regardless of flag of  registry, currently account for about 1.5 percent of national mobile  source NO X , and 2.6 percent of national mobile source PM  inventories.     We conducted a study of emissions from nonroad engines, vehicles,  and equipment in 1991, as directed by the Clean Air Act, section 213(a)  (42 U.S.C. 7547(a)). Based on the results of that study, we determined  that emissions of NO X , VOCs (including HC), and CO from  nonroad engines and equipment contribute significantly to ozone and CO  concentrations in more than one noattainment area (see 59 FR 31306,  June 17, 1994). Given this determination, section 213(a)(3) of the Act  requires us to establish (and from time to time revise) emission  standards for those classes or categories of new nonroad engines,  vehicles, and equipment that in our judgment cause or contribute to  such air pollution. We have determined that commercial marine diesel  engines cause or contribute to such air pollution (see also the  proposed commercial marine diesel engine preamble at  63 FR 68508 ,  December 11, 1998 and the final rule at  64 FR 73300 , December 29,  1999).     Where we determine that other emissions from new nonroad engines,  vehicles, or equipment significantly contribute to air pollution that  may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare,  section 213(a)(4) authorizes EPA to establish (and from time to time  revise) emission standards from those classes or categories of new  nonroad engines, vehicles, and equipment that cause or contribute to  such air pollution. We have determined that commercial marine diesel  engines cause or contribute to such air pollution (see also the  proposed commercial marine diesel engine preamble at  63 FR 68508 ,  December 11, 1998 and the final rule at  64 FR 73300 , December 29,  1999).  B. What Are the Public Health and Welfare Concerns Associated With  Emissions From Category 3 Diesel Marine Engines Subject to the Proposed  Standards?      The engines that would be subject to the proposed standards  generate emissions of NO X , HC, PM and CO that contribute to  ozone and CO nonattainment as well as adverse health effects associated  with ambient concentrations of PM. This section contains a summary of  the general health effects of these substances. Further information can  be found in Chapter 2 of the Draft Regulatory Support Document.  National and selected port city inventories are set out in Section  II.C, and estimates of the expected impact of the proposed control  program are described in Section VI. 1. Ozone and its Precursors     Volatile organic compounds (VOC) and NO X  are precursors  in the photochemical reaction which forms tropospheric ozone. Ground- level ozone, the main ingredient in smog, is formed by complex chemical  reactions of VOCs and NO X  in the presence of heat and  sunlight. Hydrocarbons (HC) are a large subset of VOC, and to reduce  mobile-source VOC levels we set maximum emissions limits for  hydrocarbon and particulate matter emissions.     A large body of evidence shows that ozone can cause harmful  respiratory effects including chest pain, coughing, and shortness of  breath, which affect people with compromised respiratory systems most  severely. When inhaled, ozone can cause acute respiratory problems;  aggravate asthma; cause significant temporary decreases in lung  function of 15 to over 20 percent in some healthy adults; cause  inflammation of lung tissue; produce changes in lung tissue and  structure; may increase hospital admissions and emergency room visits;  and impair the body's immune system defenses, making people more  susceptible to respiratory illnesses. Children and outdoor workers are  likely to be exposed to elevated ambient levels of ozone during  exercise and, therefore, are at a greater risk of experiencing adverse  health effects. Beyond its human health effects, ozone has been shown  to injure plants, which has the effect of reducing crop yields and  reducing productivity in forest ecosystems.     There is strong and convincing evidence that exposure to ozone is  associated with exacerbation of asthma-related symptoms. Increases in  ozone concentrations in the air have been associated with increases in  hospitalization for respiratory causes for individuals with asthma,  worsening of symptoms, decrements in lung function, and increased  medication use, and chronic exposure may cause permanent lung damage.  The risk of suffering these effects is particularly high for children  and for people with compromised respiratory systems.     Ground level ozone today remains a pervasive pollution problem in  the United States. In 1999, 90.8 million people (1990 census) lived in  31 areas designated nonattainment under the 1-hour ozone NAAQS.\23\  This sharp decline from the 101 nonattainment areas originally  identified under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 demonstrates the  effectiveness of the last decade's worth of emission-control programs.  However, elevated ozone concentrations remain a serious public health  concern throughout the nation. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \23\ National Air Quality and Emissions Trends Report, 1999,  EPA, 2001, at Table A-19.

A  copy of this table can also be found in Docket No. A-2001-11,  Document No. II-A-XX. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      Over the last decade, declines in ozone levels were found mostly in  urban areas, where emissions are heavily influenced by controls on  mobile sources and their fuels. Twenty-three metropolitan areas have  realized a decline in ozone levels since 1989, but at the same time  ozone levels in 11 metropolitan areas with 7 million people have  increased.\24\ Regionally,  [[Page 37558]]  California and the Northeast have recorded significant reductions in  peak ozone levels, while four other regions (the Mid-Atlantic, the  Southeast, the Central and Pacific Northwest) have seen ozone levels  increase. The highest ambient concentrations are currently found in  suburban areas, consistent with downwind transport of emissions from  urban centers. Concentrations in rural areas have risen to the levels  previously found only in cities. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \24\ National Air Quality and Emissions Trends Report, 1998,  March, 2000, at 28.

This memorandum is available in Air Docket A- 2001-11, Document No. II-A-XX. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      To estimate future ozone levels, we refer to the modeling performed  in conjunction with the final rule for our most recent heavy-duty  highway engine and fuel standards.\25\ We performed ozone air quality  modeling for the entire Eastern U.S. covering metropolitan areas from  Texas to the Northeast.\26\ This ozone air quality model was based upon  the same modeling system as was used in the Tier 2 air quality  analysis, with the addition of updated inventory estimates for 2007 and  2030. The results of this modeling were examined for those 37 areas in  the East for which EPA's modeling predicted exceedences in 2007, 2020,  and/or 2030 and the current 1-hour design values are above the standard  or within 10 percent of the standard. This photochemical ozone modeling  for 2020 predicts exceedences of the 1-hour ozone standard in 32 areas  with a total of 89 million people (1999 census) after accounting for  light- and heavy-duty on-highway control programs.\27\ We expect the  NO X  control strategy contained in this Notice for Category 3  marine engines will further assist state efforts already underway to  attain and maintain the 1-hour ozone standard. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \25\ Additional information about this modeling can be found in  our Regulatory Impact Analysis: Heavy-Duty Engine and Vehicle  Standards and Highway Diesel Fuel Sulfur Control Requirements,  document EPA420-R-00-026, December 2000. Docket No. A-2001-11,  Document No. II-A-XX. This document is also available at  http:// www.epa.gov/otaq/diesel.htm#documents .     \26\ We also performed ozone air quality modeling for the  western United States but, as described further in the air quality  technical support document, model predictions were well below  corresponding ambient concentrations for our heavy-duty engine  standards and fuel sulfur control rulemaking. Because of poor model  performance for this region of the country, the results of the  Western ozone modeling were not relied on for that rule.     \27\ Regulatory Impact Analysis: Heavy-Duty Engine and Vehicle  Standards and Highway Diesel Fuel Sulfur Control Requirements, US  EPA, EPA420-R-00-026, December 2000, at II-14, Table II.A-2.

This document is also  available at  http://www.epa.gov/otaq/diesel.htm#documents . ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      In addition to the health effects described above, there exists a  large body of scientific literature that shows that harmful effects can  occur from sustained levels of ozone exposure much lower than 0.125  ppm.\28\ Studies of prolonged exposures, those lasting about 7 hours,  show health effects from prolonged and repeated exposures at moderate  levels of exertion to ozone concentrations as low as 0.08 ppm. The  health effects at these levels of exposure include transient pulmonary  function responses, transient respiratory symptoms, effects on exercise  performance, increased airway responsiveness, increased susceptibility  to respiratory infection, increased hospital and emergency room visits,  and transient pulmonary respiratory inflammation. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \28\ Additional information about these studies can be found in  Chapter 2 of ``Regulatory Impact Analysis: Heavy-Duty Engine and  Vehicle Standards and Highway Diesel Fuel Sulfur Control  Requirements,'' December 2000, EPA420-R-00-026.

Areas with these high concentrations are more widespread than  those in nonattainment for that 1-hour ozone standard. Monitoring data  indicate that 333 counties in 33 states exceed these levels in 1997- 99.\29\ The Agency's recent photochemical ozone modeling forecast that  111 million people are predicted to live in areas that are at risk of  exceeding these moderate ozone levels for prolonged periods of time in  2020 after accounting for expected inventory reductions due to controls  on light- and heavy-duty on-highway vehicles.\30\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \29\ A copy of these data can be found in Air Docket A-2001-11,  Document No. II-A-XX.     \30\ Memorandum to Docket A-99-06 from Eric Ginsburg, EPA,  ``Summary of Model-Adjusted Ambient Concentrations for Certain  Levels of Ground-Level Ozone over Prolonged Periods,'' November 22,  2000, at Table C, Control Scenario--2020 Populations in Eastern  Metropolitan Counties with Predicted Daily 8-Hour Ozone greater than  or equal to 0.080 ppm.

Particulate Matter     Category 3 marine engines that would be subject to the proposed  standards contribute to ambient particulate matter (PM) levels in two  ways. First, they contribute through direct emissions of particulate  matter. Second, they contribute to indirect formation of PM through  their emissions of organic carbon, especially HC. Organic carbon  accounts for between 27 and 36 percent of fine particle mass depending  on the area of the country.     Particulate matter represents a broad class of chemically and  physically diverse substances. It can be principally characterized as  discrete particles that exist in the condensed (liquid or solid) phase  spanning several orders of magnitude in size. All particles equal to  and less than 10 microns are called PM 10 . Fine particles can  be generally defined as those particles with an aerodynamic diameter of  2.5 microns or less (also known as PM 2.5 ), and coarse  fraction particles are those particles with an aerodynamic diameter  greater than 2.5 microns, but equal to or less than a nominal 10  microns.     Particulate matter, like ozone, has been linked to a range of  serious respiratory health problems. Scientific studies suggest a  likely causal role of ambient particulate matter (which is attributable  to several sources including mobile sources) in contributing to a  series of health effects.\31\ The key health effects categories  associated with ambient particulate matter include premature mortality,  aggravation of respiratory and cardiovascular disease (as indicated by  increased hospital admissions and emergency room visits, school  absences, work loss days, and restricted activity days), aggravated  asthma, acute respiratory symptoms, including aggravated coughing and  difficult or painful breathing, chronic bronchitis, and decreased lung  function that can be experienced as shortness of breath. Observable  human noncancer health effects associated with exposure to diesel PM  include some of the same health effects reported for ambient PM such as  respiratory symptoms (cough, labored breathing, chest tightness,  wheezing), and chronic respiratory disease (cough, phlegm, chronic  bronchitis and suggestive evidence for decreases in pulmonary  function). Symptoms of immunological effects such as wheezing and  increased allergenicity are also seen. Exposure to fine particles is  closely associated with such health effects as premature mortality or  hospital admissions for cardiopulmonary disease. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \31\ EPA (1996) Review of the National Ambient Air Quality  Standards for Particulate Matter: Policy Assessment of Scientific  and Technical Information OAQPS Staff Paper.

The  particulate matter air quality criteria documents are also available  at  http://www.epa.gov/ncea/partmatt.htm . ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      PM also causes adverse impacts to the environment. Fine PM is the  major cause of reduced visibility in parts of the United States. Other  environmental impacts occur when particles deposit  [[Page 37559]]  onto soils, plants, water or materials. For example, particles  containing nitrogen and sulphur that deposit on to land or water bodies  may change the nutrient balance and acidity of those environments.  Finally, PM causes soiling and erosion damage to materials, including  culturally important objects such as carved monuments and statues. It  promotes and accelerates the corrosion of metals, degrades paints, and  deteriorates building materials such as concrete and limestone.     The NAAQS for PM 10  were established in 1987. According  to these standards, the short term (24-hour) standard of 150 [mu]g/m\3\  is not to be exceeded more than once per year on average over three  years. The long-term standard specifies an expected annual arithmetic  mean not to exceed 50 [mu]g/m\3\ over three years. Recent PM 10   monitoring data indicate that 14 designated PM 10   nonattainment areas with a projected population of 23 million violated  the PM 10  NAAQS in the period 1997-99. In addition, there are  25 unclassifiable areas that have recently recorded ambient  concentrations of PM 10  above the PM 10  NAAQS.\32\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \32\ EPA adopted a policy in 1996 that allows areas with  PM 10  exceedances that are attributable to natural events  to retain their designation as unclassifiable if the State is taking  all reasonable measures to safeguard public health regardless of the  sources of PM 10  emissions. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      Current 1999 PM 2.5  monitored values, which cover about a  third of the nation's counties, indicate that at least 40 million  people live in areas where long-term ambient fine particulate matter  levels are at or above 16 [mu]g/m\3\ (37 percent of the population in  the areas with monitors).\33\ This 16 [mu]g/m\3\ threshold is the low  end of the range of long term average PM 2.5  concentrations  in cities where statistically significant associations were found with  serious health effects, including premature mortality.\34\ To estimate  the number of people who live in areas where long-term ambient fine  particulate matter levels are at or above 16 [mu]g/m\3\ but for which  there are no monitors, we can use modeling. According to our national  modeled predictions, there were a total of 76 million people (1996  population) living in areas with modeled annual average  PM 2.5  concentrations at or above 16 [mu]g/m\3\ (29 percent  of the population).\35\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \33\ Memorandum to Docket A-99-06 from Eric O.

Thus, we have  estimated future conditions only for the areas with current  PM 2.5  monitored data (which cover about a third of the  nation's counties).

Carbon Monoxide     Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colorless, odorless gas produced through  the incomplete combustion of carbon-based fuels. Carbon monoxide enters  the bloodstream through the lungs and reduces the delivery of oxygen to  the body's organs and tissues. The health threat from CO is most  serious for those who suffer from cardiovascular disease, particularly  those with angina or peripheral vascular disease. Healthy individuals  also are affected, but only at higher CO levels. Exposure to elevated  CO levels is associated with impairment of visual perception, work  capacity, manual dexterity, learning ability and performance of complex  tasks.     High concentrations of CO generally occur in areas with elevated  mobile-source emissions. Peak concentrations typically occur during the  colder months of the year when mobile-source CO emissions are greater  and nighttime inversion conditions are more frequent. This is due to  the enhanced stability in the atmospheric boundary layer, which  inhibits vertical mixing of emissions from the surface.     The current primary NAAQS for CO are 35 parts per million for the  one-hour average and 9 parts per million for the eight-hour average.  These values are not to be exceeded more than once per year. Air  quality carbon monoxide value is estimated using EPA guidance for  calculating design values. In 1999, 30.5 million people (1990 census)  lived in 17 areas designated nonattainment under the CO NAAQS.\38\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \38\ National Air Quality and Emissions Trends Report, 1999,  EPA, 2001, at Table A-19.

A  copy of this table can also be found in Docket No. A-200111,  Document No. II-A-XX. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      Nationally, significant progress has been made over the last decade  to reduce CO emissions and ambient CO concentrations. Total CO  emissions from all sources have decreased 16 percent from 1989 to 1998,  and ambient CO concentrations decreased by 39 percent. During that  time, while the mobile source CO contribution of the inventory remained  steady at about 77 percent, the highway portion decreased from 62  percent of total CO emissions to 56 percent while the nonroad portion  increased from 17 percent to 22 percent.\39\ Over the next decade, we  would expect there to be a minor decreasing trend from the highway  segment due primarily to the more stringent standards for certain  light-duty trucks (LDT2s).\40\ CO standards for passenger cars and  other light-duty trucks and heavy-duty vehicles did not change as a  result of other recent rulemakings. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \39\ National Air Quality and Emissions Trends Report, 1998,  March, 2000; this document is available at  http://www.epa.gov/oar/ aqtrnd98/ .

Other Welfare and Environmental Effects     In addition to the health and welfare concerns just described,  Category 3 marine diesel engines can contribute to regional haze, acid  deposition, and eutrophication and nitrophication. Further information  on these effects can  [[Page 37560]]  be found in Chapter 2 of the Draft Regulatory Support Document.  C. Contribution From Category 3 Marine Diesel Engines  1. National Inventories     We developed baseline Category 3 vessel emissions inventories under  contract with E. H. Pechan & Associates, Inc.\41\ Inventory estimates  were developed separately for vessel traffic within 25 nautical miles  of port areas and vessel traffic outside of port areas but within 175  nautical miles of the coastline. The inventories include all Category 3  traffic, including that on the Great Lakes. Different techniques were  used to develop the port and non-port inventories. For port areas we  developed detailed emissions estimates for nine specific ports using  port activity data including port calls, vessel types and typical times  in different operating modes. Emissions estimates for all other ports  were developed by matching each of those ports to one of the nine  specific ports already analyzed based on characteristics of port  activity, such as predominant vessel types, harbor draft and region of  the country. The detailed port emissions were then scaled to the other  ports based on relative port activity. We developed non-port emissions  inventories using cargo movements and waterways data, vessel speeds,  average dead weight tonnage per ship, and assumed cargo capacity  factors. More detailed information regarding the development of the  baseline emissions inventories can be found in Chapter 6 of the Draft  Regulatory Support Document. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \41\ ``Commercial Marine Emission Inventory Development,'' E.H.  Pechan and Associates, Inc. and ENVIRON International Corporation,  April, 2002. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      There has been little study of the transport of marine vessel  NO X  emissions and the distance they may travel to impact air  quality on land. Pollutant transport is a very complicated subject, and  the transport distance can vary dramatically depending on a variety of  factors, including the pollutant under consideration, as prevailing  wind speed and direction, and other atmospheric conditions. When we  consider how far off the coast to include emissions in our baseline the  correct answer may well vary depending on geographic area and  prevailing atmospheric conditions. Thus, in developing baseline  emissions inventories we looked at two scenarios that we believe  reasonably bracket the distances from shore that vessel emissions my be  emitted and expected in impact air quality on land. First, we looked  only at the pollutants emitted within 25 nautical miles of a port area  as a reasonable lower bound to estimate the national inventory of  Category 3 marine diesel engines. As an upper bound we considered all  Category 3 emissions within 175 nautical miles of shore.     Not surprisingly, these two different distances yield different  inventory results. The 1996 NO X  and PM emissions inventories  are shown in Table II.C-1. We used 1996 as the starting point for this  analysis because that is the most recent year that we have detailed  information available for the nine specific port areas. As will be  discussed later in this section, this initial analysis shows that the  contribution from U.S. and foreign flagged vessels differs between  these two areas.   Table II.C-1.--Category 3 Marine Diesel Engine 1996 Baseline Emissions                                Inventories                           [thousand short tons] ------------------------------------------------------------------------                          Scenario                           NO X      PM ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Within 25 nautical miles of ports........................    101     9.3 Within 175 nautical miles of coast.......................    190    17 ------------------------------------------------------------------------      For the remainder of the analysis associated with the proposed  emissions standards we will consider all emissions that occur within  175 nautical miles from the coast as our primary scenario. We request  comment on all aspects of our emissions inventories. In particular, we  request comment on whether we should consider a range different than  175 nautical miles from the coast as our primary scenario, and why. We  also request comment on whether we should consider different distances  from the coast for different areas of the country. For example, should  we consider a smaller distance on the East coast than the West coast to  account for prevailing wind patterns?     We will continue to investigate this issue throughout this  rulemaking, and will incorporate any new information into the final  rule. For example, the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) has presented  information to us recommending that a different, shorter (offshore  distance) limit be established rather than the proposed 175 nautical  miles as the appropriate location where emissions from marine vessels  would affect on-shore air quality. DoD's extensive work on the marine  vessels issue in Southern California resulted in a conclusion that  emissions within 60 nautical miles of shore could make it back to the  coast due to eddies and the nature of the sea breeze effects. Satellite  data however showed a distinct tendency for a curved line of  demarcation separating the offshore (unobstructed) or parallel ocean  wind flow from a region of more turbulent, recirculated air which would  impact on-shore areas. That curved line of demarcation was close to San  Nicolas Island which is about 60 nautical miles offshore. Studies and  published information on other coastal areas in California indicates  that they experience somewhat narrower (perhaps 30 nautical miles)  region of ``coastal influence.'' The Gulf Coast and the U.S. East coast  would similarly have their own unique meteorological conditions that  might call for different lines of demarcation between on-shore and off- shore effects.     To estimate inventories for years after 1996, we developed  inventory projections based on expected increases in vessel freight  movement and expected changes in vessel characteristics, as well as  fleet turnover based on 25 years as the average age of the world fleet  at time of scrappage. We also take the MARPOL Annex VI NO X   limits into account because, although these international  NO X  standards are not yet in force, we expect that most, if  not all shipbuilders and shipping companies around the world are  currently complying with them, and we expect this trend to continue.  Our estimated emissions inventories are based on the assumption that  all vessels built after 1999, both U.S. and foreign flagged, will  comply with the MARPOL NO X  limits. Table II.C-2 shows the  future year NO X  and PM inventories for selected years out to  2030. More detailed information regarding the development of the future  year emissions inventories can be found in Chapter 6 of the Draft  Regulatory Support Document. We request comment on these inventory  projections. In particular, we request comment on whether freight  growth will continue at the exponential rate that is has seen in the  past, and for how long such exponential growth can be expected to  continue.     One very important consideration in projecting future year  inventories is the make up and size of the future vessel fleet. The  size and make up of the future U.S. flagged fleet is dependent on  vessel construction at U.S. shipyards, the nature of vessel replacement  practices, and any growth in the number of ships in the fleet.  Projecting future vessel production at U.S. shipyards is difficult for  two reasons. First, vessel construction totals for U.S. shipyards  [[Page 37561]]  have varied quite a bit from year to year, with no clear trends.  Second, the U.S. government discontinued subsidies to U.S. shipyards in  1983, creating a dramatic downward shift in production at U.S.  shipyards. We request comment on likely future production at U.S.  shipyards, including production estimates and the rationale behind the  estimates. Vessel replacement practices also play a role in future year  emissions inventory projections. For example, the current U.S. flagged  fleet contains a large number of older steamships. We request comment  on whether these steamships are likely to be replaced with diesels when  they are scrapped. We also request comment on whether there are any  other vessel replacement practices or trends that we should consider  when projecting future year emissions inventories. As shown in Chapter  6 of the Draft Regulatory Support Document, a substantial portion of  the U.S. flagged fleet is over 30 years old. We request comment on the  size and nature of any increase in U.S. shipbuilding activity that may  occur in the near future in an effort to replace the aging fleet.  Finally, we request comment on whether the total number of U.S. flagged  vessels is expected to grow substantially in the future and why.

This table shows the relative  contributions of the different mobile-source categories to the overall  national mobile-source inventory. Of the total emissions from mobile  sources, all Category 3 marine diesel engines contributed about 1.5  percent of NO X  and 2.6 percent of PM emissions in the year  2000.     Our draft emission projections for 2020 for Category 3 marine  diesel engines show how emissions from these engines are expected to  increase over time if left uncontrolled beyond the MARPOL Annex VI  NO X  limits. The projections for 2020 are summarized in Table  II.C-4 and indicate that Category 3 marine diesel engines are expected  to contribute 5.7 percent NO X  and 5.8 percent of PM  emissions in the year 2020. Population growth and the effects of other  regulatory control programs are factored into these projections. The  relative importance of uncontrolled nonroad engines is higher than the  projections for 2000 because there are already emission control  programs in place for the other categories of mobile sources which are  expected to reduce their emission levels.

Inventories for Specific Ports     In the previous section we presented estimates of Category 3 marine  diesel engine emissions as percentages of the national mobile source  inventory. Total national man-made source inventories were also  included in Tables II.C-3 and II.C-4 for comparison. However, marine  vessel activity tends to be concentrated in port areas, and thus we  would expect that Category 3 marine diesel engines would have a  proportionately bigger impact on the mobile source pollution  inventories of port areas. Using the port-specific Category 3  inventories developed for use in our national inventory in conjunction  with total port area inventories developed in support of the heavy-duty  on-highway 2007 rule, we developed estimates of the contribution of  Category 3 marine diesel engines to the mobile source NO X   and PM inventories of several selected port areas, including several  ozone nonattainment areas. The NO X  results are shown in  Table II.C-5, and the PM results are shown in Table II.C-6. As can be  seen from these tables, the relative contribution of Category 3 marine  diesel engine pollution to mobile source pollution is expected to  increase in the future. This is due both to the expected growth of  shipping traffic in the future and the effect of emissions control  programs already in place for other mobile sources.

Emissions in Nonport Areas     These ships can also have a significant impact on inventories in  areas without large commercial ports. For example, Santa Barbara  estimates that engines on ocean-going marine vessels contribute about  37 percent of total NO X  in their area. These emissions are  from ships that transit the area, and ``are comparable to (even  slightly larger than) the amount of NO X  produced onshore by  cars and truck.\42\ These emissions are expected to increase to 62  percent by 2015. While Santa Barbara's exact conditions may be unique  due to the relative close proximity of heavily used shipping channels  to shore and the meteorological conditions in their area, other coastal  areas may also have relatively high inventory impacts from ocean-going  vessels. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \42\ Memorandum to Docket A-2001-11 from Jean Marie Revelt,  ``Santa Barbara County Air Quality News, Issue 62, July-August 2001  and other materials provided to EPA by Santa Barbara County,'' March  14, 2002. Air Docket A-2001-11. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------  4. Contribution by Flag     It is important to determine how much of the Category 3 marine  diesel engine pollution inventory is contributed by U.S. flagged  vessels given that we are considering whether to restrict application  of the proposed standards and standards under consideration to U.S.  flag vessels only or to apply the standards to all vessels (U.S. and  foreign-flag entering U.S. ports). We estimated the relative  contribution of U.S. and foreign flagged vessels separately for the  port areas and the non-port areas due to the fact that we had different  data sets available to us for the two areas.     We estimated the contribution of U.S. flagged vessels for the ports  areas using port call data obtained from the U.S. Maritime  Administration (MARAD). These data contained all port calls in 1999 to  U.S. ports by vessels of greater than 1000 gross registered tons,  including the country in which they are flagged and the number of port  calls each vessel made. An analysis of the port call data shows that  U.S. flagged vessels only account for 6.4 percent of port calls to U.S.  ports. For the lack of more detailed information regarding the breakout  of U.S. and foreign flagged vessel emissions we applied the percentage  of port calls from U.S. and foreign flagged vessels to the national  ports inventories to determine the relative contributions of each to  the national ports inventories.     We used freight tonnage data from the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers  (USACE) to develop relative U.S. and foreign flagged emissions  contributions in non-ports areas within 175 nautical miles of the  coast. In contrast to the data for the ports areas, the USACE data  suggests that more than 80 percent of the non-ports emissions come from  U.S. flagged vessels.     The relative contributions from U.S. and foreign flagged vessels  are quite different between the ports areas and the non-ports areas.  Some of this difference can be explained through U.S. cabotage law,  which requires that any vessel operating between two U.S. ports be U.S.  flagged. Thus, while most port traffic is foreign flagged, the foreign  flagged vessels would tend to come into a single U.S. port and then  leave U.S. waters. In contrast, U.S. flagged vessels would typically  travel from one U.S. port to another, thus accounting for a higher  percentage of the non-ports emissions. We request comment on this  assessment of U.S. and foreign flagged vessel contributions, as well as  additional data that would help us further understand the relative  contributions of U.S. and foreign flagged vessels to the national  pollution inventories.     For the purposes of the future inventory projections we assumed  that the current split of U.S. and foreign flagged emissions would  continue. However, this assumption, in combination with our assumed  growth rates, implies that the manufacture of Category 3 vessels in the  U.S. for the U.S. flagged fleet would occur in the future at rates  greater than the recent build rate of around two vessels per year. More  likely, seven to nine new U.S. flagged vessels would need to be built  per year to accommodate the U.S. flagged vessel emissions growth  assumptions. We request comment on whether the U.S. flagged fleet is  expected to grow at this rate in the future, or instead whether a  growing fraction of vessel emissions would come from foreign flagged  vessels in the future. Specifically, we request comment on the likely  replacement rates and expected new capacity of the U.S. fleet in the  future.  III. What Engines Are Covered?      The scope of application of this proposal is broadly set by Clean  Air Act section 213(a)(3), which instructs us to set standards for new  nonroad engines and new nonroad vehicles. In this case, the proposed  rule is intended to cover all new marine diesel engines installed on  vessels flagged or registered in the United States that have a specific  engine displacement greater than or equal to 30 liters per cylinder.  Under the requirements of the Clean Air Act, once emission standards  apply to a group of  [[Page 37564]]  engines, a manufacturer of a new engine must get a certificate of  conformity from us before selling an engine, importing an engine, or  otherwise introducing an engine into commerce in the United  States.43 44 We also require vessel manufacturers to install  only certified engines on new vessels that will be flagged or  registered in the United States once emission standards apply. The  certificate of conformity (and corresponding engine label) provide  assurance that engine manufacturers have met their obligation to make  engines that meet the emission standards over the useful life we  specify in the regulations. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \43\ The term ``manufacturer'' means any person engaged in the  manufacturing or assembling of new engines or importing such engines  for resale, or who acts for and is under the control of any such  person in connection with the distribution of such engines. 40 CFR  94.2.     \44\ For this proposal, we consider the United States to include  the States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto  Rico, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam,  American Samoa, and the Virgin Islands. See CAA section 302(d)  definition of ``State.'' ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      The scope of application for emission standards for commercial  marine diesel engines up to 30 liters per cylinder was established in  our 1999 rulemaking ( 64 FR 73300 , December 29, 1999). In that rule, we  adopted a set of clarifying definitions that apply to those commercial  marine diesel engines and the vessels that use them. We are proposing  to apply those definitions to Category 3 marine diesel engines for the  purpose of identifying the engines and vessels that must comply with  the proposed standards. According to those definitions, which can be  found in 40 CFR 94.2, a Category 3 marine diesel engine would be  subject to the proposed standards if it is:      • Manufactured after the emission standards become effective,  whether domestic or imported; • Installed for the first time in a marine vessel flagged in  the U.S. after having been used in another application subject to  different emission standards; or • Installed on a new vessel flagged in the U.S.     At the same time we are soliciting comment on whether the emission  standards should also apply to marine engines on foreign vessels  entering U.S. ports and to no longer exclude such foreign vessels from  the emission standards under 40 CFR [sect] 94.1(b)(3). We are inviting  comment on whether to modify the definition of a ``new marine engine''  to find that engine emission standards would apply to Category 1, 2 and  3 marine diesel engines that are manufactured after the standards  become effective and that are installed on a foreign flagged vessel  that enters a U.S. port. If we were to adopt such an approach, we  anticipate the standards would also apply to any marine engine that is  installed on a foreign vessel if the vessel is manufactured (or that  otherwise become new) after the standards become effective.     We are also proposing to eliminate the foreign trade exemption.  Under this exemption, contained in 40 CFR section 94.906(d), engines on  vessels flagged or registered in the United States that spend less than  25 percent of total operating time within 320 kilometers of U.S.  territory are not required to comply with the proposed limits. This  would generally affect auxiliary engines, which are usually less than  30 liters per cylinder.     EPA is not considering inclusion of gas turbines in this rulemaking  given the limited amount of information that we currently have about  emissions from turbines. EPA's current belief is that gas turbines  generally have lower emissions than diesels. However, we are requesting  that commenters provide to us any emissions information that is  available as well as whether it would be appropriate to regulate  turbines and diesels together. Commenters supporting the regulation of  turbines should also address whether any special provisions would be  needed for the testing and certification of turbines.     In the remainder of this section we discuss the proposed scope of  application of the rule in greater detail.  A. What Is a Marine Vessel?      For the purpose of our marine diesel engine standards, ``marine  vessel'' has the meaning specified in the General Provisions of the  United States Code, 1 U.S.C. 3 (see 40 CFR 94.2). According to that  definition, the word ``vessel'' includes ``every description of  watercraft or other artificial contrivance used, or capable of being  used, as a means of transportation on water.''  B. What Is a Category 3 Marine Diesel Engine?      In our 1999 commercial marine diesel engine rule, we defined marine  engine as an engine that is installed or intended to be installed on a  marine vessel. We also differentiated between three types of marine  diesel engines. As explained in that rule, this approach is necessary  because marine diesel engines are typically derivatives of land-based  diesel engines and the land-based engines are not all subject to the  same numerical standards and effective dates.     The definitions for the different categories of marine diesel  engines are contained in 40 CFR 94.2. Category 1 marine diesel engines,  those having a rated power greater than or equal to 37 kilowatts and a  specific engine displacement less than 5.0 liters per cylinder, are  similar to land-based nonroad engines used in construction and farm  equipment. Category 2 marine diesel engines, those having a specific  engine displacement greater than or equal to 5.0 liters per cylinder  but less than 30 liters per cylinder, are most often similar to  locomotive engines. Category 1 and Category 2 marine diesel engines are  used as propulsion engines (i.e., an engine that moves a vessel through  the water or directs the movement of a vessel (40 CFR 94.2)) on tugs,  fishing vessels, supply vessels, and smaller cargo vessels. They are  also used as auxiliary engines (i.e., a marine engine that is not a  propulsion engine (40 CFR 94.2)) to provide electricity for navigation  equipment and crew service or other services such as pumping or  powering winches or anchors.     Category 3 marine diesel engines, which are the primary focus of  this proposal, are defined as having a specific engine displacement  greater than or equal to 30 liters per cylinder. These are very large  engines used for propulsion on large vessels such as container ships,  tankers, bulk carriers, and cruise ships. Most of these engines are  installed on ocean-going vessels, although a few are found on ships in  the Great Lakes. Category 3 marine diesel engines have no land-based  mobile source counterpart, although they are similar to engines used to  generate electricity in municipal power plants. In marine applications  they are either mechanical drive or indirect drive. Mechanical drive  engines can be direct drive (engine speed is the same as propeller  speed; this is common on very large ships) or have a gearbox (i.e.,  they have reduction gears; this is common on ships using medium speed  Category 3 marine diesel engines). Indirect drive engines are used to  generate electricity that is then used to turn the propeller shaft.  These are common in cruise ships since they have heavy electricity  demands. Category 3 marine diesel engines typically operate at a lower  speed and higher power than Category 1 and Category 2 engines, with the  slowest speed being 130-200 rpm.  [[Page 37565]]              Table III.B-1--Marine Engine Category Definitions ------------------------------------------------------------------------                   Displacement per    Category           cylinder          hp range (kW)       rpm range ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 1.............  disp. < 5 liters            37-2,300       1,800-3,000                  (and power [ge] 37                  kW). 2.............  5 [le] disp. < 30        1,500-8,000         750-1,500                  liters. 3.............  disp [ge] 30 liters.     2,500-80,000         80-900 ------------------------------------------------------------------------  C. What Is a New Marine Diesel Engine?  1. The Current Regulatory Definition     As set out in 40 CFR 94.2, a new marine engine is (i) a marine  engine, the equitable or legal title to which has never been  transferred to an ultimate purchaser; (ii) a marine engine installed on  a vessel, the equitable or legal title to such vessel has never been  transferred to an ultimate purchaser; or (iii) a marine engine that has  not been placed into service on a vessel. In cases where the equitable  or legal title to an engine or vessel is not transferred to an ultimate  purchaser prior to its being placed into service, an engine ceases to  be new after it is placed into service.     What this means is that a marine engine is new and is subject to  the proposed standards before its initial sale is completed or it is  placed into service. Practically, it means that any engine must meet  the proposed emission standards that are in effect the first time it is  sold or placed into service or the first time the vessel on which it is  installed is sold or placed into service. This is true for any engine  that is sold for the first time as a marine engine (placed into service  on a marine vessel), regardless of whether it has previously been used  in other nonroad or on-highway purposes. This clarification is  necessary because some marine engines are made by ``marinizing''  existing land-based nonroad or highway engines. Without this  clarification a marinized used highway or land-based engine would not  be subject to the standards since its title was already transferred to  the initial highway or land-based nonroad user.     With respect to imported marine diesel engines, 40 CFR 94.2 defines  ``new'' as an engine that is not covered by a certificate of conformity  at the time of importation and that was manufactured after the starting  date of the emissions standards which are applicable to such engine (or  which would be applicable to such engine had it been manufactured for  importation into the United States). According to this definition, the  proposed standards would apply to engines that are imported by any  person, whether newly manufactured or used, and whether they are  imported as uninstalled engines or if they are already installed on a  marine vessel that is imported into the U.S. In one example, a person  may want to import a vessel built after the effective date of the  standards but the engine does not have a certificate of conformity from  EPA because the engines and vessel were manufactured elsewhere. We  would still consider it to be a new engine or vessel, and it would need  to comply with the applicable emission standards. This provision is  important to prevent manufacturers from trying to avoid the emission  standards by building vessels abroad, transferring their title, and  then importing them as used vessels. 2. Should Engines on Foreign Flag Vessels That Enter U.S. Ports Be  Covered?     Today's proposal solicits comment on whether to modify the  definition of a ``new'' marine engine to find that engine emission  standards apply to Category 1, 2, and 3 marine diesel engines that are  built after the standards become effective and that are installed on  foreign flag vessels that enter U.S. ports. Such vessels and their  engines would be subject to U.S. engine emission standards as a  condition of port state entry.     The 1999 marine engine rule did not apply to marine engines on  foreign vessels. 40 CFR 94.1(b)(3). At that time we concluded that  engines installed on vessels flagged in another country that come into  the United States temporarily will not be subject to the emission  standards. Those vessels are not considered imported under the U.S.  customs laws, and under the interpretation adopted in that rule we did  not consider their engines ``new'' for purposes of Clean Air Act  section 213, 42 U.S.C. 7547.  64 FR 73300, 73302  (Dec. 12, 1999).     Section 213 authorizes regulation of ``new nonroad engine'' and  ``new nonroad vehicle.'' However, Title II of the Clean Air Act does  not define either ``new nonroad engine'' or ``new nonroad vehicle.''  Section 216 defines a ``new motor vehicle engine'' to include an engine  that has been ``imported.'' EPA modeled the current regulatory  definitions of ``new nonroad engine''and ``new marine engine'' at 40  CFR 89.2 and 40 CFR 94.2, respectively, after the statutory definitions  of ``new motor vehicle engine'' and ``new motor vehicle.'' Because  ``new nonroad engine'' is not defined in the statute, EPA is seeking  comment on whether ``new nonroad engine'' could be defined to include  marine engines on foreign vessels that enter U.S. ports and that are  manufactured after the standards go into effect, whether or not they  are considered imported under the U.S. customs laws. EPA also invites  comment on whether the term ``import,'' which is not defined in Title  II, should be defined to include foreign flag vessels, for purposes of  the definition of ``new nonroad engine'' only, whether or not they are  considered imported under the U.S. customs laws.     EPA has discretion in defining ``new nonroad engine'' as it is used  in Section 213 of the Act. EPA solicits comment on whether it would be  appropriate and within EPA's authority to exercise this discretion to  define ``new nonroad engine'' to include marine engines on foreign  vessels that enter US ports, in light of environmental and  international oceans policy and any other relevant factors, including  consideration of their significant emissions contribution to air  quality problems in the United States. If EPA were to regulate foreign- flagged vessels, such vessels would be subject to enforcement as a  condition of port entry.     Even if EPA determined that it had the discretion to define ``new  nonroad engine'' as outlined above, EPA could conclude that the most  appropriate exercise of its discretion would involve retention of the  1999 definition of ``new nonroad engine.'' EPA could conclude that  revising the definition would not be warranted at this time because of  the potential implications that setting engine emission standards for  foreign vessels might have on international commerce and future  international negotiations under MARPOL and in other fora. EPA will  consider, therefore, whether setting a national standard in this  situation and changing its interpretation of ``new nonroad engine'' to  apply this standard to foreign vessels could adversely affect the U.S.'  position with respect to the variety of other international issues that  are addressed under MARPOL and in other fora. In considering whether to  impose requirements on foreign vessels that are  [[Page 37566]]  more stringent than those imposed on such vessels by their flag states  or which may be more stringent than those set out in international  instruments (or agreements), EPA will consider whether this would raise  questions of international oceans policy or would have adverse  ramifications on U.S. foreign policy.     In such a case, it might be more appropriate at this time to  exercise any discretion EPA may have by retaining the 1999 definition  of ``new nonroad engine.''     However EPA decides this issue it would be free to revisit it in  the future as appropriate. For example, EPA could revisit any decision  to retain the 1999 definition if negotiations with other nations do not  lead to international agreement on emissions that adequately protect  air quality in the U.S. when foreign vessels enter U.S. ports.     EPA also clarifies that any extension of the rule to foreign flag  vessels would not include extension to any warship, naval auxiliary, or  other ship owned or operated by a foreign state and used for government  noncommercial service. 3. Should Engines on Foreign Flag Vessels Be Covered Regardless of the  Number of Their Annual Visits?     If we were to apply the standards to engines that are manufactured  after the standards become effective and that are installed on foreign  flag vessels that enter U.S. ports, one thing to consider is whether  this provision should be limited by the number of times a vessel visits  U.S. ports annually.     Were we to apply the standards to engines on foreign flag vessels,  using a strict approach, any engines on a vessel manufactured (or that  otherwise becomes new) after the effective date of the standards, or  manufactured before the effective date but has engines that are  manufactured after the effective date, that comes to the United States,  whether once a year, twenty times a year, or even more, would be  required to have compliant engines.     An alternative approach would apply the standards only to those  vessels that are frequent visitors to the United States. A review of  1999 data on vessel entrances from the United States Maritime  Administration for 1999 indicates that there is considerable variation  in the number of vessel entrances per ship. According to that data,  which is described in more detail in Chapter 2 of the draft Regulatory  Support Document for this rulemaking, there were about 2,500 foreign  flag vessels that made only one or two entrances into the United States  in 1999. These vessels accounted for 33 percent of all foreign flag  vessels that entered this country, but they accounted for only about 5  percent of all vessel entrances. There were about 3,900 foreign flag  vessels that entered the United States four or fewer times in that  year, accounting for about 52 percent of all vessels, but they  accounted for only about 12.5 percent of all vessel entrances. In other  words, there is a large set of vessels that come to the United States  only a few times a year. The vast majority of entrances by foreign flag  vessels, 87.5 percent, are made by about 3,700 vessels that come here 5  or more times a year. We estimate that emissions from engines on  foreign flag vessels were on average about 1.7 tons NO X  per  vessel in 2000. This means that foreign vessels that enter U.S. ports  only once or twice a year contributed about 6,100 tons of  NO X  in 2000 (about 3 percent of total Category 3  NO X  emissions of 195,000 tons), and foreign flag vessels  that entered U.S. ports four or fewer times a year contributed about  14,500 tons of NO X  in 2000 (about 7.4 percent of Category 3  NO X  emissions).     If we were to conclude that it was appropriate under the Clean Air  Act to apply the standards to engines on foreign flag vessels, it might  be appropriate to exempt engines on foreign-flag vessels that come to  the United States only a few times a year. This could be a temporary  exemption that would apply only as long as a vessel remains below the  threshold number of vessel entrances. To qualify for such an exemption,  the shipowner would have to show that the ship does not frequently  enter U.S. ports. This demonstration could be made based on the average  number of times the vessel entered the United States in the previous  two years, for existing vessels, or on the expected usage of the vessel  for new vessels (e.g., a regular container or tanker route), for new  vessels. In any case, a shipowner that did not obtain an exemption  would have to demonstrate in some form that the vessel's engines are  compliant. In other words, under such an approach, each foreign flag  that seeks to enter a U.S. port would be required to have either a  compliant engines or an exemption from the program based on the  frequency of its visits. Under this approach, such a requirement would  apply for every trip, not just trips in excess of the threshold number  of trips to obtain the exemption.     This alternative relies on the assumption that a vessel that enters  the United States only periodically does not have dramatically  different number of vessel entrances from year to year. We request  comment on whether this is, in fact, the case. Another important aspect  of such an exemption for foreign flag vessels, if we were to include  them in this rule, is what would happen if the vessel wished to make a  third, or fifth, entry into a U.S. port. This is important because of  the certification burden associated with making that extra annual trip.  The owner of a ship with such an exemption would have to be confident  that the vessel would not seek entry more than the allowable number of  times. Alternatively, it might be possible to petition EPA for  permission to enter an extra time. This might require entering into a  settlement agreement in advance of a violation of the terms of the  exemption. The settlement could include a fine, a restriction on the  number of entries in the future, or some other requirement. We seek  comment on this as well as alternative methods to address the case in  which a ship would seek to enter U.S. ports in excess of the number of  visits specified in the exemption, and on whether obtaining an advance  agreement with EPA would be too burdensome.     We request comment on all aspects of this potential alternative.  Specifically, we request comment on the number of times a ship should  be allowed to enter U.S. ports in a twelve-month period before being  required to have compliant engines. We also request comment on whether  there is much variability in port entries from year to year for vessels  that come to U.S. ports only periodically.  D. What is a New Marine Vessel?      The definition of new vessel is set out in 40 CFR 94.2. This  definition is similar to the definition of new engine: a new marine  vessel is a vessel the equitable or legal title of which has never been  transferred to an ultimate purchaser. In the case where the equitable  or legal title to a vessel is not transferred to an ultimate purchaser  prior to its being placed into service, a vessel ceases to be new when  it is placed into service. Thus, a vessel is new and must have a  certified engine and meet any other requirements for new vessels until  its initial sale is completed or it is placed into service.     In addition, a vessel is considered to be new when it has been  modified such that the value of the modifications exceeds 50 percent of  the value of the modified vessel. As noted in our 1999 rulemaking, this  provision is intended to prevent someone from re-using the hull or  other parts from a used vessel to avoid emission standards. When  applying this provision, the modifications must be completed prior  [[Page 37567]]  to the effective date of the standards that would otherwise apply. For  example, if a second tier of engine standards goes into effect in 2007,  modifications that are completed by December 31, 2006 will not trigger  the engine requirements and the engines on that vessel would not have  to meet the standards. However, if the vessel modifications are  completed on or after January 1, 2007, and they exceed 50 percent of  the value of the modified vessel, then the engines on the vessel must  meet the standards regardless of whether they have been changed as part  of the vessel modification.     The definition in 40 CFR 94.2 refers to the ``value'' of the  modifications, rather than the costs. This should therefore be based on  the appraised value of the vessel before modifications compared with  the value of the modified vessel. The following equation demonstrates  the calculation, showing that a vessel is new if: [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TP29MY02.012      If the value of the modifications exceeds 50 per cent of the final  value of the modified vessel, we would treat the vessel as new under 40  CFR part 94. To evaluate whether the modified vessel would be  considered new, one would need to project the fair market value of the  modified vessel based on an objective assessment, such as an appraisal  for insurance or financing purposes, or some other third-party  analysis. While the preliminary decision can be based on the projected  value of the modified vessel, the decision must also be valid when  basing the calculations on the actual assessed value of the vessel  after modifications are complete.  E. Would the Foreign Trade Exemption Be Retained?      In addition to their main propulsion engines, which are generally  Category 3 marine diesel engines, ocean-going commercial vessels  typically have several Category 1 and Category 2 engines that are used  in auxiliary power applications. They provide electricity for important  navigational and maneuvering equipment, and crew services.     Several commenters to our earlier marine diesel engine rulemaking  expressed concern that requiring ship owners to obtain and use  compliant Category 1 and Category 2 engines for vessels that spend most  of their time outside the U.S. could be burdensome for those vessels if  these engines need to be repaired or replaced when they are away from  U.S. ports. Consequently, we provided a foreign trade exemption for  these engines. A vessel owner can obtain this exemption for Category 1  and Category 2 marine diesel engines if it can be demonstrated to the  Administrator's satisfaction that the vessel: (a) Will spend less than  25 percent of its total engine operation time within 320 kilometers of  U.S. territory; or (b) will not operate between two U.S. ports (40 CFR  94.906(d)). Engines that are exempt under this provision must be  labeled to indicate that they have been certified only to the MARPOL  Annex VI NO X  curve limits and that they are for use solely  on vessels that meet the above criteria.     Today, we are proposing to eliminate this foreign trade exemption  because the conditions that led to the need for it no longer hold.  Specifically, we have learned that many engine spare parts are kept  onboard vessels to enable ship operators to perform maintenance and  repairs while the ship is underway. In addition, obtaining parts that  are not kept onboard is not expected to be a problem. Modern package  delivery systems should allow ship owners to obtain parts quickly, even  overnight, and necessary parts can be shipped to the next convenient  port on a ship's route. In the unlikely case that an engine fails  catastrophically and must be replaced by a compliant engine, we are  confident that the ship operator will be able to make arrangements to  obtain a certified engine since the major manufacturers of marine  diesel engines operate abroad as well as in the United States. Because  the burden associated with repairing or replacing engines away from the  United States is not significant, we believe it is appropriate to  eliminate the exemption. We do not expect this change to have any  impact on shipowners and operators, however, we request comments on the  elimination of this exemption. Would this change have any measurable  impact on U.S. flag shipowners or operators? Would it put U.S. flag  shipowners or operators at a competitive disadvantage, in particular if  a Tier 2 standard is included in the final rule? If so, please provide  information supporting this concern.  IV. Standards and Technological Feasibility  A. What Engine Emission Standards Are Under Consideration?      Manufacturers of Category 3 marine engines have available a wide  range of technologies to control emissions. Many of these technologies  are similar to those that have been developed for smaller nonroad and  highway diesel engines. While Category 3 marine engines are much larger  than other regulated diesel engines, many of the same engineering  principles of emission formation and control apply. In fact,  manufacturers have applied significant effort to reduce emissions from  these engines, both to meet Annex VI NO X  standards and to  develop technologies to address concerns in specific areas. At the same  time, it is clear that a substantial opportunity remains to adapt  technologies to Category 3 marine engines     The following discussion of emission standards and the associated  control technologies applies without respect to whether the standards  ultimately apply only to U.S.-flag vessels or to all vessels calling on  U.S. ports. Engine technology has become a very global field, with  emission-control technology and compliant engines coming from all parts  of the world. Manufacturers and owners of foreign-flag vessels would  not face any unique constraints in using engines certified to EPA  emission standards compared with U.S.-flag vessels. Nevertheless, we  are proposing emission standards only for engines installed on U.S.- flag vessels, so references in this section to Category 3 marine  engines apply specifically to those engines that would be subject to  the proposed emission standards, unless otherwise noted.      Clean Air Act section 213 directs EPA to adopt standards  requiring: * * *the greatest degree of emission reduction achievable  through the application of technology which the Administrator  determines will be available for the engines or vehicles to which  such standards apply, giving appropriate consideration to the cost  of applying such technology within the period of time available to  manufacturers and to noise, energy, and safety factors associated  with the application of such technology.  To implement this Clean Air Act directive, we are seeking comment on  two separate tiers of emission standards  [[Page 37568]]  for new marine diesel engines, as described below.     This section also describes an approach for setting Tier 2 HC and  CO standards, applying Tier 1 standards to engines between 2.5 and 30  liters per cylinder, and defining voluntary low-emission standards. 1. Tier 1 Emission Standards     We propose to adopt a first tier of standards starting in the 2004  model year \45\ equivalent to the Annex VI NO X  limits.  Manufacturers have introduced basic emission-control technologies for  all types of marine diesel engines in response to the Annex VI  standards. This effort has demonstrated the feasibility of in-cylinder  technologies including optimized turbocharging, higher compression  ratio, and optimized fuel injection, which generally includes timing  retard and changes to the number and size of injector holes to increase  injection pressure. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \45\ We are proposing to base model years on the date on which  the engine is first assembled. In other rules, we have defined the  date of manufacture to be the date of the final assembly of the  engine. However, we recognize that Category 3 engines are often  disassembled for shipment to the site at which it is installed in  the ship. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      As described in Section V, we are proposing to accept emission data  for Tier 1 certification based on testing with either distillate or  residual fuel. Since most or all manufacturers have been using  distillate fuel to comply with Annex VI requirements, we expect  manufacturers to meet Tier 1 standards generally by submitting their  available emission data from testing with distillate fuels. However,  since Annex VI does not include detailed specifications for test fuels,  we believe that we will need to correct emission data for the effect of  fuel nitrogen content. This correction is described later in this  section. We would require that certified engines continue to meet Tier  1 emission standards throughout their useful life when tested with  either distillate or residual fuel, after correction for the effect of  fuel nitrogen. The proposed Tier 1 NO X  limits, reflecting  the fuel adjustment, are set out in Table IV.A-1.        Table IV.A-1.--Proposed Tier 1 NO X  Emission Limits (g/kW-hr)* ------------------------------------------------------------------------        Engine speed (n)            n [ge] 130 rpm**       n < 130 rpm ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Tier 1........................      45.0xn-0.2 + 1.4              18.4 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ * The proposed regulations specify emission standards based on testing   with measured emission values corrected to take into account the   nitrogen content of the fuel. Emission values are corrected to values   consistent with testing engines with fuel containing 0.4 weight   percent nitrogen. Testing with fuel containing 0.2 weight-percent   nitrogen (typical for in-use distillate marine fuels) would have a   correction of 1.4 g/kW-hr, so the proposed Tier 1 NO X  standards would   match the Annex VI NO X  standards at this test point. ** No cap would apply to engines over 2000 rpm, because Category 3   engines all have engine speeds well below that speed.      We are also proposing to apply the Tier 1 standards to all marine  diesel engines with specific displacement between 2.5 and 30 liters per  cylinder. This would apply to these engines from 2004 to 2006, after  which the EPA Tier 2 marine engine emission standards established in  December 1999 would apply ( 64 FR 73300 , December 29, 1999). All testing  to show compliance for these engines would be based on testing with  distillate fuels meeting the specifications in 40 CFR 94.108.\46\ As  with the Category 3 engines, this would merely formalize the Annex VI  standards, which these engines should already meet. Including these  engines in this proposal would remove any ambiguity regarding the  applicability of emission standards. We are not proposing to include  engines under 2.5 liters per cylinder, because the December 1999  emission standards generally start already in 2004. Marine diesel  engines below 0.9 liters per cylinder need not meet EPA emission  standards until 2005. Most of those engines are under 130 kW and are  therefore not subject to Annex VI standards. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \46\ Without the fuel-based corrections described below, the  proposed Tier 1 standards for these engines default to  NO X  = 45.0 -0.2, with emissions  capped at 9.8 g/kW-hr for engine speeds over 2000 rpm. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------  2. Effect of Fuel Variables on Emission Standards     Another objective of the Clean Air Act is to adopt test procedures  that represent in-use operating conditions as much as possible,  including specification of test fuels consistent with the fuels that  compliant engines will use over their lifetimes. This raises the  question of testing Category 3 marine engines with distillate and  residual fuel. Distillate fuel has a higher quality than residual fuel,  but costs significantly more, so vessels with Category 3 marine engines  primarily use residual fuel. The Annex VI emission standard is based on  allowing manufacturers to test with marine distillate fuels, which  generally have nitrogen levels of 0.0 to 0.4 weight percent. As  discussed in the Draft Regulatory Support Document, NO X   emission levels increase with greater amounts of nitrogen that are  bound up in the fuel. Residual fuels generally have higher nitrogen  concentrations (typically 0.2 to 0.6 weight percent).     We are proposing that manufacturers of Category 3 engines may  certify that they meet the applicable emission standards using either  distillate or residual fuel. The proposed regulations include a range  of fuel specifications for each fuel type (40 CFR 94.108). However, for  testing engines after installation in the vessel, we would expect  manufacturers to use residual fuel. This would add assurance that  emission-control technologies reduce emissions under real operation in  vessels. Without this assurance, manufacturers could implement and  optimize technologies to achieve substantial emission control with  distillate fuel without necessarily reducing emissions when engines  operate with residual fuel.     To appropriately account for the emission-related effects of fuel  quality, we analyzed the effect of nitrogen in contributing to  NO X  emissions. The first step is to assign a default  nitrogen content for distillate fuels as a benchmark to properly  characterize the Annex VI NO X  standards. Fuel sampling shows  an average concentration of 0.2 percent nitrogen in distillate fuel by  weight (i.e., weight percent).\47\ The comparable average value for  residual fuels is 0.4 weight percent. To adjust the standard for  testing with high-nitrogen residual fuel, we calculated the amount of  additional NO X  that would form if all the additional fuel- bound nitrogen would react to form NO X . This calculation  depends on assigning a value for brake-specific fuel consumption, for  which we use 220 g/  [[Page 37569]]  kW-hr.\48\ The resulting correction of 1.4 g/kW-hr shows up as an  additive term in the equation in Table IV.A-1, since it is a constant  value (independent of speed), assuming a consistent brake-specific fuel  consumption rate.\49\ For all testing with Category 3 engines, we would  require measuring fuel-bound nitrogen and correcting measured values to  what would occur with a nitrogen concentration of 0.4 weight percent  (see Section V). This corrected value would be used to determine  whether the engine meets emission standards or not. This correction  methodology would apply equally to testing with distillate or residual  fuels. Note that Annex VI includes a 10-percent allowance for higher  emissions when performing simplified in-use testing with residual fuel.  However, we believe that the nitrogen-based correction for any testing  with any fuel is a better way to ensure that the targeted emission  reductions are achieved in use. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \47\ Lloyds report.     \48\ ``Commercial Marine Emissions Inventory Development, Draft  Final Report,'' EPA Work Assignment Number 1-1, Prepared by ENVIRON  International Corporation, April 2002.     \49\ In contrast, Annex VI and the proposed Tier 1 standards  allow for a 10-percent increase in emissions when testing with  residual fuel, which makes the fuel correction a function of engine  speed. For most Category 3 engines, 1.4 g/kW-hr is roughly 10  percent of the Annex VI NO X  emission standard. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      This proposed approach to account for fuel nitrogen would help us  ensure that engines meet the targeted level of emission control for the  whole range of in-use fuels. At the same time, it allows substantial  testing flexibility without compromising our ability to set an emission  standard requiring the greatest degree of emission reductions for any  given fuel. We request comment on this approach to testing with  distillate and residual fuels. In particular, we request comment on the  appropriate adjustment in the emission standard to account for the  effects of testing with residual and distillate fuels in general and  fuel-bound nitrogen in particular. We also request comment on how this  approach to test fuels affects the cost of emission testing. 3. Tier 2 Emission Standards     EPA is considering adoption of a second tier of standards that  would reflect additional reductions that could be achieved through  engine-based controls and would apply to new engines built after 2006  or later. The year that EPA considers most appropriate at this time is  2007. The NO X  standards we are considering for potential  Tier 2 standards are based on a 30 percent reduction from Tier 1 to  allow manufacturers both greater flexibility in choosing the  combination of emission control technologies to apply to their engines  and a compliance margin for certification purposes. The NO X   limits we are considering for a second tier of standards are contained  in Table IV.A-2.     Table IV.A-2.--Tier 2 Standards Currently Under Consideration, NO X                         Emission Limits (g/kW-hr)* ------------------------------------------------------------------------        Engine speed (n)            n [ge] 130 rpm**       n < 130 rpm ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Tier 2........................      31.5xn-0.2 + 1.4              13.3 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ * See notes to Table IV.A-1. ** See notes to Table IV.A-1.      Control of diesel engine emissions typically focuses on  NO X  and PM emissions. HC and CO limits for diesel engines  generally receive less attention because the diesel combustion process  inherently prevents high rates of HC and CO emissions. We estimate that  HC emissions are currently at 0.4 g/kW-hr, which is significantly lower  than NO X  emissions from Category 3 engines, even after  manufacturers substantially reduce NO X  emissions.  Hydrocarbon emissions nevertheless combine with NO X   emissions to form ozone. We have generally adopted emission standards  for other types of diesel engines in the form of a single standard for  combined NO X  and HC emissions. To prevent increases in HC  emissions, we are considering a Tier 2 standard at the baseline level  of 0.4 g/kW-hr. This may achieve modest reductions in HC emissions, but  more importantly would prevent HC emission increases that might  otherwise result from controlling NO X  emissions alone. We  request comment on whether we should set an emission standard for HC  emissions and how to best to set an appropriate standard if one is  warranted. We further request comment on setting a combined  NO X +HC standard for Category 3 engines as part of a second  tier of standards. Commenters supporting a NO X +HC standard  should also address how to use NO X -only onboard emission  measurements in the context of a NO X +HC standard, since it  may not be possible to measure HC emissions.     We do not expect manufacturers to apply control technologies to  reduce CO emissions. In fact, for current technologies, CO emissions  generally decrease as manufacturers improve fuel consumption rates, so  there is no incentive that would lead manufacturers to increase CO  emissions. In other EPA programs for diesel engines, we generally set  CO emission standards to prevent emission increases over time. We are  considering this same approach with Tier 2 standards for Category 3  marine engines. Uncontrolled CO levels are generally less than 1 g/kW- hr. We are therefore considering a Tier 2 emission standard of 3 g/kW- hr for these engines, which would ensure that manufacturers don't cause  significant increases in CO emissions when applying technologies  designed to address NO X  emissions. A tighter standard may  cause a manufacturer to spend a disproportionate amount of effort  developing emission-control technologies for small changes in CO  emissions. We request comment on regulating CO emission levels this way  and specifically whether this is an appropriate level for a CO emission  standard.     Regarding PM from Category 3 marine engines, the majority of  emissions comes directly from the high concentration of sulfur in the  fuel. Short of changing in-use fuel quality, emission-control  technologies only address the remaining portion of PM, since engine  technologies are ineffective at reducing sulfur-related PM emissions.  Furthermore, no acceptable procedure exists for measuring PM from  Category 3 marine engines, because current established PM test methods  show unacceptable variability when sulfur levels exceed 0.8 weight  percent, which is common for both residual and distillate marine fuels  for Category 3 engines. No PM test method or calculation methodology  has been developed to correct that variability for these engines. For  these reasons, we are not considering a PM standard for Category 3  engines. We request comment on our approach; commenters supporting PM  emission standards should address these issues and suggest  [[Page 37570]]  an appropriate standard reflecting an achievable level of control,  considering costs and other statutory factors. See the section below  for discussion of regulating in-use fuels to achieve PM,  SO X , and possibly additional NO X  reductions.     Testing has shown that optimizing engine systems and developing  additional control technologies will allow manufacturers of Category 3  marine engines to meet emission standards more stringent than Annex VI  levels. Such improvements will require additional time. As discussed in  Section IV.C, we believe manufacturers can achieve these proposed  emission standards by further optimizing their designs and developing  additional technologies for better control of fuel injection, charge  air induction and mixing, and the overall design of combustion chambers  and the timing of combustion events. We request comment on the level of  the Tier 2 standards. Section IV.B discusses the timing of introducing  the proposed Tier 1 standards and the Tier 2 standards under  consideration. 4. Emission Effects of Test Conditions and Engine Operating Modes     Section V describes how we propose to address varying test  conditions for emission measurements to show that engines meet emission  standards when operated over the ISO E3 duty cycle. In general, we  define a range of conditions for barometric pressure, humidity, ambient  air temperature and ambient water temperature for testing according to  the proposed duty cycle. Weighted engine emissions may not exceed the  emission standards within the specified ranges of ambient conditions.  For humidity and ambient water temperature, we specify a proposed  method for correcting emission levels to a reference condition. We  don't propose to allow any correction or adjustment based on varying  ambient air temperatures or barometric pressures within the specified  ranges. The specified ranges of test conditions apply to both  laboratory testing and testing onboard a vessel. We are also proposing  other provisions that would require equivalent emission control under  other ambient conditions.     An additional concern relates to the way emissions vary under  different engine operating conditions. For Category 1 and Category 2  engines, we adopted ``not-to-exceed'' provisions to define an objective  measure to ensure that engines would be reasonably controlling  emissions under the whole range of expected normal operation, as well  as the defeat-device prohibition. Since these smaller engines are mass  produced for a wide range of vessels used in many different  applications, we expected ``normal operation'' for these engines to  vary considerably around the ideal propeller curve. We are not  considering not-to-exceed standards for Category 3 engines, since each  engine intended to operate on a propeller curve is matched with a  propeller for custom installation on a specific vessel. Also, the very  large mass of ocean-going vessels make them relatively insensitive to  perturbations caused by varying vessel loads, water currents, or  weather conditions. As a result, engine operation should invariably be  limited to a very narrow range around the propeller curve. Propulsion  engines that operate at constant speed (whether coupled to a variable- pitch propeller or generator for electric-drive units) will similarly  operate over a very narrow range. Moreover, we are considering a  requirement that manufacturers test their production engines after  installation on the vessel to show compliance with Tier 2 emission  standards, which further removes the possibility of engines departing  significantly from areas of engine operation over for which they are  demonstrated to control emissions.     The proposed ISO E3 duty cycle includes four test modes weighted to  reflect the operation of commercial marine vessels. The modal  weightings are based on 70 percent of engine operation occurring at 75  percent or more of the engine's maximum power. For Category 1 and  Category 2 engines, we have applied this same duty cycle, which  reflects the way such engines are expected to operate. We are  concerned, however, that Category 3 engines operate at significantly  lower power levels when they are operating within range of a port. Ship  pilots generally operate engines at reduced power for several miles to  approach a port, with even lower power levels very close to shore.  Because of the relatively low weighting of the low-power test modes, it  is very possible that manufacturers could meet emission standards  without significantly reducing emissions at the low-power modes that  are more prevalent for these engines as they operate close to  commercial ports. This issue would generally not apply to vessels that  rely on multiple engines providing electric-drive propulsion, since  these engines can be shut down as needed to maintain the desired engine  loading.     We are considering a variety of options to address this concern. We  could re-weight the modes of the duty cycle to emphasize low-power  operation. This has several disadvantages. For example, we have no  information to provide a basis for applying different weighting  factors. Also, changing the duty cycle would depart from the historic  norm for marine engine testing. This would make it more difficult to  make use of past emission data, which is all based on the established  modal weighting. An alternative approach would be to cap emission rates  at the two low-power modes. We could set the cap at the same level as  the emission standard, or allow for a small variation above the  emission standard. For mechanically controlled engines, such an  approach could dictate the overall design of the engine. On the other  hand, we expect most or all new engines to have electronic controls,  which would enable the manufacturer to target emission controls  specifically for low-power operation without affecting the  effectiveness of emission controls at higher power. We request comment  on the need to adopt special provisions to ensure appropriate control  of emissions during low-power operation. We specifically request  comment on an additional requirement to limit emission levels of the  two low-power modes to the level of the NO X  emission  standard for each engine.     An additional concern relates to variation in emission levels  between test modes. The proposed defeat device provisions (which  already apply to Category 1 and Category 2 engines) would prevent  manufacturers from producing their engines to control emissions more  effectively at established test points than at other points not  included in the test. This is especially important for Category 3  engines that leave the U.S., because we are expecting ship operators to  measure emissions to show that the engines still meet emission  standards within a certain range of a U.S. port. As described in  Section V.B.10, outside the U.S., ship operators may make adjustments  outside the range of adjustable parameters to which the engine is  certified. Engine manufacturers would be required to develop emission  targets to allow the operator to ensure that the engine has been  readjusted to the certified configuration. These emission targets would  vary with operating conditions and would include targets for engine  speeds other than the test points speeds. We are proposing that  Category 3 engine manufacturers design their engines to achieve  equivalent control for varying engine speeds after any changes are made  to compensate for changes such as switching fuels. In identifying the  NO X   [[Page 37571]]  emission targets, manufacturers would have the choice of either  applying the same injection timing map for the tested and nontested  engine speeds, or ensuring that NO X  emissions for nontest  speeds follow a linear interpolation between test points. Ship  operators would be required to adjust their engines to have  NO X  levels below the target level. 5. Voluntary Low-Emission Standards     We are also proposing voluntary low-emission standards, consistent  with the approach we have taken in several other programs, to encourage  the introduction and more widespread use of low-emission technologies.  Manufacturers would need to reduce emissions 80 percent below Annex VI  levels (excluding the nitrogen adjustment), as shown in Table IV.A-1,  to qualify their engines for designation as voluntary low-emission  engines. These reduced emission levels would apply to testing with both  residual and distillate fuels, with the appropriate adjustments for  nitrogen content of the fuel. Data show that engines utilizing  selective catalytic reduction are capable of meeting these emission  levels. If we establish an objective qualifying level for voluntary  low-emission engines, this would make it easier for state and local  governments or individual port authorities to develop meaningful  incentive-based programs to encourage preferential use of these very  low-emitting engines.     Engines certified to the voluntary low-emission standards would  also need to meet HC and CO levels at levels we are considering for the  second tier of standards. The voluntary low-emission standards are  contained in Table IV.A-3.      Table IV.A-3.--Proposed Blue Sky NO X  Emission Limits (g/kW-hr)\*\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------        Engine speed (n)           n [ge] 130 rpm\**\      n < 130 rpm ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Blue Sky......................       9.0xn-0.2 + 1.4               4.8 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ * See notes to Table IV.A-1. ** See notes to Table IV.A-1.  6. Hotelling Emissions     In addition to emissions from engines while the ship is moving in  port, many ships run one or more engines to produce electricity for  ship operations while in port for loading and unloading. These  emissions are concentrated locally in the port area, which may have a  disproportionate effect on neighboring communities. Several options are  available specifically to address this concern for ``hotelling''  emissions. Many of these go beyond our usual approach of setting  emission standards for new engines, but we request comment on these and  other possible approaches, given the potential to achieve substantial  additional reductions in this area.     Focusing on port emissions raises several questions. (1) Would it  be appropriate for regulatory provisions to focus on reducing emissions  specifically from port facilities, including hotelling emissions from  ships? (2) Should EPA provide targets or incentives to encourage port  authorities to reduce overall port emissions, including land-based  equipment and vehicles? (3) What form might such a policy take-- regulatory, voluntary, administered by EPA or local governments,  including financial or logistical incentives? (4) Is it appropriate to  adopt national policies to ensure emission reductions in all port areas  or should such policy development be tailored to port-specific  concerns? (5) Should EPA emission standards differentiate between in- port and transit emission levels? If so, what form or emission levels  would be appropriate for in-port operations?     While we are not proposing to take action to address hotelling or  other in-port emissions separately, we request comment on these issues  and on any other possible approaches to encourage or ensure that  emission controls are applied appropriately in port areas.  B. When Would the Engine Emission Standards Apply?      Proposing emission standards for new Category 3 marine engines  starting in 2004 allows less than the usual lead time for meeting EPA  requirements. We note, however, that manufacturers are already meeting  the Annex VI standards, which apply to engines installed on vessels  built on or after January 1, 2000. The Tier 1 standards proposed in  this document require no additional development, design, or testing  beyond what manufacturers are already doing to meet Annex VI standards.     Under the proposed EPA regulations, engine manufacturers would need  to comply with emission standards for all engines produced after the  specified date. This date would be based on the point of final engine  assembly, which for large Category 3 marine engines typically occurs  when the engine is installed in the vessel. Shipbuilders and owners  would not be responsible for meeting EPA standards, but we are  proposing to apply the prohibition from 40 CFR 94.1103(a)(5), which  prevents shipbuilders from selling vessels with noncompliant engines if  they initiate construction of a vessel after the date that regulations  begin to apply. This raises a question about vessels whose keel is laid  before new standards take effect if vessel completion does not occur  until after standards take effect. This question is best addressed by  an example--if EPA were to adopt Tier 2 standards that would apply in  January 2007 and if a ship's keel is laid in June 2006, with final  vessel assembly in June 2007, that vessel could use Tier 1 engines only  if the engine manufacturer completes the engine assembly before January  1, 2007. This should not be an issue for Tier 1 engines, since vessels  are generally already using engines that meet Annex VI NO X   limits.     As described in the Draft Regulatory Support Document,  manufacturers are well underway in pursuing emission-control  technologies that would reduce emissions from Category 3 marine engines  beyond Annex VI levels. If EPA were to adopt Tier 2 standards in a  final rule in 2003, manufacturers would have four years to implement  technologies needed to meet such standards by 2007. This would include  time in the early years for selecting specific approaches and  developing those technologies. Manufacturers would also need that time  to integrate the various technologies into an overall engine design  that performs well and is durable. Given that engine manufacturers  already have limited experience in applying these technologies to  Category 3 marine engines, we believe the Tier 2 standards will be  achievable in the time frame under consideration. In addition, Tier 2  emission standards are already scheduled to apply to Category 2 engines  in 2007. To the extent that some Category 3 engines compete directly  with Category 2 engines, sharing an implementation date helps in  maintaining a level playing field between competitive engines. We  request comment on the implementation  [[Page 37572]]  dates for the Tier 2 program under consideration.  C. What Information Supports the Technological Feasibility of the  Engine Emission Standards?      Annex VI calls for marine diesel engines over 130 kW to meet  emission standards if they are installed on vessels built on or after  January 1, 2000. Engine manufacturers are meeting the Annex VI  standards today with a variety of emission-control technologies.  Chapter 4 of the Draft Regulatory Support Document identifies several  technologies that individual manufacturers have already incorporated to  reduce emissions. The most common approach has been to focus on  increased compression ratio, adapted fuel injection, valve timing and  different fuel nozzles to trim NO X  emissions. Manufacturers  have generally been able to do this with little or no increase in fuel  consumption. By building engines that can meet the Annex VI standards,  manufacturers have shown that they can meet the identical Tier 1  standards proposed here for Category 3 marine engines.     As described in the Draft Regulatory Support Document, we have  relied on existing data to account for fuel effects in selecting the  proposed Tier 1 and potential Tier 2 NO X  emission standards  for testing Category 3 marine engines with residual fuel. Engines  designed to meet Annex VI NO X  standards using in-use  distillate fuels should be able to meet the proposed Tier 1 standards  without adopting any new technologies.     While manufacturers have used a wide variety of technologies to  meet Annex VI standards for Category 3 marine engines, engines have so  far generally incorporated only a few of the available emission-control  technologies. To meet more stringent standards, manufacturers would  need to integrate Tier 1 technologies more broadly into the fleet and  pursue several additional approaches. These include:  --Improved fuel injection. This includes injection timing, injection  pressure, rate shaping (or split injection), and common rail injection  systems. Electronic controls would also allow for more precise metering  and timing of individual injections. --Intake air management. Manufacturers can use more effective  turbocharging and aftercooling to reduce NO X  emissions.  Also, valve timing can be manipulated to vary expansion and compression  ratios or to recirculate exhaust gases. --Combustion chamber modifications. Several design variables affect the  compression and mixing of the fuel-air mixture before and during  combustion, including higher compression ratios, piston geometry, and  injector location.      Test data show that these technologies can reduce emissions up to  40 percent below Annex VI NO X  standards.\50\ We believe  manufacturers could incorporate emission-control technologies to  achieve a 30-percent reduction below Annex VI standards for all their  Category 3 marine engines. Some industry representatives have indicated  that this level of control is achievable.\51\ Specifying 30 percent  instead of 40 percent allows for a compliance margin for manufacturers  to ensure that they meet emission standards consistently with all the  engines they produce in an engine family. This also allows for  manufacturers to show that they meet emission standards under the range  of prescribed testing and operating conditions, as described above,  including measures to cap emission levels at low-power modes to the  level of the proposed emission standards. These technologies, and  accompanying emission data, are described in more detail in Chapter 4  of the Draft Regulatory Support Document, while Chapter 5 adds specific  detail regarding our estimated deployment of each of the targeted  control technologies in the analysis to develop costs estimates related  to the emission standards. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \50\ Ingalls, M., Fritz S., ``Assessment of Emission Control  Technology for EPA Category 3 Commercial Marine Diesel Engines,''  Southwest Research Institute, September 2001 (Docket A-2001-11,  document II-A-08).     \51\ Mayer, Hartmut, Euromot, e-mail response to EPA questions,  January 31, 2002 (Docket A-2001-11, IIA-D-01). ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      The analysis of emission-control technologies in most cases applies  equally to two-stroke and four-stroke engines. While there are many  fundamental differences between these types of engines, most emission- control strategies could be applied effectively to both types. Perhaps  the most significant difference between these engines is the tendency  for significantly larger displacements and slower operating speeds with  two-stroke engines. The emission standards for Category 3 marine  engines incorporate the same shape of the NO X  curve  specified by Annex VI (and shown in Table IV.A-1), which reflects the  generally increasing NO X  emission levels for larger engines  with slower operating speeds. The emission standards therefore  implicitly take into account higher emission levels for two-stroke  engines.     Section VII discusses a range of alternative approaches we  considered in developing this proposal and explains our reasons to  defer their adoption at this time.     If we adopt Tier 2 standards as part of this rulemaking, we intend  to revisit and reopen the Tier 2 standards in approximately 2005. At  that time we would fully reassess the circumstances and re-determine  the appropriate level of the standards. We believe it is important to  preserve our ability to coordinate our actions under the Clean Air Act  with the future actions of the U.S. government involving MARPOL. To  maximize this coordination and to allow for all appropriate  harmonization, we would establish a rulemaking schedule for a future  reopening and revisiting of any Tier 2 standards. In this future  rulemaking we would reconsider the level of any Tier 2 standards based  on all the circumstances then present, including the information then  available concerning technological feasibility, cost, and other  relevant aspects of emissions control for these engines, as well as the  then current status of emissions standards under MARPOL. This  reconsideration could lead to revised Tier 2 standards to reflect the  appropriate level of the standard under the Clean Air Act based on the  circumstances present at that time. We would implement this process by  adopting in this rule a specific schedule for a future rulemaking,  including for example a set date for final action on the future  rulemaking.  D. Is EPA Considering Not Adopting Tier 2 Standards in This Rulemaking?      EPA is also considering not adopting Tier 2 standards in this  rulemaking, and instead establishing a schedule for a future rulemaking  and addressing Tier 2 standards in that future rulemaking. For these  reasons, EPA has not included proposed regulations in this Notice. In  that future rulemaking, EPA would propose and establish appropriate  Tier 2 standards based on an assessment of all of the circumstances  then present, including the information then available concerning  technological feasability, cost, and other relevant aspects of  emissions control for these engines, as well as the then current status  of emissions standards under MARPOL. This would be similar to the  reopening rulemaking discussed above, involving reopening of any Tier 2  standards adopted in the current rulemaking. However, instead of  revisiting Tier 2 standards adopted in the current rulemaking, under  this alternative no Tier 2 standards would be set until the future  rulemaking. The schedule for the future rulemaking would be the same as  that discussed above, approximately 2005, and as with the reopening  [[Page 37573]]  rulemaking this schedule would be included in the regulations adopted  in this rulemaking.     The benefit of this alternative would stem from its potential to  facilitate the international process of updating the Annex VI emissions  standards. As discussed earlier in this preamble, EPA anticipates that  further discussions will be held at the IMO, in the Marine Environment  Protection Committee, concerning adoption of a second, more stringent  level of emissions standards. If delaying the initial establishment of  Tier 2 standards to a future rulemaking facilitates the successful  completion of updating the Annex VI emissions standards, the overall  environmental result might be better than adoption of Tier 2 standards  in this rulemaking. In addition, it could facilitate EPA's actions to  harmonize its regulations as appropriate with future Annex VI  provisions. This future rulemaking would occur whether or not Annex VI  negotiations were concluded by that date. Delaying setting Tier 2  standards until a future rulemaking, however, also raises the issue of  whether adoption in this rulemaking of only Tier 1 standards and  establishment of a schedule for a future Tier 2 rulemaking would be  consistent with the Agency's obligations under the Clean Air Act. EPA  invites comment on all issues associated with this alternative.  E. Is EPA Considering Any Fuel Standards?      The majority of Category 3 engines are designed to run on residual  fuel. This fuel is made from the very end products of the oil refining  process, formulated from residues remaining after the primary  distilling stages of the refining process. It has higher contents of  ash, metals, and nitrogen that may increase exhaust emissions. Residual  also has sulfur content up to 45,000 ppm; the global average sulfur  concentration is currently about 27,000 ppm, though fuel sold in the  U.S. has sulfur levels somewhat above the average.\52\ Operating on  fuels with such high sulfur contents results in high SO X  and  direct sulfate PM emissions.     Using a residual fuel with a lower sulfur content would reduce the  fraction of PM emissions from ash and metals. Using distillate fuel  instead of residual fuel could result in even lower emissions. The  simpler molecular structure of distillate fuel may result in more  complete combustion with reduced levels of carbonaceous PM. Operation  on distillate fuel would also reduce NO X  emissions because  distillate fuel generally contains less nitrogen and has better  ignition qualities. Because of these benefits, we request comment on  fuel controls to reduce exhaust emissions from Category 3 marine  engines.     MARPOL Annex VI contains requirements for fuels used onboard marine  vessels. These requirements, which will be effective when the Annex  goes into force, consist of two parts. First, Annex VI specifies that  the sulfur content of fuel used onboard ships cannot exceed 45,000 ppm  (4.5 percent). Information gathered in an international monitoring  program indicates refiners are currently complying with this  requirement. Second, the Annex provides a mechanism to designate  SO X  emission control areas, within which ships must either  use fuel with a sulfur content not to exceed 15,000 ppm or an exhaust  gas cleaning system to reduce SO X  emissions. To date, two  SO X  emission control areas have been designated: the North  Sea and English Channel, and the Baltic Sea. The Annex VI fuel  provisions do not go into effect, however, until the Annex enters into  force (see Section I.C. above).     Operators who choose not to use exhaust gas cleaning systems can  meet the Annex VI SO X  requirement by using low-sulfur  residual fuel or by switching to distillate fuel while they operate in  SO X  Emission Control Areas. Due to the nature of distillate  fuel, this would also reduce NO X  emissions. In general,  engines that are designed to operate on residual fuel oil are capable  of operating on distillate fuel. For example, if the engine is to be  shut down for maintenance, distillate fuel is often used to flush out  the fuel system. However, there are several complications associated  with this option. Switching to distillate fuel requires 20 to 60  minutes, depending on how slowly the operator wants to cool the fuel  temperatures. According to engine manufacturers, switching from a  heated residual fuel to an unheated distillate fuel too quickly could  cause damage to fuel pumps. There could also be fuel pump durability  problems if the engine is operated on distillate fuel for more than a  few days. For continued operation on distillate fuel, ships would need  to have separate (or modified) pumps and lines. In addition,  modification to the fuel tanks may be necessary to ensure sufficient  capacity for low-sulfur fuel.     Alternatively, ships can use residual fuels produced to meet the  15,000 ppm (1.5 percent) sulfur requirement. Refiners can produce low- sulfur residual fuel from a low-sulfur crude oil or they can put the  fuel through a de-sulfonation step in the refinery process. They can  also produce it by blending marine distillate fuel, which typically has  fuel sulfur levels between 2,000 and 3,000 ppm.     Given the PM, and SO X  benefits of using low-sulfur  residual fuels and the added NO X  benefit of using distillate  or distillate-blend fuels, we are requesting comment on whether we  should set standards for the fuel that ships use. We are also seeking  comment on what form such fuel standards should take. For example, we  could adopt the Annex VI special control area sulfur limits, either  through the Annex VI process or through regulation under the Act. This  would set a maximum sulfur limit of 15,000 ppm. However, lower sulfur  contents are feasible and would yield greater PM and SO X   benefits. As a comparison, the sulfur content of highway diesel fuel is  under 500 ppm today, with a 15-ppm cap applying starting in 2007. The  sulfur content of nonroad diesel is not regulated, but generally ranges  from 2,000 to 3,000 ppm. Reducing the sulfur content of the fuel would  reduce PM and SO X  emissions by 10 and 44 percent,  respectively (see Chapter 4 of the Draft Regulatory Support Document).  An alternative approach would be to require that ships use distillate  fuels, which would achieve the same or greater reduction of PM and  SO X  emissions, with an additional 10-percent reduction in  NO X  emissions resulting from the decreased nitrogen content  of the fuel. Chapter 5 of the Draft Regulatory Support Document  presents costs estimates for these fuel-based regulatory options. We  request comment on these possible approaches to addressing in-use fuel  quality. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \52\ Sulphur Monitoring 2002. Report to Marine Environmental  Protection Committee, 47th Session. MEPC 47/INF.2, August 28, 2001.  A copy of this document can be found in Docket A-2000-11. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      We also seek information on the costs and expected benefits of  further reductions in allowable fuel-sulfur levels, for both ship  owners and fuel suppliers. Finally, we seek comment on how to apply the  standard. Historically, we have regulated in-use fuels by establishing  minimum specifications that apply to those who sell the fuel. This  approach may not be effective for this sector because ship owners could  choose to purchase their fuel outside the U.S. If we don't adopt any  requirements related to in-use fuels in this rulemaking, we could  revisit these questions in the context of a technology review, as  described above.     We are not proposing fuel-based regulations in this rule because  regulating fuel sold in the U.S. would not necessarily ensure that  distillate fuel  [[Page 37574]]  was used in U.S. waters. The Clean Air Act limits us to setting  requirements on fuel entered into commerce in the U.S. If we can  regulate only the fuel sold in the U.S., then a fuel sulfur standard  would be unlikely to have a significant impact on emissions because  ships may choose to bunker before entering or after leaving the U.S.  However, Regulation 14 of MARPOL Annex VI allows areas in need of  SO X  emission reductions to petition to be designated as  SO X  Emission Control Areas (SECA). Within such waters, the  maximum sulfur content of the fuel will be limited to 15,000 ppm.\53\  We intend to work through the MARPOL process to designate certain areas  in the U.S. as sulfur control areas which would require the use of  distillate fuel. We request comment on whether all waters under U.S.  jurisdiction or only specific areas should be designated as SECAs, and  whether such designation(s) could be expected to have an adverse impact  on port traffic within SECAs. EPA also invites comment on our authority  under the Clean Air Act to regulate this fuel. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \53\ Unless SO X  emission controlled by secondary  means which at present is not clear. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------  V. Demonstrating Compliance  A. Overview of Certification  1. How Would I Certify My Engines?     We are proposing to base certification data and administration  requirements for new Category 3 marine engines on the existing program  for Category 1 and Category 2 marine engines. These provisions are  contained in 40 CFR part 94, and were described in detail in the  preamble to the FRM that promulgated those regulations ( 64 FR 73300 ,  December 29, 1999). In general, these provisions require that a  manufacturer do the following things to certify engines: • Divide engines into groups of engines with similar emission  characteristics. These groups are called ``engine families''. • Test the highest emitting engine configuration within the  family. • Determine deterioration rate for emissions and apply it to  the ``zero-hour'' emission rate. The deterioration rate is essentially  the difference between the emissions of the engine when produced and  the point at which it would need to be rebuilt. • Determine the emission-related maintenance that will be  necessary to keep the engines in compliance with the standards. • Submit the test data to EPA along with other information  describing the engines within the engine family. This submission is  called the ``application for certification''.  The certification provisions proposed for new Category 3 engines are  discussed more fully in later sections. You should also read the  proposed regulatory text, and the existing Category 2 regulations in 40  CFR part 94. These later section highlight the differences that we are  proposing to apply to Category 3. 2. How Is the Proposed Certification Method Different From That Used  Under Annex VI?     In general, the two methods are similar. Our certification process  is similar to the Annex VI pre-certification process, while our  production-line testing program (described later) is similar to the  Annex VI initial certification survey. However, the Clean Air Act  specifies certain requirements for our certification program that are  different from the Annex VI requirements. The most important  differences between the proposed approach and the method used under  Annex VI are related to witness testing (we allow, but do not require  witness testing), the durability requirements, and test procedures. Our  proposed durability requirements and testing requirements are discussed  in other sections. It is also worth noting that, as described in  Section III, we are proposing to apply the standards based on the date  of final assembly of the engine, while Annex VI generally applies the  standards based on the start-date of the manufacture of the vessel  (i.e., the date on which the keel is laid), which would generally occur  prior to the final assembly of the engine. Overall, we believe that our  proposed regulations are sufficiently consistent with Annex VI that  manufacturers would be able to use a single harmonized compliance  strategy to certify under both systems. The relationship between our  proposed program and the Annex VI requirements is described in more  detail in section V.D. 3. How Does a Certificate of Conformity Relate to a Statement of  Voluntary Compliance or an EIAPP?     The Clean Air Act requires that manufacturers obtain a certificate  of conformity before they introduce a new engine into commerce. Once it  goes into force, MARPOL ANNEX VI will require manufacturers to obtain  an ``Engine International Air Pollution Prevention Certificate''  (EIAPP). We anticipate that engines that receive an EPA certificate of  conformity will also be eligible for an Engine International Air  Pollution Prevention Certificate, since the proposed Tier 1 emission  limits are the same as the Annex VI NO X  limits and the Tier  2 limits under consideration are more stringent.     It should be noted that EIAPPs will not be issued until the Annex  goes into force and can be issued only by the flag state  Administration. Prior to entry into force of the Annex, and to  encourage vessel owners to purchase MARPOL Annex VI compliant engines,  we have developed a voluntary certification program. Under this  program, the engine manufacturer can apply for and obtain a Statement  of Voluntary Compliance to the MARPOL Annex VI NO X   limits.\54\ It is anticipated that ship owners will be able to exchange  this Statement of Voluntary Compliance for an EIAPP after the Annex  enters into force. If a shipowner does not have a valid Statement of  Voluntary Compliance for an engine, it may be necessary to recertify  the engine to obtain an EIAPP after the Annex enters into force.  Finally, it should be noted that to obtain an EIAPP in this way, the  Statement of Voluntary Compliance must be issued by EPA. A shipowner  with a Statement of Voluntary Compliance issued by another  Administration will have to apply for certification to obtain an EIAPP. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      \54\ Information on how to obtain a Statement of Voluntary  Compliance can be found on our website,  www.epa.gov/otaq/marine.htm . ---------------------------------------------------------------------------  4. Could I Use a Continuous Emission Monitoring System to Demonstrate  Compliance for Certification?     You would generally not be able to use a continuous emission  monitoring system to generate emission data that would be sufficient  for our certification purposes. However, as we describe later, such a  system could probably be used for production line testing or for in-use  verification. 5. What Would the Roles of the Engine Manufacturer and Ship Owner Be  After the Engine Is Installed?     Unlike the provisions of MARPOL Annex VI, under our proposed  regulations, the engine manufacturer would have some responsibilities  for in-use compliance. The manufacturer would be required to  demonstrate that its engine would be capable of complying with the  standards through the ``useful life'' of the engine (as described  below, the useful life would generally be the first rebuild cycle). The  manufacturer would be responsible for remedying failures that occur  during that period. The ship owner would be  [[Page 37575]]  responsible for ensuring that all proper maintenance is performed  during the entire service life of the engine. After Annex VI goes into  force internationally, the ship owner would also be responsible for  compliance with the provisions contained in the NO X   Technical Code, including the recordkeeping requirements for the Record  Book of Engine Parameters and the various survey requirements. EPA and  Coast Guard will work together to develop procedures to verify onboard  performance of Annex VI requirements, as Coast Guard has the general  authority to carry out such procedures on vessels. 6. How Would Engines on Foreign-Flagged Vessels Be Certified?     We are asking for comment regarding whether EPA should regulate all  engines installed in foreign-flagged vessels that will call at a U.S.  port (Categories 1, 2, and 3). In general, we would apply the same  compliance provisions to foreign-flagged vessels as we would to U.S.- flagged vessels. We do not believe that manufacturers or owners of  foreign-flag vessels would face unique constraints compared with  manufacturers and owners of U.S.-flag vessels. Thus, the compliance  discussions in the section V would apply without regard to whether the  standards ultimately apply only to U.S.-flag vessels or to all vessels  calling on U.S. ports.     It is worth discussing, however, how engines on foreign-flagged  vessels would be certified if we determined that it was appropriate to  regulate them in the rule. If we extended our regulations to these  engines, compliance could be demonstrated for certification in one of  two ways. Both would require that an application be submitted to EPA.  It would not be sufficient to have obtained a certificate from a  country other than the U.S. The simplest way to obtain an EPA  certificate would be for the ship manufacturer to install a certified  engine during the construction of the ship. In this case, we would  treat this engine in the same manner as engines installed on U.S.- flagged vessels. Our proposed regulations would already allow this.  This approach would also work for replacement auxiliary engines. The  ship owner would only be required to purchase a certified marine  engine.     The second approach would be for the engine to be certified after  it has been installed in a vessel that will call at a U.S. port, but  before the vessel is within 175 nautical miles of the U.S. As with our  requirements for newly manufactured engines, we would require that  emission test data be submitted in an application for certification to  demonstrate that the engine complies with our requirements. This could  be done by either the engine manufacturer or the ship owner. We  recognize that we may need to allow different certification procedures  to be used in these special cases. In fact, our existing regulations  for smaller marine engines include an allowance for EPA to establish  special certification procedures for engines on imported vessels  ([sect] 94.222). We could modify this provision to allow these special  certification procedures for foreign-flagged vessels subject to our  standards irrespective of whether such vessels are considered to be  imported.     It is also worth noting that any vessel subject to our standards  that has one or more uncertified engines installed could be denied the  right to enter a U.S. port, because the vessel would not be in  compliance with U.S. law. Similarly, a vessel with an engine that has  within 175 nautical miles of the U.S. coastline operated outside the  range of operating parameters within which the engine is certified to  comply with the applicable emission standard could be denied the right  to enter a U.S. port. In addition, EPA could bring an enforcement  action against the vessel and its operator under the Clean Air Act for  injunctive relief and for penalties of up to $27,500 for each day that  a violation occurs. As is described in section III.C.3, if we were to  apply our proposed standards to foreign-flagged vessels, we would  consider exemption provisions to allow vessels with uncertified engines  to make occasional, but not frequent visits to U.S. ports.  B. Other Certification and Compliance Issues  1. How Are Engine Families Defined?     We are proposing that engine grouping for the purpose of  certification be accomplished through the application of an ``engine  family'' definition. Engines expected to have similar emission  characteristics throughout their useful life are proposed to be  classified in the same engine family. We are proposing to define engine  families consistent with MARPOL. To provide for administrative  flexibility in the proposal, we would have the authority to separate  engines normally grouped together or to combine engines normally  grouped separately based upon a manufacturer's request substantiated  with an evaluation of emission characteristics over the engine's useful  life. We are requesting comment on the proposed requirements for  selecting engine families. Do the proposed criteria provide sufficient  certainty that NO X  emissions would be similar for all of the  engines within a particular family? 2. Which Engines Would Be Tested?     We are proposing that manufacturers select the highest emitting- engine (i.e., ``worst-case'' engine) in a family for certification  testing. This is consistent with the Annex VI requirements. In making  that determination, the manufacturer shall use good engineering  judgement (considering, for example, all engine configurations and  power ratings within the engine family and the range of installation  options allowed). By requiring the worst-case engine to be tested, we  are assured that all engines within the engine family are complying  with emission standards for the smallest number of test engines. If  manufacturers believe that the engine family is grouped too broadly,  they may request separating engines with dissimilar calibrations (based  on an evaluation of emission characteristics over the engine's useful  life) into separate engine families.     For these large marine engines, conventional emission testing on a  dynamometer becomes more difficult. Often the engine mock-ups that are  used for the development of these engines use a single block for many  years, while the power assemblies are changed out. We propose that for  Category 3 engines, certification tests may be performed on these  engine mock-ups, provided that their configuration is the same as that  of the production engines. In addition, we are proposing to allow  single-cylinder tests, since a single-cylinder test should give the  same brake-specific emission results as a full engine test, as long as  each cylinder in an engine is equivalent in all material respects.     We are also proposing that manufacturers be required to allow EPA  to perform confirmatory testing using their certification engines. In  other rules, we have required manufacturers to provide us with actual  engines for our confirmatory testing program. However, this would not  be practical for Category 3 engines because of their size and cost. 3. How Does EPA Treat Adjustable Parameters?     Diesel engines are often designed with adjustable components. For  example, it is common to be able to adjust the fuel injection timing of  an engine. EPA has historically required that these important  adjustable parameters be physically limited to the range over which an  engine would comply with the standards. Thus, while an uncontrolled  diesel engine would typically have a broad (or even unlimited) range of  adjustability, EPA-certified engines have  [[Page 37576]]  a very narrow range of adjustability. Typically, this narrow range is  enforced through physical stops on the adjustable parts. In some cases,  manufacturers seal a component after final assembly to prevent any  adjustment in use. Disabling physical stops, breaking seals, or  otherwise adjusting an engine outside of the certified range is  considered tampering with the emission controls, and is a violation of  section 203(a) of the Clean Air Act.     For marine engines, broad adjustability allows engines to be  adjusted for maximum efficiency when used in a particular application.  This practice simplifies marine diesel engine production, since the  same basic engine can be used in many applications. While we recognize  the need for this practice, we are also concerned that the engine meet  the proposed emission limits throughout the range of adjustment.  Therefore, the Agency has established provisions for Category 2 engines  to allow manufacturers to specify in their applications for  certification the range of adjustment for these components across which  the engine is certified to comply with the applicable emission  standards, and demonstrate compliance only across that range. We are  proposing to also allow such adjustments for Category 3 engines.  Practically, this requirement means that a manufacturer would specify  different fuel injection timing calibrations for different conditions.  These different calibrations would be designed to account for  differences in fuel quality, which can be very significant for Category  three engines. Operators would then be prohibited by the anti-tampering  provisions from adjusting engines to a calibration different from the  calibration specified by the manufacturer. (See section V.B.10 for a  discussion of adjustments away from the U.S.) Annex VI also allows  engines to be adjusted in use, and requires the engine manufacturer to  include a description of the allowable adjustments in the Technical  File for the engine.     Given the broad range of ignition properties for in-use residual  fuels, we expect that this allowance for Category 3 engines would  result in a broader range of adjustment than is expected for Category 2  engines. Because of this broader allowance, we are also proposing that  operators be required to perform a simple field measurement test to  confirm emissions after a parameter adjustment or maintenance  operation. This would not be required for adjustments or maintenance  that would not affect emissions. In addition, given the degree to which  Category 3 engines regularly undergo major maintenance (e.g.,  replacement of an entire power assembly), we believe that all Category  3 engines as a class should be considered to be inherently adjustable.  We do not believe that a manufacturer could make an engine that would  be unadjustable in practice. Therefore, we are proposing that all new  Category 3 engines be equipped with emission measurement systems and  with electronic-logging equipment that automatically records all  adjustments to the engine and the results of the required verification  tests. EPA believes this is a nominal burden. We request comment on  this proposed requirement. It is important to emphasize that we believe  that it is essential that the logging equipment automatically record  all adjustments without requiring the operator to turn on the data  logger. (As is described in section V.B.10, this requirement would  apply to all adjustments without regard to whether they occur within  175 nautical miles of the U.S. coast.) This would allow us to rely on  the data log to ensure that the vessel is consistently being adjusted  properly. We would also require that such adjustments be manually  recorded as well, consistent with Annex VI requirements.     We are proposing to use a simpler measurement system than the type  specified in Chapter 6 of NO X  Technical Code. As is  described in the RSD, we believe that onboard emission equipment that  is relatively inexpensive and easy to use could be used to verify that  an engine is properly adjusted and is operating to the specifications  of the engine manufacturer. We do not believe that it would be  necessary to perform a complete certification-type emission test after  each adjustment. Under the proposed approach, operators should be able  to complete this testing during normal operation without stopping or  slowing the vessel. We also expect that this equipment will provide  useful information to the ship's crew, that will enable them to better  monitor the engine performance from a non-emission perspective. We  believe that the proposed requirement to include this equipment should  result in little or no net burden to ship operators. It is worth noting  the fact that Annex includes specifications that would allow operators  to choose to verify emissions through onboard testing suggests that  MARPOL also envisioned that onboard measurement systems could be of  value to operators.     We are requesting comment on the broader Annex VI approach to  address engine adjustments, which is to specify that ship operators  must keep the engine adjusted within the limits specified by the engine  manufacturer and to verify the compliance through periodic surveys.  Ship operators would have the choice between verifying the emissions  performance through parameter check or through onboard testing.  Commenters should address the reliability of this approach. We have  concerns that the Annex VI parameter check approach could be difficult  to enforce, since operators that adjusted their engines outside of a  manufacturers specifications would have no incentive to record such  violations. It is also not clear that a parameter check could be  reliable, given the infrequency with which these surveys will likely  occur. Commenters should address both the parameter check method and  the testing method. Are they equivalent? Is the reliability of the  testing method affected by whether the tests are scheduled in advance  or are performed as part of a surprise inspection? Are surprise test  inspections practical?     We also have concerns that, under the Annex VI approach,  manufacturers would not be able to identify the specific adjustments  that would be required for the full range of in-use conditions. While  it is known that changes in fuel properties can require changes in  engine calibrations, the properties themselves are poorly understood.  We do not believe that manufacturers could specify to the operator that  if fuel property A is equal to X, fuel property B is equal to Y, and  fuel property C is equal to Z, then the fuel injection timing should be  adjusted to a specific setting to make sure that the engine meets the  emission standards. Not every important fuel property is readily  quantifable, and different fuel properties can interact to affect  performance. How would an operator record that a parameter was properly  adjusted for a given in-use fuel if not all of the relevant fuel  properties are quantifiable?     We also request comments on other approaches to ensure that engines  with adjustable parameters meet the proposed emission requirements.  Should we require that engine manufacturers design their engines to be  automatically adjusted for changes in fuel quality of other conditions  and prohibit all other adjustments? Would such a prohibition be  practicable? We are also requesting comment on the need for and the  feasibility of indicators on the outside of the vessel (e.g. a light)  to indicate whether the pollution controls are working properly.  Obviously, such a feature would need to be hard-wired into the vessel  controls to be reliable.  [[Page 37577]]  4. How Would Engines Be Labeled?     We are proposing that each new engine have a permanent emission  label on the engine block, or on some other part of the engine that  would not be replaced in service. This label would have to include  specific emission-related information such as engine family name, model  year, and basic maintenance specifications. This inclusion of this  information on the label would be in addition to the recordkeeping  requirements specified in the NO X  technical code. 5. How Does EPA Ensure Durable Emission Controls?     To achieve the full benefit of the emissions standards, we need to  ensure that manufacturers design and build their engines with durable  emission controls. It is also necessary to encourage the proper  maintenance and repair of engines throughout their lifetime. The goal  is for engines to maintain good emission performance throughout their  in-use operation. Therefore, we believe it is necessary to adopt  measures to address concerns about possible in-use emission performance  degradation. The proposed durability provisions, described in the  following sections, are intended to help ensure that engines are still  meeting applicable standards in use. Most of these provisions are  carried over from our program for smaller marine compression-ignition  engines. We request comment on all aspects of this durability program.     The most fundamental issue related to durability is the concept of  useful life. The Clean Air Act specifies that useful life is the period  during which an engine is required to meet the emission standards. For  Category 3 marine engines subject to our standards, we are proposing  that the useful life be the period during which an engine is expected  to be properly functioning with respect to reliability and fuel  consumption without being rebuilt. For engines that are rebuilt  completely at one time, the useful life would be the expected period  between original manufacture and the first engine rebuild. For engines  that are maintained by replacing individual power assemblies, the  useful life would be the expected period between original manufacture  and the point at which the last power assembly is replaced. We expect  that this period will vary to some degree among engine models.  Therefore, we are proposing that manufacturers specify the useful life  for their engines at the time of certification. Their specification  would be subject to EPA approval, and could not be less than a minimum  period of 3 years or 10,000 hours of operation (based on all engine  operation, not just operation in or near U.S. waters). This  specification would not limit in-use operation. Rather it would  determine how the manufacturer would address emission deterioration  (i.e., the manufacturer would be required to demonstrate to EPA that  the engine would meet the standards for the full useful life). We are  also proposing that the useful life period may not be less than any  mechanical warranty that the manufacturer offers for the engine.     These minimum useful life values are lower than the minimum values  for Category 2 engines due to the effect of using residual fuel, which  generally has much higher sulfur levels than distillate fuels. The high  sulfur levels create a more corrosive environment within the combustion  chamber, which decreases durability. The period of years (three years)  is also affected by the higher usage rate in terms of hours per year.  We request comment on this issue. 6. What Are the Manufacturer's Responsibilities for Warranty and Defect  Reporting?     Tied to the useful life is the minimum period for the warranty  required under section 207(a) of the Clean Air Act. We believe it is  important to ensure that the engine manufacturer has designed and built  the engine to ensure that it would comply with the emission standards  throughout its useful life, as long as it is properly maintained.  Therefore, we are proposing that the warranty period be equal to the  useful life period (e.g., 10,000 hours or 3 years). Under the  performance warranty, the engine manufacturer would be responsible to  repair any properly maintained and used engine that fails to meets the  standard in use during the warranty period. (Engine operators would be  responsible to repair any engines that failed to meet the standards  because of improper maintenance.) We request comment on this approach.     We are also proposing defect-reporting requirements. These  provisions require Category 3 engine manufacturers to report to EPA  whenever a manufacturer identifies a specific emission-related defect  in 2 or more engines (or 2 or more cylinders within the same engine).  In most cases, we would expect the defects to be identified as part of  a manufacturer's warranty process. However, the manufacturer would be  required to report all defects, without regard to how they were  identified. It is important to clarify that the defect reporting  requirements would not require the manufacturer to collect new  information. The manufacturer would be required to track and report to  EPA information that they obtain through normal business practice. We  request comment on this issue. 7. What Are Deterioration Factors?     To further ensure that the proposed emission limits are met in use,  we are proposing to require the application of a deterioration factor  (DF) to engines in evaluating emission control performance during the  certification and production-line testing process. The emissions from  new engines are adjusted using the DF to account for potential  deterioration in emissions over the life of the engine due to aging of  emission control technologies or devices. The resulting emission level  is intended to represent the expected emissions at the end of the  useful life period for a properly maintained engine. We believe that  the effectiveness of some emission control technologies, such as  aftertreatment, sophisticated fuel-delivery controls, and some cooling  systems, can decline as these systems age. The DF is applied to the  certification emission test data to represent emissions at the end of  the useful life of the engine. We are proposing that marine diesel  engine DFs be determined by engine manufacturers in accordance with  good engineering practices. The DFs, however, would be subject to EPA  approval, and must be consistent with in-use test data. For example, if  we had in-use test data from earlier model year engines from the same  basic engine family that showed that NO X  emissions generally  deteriorate by 0.5 g/kW-hr over the useful life, then we would approve  a DF that assumed no deterioration in NO X  emissions.  Additionally, the DF should be calculated for the worst-case engine  configuration offered within the engine family.     It is not our intent to require a great deal of data gathering on  engines that use established technology for which the manufacturers  have the experience to develop appropriate DFs. New DF testing may not  be needed where sufficient data already exists. However, we are  proposing to apply the DF requirement to all engines so that we can be  sure that reasonable methods are being used to ascertain the capability  of engines to meet standards throughout their useful lives. Consistent  with other programs, we propose to allow manufacturers the flexibility  of using durability emission data from a single engine that has been  certified to the same or more stringent standard for which all of the  data applicable for  [[Page 37578]]  certification has been submitted. In addition, we request comment on  whether this flexibility should be extended to allow deterioration data  from highway, nonroad, or stationary engines to be used for similar  marine diesel engines.     Finally, we are proposing that DFs be calculated as an additive  value (i.e., the arithmetic difference between the emission level at  full useful life and the emission level at the test point) for engines  without exhaust aftertreatment devices. In contrast, DFs should be  calculated as a multiplicative value (i.e., the ratio of the emission  level at full useful life to the emission level at the test point) for  engines using exhaust aftertreatment devices. This is consistent with  the DF requirements applicable to other diesel engines, based on  observed patterns of emission deterioration. Given the type of emission  controls projected to be used to meet the proposed standards  (calibration changes and combustion chamber redesign, but not  aftertreatment), it is possible that NO X  emissions may  actually decrease with time as the piston rings and cylinder liners  wear (thereby reducing peak pressures). In such cases, we would require  that the manufacturer use an additive DF of zero.     It is important to note that one of the reasons we are proposing a  very flexible DF program for this rulemaking because we do not expect  deterioration to be a major problem for these engines. Our history with  in-cylinder NO X  control suggests that engine-out  NO X  emissions are relatively stable over time. If we were to  adopt an aftertreatment-forcing standard or a standard for PM, we would  likely consider more specific requirements for calculating DFs. For  example, it might be appropriate to apply to these engines the more  specific DF provisions that have been developed for on-highway heavy- duty engines (40 CFR 86.004-26). Commenters that favor the adoption of  an aftertreatment-forcing standard or a standard for PM should address  whether they believe that the proposed DF program would be sufficient  to ensure that manufacturers design their aftertreatment devices to be  durable. 8. What Requirements Are Proposed for In-Use Maintenance?     In previous rules, we have required manufacturers to furnish the  ultimate purchaser of each new nonroad engine with written instructions  for the maintenance needed to ensure proper functioning of the emission  control system. (Generally, manufacturers require the owners to perform  this maintenance as a condition of their emission warranties.) If such  required maintenance is not performed by the engine operator, then in- use emissions deterioration can result. We are proposing to require  that Category 3 engine operators be required to perform this  maintenance, or equivalent maintenance. This provision is comparable to  our requirement for railroads to perform emission-related maintenance  for locomotives (40 CFR 92.1004). In that approach, locomotive owners  who fail to properly maintain a locomotive are subject to civil  penalties for tampering. For marine engines, properly rebuilding  engines and power assemblies would be considered to be a part of  emission related maintenance. We believe that these requirements would  generally be consistent in practice with the provisions specified for  ship operators in Technical File required by the NO X   Technical Code.     An important part of this proposal is the allowance for operators  to perform the maintenance differently than specified by the  manufacturer, provided that maintenance is performed in such a way to  keep the engines performing properly with respect to emissions. With  the proposed emission verification requirements, it would be  straightforward for ship operators to determine if their maintenance  practices are sufficient. As long as their engines pass the  verification tests, EPA would consider the maintenance to be  equivalent. For ships that travel far from U.S. waters, this  requirement would mean that maintenance would need to be performed in  such a way that the engines would pass the verification tests before  they come within 175 nautical miles of the U.S. coastline. (See section  V.B.10 for more information about special provisions that apply for  ships that travel more than 175 nautical miles from the U.S.)     Unlike our regulation for smaller marine engines, we are not  proposing minimum allowable maintenance intervals for Category 3 marine  diesel engines. This is also consistent with our approach for  locomotives. In both cases, we believe that maintenance would be  jointly agreed to by the engine manufacturer and the engine owner prior  to purchase.     We are requesting comment on whether we should allow a manufacturer  or owner to petition EPA to amend the emission-related maintenance  instructions after the engine is in use, either within or after the  useful life. This may be necessary because of the very long service  lives of these engines. It may not be reasonable for us to require an  owner of a 20-year old engine to be bound to maintenance practices that  were set 20 years earlier. We are requesting comment on how such  amendments would be made. 9. Do the Proposed Regulations Affect Engine Rebuilding?     We are proposing in-use maintenance provisions that would require  operators to perform emission related maintenance properly. We are  proposing that this would also apply whenever an engine or engine  subsystem is rebuilt. These provisions would require that all rebuilds  return the engine to its original certified condition. (Failure to  rebuild an engine to its original certified condition would be  considered tampering with the emission controls.) We believe that the  proposed provisions would address the vast majority of in-use  maintenance and rebuilding practices. However, we are concerned about  special circumstances in which an owner wants to upgrade the engine to  be comparable to a newer configuration rather than simply returning it  to its original configuration. Under Annex VI, such ``substantial  modifications'' are allowed, but the owner is required to recertify the  engine. Should we adopt a similar provision? We are also requesting  comment on a voluntary rebuild standard for older ships with engines  that are not subject to our standards or the Annex VI requirements. For  example, should we create a program for owners of ships built before  2004 to voluntarily certify that they comply with the EPA standards for  model year 2004 ships?     As described in the previous section, for ships that travel far  from the U.S., the proposed in-use maintenance provisions that would  require operators to perform emission related maintenance so that an  engine meets the manufacturer's maintenance requirements when it is  within 175 nautical miles of the United States. For rebuilds performed  away from the U.S., this would require that all rebuilds be performed  so that the engine could be returned to its original certified  condition before the ship returns to within 175 nautical miles of the  United States. (See section V.B.10 for more information about special  provisions that apply for ships that travel more than 175 nautical  miles from the U.S.) 10. Compliance With a Certificate of Conformity Beyond 175 Nautical  Miles of the U.S. Coast     As described in section V.B.3, we are proposing to allow engines to  be adjusted in use in accordance with the certificate of conformity,  and to limit  [[Page 37579]]  this adjustability under our Clean Air Act authority to prohibit  tampering. We are also proposing different compliance requirements than  those adopted in prior rulemakings for new nonroad vehicles and new  nonroad engines for Category 3 marine engines installed in vessels that  operate outside the U.S. Under this approach a vessel operator would be  conditionally allowed to adjust an engine's operating parameters  different from the manufacturer's specification. This would be allowed  when a vessel that is proceeding toward or out of a U.S. port is more  than 175 nautical miles about (200 statutory miles) from the U.S.  coastline. More precisely, we would allow this for vessels that are  more than 175 nautical miles from the baseline from which the  territorial sea is measured, including U.S. states or territories  outside of the U.S. mainland.     This flexibility is not included in the Annex VI provisions. While  we considered proposing our program without this flexibility, we  believe that it is an appropriate flexibility, as is described below.     Under the proposed approach, engine adjustments different from  engine manufacturer's specifications would be conditional on  readjusting the engine's parameters within its certified range and  confirming that emissions are within the range of emissions to which  the engine is certified to comply before a vessel seeking to enter a  U.S. port is 175 nautical miles from the U.S. coastline. Failure to  take these actions would constitute tampering with the engine in  violation of section 203(a)(3)(A) of the CAA and 40 CFR  94.1103(a)(3)(i). To confirm that emissions are within the range of  emissions at which the engine is certified to comply, operators would  have to perform a simple field measurement test after each parameter  adjustment or maintenance operation that

Friedman  roductivity (as measured by output per employee hour) in the crude petroleum and natural gas production industry declined at an average annual rate of 1.1 percent from 1959 to 1990.' (See table 1.) Productivity growth was hampered by increasingly difficult access to new oil and gas supplies over the period. Productivity was also strongly affected by the volatile rise and fall of the price of oil and related products, which influenced the economic feasibility of employing more marginal and labor-intensive types of recovery. Productivity declined during the period as labor increased in times of high prices, while output growth was slowed by diminishing reservoir pressure in existing oil fields. There were three distinct periods of economic activity that produced different productivity trends during 1959-90: 1959-72, a period of increasing production and low prices; 197282, a period of declining production despite the incentives of high world oil prices and technological advances; and 1982-90, a period of predominantly declining prices and continued declining production. The following tabulation lists the average annual rates of change for three productivity-related variables during the three separate subperiods of the period under study: Annual percent change 195972 Output output Employee per hour. ...... hours. . . 5.4 3.4  P  Productivity  trends  Brian L.

In general, the number of stripper oil wells declined during the period.* Stripper wells are oil wells that produce 10 or fewer barrels of oil per day. The low price of oil made it only marginally economically feasible to keep these wells in production. There was also little incentive to employ more sophisticated, expensive, and labor-intensive production techniques for recovering oil. Employment declined steadily at a rate of 1.9 percent per year, and output per hour rose at a rate of 5.4 percent per year. U.S. production of gas and oil, however, peaked in the early 1970's. U.S. consumption became increasingly dependent on foreign supplies, which led to two shocks to industry prices. The OPEC oil embargo occurred during 197374 and caused world oil prices to rise significantly. Then, the cutbacks in Iranian oil production in 1979 led to another round of rapid During 1972-82, world oil price increases. prices quadrupled. Increasing prices led to greatly increased U.S. industry activity in exploration and production during 1972-82. Crude oil, however, had become harder to find and harder to produce than in earlier years. The number of marginal stripper wells rose substantially. Increases in enhanced oil recovery production techniques and technological innovations helped mitigate production declines that, nevertheless, reached 0.9 Monthly Labor Review March 1992 9   Productivity  in Oil and Gas Production climbing toward the levels of the early 1980's.

Productivity declined in these 2 years after 5 years of posting gains.  percent per year. Industry employment, however, rose 7.2 percent per year, and output per hour fell at an annual rate of 7.8 percent. The most recent period, 1982-90, was generally a period of oversupply of foreign crude oil and declining prices. Oil prices fell very rapidly in 1986. Some of the more expensive and labor-intensive production techniques lost their economic feasibility.3 The number of stripper wells, which had been growing since 1970, fell by nearly 9,000 in 1987.4 Industry output continued to fall 1.2 percent per year, but employment fell 4.7 percent annually. The industry shrank in size, but what remained were, by and large, the most efficient wells, with the best equipment, run by the most experienced personnel.5 Output per hour increased at a rate of 3.6 percent per year. Oil prices began to rise again in 1989. The confrontation with Iraq, beginning in August of 1990, marks the end of this period, with prices  output In 1960, natural gas and petroleum products accounted for nearly 74 percent of all U.S. energy consumption. By 1970, this percentage had grown to more than 77 percent. Increasing prices following the OPEC oil embargo spurred energy conservation efforts in the United States. Automobiles that provided better gasoline mileage, lower speed limits, and the switching of many utilities to coal lowered the amounts of industry products used as a percentage of total energy consumed. Still, natural gas and petroleum products accounted for nearly 65 percent of all U. S. energy consumed in 1990.6  Table 1.

Gasoline accounts for around 40 percent of the use of refined petroleum. In 1990, petroleum products and natural gas each accounted for 37 percent of industrial energy consumption.7 Petroleum products are also used for nonfuel purposes, such as asphalt, road oil, lubricants, and petrochemical feedstocks. Natural gas is the primary source for heating households.8 The production of crude oil and that of natural gas are interrelated. Crude oil and natural gas are found in deposits close to each other or mixed together. Natural gas is often produced along with crude oil, with 20 to 25 percent of all natural gas produced from oil wells. Lease condensate-liquid hydrocarbons that are removed from natural gas at the well site-are also produced by the industry. During the first 10 years of the study period, crude oil production capacity exceeded demand. Import ceilings were used to protect the domestic industry.9 Crude oil production rose from 7.05 million barrels a day in 1959 to a high of 9.64 million barrels per day in 1971. By the early 1970's, demand had increased to the point where crude oil production was at 100 percent of capacity.`O Gas production grew from 12.05 trillion cubic feet in 1959 to a high of 22.65 trillion cubic feet in 1973. Crude oil production began to decline in the early 1970's. Much of the decline was the result of diminishing reservoir pressure in existing oil fields, combined with low levels of exploration for new oil in the 1960's. Crude oil production declined during 7 years of the 1970's. Production leveled out in the early 1980's, due in part to increases in exploration in the late 1970's and in part to increases in the number of new developmental wells and older stripper wells producing on existing oil fields. World surpluses of crude oil in late 1985 and 1986, however, caused sharp declines in oil prices. U.S. production began falling again in 1986 and continued to decline throughout the rest of the decade."" Production of natural gas was less influenced by world markets than was crude oil because of domestic price regulation and the difficulty in transporting and importing gas. Natural gas was relatively cheap and preferred for environmental reasons. Production increased every year from 1959 to 1973. Low controlled prices, however, led to low natural gas reserves. In 1978, the Natural Gas Policy Act was enacted. The Act was designed to remove price controls gradually and stimulate production. This, coupled with declining demand, led to an oversupply of gas in the early 1980's."" The oversupply was also due, in part, to the steady  production of gas from oil wells that were producing at full capacity, despite declining demand in natural gas markets.13 Production from pure gas wells declined sharply in the early 1980's. Total industry output of combined oil and natural gas declined during 7 years of the 1970's and every year of the 1980's except 1984. By 1990, industry output had declined from its high in 1970 to levels slightly below those of 1965.  Employment  and hours  The trends for employment and hours show little relationship to output, but a very direct relationship to the price of oil. Whenever the price of oil increased, employment increased in an attempt to produce more oil in times of high prices. (See chart 1.) The relationship between the price of oil and employment was a key factor influencing productivity trends in the industry. Productivity declines were largely the result of the influx of employees and hours into the industry during periods of rapidly rising oil prices. It became economically feasible to hire more employees, even though increases in output were only marginal. In addition, more small companies entered the industry during times of high prices.L4 With overall production relatively flat, productivity trends were inversely related to employment trends. (See chart 2.) Employee hours actually declined from 1959 to 1972 at an average annual rate of 1.9 percent as prices for gas and oil increased at a rate of only 1.3 percent per year. During this period, the slow growth in price provided little incentive for the industry to increase employment. Employee hours, however, rose at an average annual rate of 7.4 percent from 1972 to 1982 as the price of oil rose 23.6 percent per year. The rapid average annual decline in price (7.5 percent) from 1982 to 1989 was associated with an average annual decline of 5.2 percent in employee hours. There is a very high proportion of nonproduction workers in the crude petroleum and natural gas production industry relative to other mining industries. This is because most of the production workers associated with drilling and geophysical exploration are contracted from the oil field services industries, SIC 138. For the crude petroleum and natural gas industry (SIC 131 l), nonproduction workers grew from 36.5 percent of industry employment in 1959 to 48.3 percent in 1969. The proportion has remained at approximately 50 percent since, with a low of 48.2 percent in 1971 and a high of 56.3 percent in 198 1. Monthly Labor Review March 1992 11   Productivity  in Oil and Gas Production exploratory drilling. While the number of exploratory oil wells increased every year during this period,17 proven reserves continued to decrease every year. Ia Most of the oil wells drilled during 1972-82 were development wells, designed to increase production from already discovered fields. This type of well nearly quadrupled in number.19 The production capacity of existing oil fields was at its highest in the 1960's and began to decline in the early 1970'szo The proportion of oil wells requiring artificial lift, or mechanical pumping, began increasing in the mid-1960's and gradually increased through the 1980's*' Average oil well production per day, which grew steadily since 1959, reached a peak in 1972 and began a gradual decline that continued throughout the 1970's and 1980's. Average gas well production reached a peak in 1971 and began a steady and much steeper decline than did average oil well production. In 1990, the average gas well produced only 38 percent per day as much as the average gas well did in 1971.22 Some of this downturn was in response to oversupply and came from intentional cutbacks in production, beginning in early 1982 and lasting throughout the decade.23  The nonproduction workers within the industry include engineers, computer specialists, mathematicians, and physical scientists. There are also large numbers of administrative and clerical personnel, as well as lawyers and others involved in purchasing potential oil-producing properties. In addition, the central administrative and auxiliary offices support a large amount of research affecting the entire oil industry. Production workers within the industry are for the most part hoist operators, mechanics, painters, pumpers, roustabouts, truck drivers, welders, and well-service personnel.  Factors affecting productivity Productivity growth during the Aging fields. 1970's and 1980's was adversely affected by oil and gas being increasingly harder to find. There is typically a 5- to 7-year lag from the beginning of exploratory expenditures to substantial production gains.15 The rapidly rising and falling price of oil was outside the control of the domestic industry. The uncertainty over future oil prices led to an increasing dependence on existing oil fields.16 Some of the increased drilling activity during 1972-82 was  Chart 1.

In 1959, 67.3 percent of all oil wells were stripper wells, and they provided 20.7 percent of all U.S. oil production in that year. In 1986, before the large drop in world oil prices, 73.2 percent of all producing oil wells were stripper wells, but they only accounted for 14.5 percent of U.S. crude oil production. Average daily production per well fell from a high of 4.0 barrels in 1961 to only 2.3 barrels in 1990.24 The economic feasibility of having these marginally producing wells in production depends on price levels. There is an inverse relationship between the growth of stripper wells and productivity growth. The number of strippers fell during the 1960's, which was a period of rising productivity, and increased in the 1970's, when productivity declined. Similarly, stripper gas wells were increasingly taken out of production during the 1980's, while productivity growth was again rising.25 Capital expenditures. the crude petroleum (SIC 1311) equaled shipments in 1963. 26.7 percent in 1977 then they fell to only Capital expenditures in and natural gas industry 22.3 percent of industry Expenditures increased to and 25.4 percent in 1982; 13.7 percent of shipments  in 1987. Capital outlays per employee grew from $15,200 in 1963 to a high of $129,800 in 1982 and far exceeded mining industry averages.26 The bulk of capital expenditures in the industry are for mineral exploration and development. These outlays include expenses for supplies, machinery, fuel, and parts in the exploration and development of any potential or working oil- or gas-producing property. They also include some costs for labor, which can be contract labor or industry employees. Exploration and development expenditures grew from a low of 54.0 percent of capital costs in 1967 to a high of 77.4 percent of capital costs in 1982. In 1987, exploration and development costs had fallen to 62.3 percent of capital expenditures.*' Land costs and mineral rights expenses for the entire industry are excluded from available data on capital expenditures. Data for 30 large energy companies show that, for 1982, domestic outlays for the acquisition of potential petroleum-producing properties were $7.9 billion.28 Expenditures for environmental protection have increased significantly since the rnid-1960'~.~~ The high costs for land and environmental protection have been a factor affecting exploration and production.30 Monthly Labor Review March 1992 13   Productivity  in Oil and Gas Production computers improved production by 5,000 barrels per day.39 Integrated computer software used on personal computers employs historical well production statistics as a data base to estimate reserves and analyze deliverability and declines in production. The software is a great timesaver in these types of analysis.40 Programmable logic controllers are a digital electronic apparatus with programmable memory that controls machines and processes. Developed in the auto industry and introduced into the oil industry in the middle 1980's, they first saw use in the industry on offshore platforms as replacements for pneumatic systems that regulated and set the pressure of fluids in separators. They are considered safer than the systems they superseded and replace very labor-intensive operations. In some instances, they are used to control virtually all offshore platform processes. They are also used onshore, where they are considered valuable in saving training time and in simplifying troubleshooting and spare part requirements. Programmable logic controllers can be applied to whole field operations to reduce labor requirements.41 Enhanced oil recovery. In primary recovery from an oil well, the natural water and gas pressure of the reservoir is used to bring the oil to the surface. When the natural pressure declines, primary production also includes artiticial lift. In secondary recovery, which is commonly used, water, or sometimes natural gas, is pumped down injection wells to force oil to the surface. Primary recovery and secondary recovery usually bring 30-50 percent of the recoverable reserve into production.42 Tertiary production, known as enhanced oil recovery, is used to bring as much of the rest of the reserve as is possible to the surface. Enhanced oil recovery is complicated and expensive. Steam, heat, chemicals, or gas is injected into the reservoir to repressurize it or to change the viscosity of the crude oil in it. Enhanced oil recovery can add up to 10 years to the productive life of an oil field.43 Rising prices made increases in the use of enhanced oil recovery economically feasible in the late 1970's. The number of projects in which carbon dioxide was flooded into reservoirs increased from 20 in 1980 to 100 in 1986. Also in 1986, there were 200 thermal projects and 200 chemical projects. That year, enhanced oil recovery accounted for 605,000 barrels of crude oil per day, until falling prices halted the growth in the use of these technologies."" By 1989, enhanced oil recovery was down to producing 500,000 barrels daily.45 By 1990, however, with  Structure. The largest companies within SIC 13 11 produce the bulk of industry output. Major oil companies, with huge oil and gas fields, dominate the industry. Offshore drilling and production are especially dominated by major oil companies. The 20 largest oil companies account for 75 percent of all offshore capital expenditures.31 In 1963, the 16 largest companies accounted for only 3.8 percent of establishments (producing oil or gas fields), but had 58.6 percent of industry value of shipments, 46.8 percent of employment, and 62 percent of industry capital expenditures. In 1972, when industry activity was slowing down, the 16 largest companies accounted for .5.8 percent of establishments, 69.9 percent of shipments, 32.2 percent of employment, and 60.7 percent of capital expenditures. By 1982, just past the peak in industry activity, the top 16 companies accounted for 14.5 percent of establishments, 56.4 percent of shipments, 39.7 percent of employment, and 56.1 percent of capital expenditures.32 Nevertheless, there are a large number of companies and establishments in SIC 1311. As many as 50 oil companies are vertically integrated.33 In all, there were 8,676 companies operating 12,087 establishments in 1982. There have been numerous small Technology. innovations and improvements to existing technologies in oil and gas field production. Many of these involve the basic sucker rod pumping systems in oil wells and shutoff systems necessary for maintenance of both oil and gas wells.34 There have also been improvements in steel metallurgy that have allowed the production of deep, high-temperature, sulfurous natural gas.35 Large increases in offshore technological developments occurred during the late 1970's and early 1980'~.~~ Submersible production systems for offshore wells and special equipment for use in arctic climates made it possible to exploit previously inaccessible oil and gas fields. Although these technologies aid output growth, their effect on productivity is uncertain. Innovations, however, have helped the industry offset some of the problems and costs involved in producing oil and gas under more difficult circumstances.37 One technology that has had a positive influence on productivity has been the computer. The use of personal computers to deal with bookkeeping duties is widespread in the industry. In the field, computers quickly measure the flow of natural gas and monitor liquid flow from oil wells.38 In 1973, computers were used for field management in 82 percent of Exxon's oil production. Exxon estimated then that these 14 Monthly Labor Review March 1992   prices rising, oil produced by these methods was up to 700,000 barrels per day.46 Enhanced oil recovery is more labor intensive than primary and secondary recovery. Although it increases production, it also usually increases unit labor requirements.47 In times of high prices, enhanced oil recovery can contribute to declines in labor productivity. Unconventional gas recovery is less developed than enhanced oil recovery, yet it is considered important to the future recovery of natural gas reserves. 48 The technique is used mostly for tight sand formations where large amounts of gas are trapped in individual small pockets. Hydraulic fracturing is most commonly used to release the gas. Fracture methods are also used to recover gas from the methane seams of coalbeds and from Devonian shale formations. Some forms of fracturing have become standard enough to no longer be considered unconventional. Unconventional gas recovery is generally slower than primary gas recovery, and many techniques are not economically feasible at current price levels.49 The increased usage of unconventional gas recovery, with current technology, would tend to dampen labor productivity growth.  Outlook The basic dynamics that have influenced the crude petroleum and natural gas industry for the past two decades will continue to mold production and productivity growth in the foreseeable future. Lower prices depress the domestic industry and stimulate demand, while foreign producers gain market share. Higher prices stimulate the domestic industry. In order to sustain long-term investment and production, a portion of the domestic industry prefers guaranteed price levels.50 If increasing prices lead to increased production from new oil and gas reservoirs, productivity growth will be affected positively. If, however, increasing prices only increase marginal production, productivity growth will be affected negatively. Production from existing U.S. oil fields is declining. In the lower 48 States, this decline has been continuing since 1970. Production from existing Alaskan oil fields has also begun to decline and is expected to fall sharply in the future. Offshore production is expected to de-  crease as well.51 In addition, there has been a shift away from domestic investment for exploration to international projects, because of more favorable success rates of wildcatting outside the United States and because foreign govemments provide incentives to encourage exploration.52 Even if major reservoirs are found in the continental United States, there is a shortage of labor from the prolonged industry downturn in the 1980's. Both skilled production workers and professional employees have moved on to other industries.53 Future U.S. production and productivity will be affected by new technology. Horizontal drilling is expected to add significant new recoverable reserves for U.S. production."" Recent technological advances involving undersea equipment may make some previously marginal offshore sites economically feasible for production.s5 Improvements in enhanced oil recovery, even in the use of microbial techniques, will help future production if the price of oil increases enough to make the techniques profitable.56 The Gas Research Institute estimates that 16 percent of natural gas production from the lower 48 States by the year 2000 and 42 percent by the year 2010 will be produced using new technology. 57The total impact of these developments on productivity, however, remains uncertain. Domestically, future production and productivity trends are clouded by environmental considerations. Opposition to offshore drilling is strong, especially in California, where there are thought to be large untapped offshore reserves.58 Similarly, the exploration and development of large reserves in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska are being opposed by environmental groups. The enormous investment in both time and money that is necessary for the growth of the domestic oil and gas industry requires a stable environment and stable oil prices. The intemational and domestic political forces that affect the U.S. oil and gas industry are extremely complex. The uncertainties produced by these complex political forces have led to basic disagreements concerning a national energy strategy. It is likely that the industry will be cautious in initiating large investments in domestic exploration and production in the face of so much uncertainty. 0  Footnotes r The crude petroleum and natural gas industry (SIC 1311) includes establishments engaged primarily in operating oil and gas fields and related properties.

When data to develop these weights were no longer available, price weights were developed to combine oil and gas produced from 1972 forward. Employment and employee hour indexes were derived from data published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Employees and employee hours are each considered homogeneous and additive and thus do not reflect changes in the qualitative aspects of labor, such as skill and experience. The indexes of output per employee hour do not measure any specific contributions, such as that of labor or capital. Rather, they reflect the joint effect of factors such as changes in technology, capital investment, capacity utilization, plant design and layout, skill and effort of the work force, managerial ability, and labor-management relations.  Indexes of output per employee hour measure changes in the relation between the output of an industry and employee hours expended on that output. An index of output per employee hour is derived by dividing an index of output by an index of industry employee hours. The preferred output index of mining industries would be obtained from data on quantities of the various materials produced by the industry, each weighted (multiplied) by the employee hours required to produce one unit of each good in some specified base period. Thus, those products which require more labor time to produce are given more importance in the index. The output index for this industry was developed from data on the quantities of crude oil and natural gas produced.

Petroleum is formed by the slow alteration of organic remains over time. It consists of a mixture of liquid hydrocarbon compounds and varies widely in composition, color, density, and viscosity. This liquid, after distillation, yields a range of combustible fuels, petrochemicals, and lubricants. Petroleum is usually classified according to the predominance of paraffin or asphaltic compounds and, accordingly, is said to have a paraffin base, an intermediate base, or an asphalt base.    Uses   Petroleum is used principally as a source of fuel and lubricating oils. Only when these supplies are restricted or threatened does the average person begin to realize their importance. Compounds and mixtures of compounds separated from crude petroleum by distillation include gasoline, diesel fuel, kerosene, home-heating oil, some types of alcohol, benzene, heavy napthas, different grades of lubricating oils, and residuum. South Arkansas has several refineries currently processing in excess of 30,000 barrels of crude oil daily. Many hydrocarbons extracted from petroleum are used by the petrochemical industry in the manufacture of plastics and synthetic materials.    Location of Fields   The southern part of the Gulf Coastal Plain of south Arkansas contains all the oil-producing fields in the state. These are in Ashley, Union, Ouachita, Columbia, Nevada, Hempstead, Bradley, Calhoun, Lafayette, and Miller Counties. By the end of 1993, oil recovery from over 200 active fields was in excess of 29,000 barrels of oil and approximately 105 million cubic feet of gas per day. Oil and condensate reserves as of January 1, 1994, were calculated to be in excess of 205 million barrels while the gas reserves associated with the oil and condensate were calculated at over 466 billion cubic feet. Data for 1993 indicate that the petroleum consumption by Arkansas citizens, by products, was predominantly as gasoline (55 percent) and distillate fuel (31 percent), and also included the following other products: asphalt and road oil (3 percent), liquefied petroleum gas – LPG – (4 percent), jet fuel (2 percent), lubricants (1 percent), and other petroleum products (4 percent). See the section on  Natural Gas  for the reserve estimates for northern Arkansas gas fields.    History of Discovery and Exploration   Oil was discovered in Arkansas in a well near Stephens in Ouachita County in April of 1920. During the same month, gas was discovered in the northern part of the present El Dorado field in Union County by the Constantin Oil and Refining Company. On January 10, 1921, oil was discovered in the S. T. Busey well in the same field. This marked the beginning of commercial oil production in Arkansas.   In south Arkansas, several wells have been drilled to depths exceeding 16,000 feet. An exploratory well in Hempstead County was drilled to 17,349 feet. Elsewhere, an exploratory well in Ashley County was drilled to a depth of 16,611 feet. As of 1995, the depth record for an exploratory well drilled in Arkansas was held by the Occidental Petroleum #1 U. S. A., located in Yell County, with a total depth of 20,661 feet. There are several oil wells which produce from a depth exceeding 11,000 feet along the southern border of Arkansas in Lafayette County.   Arkansas has two giant oil-producing fields. Giant fields are defined as those that have produced at least 100 million barrels of oil. The Smackover field, discovered in 1922, produced 569,974,000 barrels of crude oil as of January 1, 1995. The Magnolia field, discovered in 1938, produced 164,656,000 barrels as of January 1, 1995.   During the early development of the Arkansas oil fields, prospecting and locating structures favorable for the accumulation of oil and gas was based almost entirely on information gained by the study of the relationship of rock units in time and space from records of previously drilled wells. In recent years, geophysical methods have largely replaced older methods of locating favorable structures for the accumulation of petroleum and natural gas. The most widely used geophysical instrument in petroleum exploration is the seismograph.   Present-day production methods, based on existing technical knowledge and principles of conservation, have greatly increased the amount of oil and gas that can be recovered from an oil pool. Better equipment makes it possible to pump oil profitably from depths exceeding 11,000 feet. Improved handling and storage facilities at wells have eliminated much of the waste that existed in the early fields, where earthen pits or wooden storage tanks were used.  Modern recovery methods are much more efficient than early methods. Today, the natural underground forces of gas and water pressure are used to obtain the greatest recovery of oil over the longest period of time.   Oil and gas production involves relatively high fixed costs, mailing drilling expenses. Drilling cost varies with factors such as depth of the well, physical characteristics of the rocks composing the formation(s) penetrated, diameter of the hole, and materials required. A well may cost from a few dollars per foot to more than a thousand dollars per foot. The decrease in prices permitted by competition, improved skills, and better equipment has, in many cases, been offset by the increasing depth of current drilling.

Asphaltum from oil seeps helped keep arrowheads on  their shafts and made baskets watertight.    The Division of Oil, Gas, and Geothermal Resources -- originally known as the  Department of Petroleum and Gas -- never regulated the making of arrows or  baskets. Its work began in 1915, at a time when the oil and gas industry was a  booming free-for-all in need of a referee. Through the 20th Century and into  today, DOGGR has helped the  oil, gas and geothermal (a relative newcomer) industries maintain productivity  while becoming more efficient, diversified and environmentally conscious.    ""By and large, DOGGR and the oil, gas and geothermal industries have had an  excellent relationship that has benefited the state's economy and population,''  State Oil and Gas Supervisor Bill Guerard said. ""It's a legacy all Department  of Conservation employees can be proud of.''    The world's first oil well, about 69 feet deep, was drilled in Pennsylvania  in 1859. Two years later, an oil well was sunk in Humboldt County, California. It was dry.  But the state experienced a two-year boom in the mid-1860s, as 65 oil companies  drilled from Humboldt Bay to Ventura. Our industry was off and running.    The first legislation involving the industry -- aimed at preventing the  intrusion of water into oil strata -- came in 1903. However, there was no  enforcement agency. Other regulations followed in 1909 and 1911, but they were  often ignored. It was becoming obvious that a statewide organization was needed  to monitor the industry. The Department of Petroleum and Gas came into being  Aug. 9, 1915, under the State Mining Bureau.    Mining engineer Roy McLaughlin was appointed State Oil and Gas Supervisor. The  Department of Petroleum and Gas had a yearly budget of $45,000 -- hardly enough  to oversee an industry of 7,000 wells producing 237,000 barrels of oil a day,  not to mention 80,702 acres of oil land, about 2,000 miles of pipeline, 30  refineries and 40 tank steamers.    The department gained true credibility with the industry through a mishap at Elk  Hills, near Bakersfield, in June of 1919. The department had tried to convince  Standard Oil it was drilling improperly through a gas zone, only to be ignored.  Shortly thereafter, fires lasting four and 10 days, respectively, started when  two wells on the field blew out. It was estimated that 140 million cubic feet  per day of gas was flowing out of the second well, Hay No. 7, at the time it was  capped, 26 days after the fire began. That well produced an unprecedented 43  billion cubic feet of gas over the next seven years, making it the world's most  productive gas well and confirming the Department of Petroleum and Gas  evaluation.    By the end of World War I, the importance of petroleum was clear. Demand for  gasoline for automobiles began growing. In 1930, the Department of Petroleum and  Gas became the Division of Oil and Gas, under the Department of Natural  Resources rather than the State Mining Bureau.    During the Great Depression, the oil and gas industry took a big hit in  California. But it wasn't dormant. In June 1934, General Petroleum Corporation broke  the world record with a well 11,377 feet deep in the South Belridge Oil Field. In  1936, the state's largest gas field, near Rio Vista, was discovered.     California oil was a target during World War II. A Japanese submarine attacked  the Richfield Oil Corporation tanker Agwiworld as it sailed from Los Angeles to San  Francisco. The tanker tried to ram the sub and made it to Santa Cruz with only  slight damage. A sub sank the tanker Larry Doheny and a sub fired at an oil  field near Santa Barbara on Feb. 23, 1942. Except for one salvo at an Oregon  target and the launching of some balloons carrying explosive/incendiary devices,  that was the only enemy attack on the continental U.S. during the war.    Offshore drilling, first accomplished in 1897, became vogue in the postwar  years. The first offshore oil well was drilled in 1897 on a pier at Summerland,  just south of Santa Barbara. The state started to open up offshore lands for  exploratory drilling in an effort to boost sagging production. In 1957, 85 of  the 106 notices to drill new wells were of the offshore variety. On Sept. 20,  1958, Standard made the first new-field discovery from the sea, rather than from  dry land, starting a new era.    In 1965, the Division of Oil and Gas became part of the Department of  Conservation. During the decade, oil producers tried a variety of methods to  heat the heavy crude oil they couldn't pump up, making it flow more readily. The  most effective of these proved to be the injection of steam or hot water into  the ground. In 1967, California's daily production went over one million barrels  for the first time in 14 years. In 1968, the state produced a record 373.2  million barrels.    Geothermal energy was first tapped in the state in 1922 at The Geysers, 75 miles  north of San Francisco in Sonoma County. More recently, Pacific Gas & Electric opened Geysers  Power Plant Unit 1 on Sept. 25, 1960, generating enough electricity for a city  of 12,500 people. By 1973, there were 10 generating plants at The Geysers,  making it the world's largest geothermal power facility. The Division of Oil and  Gas began to oversee the geothermal industry in 1965 and the division's name was expanded  to DOGGR in 1992.    In Feb. of 1969, the state was confronted with its first offshore oil spill when  a well blew out. It took the operator of the federal lease 10 days to stop the  flow of oil and gas, and the incident was followed by lawsuits and proposed  legislation to block all offshore drilling. Two years later, the first  comprehensive report on the state's offshore oil and gas seeps was published.    Onshore, DOGGR was taking a closer look at potential environmental hazards.  Assembly Bill 2209 became effective Jan. 1, 1974, providing for sump inspection  and correction. Within five years, most of the pits containing oil from  production operations had been eliminated or screened to prevent wildlife from  falling in. In 1975, the division targeted hazardous and idle-deserted wells for  plugging and abandonment.    In 1986, the division began its construction-site review and  well-reabandonment program to ensure construction would not take place over  improperly abandoned wells. Three years later, a program to remove unneeded  equipment such as cable, pipelines and tanks from various sites was begun. Some  of the work was done on land considered prime habitat for endangered species.    In the past decade, DOGGR has used new technology to more efficiently track well  data. DOGGR also plugged a record number of orphaned oil and gas wells (398, for  a total of 535), and is taking a proactive approach to the remaining 600 or so  in the state. Also, DOGGR began plugging and abandoning geothermal wells, and received legislative authority for the regulation of  oilfield tanks and pipelines.     California is the nation's fourth-largest oil producer, behind Louisiana, Texas  and Alaska, with 307.4 million barrels produced in 2000. There are about 3.5  billion barrels of proven crude reserves in California (onshore and offshore),  meaning DOGGR will be busy for years to come.     Much of the information for this story was taken from ``Drilling Through  Time,'' by William Rintoul, available from DOGGR.

GX095-81-4903244	"Big Thicket National Preserve        Oil and Gas in the Thicket         Limiting Factors    W hen Big Thicket National Preserve was established by Congress on October 11, 1974, limits were placed on the National Park Service's ability to acquire the oil and gas resources underlying the Preserve. Congress also directed the park service to limit and control nonfederal oil and gas development to protect the resources it administers.    Using current regulations, the National Park Service is working to insure that oil and gas operations are managed to protect the natural and ecological integrity of the Preserve while providing for public safety, use, and enjoyment.        A Significant Resource          S plashing onto the scene in the wakening years of the twentieth century, the Lucas Gusher ( photo: Spindletop 1903 ), a major oil strike in the United States, helped to create today's oil industry. The economy of Southeast Texas is dependent on the oil and gas industry. Many people, directly and indirectly, are employed by this industry.    The Preserve is adjacent to the Golden Triangle - Beaumont, Port Arthur, and Orange, Texas. This are is the sixth ranking industrial complex in Texas and one of the largest petrochemical and refining centers in the World.        Brief History    P receded by the timber industry or the late 1880's, most oil and gas activity and pipeline construction occurred between the late 1920's and early 1970's in the seven county area of the Preserve. Today, there are 47 segments of pipelines crossing the Preserve, about 110 plugged and abandoned wells, 15 miles of access roads, and a small number of production operations currently underway. The overall oil and gas ""footprint"" in the Preserve is about 920 acres -- one percent of the total Preserve.    Under the Preserve, most oil and gas resources are being produced from depths of 6,500 to 10,00 feet. The search for reserves continues with some targets as deep as 18,000 feet.        Geology, Products and The Future    G eologically, the Preserve is located in the Upper Gulf Coast Salt Basin. This basin has an active history in the oil industry. The Spindletop Oil Field discovery in 1901 made possible the use of oil as an inexpensive, lightweight, and efficient fuel. Our lives, indeed, the American life-style have been altered by this discovery. Today, most petroleum components are used in the manufacturing of resins, polyester fibers, solvents, steel, fertilizer, paper, and many other chemicals.    Change is inevitable. We are now charged with the personal choice of considering the recent alternate power systems being offered by automobile makers. How will our personal transportation change over the next 15 to 25 years? What will be the ""new"" source of fuel to power our future vehicles and the country's manufacturing? What is in store for the future of the oil and gas industry?    When in Beaumont, Texas, take the time to visit the  Texas Energy Museum  the story of petroleum resources and how humans have used it over many decades is told here through excellent exhibits.

Among the world's leading atmos-  pheric scientists, agreement is now widespread that the Earth  is warming and that greenhouse gas emissions from human activities are at least partly to blame. The United States is committed to meeting this challenge, both through domestic actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and through environmentally sound, cost-effective international cooperation under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and its 1997 Kyoto Protocol. Awareness is growing throughout U.S. society that global warming is a serious problem and that serious action is required. Most importantly, specific concrete actions by citizens, businesses, and governments are yielding tangible results. In fact, recent data show that growth in U.S. greenhouse gas emissions has begun to decline, even as the U.S. economy grows at an unprecedented rate--an important measure of progress in the fight against climate change.  ""The greatest environmental challenge of the new century is global warming ...If we fail to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases, deadly heat waves and droughts will become more frequent, coastal areas will flood, and economies will be disrupted. That is going to happen, unless we act."" President Bill Clinton State of the Union Address January 27, 2000  1   U nit ed St at es: Domes t ic Pr o gres s on Climat e Change Challenging the Historic Link between GDP and Carbon Emissions Historically, U.S. CO2 emissions have grown at roughly half the rate of the gross domestic product (GDP). In recent years, however, very robust growth in the nation's GDP has been accompanied by a slowdown in the growth of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. This trend grew even more pronounced in the late 1990s. s Over the 1990s, the U.S. GDP grew almost three times faster than energy-related CO2 emissions. s In both 1998 and 1999, U.S. GDP grew by more than 4 percent each year while CO2 emissions grew by less than 1.5 percent per year. In addition, recent data demonstrate that from 1960 to 1996, energy intensity--the amount of energy used per unit of GDP--declined by an average of 1.3 percent per year. Even more telling, from 1996 to 1999, the nation's energy intensity declined at a rate of 3.2 percent annually. Finally, the carbon intensity of the U.S. economy--the amount of CO2 emitted per unit of GDP--declined by 15 percent over the course of the 1990s. Factors contributing to these trends may include a high rate of new investments and the rise of the digital economy. What is clear is that U.S. businesses, states and localities, and the Federal government are achieving real results in reducing growth in greenhouse gas emissions. There is also a commitment at all levels to ensuring that these positive results multiply in the years ahead.  U.S. Business Community Stepping For ward U.S. industry is undergoing a sea change in its attitude towards climate change. This, in part, reflects a realization by more and more companies that saving energy and reducing waste make sense not just for the environment, but also for their bottom line. The automobile industry, for example, is making important progress in reducing emissions from vehicles. s Ford and GM announced production plans for sport utility vehicles (SUVs) that are 15 to 25 percent more fuel-efficient than today's SUVs. Preliminary estimates by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency indicate that these commitments could result in cumulative emissions reductions of up to 100 MMTCE through 2020. s Thanks in part to the public-private Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles (PNGV), General Motors (GM), Ford Motor Company, and Daimler-Chrysler have all unveiled dieselbattery hybrid concept cars that are capable of traveling 70-90 miles per gallon (mpg). s Honda and Toyota introduced gasoline-battery hybrids into the U.S. market with fuel economy ratings of up to 70 mpg on the highway. Also, this year Johnson & Johnson and IBM became the first two companies to join a new partnership with the conservation community to help businesses voluntarily lower energy consumption. Under this partnership, companies make specific commitments to reduce their emissions and participate in an independent verification process. In so doing, these two companies join a host of major companies that are stepping for ward with real plans to address climate change, including DuPont, Motorola, United  ""We have learned that a strong economy and a safe environment go hand in hand.""

And in May 2000, 11 major U.S. corporations, calling themselves the Green Power Market Development Group, began purchasing green energy and otherwise providing support to the development of green energy markets. The rise in good corporate citizenship is further evidenced by the decline of business organizations dedicated to opposing international action to address climate change, and the rise of other, more constructive voices, such as those of the Business Council for Sustainable Energy, the International Climate Change Partnership, and the Pew Center for Global Climate Change.  climate protection programs showing tangible results are the following: s Minimum efficiency standards on residential appliances have saved consumers nearly $25 billion through 1999, avoiding cumulative emissions by an amount equal to almost 50 million metric tons of carbon (MMTCE). Four pending appliance standards (clothes washers, fluorescent light ballasts, water heaters, and central air conditioners) are expected to save consumers more than $10 billion and reduce cumulative emissions by 22 MMTCE through 2010. s The ENERGY STAR program promotes energy efficiency in U.S. homes and buildings. It is estimated that by 2010 ENERGY STAR will reduce cumulative U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by more than 100 MMTCE. s Public-private partnership programs to reduce methane emissions are expected to hold methane emissions at or below 1990 levels through 2010. Partners in the methane programs will reduce cumulative emissions by an estimated 120 MMTCE by 2010. s Programs designed to halt the growth in emissions of the most  Real Actions, Real Results For the past seven years, the hallmark of the Clinton-Gore Administration's strategy for reducing U.S. greenhouse gas emissions has been to use R&D investments and tax incentives to increase energy efficiency, spur the broader use of renewable energy, and work with industry to promote voluntary, costeffective reductions. Among the many U.S.  3   U nit ed St at es: Domes t ic Pr o gres s on Climat e Change Funding for Technology Programs to Combat Climate Change (In millions of dollars) 1500  1200  potent greenhouse gases--the so-called ""high global warming potential (GWP) gases""--are achieving significant progress. Investments already made by partners in these programs will reduce cumulative emissions by an estimated 80 MMTCE by 2010.  900  Growing Commitment by the U.S. Government Over the past two years (FY 1999 and FY 2000), the Clinton-Gore Administration has secured more than $7 billion in overall funding to fight climate change. This includes more than $2 billion for the research and development of clean energy technologies in the four major carbon-emitting sectors of the U.S. economy: Industry, Buildings, Electricity Generation, and Transportation. The President's FY 2001 budget proposed $2.4 billion in funding for renewable energy, energy efficiency, agricultural- and forestbased bioproducts and energy, research and development, and tax incentives for the purchase of clean cars, homes, appliances, and clean energy production. This represents a 43 percent increase over FY 2000 enacted levels and builds on the Administration's consistent record of fighting for--and achieving--higher funding levels for climate programs.  600  300  0  1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001*  *proposed Source: Office of Management and Budget  Targeted Tax Credits to Fight Global Warming As part of t he Climate Change Technology Initiative, President Clinton has proposed $9.3 billion in tax incentives over 10 years for consumers who purchase energy-efficient products and for producers of energy from renewable sources. Highlights include the following: s Tax credits for fuel-efficient cars. The package extends the current tax credit (of up to $4,000) through 2006 for qualified electric and fuel cell vehicles and also includes a tax credit of $5003,000 for the purchase of a qualifying hybrid vehicle from 2003-2006. s Tax credits for energy-efficient homes. Consumers can receive a $1,000-2,000 credit toward the purchase of a new energy-efficient home; a 20 percent tax credit for the purchase of selected energy-efficient products for homes and buildings; and a $1,000 -2,000 credit for installing a solar energy system. s Tax credits for clean energy. The package extends existing tax credits for the production of electricity from wind and closed-loop biomass and creates credits for electricity from openloop biomass facilities, coal-biomass co-firing, and landfill methane.  New Federal Initiatives In addition to fighting for increased funding for existing climate programs, the Administration has proposed or implemented several major climate initiatives in the past year, including: s Cutting Fuel Use by Federal Fleets. An Executive Order from President Clinton requiring U.S. government agencies to reduce the amount of petroleum used by their vehicle fleets by 20 percent below 1999 levels by 2005.

We must also make more progress international-  ly--both inside and outside of the Kyoto Protocol. In the long run, the United States' balanced approach to addressing climate change will allow us to continue to grow our economy and protect the environment at the same time--the essential challenge facing all nations.  5   Industry   Chapter 1. Industr y  America's interest. More and more companies are realizing that saving energy and reducing waste make sense not just for the environment, but also for their bottom line. After 1997, carbon dioxide emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels by the U.S. manufacturing sector began to decrease, partly due to increasing efficiency, as measured by a reduction in emissions per unit of gross domestic product. Methane emissions from U.S. coal mining also are decreasing, owing at least in part to investments in methane recovery from coal mines and projects to use that methane. Emissions from natural gas systems are decreasing as well, primarily due to greater use of plastic piping for distribution. In fact, through voluntary public-private partnership programs and other actions, overall U.S. methane emissions are expected to be at or below 1990 levels through 2010. Public-private partnerships are substantially reducing emissions of the ""high global warming potential"" (GWP) gases--perfluorocompounds (PFCs) and several hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) --from industrial operations. These initiatives are underway in the semiconductor industry, aluminum production, the chemical industry, electric transmission and distribution systems, and the magnesium industry.  S  everal positive trends characterize greenhouse gas emissions from the U.S. industrial sector, reflecting the basic economic fact that saving energy and reducing waste is in corporate  7   U nit ed St at es: Domes t ic Pr o gres s on Climat e Change Johnson & Johnson: A Win-Win Johnson & Johnson, the pharmaceutical company, estimates that its efforts to improve energy efficiency in its manufacturing processes are saving $3.8 million a year. Since 1991, the company has cut energy use by 8 percent while production has soared by 330 percent. On top of that, Johnson & Johnson is saving an estimated $9.7 million as a partner in the U.S. government's ENERGY STAR buildings program through the company's effort to improve energy efficiency in its facilities. (See Chapter 2, ""Buildings."")  Industr y Initiatives on Climate Change Awareness is growing among U.S. corporations that climate change is a serious issue deserving serious action. As a result, a number of companies are undertaking forward-looking initiatives: In May 2000, 11 major U.S. corporations, calling themselves the Green Power Market Development Group (GPMDG), began purchasing green energy and otherwise providing support to the development of green energy markets. (See Chapter 3, ""Electricity."") In 2000, Johnson & Johnson and IBM were the first two companies to join Climate Savers, a new partnership to help businesses voluntarily lower energy consumption and reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. In joining Climate Savers, companies make specific commitments to reduce those emissions and participate in an independent verification process. In 1999, the Business Roundtable, a group of CEOs from leading U.S. corporations, released a report advocating ""the deployment of more energy-efficient and breakthrough technologies"" and called on government and industry to work together to find answers to the challenges of climate change. The Pew Center on Climate Change launched a $5 million campaign in 1998 to build support for taking action on climate change. Boeing, DuPont, Shell, Weyerhaeuser, and 17 other major corporations joined the center's Business Environmental Leadership Council, agreeing that ""enough is known about the science and environmental impacts of climate change for us to take actions to address its consequences.""  Majestic Metals Majestic Metals, a precision sheet metal manufacturer in Denver, Colorado, achieved a 15 percent annual reduction in its natural gas bill-- saving some $40,000 per year--through energy efficiency improvements. Efficiency measures include t he development of a cost-effective closed-loop rinse system in its metal pre-paint processing area. O t her energy efficiency improvements included enhanced insulation and an upgraded heating system.  Energy Efficiency in Industrial Processes A cornerstone of the U.S. strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the industrial sector is the development of partnerships between the Federal government and private  8   Greening the Cement Industr y Cement manufacturing accounts for approximately 5 percent of U.S. CO2 emissions from industrial sources. Companies representing more than 70 percent of U.S. cement production are taking advantage of the latest methods for improving energy efficiency. These companies have produced action plans in which they have committed to reducing their CO2 emissions by more than 736,364 MTCE by the end of 2000 with an expected cost savings of around $2.3 million. 2  of $25 million per year and avoid emissions of 130,000 MTCE.  ""We recognize that the debate over climate change goes well beyond the matter of the U.S. economy. We also believe that protracted debate about the adequacy of the science is something Texaco wishes to move beyond."" J.G. Metzger Vice President, Texaco February 2000 announcement of Texaco's withdrawal From the Global Climate Coalition  industry to improve efficiency and reduce waste. One Federal program, Industries of the Future, works in partnership with the nation's most energy-intensive industries, enhancing their long-term competitiveness, and accelerating research, development, and deployment of technologies that increase energy and resource efficiency. For example, steel scrap generated in steelmaking plants is now being recycled at a rate close to 100 percent. By 2010, participating industries are projected to avoid 15 MMTCE and realize $3 billion in energy savings annually. The Federal government's Best Practices Program helps participating U.S. manufacturers lower energy bills with little to no added capital investment through the careful selection and adoption of new processes and component technologies. One best practice program, Steam Challenge, helps industrial partners retrofit, operate, and maintain their steam systems more efficiently and profitably. The program expects to achieve a 20 percent efficiency improvement by 2010, saving some 2 quads of energy annualy. A similar program, Motor Challenge, stresses a systems approach to the engineering, specification, and maintenance of motors, drives, and motor-driven equipment. Funded at just over $5 million a year, Motor Challenge helps industry realize electricity cost savings  Recovering Useful Methane U.S. industry works in concert with the Federal government through a variety of voluntary partnerships that are directed toward eliminating market barriers to profitable collection and use of methane that otherwise would be released to the atmosphere. Collectively, these programs are expected to hold methane emissions at or below 1990 levels through 2010. Partners in the methane programs will reduce cumulative emissions by an estimated 120 MMTCE by 2010. One of these partnerships, the L andfill Methane Outreach Program (LMOP), has assisted more than 140 planned and operational projects by providing decision support software, identifying potential partners, and addressing specific technical or regulatory issues. The Coalbed Methane Outreach Program (CMOP) works with coal mines and project developers to develop technical and cost evaluation models. As a result, methane recovery by the coal industry has more than doubled since 1993. Nearly $50 million in direct gas sales were generated in 1999. Natural GasSTAR works with more than 70 gas production, transmission, and distribution companies,  9   U nit ed St at es: Domes t ic Pr o gres s on Climat e Change Lucent Shines with Clean Energy Working with the Landfill Methane Outreach Program, Lucent Technologies found it could save approximately $100,000 a year on fuel bills at its Columbus, Ohio, plant by using captured landfill gas instead of fossil fuels to power boiler operations that generate steam for space heating and hot water. Lucent's new fuel source is reducing annual greenhouse gas emissions by 100,000 MTCE--equivalent to removing more than 80,000 automobiles from the road. And because landfill gas is less expensive and easier to maintain than traditional fuels like coal and oil, Lucent saves money on fuel costs and operating expenses.  Voluntary partnership programs are expected to hold methane emissions at or below 1990 levels through 2010. providing partners with detailed technical and economic information on how to reduce emissions. The program has identified more than 50 previously unrecognized ways of economically reducing methane emissions, which now are being widely adopted by industry.  Reducing Emissions by Reducing Waste The U.S. government's WasteWise program works to reduce municipal solid waste and greenhouse gas emissions through energy savings, increased carbon sequestration, and avoided methane emissions from landfills. WasteWise has grown from 361 partners in 1994 to its current membership of more than 1,000. The partners reported total reductions of 7.8 million tons of solid waste in 1998. Avoided disposal cost savings grew from $38 million in 1994 to $280 million in 1998. Since the program's inception, partners have avoided an estimated 19 MMTCE.  Company Gets Wise to Waste Herman Miller, a Zeeland, Michigan, furniture manufacturer, saved $422,000 in 1998 by switching to returnable packaging and changing its packaging design. The company also eliminated 40 tons of panel textiles and 27.5 tons of textiles for chairs through a life cycle analysis process and saved $407,300. In 1998 the company prevented 725 tons of waste, collected 10,273 tons of recyclables, and purchased 37,423 tons of recycled-content products.  Reducing High GWP Gases Public-private Environmental Stewardship Partnerships are substantially reducing U.S. emissions of PFCs and several HFCs, the ""high global warming potential"" (GWP) gases, which are released as byproducts of industrial operations. Investments already made by partners in these programs will reduce cumulative emissions by an estimated 80 MMTCE by 2010.  10   The PFC Emission Reduction Partnership for the Semiconductor Industry has served as a catalyst for companies in Europe, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and the United States to join together to set the first global target for reducing greenhouse gas emissions: Participating countries will reduce PFC emissions to at least 10 percent below 1995 levels by 2010. Since the launch of the Voluntary Aluminum Industrial Partnership (VAIP) in 1995, the program's membership has grown to include 11 of the nation's 12 primary aluminum producers, representing 22 smelters and 94 percent of U.S. production capacity. As of 1998, VAIP partners cumulatively achieved a dramatic 44 percent in PFC emissions from 1990 levels. In the chemical industry, all four of the U.S. manufacturers that emit HFC-23 during the manufacture of HCFC-22 are significantly reducing emissions of this highly potent greenhouse gas through process optimization. Two new partnerships, the SF6 Emission Reduction Partnership for Electric Power Systems and the SF6 Emission Reduction Partnership for the Magnesium Industry, are identifying and encouraging adoption of best management practices for reducing emissions of sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), a highly potent greenhouse gas. The program to reduce emissions from electric power systems now represents approximately 25 percent of the companies within this industry. The program to reduce emissions from magnesium production already represents 60 percent of U.S. magnesium industry emissions.  The Voluntary Aluminum Industrial Partnership (VAIP) is reducing PFC emissions while increasing the efficiency of primary aluminum production.  11   Buildings   Chapter 2. Buildings  application of whole-building and whole-community approaches. The sector has other good news to report as well. From 1984 to 1997, energy consumption per housing unit in the United States decreased, primarily as a result of a large reduction in energy consumption for space heating. Total energy consumption in commercial buildings remained roughly constant from 1989 to 1995, as did energy use per square foot. Studies show that by investing in simple profitable building upgrades, many U.S. homes and businesses could reduce their annual energy use by nearly 30 percent. To meet this need, the U.S. government created a variety of programs that focus on developing and promoting the broader use of cleaner and more efficient building and appliance technologies. The buildings sector, comprising primarily residential and commercial facilities, is responsible for approximately 35 percent of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. Electricity consumption for lighting, heating, cooling, and operating appliances accounts for the majority of these emissions.  T  here are several promising trends for reducing emissions from the U.S. buildings sector, including the increasing deployment of energy-efficient technologies and the growing  Community Actions on Energy Use in Buildings Improving the energy efficiency of buildings is a priority for U.S. state and local governments. One program, Rebuild America, helps communities identify clean energy opportunities by providing on-site technical assistance, training, and access to resources. The program's network of community partnerships--made up of municipalities, state agencies, schools and universities, nonprofit organizations, and businesses--tailors programs to local needs, choosing the buildings to renovate and the technologies to use. Rebuild America partnerships in 51 U.S. states and territories are committed to performing energy retrofits on 469 million square feet of space. By August 2000, the number of partners was nearing 300. By 2005, energy efficiency measures undertaken by Rebuild America part-  13   U nit ed St at es: Domes t ic Pr o gres s on Climat e Change Rebuild Duke University Facilities In 1998 the Rebuild Duke University Facilities partnership completed lighting and water conservation improvements in 114 academic buildings with 3.2 million square feet. This Rebuild America partnership is presently renovating inefficient and aging heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems in the campus buildings that consume the greatest amount of energy. During fiscal year 1998-99, t he partnership saved the university an estimated 10 million kilowatt-hours of electricity, 42 million pounds of steam, and 7 million cubic feet of water. nerships are expected to achieve savings of $1 billion annually and double that amount by 2010. In addition, local governments that participate in ICLEI's Cities for Climate Protection program promote building energy efficiency, not only within their own facilities, but also in the commercial and residential building stock. Over the past year, participating governments have implemented a range of measures that are reducing emissions from both municipal and private sector buildings.  ""Energy conservation not only reduces global warming pollution, it also helps local businesses save money and remain competitive. That's a win-win for the city, and it's just one of the measures we're pursuing to meet our pledge to cut the emissions that cause global warming."" The Honorable Paul Schell Mayor, City of Seattle, Washington  Schools Saving Energy America's schools spend more than $6 billion each year on energy. Schools could save 25 percent by reducing energy consumption through better building design, widely available energy-efficient and renewable energy technologies, and improvements to operations and maintenance. In addition to saving money, the EnergySmart Schools program is reducing greenhouse gas emissions through gains in energy efficiency and the use of clean energy technologies. So far, more than 240 such community partnerships have been formed, involving 2,000 schools. In addition, the ENERGY STAR label for school buildings provides tools for schools to evaluate their own energy use, find ways to reduce it, and meet indoor air quality standards. A 25 percent reduction in schools' energy use will cut annual U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by 3 to 4 MMTCE.  Daniel Boone High School Since 1995, Daniel Boone High School, located in Washington County, Tennessee, has realized a 34 percent reduction in annual energy costs due to the installation of a geothermal heating and cooling system. Annual savings have averaged $82,000. With the installation of the geothermal system, the school also reduced maintenance costs, improved indoor air quality, and gained control over individual classroom temperatures. Because the geothermal system was sized to allow for changes, the school is able to add electric loads easily.  14   The Greening of The White House On Earth Day 1993, President Clinton launched a new initiative, The Greening of the White House, to improve the energy and environmental performance of the White House complex with steps that can be taken in any home. Measures implemented include replacement of standard light bulbs with more efficient compact fluorescents, installation of weather-tight windows, heating and air conditioning upgrades, and composting of yard trimmings from the White House grounds for use as fertilizer. The recently released status report on The Greening of the White House found that the initiative is saving $300,000 a year and reducing annual carbon emissions by 800 MTCE--t he equivalent of removing more than 600 automobiles from the road. Three of t he buildings t hat house t he U.S. Depar tment of Agriculture in Washington, D.C., are designated as historic structures--a circumstance that means many of the simple solutions for reducing energy consumption, such as  installing energy-efficient windows or using window awnings, are not options. The solution was to implement an Energy Management Program that involves the continuous evaluation of existing conditions, a facility-wide energy tune-up, load reduction, equipment replacement, building faade restoration, and indoor air quality programs. The results are impressive. In 1992, electricity usage, which had been climbing by roughly 3 percent per year over the preceding decade, exceeded 41 million kilowatt-hours (kWh) and was expected to approach 50 million kWh by 2000. Instead, energy consumption had declined by more than 24 percent by 1997--for a cumulative savings of 2 million kWh per year, or 1,758 MTCE.  Federal Government Leading By Example The Clinton-Gore Administration has set aggressive goals for curbing greenhouse gas emissions by U.S. government agencies. In 1999, President Clinton issued Executive Order 13123 requiring all Federal agencies to take steps to cut greenhouse gas emissions from energy use in buildings by 30 percent below 1990 levels by 2010. At present, the U.S. government is the single largest energy consumer in the world. Its annual energy bill exceeds $8 billion, including $4 billion to heat, cool, and power 500,000 buildings. As a result of the President's leadership, the Federal government's energy bill is $2 billion  less (in constant dollars) than it was in 1985. Implementing the measures needed to comply with the Executive Order will result in an annual reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of 2.4 MMTCE and save U.S. taxpayers approximately $750 million a year. The Executive Order requires agencies to opt for purchases from cleaner, more efficient power generators. Agencies are directed to adopt policies to increase the use of electricity generated from renewable energy sources and to consider off-grid electricity opportunities that provide energy and environmental benefits, while allowing agencies to avoid the costs of building new transmission lines or digging up existing lines.  15   U nit ed St at es: Domes t ic Pr o gres s on Climat e Change ENERGY STAR Cumulative Benefits through 2010 for Buildings and Products ($Billions) ENERGY STAR Buildings Private Sector Investments Savings on Energy Bills Net Savings on Energy Bills MMTCE Avoided $7.0 $19.8 $12.8 45 ENERGY STAR Products $0.7 $26.3 $25.6 60  Energy Efficiency in Private Buildings Public-private partnerships are producing important benefits in greenhouse gas abatement in buildings. What all of the partnerships have in common is that they all strive to lower costs for builders, developers, and homebuyers while reducing energy and environmental impacts and improving building durability and worker safety. One suite of programs, ENERGY STAR, promotes energy efficiency in the nation's homes and buildings. Based on actions already taken by partners, ENERGY STAR estimates that by the year 2010 more than 100 MMTCE of greenhouse gas emissions cumulatively will be avoided, and consumers and businesses will save more than $38 billion. ENERGY STAR labeled homes incorporate such features as improved insulation, sealed ducts, high-performance windows, and high-efficiency heating and cooling equipment. These homes are generally 30 percent more energy efficient than is called for by local building codes. Currently, more than 800 industry partners, including about 40 utilities, have signed agreements to promote ENERGY STAR qualified homes. ENERGY STAR also collaborates with a wide range of building owners and users--retailers, healthcare organizations, real estate investors, state and local governments, schools and universities, and small businesses. Each partner commits to improving the energy performance of its facilities and to using the performance metrics and tools provided by ENERGY STAR. A new energy performance rating system for commercial buildings allows the most efficient buildings across the country to be awarded the ENERGY STAR label. More than 1,000 buildings were rated in 1999 using this new system, and 90 qualified for the new label. More than 15 percent of the U.S. commercial, public, and industrial building market is enrolled in ENERGY STAR. Cumulatively, partners have invested more than $3.6 billion in  (measured since the early 1990s) Source: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency  16   energy-efficient technologies and, in 1999 alone, saved more than 20 billion kWh of energy. Going for ward, the recently introduced Building Benchmarking Tool, now allows building owners and managers to know whether their buildings have good or poor energy performance. Similar to a miles-pergallon rating for automobiles, this new tool provides tenants and potential buyers with a better understanding of the operating expenses of buildings and thus produces additional incentives for energy efficiency via the marketplace.  building design improvements. To date, more than 1,200 houses have been completed under this partnership program that achieve ENERGY STAR or greater savings in heating and cooling energy usage. In the near future, an additional 4,100 houses will be built under this contribution to PATH. The energy saved annually by these 1,200 houses is more than 43,000 MBtu with a savings of more than 250 MTCE, 10,000 pounds of sulfur dioxide emissions avoided and 11,000 pounds of nitrogen oxide emissions eliminated.  Solar Buildings The Federal government's Solar Buildings program has provided $2 million in funding to help develop Transpired Solar Collectors. Transpired solar collectors, located on building walls, are capable of converting 60-75 percent of the solar energy striking them into usable heat. Building owners and operators are finding them to be a reliable, lowcost technology that is well-suited for preheating the large quantities of ventilation air that most industrial and commercial buildings must pull in during the fall and winter. Ford Motor Company, General Motors, Federal Express, and McDonnell Douglas are on the growing list of industrial users of this technology.  Partnering with Home Builders The Partnership for Advancing Technology in Housing (PATH) is a public-private partnership including the National Association of Home Builders as a charter member, along with building product and equipment manufacturers, individual home builders, developers, and members of the finance community. PATH aims to cut the environmental impact and energy use of new housing by 50 percent or more, and reduce energy use in at least 15 million existing homes by 30 percent or more by 2010. Along with the contributions of such Federal programs as Building America and Energy Star Homes, accomplishing these objectives would save consumers $11 billion in annual energy costs and reduce annual carbon emissions in 2010 by nearly 24 MMTCE--roughly the amount that is produced by 20 million automobiles. There are more than a dozen field evaluation and demonstration sites across the nation. In addition, PATH projects are now underway in pilot communities in Denver, Los Angeles, Pittsburgh, San Fernando Valley, and Tucson, as well as an additional 25 demonstration and field evaluation sites nationwide. The Building America program is a costshared partnership for incorporating whole-  Energy-Efficient Products Help Consumers Fight Global Warming Using more energy-efficient appliances and other products helps reduce overall energy use in buildings and thus carbon emissions from the buildings sector. Two types of Federal programs promote the use of more energy-efficient products: Appliance standards increase the minimum level of efficiency of products on the market, while the ENERGY STAR program promotes the voluntary use of highly efficient products.  17   U nit ed St at es: Domes t ic Pr o gres s on Climat e Change PATH Makes Waves in California Rooftop photovoltaic solar panels and the first units of a new generation of high-efficiency gas absorption chillers are standard equipment in a new development in the San Fernando Valley outside Los Angeles, California. At Village Green, the homes of the future are here today. In 1999 families began moving into the first 22 of 186 planned homes, just about a year after President Clinton visited the site to launch the Partnership for Advancing Technology in Housing (PATH). Village Green is one of five PATH pilot projects around the country. The homes will use less than half of the electricity of a home built to the state's current energyefficient building standards. Heating and cooling costs are guaranteed to be no more than $38 per month. Most of the homes will have photovoltaic panels that will provide 90 percent of the electrical needs from the sun. Village Green will be on a mass transit line, making it the largest transit-based affordable housing development in the Los Angeles area. ""Village Green is living proof,"" says Los Angeles Councilwoman Ruth Galanter, ""that the building industry can combine new environmental technologies with affordable housing right here in one of t he largest housing markets in t he nation.""  Minimum efficiency standards on residential appliances such as furnaces, water heaters, air conditioners, and refrigerators saved consumers nearly $25 billion through 1999, avoiding cumulative emissions of nearly 50 MMTCE. In 1999 alone, appliance standards saved the equivalent of the total annual energy consumption of more than three million American households. Four pending appliance standards (clothes washers, fluorescent light ballasts, water heaters, and central air conditioners) are expected to save consumers more than $10 billion and reduce cumulative emissions by 22 MMTCE through 2010. Based on one study, the ENERGY STAR label is recognized by 30 percent of the American public. At of the close of 1999, more than 1,200 manufacturers were producing 7,000 product models with the ENERGY STAR label in 31 consumer product categories, and the public had purchased 380 million ENERGY STAR products to date. The list of products is continuing to grow. Recent additions include DVD players, CD players, and compact fluorescent light bulbs.  Helping Low-Income Families Save Energy The Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP) provides energy-efficiency services to lowincome families and individuals who might not otherwise have access to energy-saving technologies. Created in 1976, WAP focuses on households with elderly members, persons with disabilities, and children. Since the program's inception, WAP has retrofitted almost 5 million homes, saving an estimated  18   7 MMTCE annually. In 2001, the Federal government expects to provide state grants to weatherize 74,751 homes, saving 110,000 MMTCE annually and $1.80 in energy costs for every $1.00 invested over the life of the measures.  ""Newmark Homes joined the ENERGY STAR homes program because, like our consumers, we feel that energy efficiency is important. We wanted our energy -efficiency program to be . . . several notches above our competitors, and being an ENERGY STAR builder guarantees that goal."" Mick Beckett Senior Vice President Newmark Homes  19   Electricity   Chapter 3. Electricity  R  educing greenhouse gas emissions from the electricity sector is a national priority in the United States. U.S. climate efforts in this area include improving the efficiency of electricity  generation, substituting lower carbon fuels and carbon-free renewables, reducing the demand for electricity through greater end-use efficiency, and restructuring the electric power industry. At the Federal level, these efforts are being accomplished through a variety of voluntary partnerships. In addition, Federal funding is sponsoring research and development of promising low- or no-emission technologies for generating electricity from fossil power, hydroelectric power, wind power, solar power, biomass gasification, nuclear power, and geothermal heat pumps. The U.S. private sector is also demonstrating its leadership and environmental stewardship with initiatives such as the Green Power Market Development Group, a group of 11 major corporations that is exploring a variety of green energy options. (See page 22.) Electric utilities account for approximately 29 percent of U.S. emissions and are, collectively, the single largest source of the nation's greenhouse gases. Carbon dioxide (CO2), a byproduct of the combustion of fossil fuels, accounts for the majority of the sector's emissions, but methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) also are emitted during the generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity. Carbon-free technologies such as nuclear energy, hydroelectric, and other renewables, supply 30 percent of the electricity produced in the United States while generating almost no greenhouse gas emissions. If these sources were not available, greenhouse gas emissions would be greater by at least 250 million metric tons of carbon (MMTCE) each year.  21   U nit ed St at es: Domes t ic Pr o gres s on Climat e Change Growing Green Power A prime example of leadership by example in the corporate world is the Green Power Market Development Group (GPMDG), which was organized in May 2000 to support the development of green energy markets in the United States. The members, a number of private corporations not directly involved with the electric utility industry, are exploring a variety of green energy purchase opportunities to identify those that are cost-competitive. This is a long-term process with companies hoping to support market development over a 10-year period. As members of t he GPMDG, 11 major U.S. businesses are working wit h t he World Resources Institute and Business for Social Responsibility to purchase 1,000 megawatts of new green energy capacity and otherwise provide support to the development of green energy markets. The GPMDG believes that such markets are essential to provide competitively priced energy that also protects the Earth's climate and reduces conventional air pollutants. Corporate members of the group include Alcoa, Cargill-Dow, Delphi, DuPont, General Motors, IBM, Interface, Johnson & Johnson, Kinko's, Or acle, and Pitney Bowes. Together, these companies account for about 7 percent of industrial energy use in the United States.  Electricity Sector Restructuring A core element of President Clinton's climate change program involves restructuring the electricity industry in a manner that will reduce greenhouse gas emissions while cutting consumers' energy bills. The Administration's restructuring proposal involves using market forces to obtain the greatest amount of energy from each unit of fuel. Most states have restructuring activities underway. The President's proposal also calls for a Renewable Portfolio Standard to increase the use of electricity from non-hydro renewable sources to at least 7.5 percent of sales by 2010. It also provides for a Public Benefits Fund of $3 billion per year, some of which will be used to spur greater investment in energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies. This plan is projected to reduce carbon emissions by roughly 40 to 60 million MMTCE in 2010 while saving consumers at least $20 billion per year on their electricity bills. The plan is now under consideration by the U.S. Congress.  ""We have a corporate goal of 10 percent of our energy supply from renewable sources. We're excited about participating in [the Green Power Market Development Group] because we hope it will help us to meet that commitment."" Paul Tebo Vice President for Safety, Health and Environment DuPont  Bioenergy Biomass is plant matter such as trees, grasses, agricultural crops, and other material derived from living matter that can be used as a solid fuel or converted into liquid or gaseous fuels to supply electricity, heating, transportation, and other energy markets.  22   Switchgrass to Reduce Coal Emissions Switchgrass once grew abundantly in southern Iowa's rolling hills. The Chariton Valley Biomass Project, which was initiated in 1996, is evaluating the possibility of growing switchgrass on marginal land as a biomass crop to replace a portion of the coal burned at a local generating station. A public-private initiative that is expected to be complete in 2004, the Chariton project is also looking at the economic benefits of growing switchgrass as a profitable alternative to row crops. Other benefits include the fact that the plant's massive root system sequesters carbon and filters pesticides and herbicides. One of the project's additional goals is to ensure minimal Next to hydropower, more electricity is generated from biomass than from any other renewable energy resource in the United States. The 37 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity produced each year from biomass are more than the entire state of Colorado uses annually.  or no effect on wildlife when harvesting occurs. Co-firing 5 percent switchgrass with coal can reduce emissions by almost 44,000 MTCE per year.  On August 12, 1999, President Clinton issued Executive Order 13134 on Bioproducts and Bioenergy, coordinating Federal efforts to accelerate biobased technologies to convert sustainably grown crops, trees, and other biomass into fuels, power, and products. The goal is to triple U.S. use of bioproducts and bioenergy by 2010. Meeting this goal could create $15 to $20 billion in new income for farmers and rural America, and reduce annual greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 100 MMTCE--the equivalent of taking more than 70 million cars off the road. In addition to aggressively sponsoring bioenergy, this initiative supported the development of the world's first efficient, low-pressure biomass gasifier capable of producing a high-quality fuel. The gasifier, which is operating in Vermont, can convert 200 tons of solid biomass per day into a clean-burning gas with an energy content that is high enough for electricity generation. In addition to providing clean energy (with extremely low emissions of SOx and NOx), gasifiers increase the number and types of biomass fuels suitable for power systems. Another promising avenue being pursued is co-firing biomass with coal. Co-firing involves substitut-  Vermont biomass gassification plant 23   U nit ed St at es: Domes t ic Pr o gres s on Climat e Change From Brownfields to Brightfields The New Center for Green Industry in Chicago, Illinois, is an alliance between t he City of Chicago, Commonwealt h Edison, t he Spire Corporation, and the U.S. government. The goal is to develop one of the city's brownfields by building a factory for manufacturing solar panels and constructing a solar energy system that will supply some of the company's electricity needs and serve as a demonstration site. The project will create 100 jobs in Chicago in manufacturing and supporting industries when the plant opens in the winter of 2000. The New Center for Green Industry solar systems will produce more than 22 million kilowatts of power annually and spare the region's air almost 3,093 MTCE over the next five years. The plant will produce enough panels to meet local solar demand, and local production will lead to cost reductions for consumers in the region in addition to stimulating the market for photovoltaics. ing biomass for a portion of coal in an existing power plant furnace. It is the most economic near-term option for introducing new biomass power generation. Compared to the coal it replaces, biomass reduces SO2, NOx, and net greenhouse gas emissions. There is little or no loss in efficiency from adding biomass, which allows the energy in biomass to be converted to electricity with the high efficiency (in the 33-37 percent range) of a modern coal-fired power plant. By the year 2010, the potential market for biomass power systems could approach 10,000 megawatts--enough electricity for 10 million households. (For more on bioenergy, see Chapter 4, Transportation, and Chapter 5, Agriculture and Forestry.)  Distributed Energy Utility restructuring, emerging technology, environmental concerns, and an expanding electricity market are important drivers facilitating the emergence of distributed generation as an important new energy option. Public-private partnerships such as the Distributed Energy Resources program offer the promise of producing electricity in a fundamentally different way through a dispersed fleet of small-scale electric generators providing power at or near customer sites to meet specific needs. The power also is to be produced near the grid to support economic operation of existing power stations. Mostly fueled by natural gas, liquid fuels, or renewables, these dispersed generation resources can bypass congested portions of the electric transmission and distribution system. On-site cogenerated electricity and heat production, for example, can allow consumers to use the heat byproduct of electricity production, saving dollars as well as reducing primary energy loads. Distributed systems include combined cooling, heat, and power systems, biomass-based generators, combustion turbines, concentrating solar power and photovoltaic systems,  24   Leading the Way with CHP Malden Mills, a fabric manufacturer in Lawrence, Massachusetts, installed a cogeneration system to replace generating and heating equipment destroyed in a fire. When completed, the combined heat and power system-- developed with the assistance of the Advanced Turbine Systems (ATS) program--will lower the company's annual energy costs and reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide by 99.6 percent, NOx by 83 percent, and CO2 by 26 percent compared with grid-supplied power. fuel cells, microturbines, engines/generator sets, and wind turbines storage and control technologies. launched the Combined Heat and Power Challenge program with the goal of doubling U.S. combined heat and power capacity by 2010. By substituting 46 gigawatt of CHP capacity for conventional capacity, annual greenhouse emissions will be reduced by 30 MMTCE and annual NOx emissions by hundreds of thousands of tons. Recent analyses have concluded that this goal can be achieved through electric utility restructuring and modifications to tax policy and air regulations.  Combined Heat and Power The U.S. government is actively supporting research, development, and deployment of combined heat and power (CHP) systems. Combined heat and power systems generate electricity and capture waste heat and use it to heat and cool buildings, or provide steam in industrial processes. The use of waste heat results in total system efficiencies of 70 to 90 percent--a considerable performance gain over the 33 percent average efficiency of conventional central electricity generating plants.

Toward this end, the U.S. government's solar energy program is providing support for research by world-class scientists and engineers in industry, universities, and the national laboratories. Over the past 20 years, Federal support for Photovoltaic Energy Systems R&D has resulted in a 90 percent reduction in the cost of producing electricity from photovoltaics (PV). As a result, between 1994 and 1998, energy produced by PV modules more than doubled, growing from 26 megawatts in 1994 to more than 61 megawatts in 1998. The lowest-cost solar power option available today is Parabolic Trough technology. These systems use curved mirrors to focus sunlight on a receiver pipe. Parabolic-trough technology is being used in California's Mojave Desert at nine power plants that sell their power to the local utility, Southern California Edison. The plants, which total 354 megawatts of installed capacity, generate enough power to meet the needs of approximately 500,000 people with no emissions of greenhouse gases. President Clinton's Million Solar Roofs initiative seeks to place solar energy systems on one million roofs by 2010. To date, commitments for one million systems have been made, and more than 100,000 have been installed, indicating the potential for widespread market penetration of solar technologies. The President's Climate Change Technology Initiative includes $132 million in proposed tax credits over five years to support this program. Meeting the initiative's 2010 goals will reduce carbon emissions by an amount equivalent to removing 850,000 automobiles from the roads. The U.S. government's Brightfields initiative, launched in 1999, is aimed at using abandoned industrial sites--known as brownfields--for producing pollution-free solar  Catching Rays by the Lake The Dangling Rope Marina, on the northern shore of Glen Canyon's Lake Powell in the state of Utah, is a popular rest stop for travelers and tourists. The facility was once run using a power system that consumed about 65,000 gallons of diesel fuel annually. To find a greener alternative, several private and public organizations teamed up on a $1.5-million renewable energy project. In 1996, the marina replaced the old diesel power system with a new 115-kilowatt photovoltaics-hybrid system wit h 384 PV panels. During the new system's 20-year operating life, it is expected to save as much as $2.3 million in energy costs while dramatically reducing greenhouse gas emissions and other pollutants. The project at Dangling Rope Marina on Lake Powell is just one example of more than 30 U.S. government projects in 15 states that are producing electricity from photovoltaics.  26   A New ""Crop"" Sweeps the Plains Since 1998 more than 260 megawatts of new wind generating capacity have been installed on farmlands in the Great Plains region of the United States. This new capacity is not only helping to satisfy the growing demand for clean electricity, it is also generating benefits in the form of substantial economic gains for farmers, landowners, and local communities. Wind farming creates construction and service jobs in rural regions and provides a new source of income for U.S. farmers, Native Americans, and other rural landowners, as well as a new source of tax revenues for local municipalities. One example is the Lake Benton Wind Power Plant, which was the world's largest wind-generation facility when it was completed in 1998 by Enron Wind Corpor ation. This 107megawatt plant can generate enough electricity to power 43,000 homes. The facility displaces greenhouse gases equivalent to removing 50,000 new cars and light trucks from the road. energy. Currently, Brightfields projects are underway in cities across the United States, including Chicago, Miami, New Haven, and San Diego. The Brightfields model has proven extremely successful: Redeveloping brownfield sites with solar energy manufacturing benefits local communities through economic development and environmental protection.  Wind Power In the 1990s, wind power was the world's fastest growing source of energy. Worldwide, wind-generating capacity grew 36 percent (3,600 megawatts) in 1999, bringing global wind-generating capacity to 13,400 megawatts. In the United States, more than 700 megawatts of new capacity was added, representing a 41 percent increase in capacity. The U.S. wind industry is completing the research, testing, and field verification needed to develop fully advanced wind energy technologies that lead the world in costeffectiveness and reliability. The U.S. government's Wind Energy Systems program was established to develop advanced wind turbine technologies capable of reducing the cost of wind energy to 2.5 cents per kilowatt-hour (in 15 mile-per-hour winds).  The Million Solar Roofs initiative seeks to place solar energy systems on one million roofs. 27   U nit ed St at es: Domes t ic Pr o gres s on Climat e Change Wind: New Cash Crop for the 21st Centur y 1979: 40 cents/kWh Another Federal initiative, Wind Powering America, was announced in June 1999 with a goal of supplying 5 percent of U.S. electricity through wind technologies by 2020. Meeting this goal will avoid greenhouse gas emissions of more than 30 MMTCE.  2000: 4-6 cents/kWh  Geothermal Power Geothermal heat pump (GHP) technology extracts heat from the ground during the heating season and discharges waste heat into the earth during the cooling season. The Geothermal Heat Pump Consortium (GHPC) is a partnership working to inform the public about the technology and to expand the GHP market in the United States. GHPs can reduce energy consumption and corresponding emissions by 63 to 72 percent when compared with electric resistance heating using standard air-conditioning equipment. In addition, GHPs reduce peak demands. For that reason, some electric utilities offer special financing, rebates, or electric rates for customers who use GHPs. Approximately 400,000 GHPs are in use today for heating and cooling of residential, commercial, and institutional buildings throughout the United States. Savings from GHP units installed between 1995 and 1998 are estimated to be $29 to $39 million. The growth target of the GHPC and the Federal government is to install 2 million GHPs by the year 2005. Achieving this goal will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by about 1.2 MMTCE per year. In January of 2000, the public-private GeoPowering the West partnership was launched to increase dramatically the use of geothermal energy in the western United States. The goals are to convert 10 percent of electricity use in the western states to geothermal energy by 2020, increase the number of homes using geothermal energy to seven million by 2010, and double the number of states with geothermal facilities to eight by 2008. The benefits will include 20 MMTCE displaced in 2020.  2007: 2- 4 cents/kWh  s Increased turbine size s R&D advances s Manufacturing improvements Source: U.S. Department of Energy  Green Technology Invades the Army In 1994 Fort Polk, Louisiana, adapted 4,003 U.S. Army housing units to use geothermal heat pump (GHP) energy. The resulting energy savings are extraordinary. Fort Polk achieved a reduction of 43 percent or 7.5 megawatts of peak summer load and improved its load factor from 52 percent to 62 percent. In addition, service calls on hot summer days dropped from 90 per day to virtually none, testifying to the reliability of GHP systems. The U.S. Army saved about 22 percent compared with previous maintenance costs. The Fort Polk project received Vice President Gore's ""Hammer Award"" for ""hammering away at building a better government""-- one that works better and costs less.  28   Geothermal: Heat and Power for the 21st Centur y 1985: 15-16 cents/kWh  tance of the new technology. As a result, benefits will not begin to accrue until 2015 but will be quite substantial by 2030. Deployment of the new coal and gas systems in the United States is expected to yield reductions of 5 MMTCE by 2015 and 75 MMTCE by 2030.  2000: 5-8 cents/kWh  Nuclear Power Nuclear energy provides approximately 20 percent of all U.S. generated electricity, and its continued role in electricity production is important for our economic and energy security. The Administration's policy focuses on the safety of existing reactors, advancing nuclear power plant designs, and safe longterm storage of spent nuclear fuel. Three programs are implementing these policies. The Nuclear Energy Plant Optimization Program (NEPO) is applying new technologies to increase plant life, reliability, availability, and productivity. The Nuclear Energy Research Initiative (NERI) is researching breakthroughs in nuclear fission and reactor technology. Generation IV Nuclear Power Systems is developing the next generation of reactors that are more economic, resistant to proliferation, produce less waste, and have improved safety features.  2007: 3-5 cents/kWh  s More industry experience s Improved drilling technology s Economies of scale s Reduced cost of finance Source: U.S. Department of Energy  Advanced Technologies for Fossil Fuels The U.S. government sponsors a number of R&D programs to develop more efficient generating technologies and high-efficiency coal-fired generating plants. The U.S. government's new Power Systems Program is developing more efficient coal and natural gas power generating technologies that can produce power with about 40 percent fewer carbon emissions than conventional technologies using those fuels. The program will result in ""power-plexes"" that can use multiple feedstock materials (coal, gas, biomass, and opportunity fuels like petroleum coke) to produce a slate of market-relevant energy products, including electricity, steam, chemicals, and alternative fuels. Research is now underway on combining power-plexes with carbon sequestration in geological formations. The research itself will require a little over a decade to complete, followed by a period for market accep-  Hydropower Hydropower currently generates about 10 percent of the nation's electricity. Maintaining existing hydropower generation, however, is at risk due to a mix of environmental, regulatory, and economic pressures. The Federal government is supporting the development of advanced technology that will allow the nation to maximize the use of hydropower resources while minimizing adverse environmental impacts. The main focus is on the development of a ""fish-friendly turbine"" that will decrease fish mortality to 2 percent, compared with the current 5 to 30 percent mortality.  29   U nit ed St at es: Domes t ic Pr o gres s on Climat e Change Utilities Reducing Emissions Now Climate Challenge is a voluntary effort between the Federal government and the electric utility industry for identifying and implementing cost-effective activities to reduce, avoid, or sequester greenhouse gases. Currently, Climate Challenge's partner utilities number more than 600 and represent 71 percent of 1990 U.S. carbon emissions from electricity generation. Utilities estimate t hat pledged Climate Challenge actions will reduce emissions by as much as 47 MMTCE in 2000  Superconductors High-temperature superconductors (HTS) conduct electricity with high efficiency and very little loss when cooled to liquid nitrogen temperatures. A Superconductivity Partnership Initiative (SPI) stands at the forefront of worldwide efforts to advance research and development of high-temperature superconducting power equipment for energy transmission, distribution, and industrial use. Among the accomplishments of the partnership is a new industrial HTS motor that is smaller, lighter, and more efficient than conventional motors. Other applications include current controllers that protect utility equipment, improve reliability, and increase stability of the distribution grid, and underground transmission cables that can double the power capacity of current technology. The potential global market for HTS products by the year 2020 might reach as high as $100 billion, saving 5 MMTCE in 2015 and 9 MMTCE by 2030.  SF6 Emissions The SF6 Emissions Reduction Partnership for Electric Power Systems, initiated in early 1999, provides a forum for the electric power industry to work together with the U.S. government to reduce SF6 emissions to technically and economically feasible levels. SF6, a gaseous dielectric used in circuit breakers, gas-insulated substations, and switchgear, allows for the safe transmission and distribution of electricity. As of May 2000, 58 electric utility companies had joined the partnership. (See Chapter 1, Industry.)  State and Local Initiatives in the Electricity Sector One goal of GeoPowering the West partnership is to double the number of states with geothermal facilities to eight by 2008. Many state and local governments have initiated their own programs to address climate change issues. Programs in Oregon, Idaho, and California are highlighted here.  30   Ambitious Goals--Flexible Means According to an Oregon law enacted in 1997 and updated in 2000, energy facility developers may choose from several options to meet the CO2 emission standards. These include building high-efficiency facilities using cogeneration, providing offset projects that avoid, reduce, or sequester CO2 emissions, or paying a fee of $2.30 per MTCE. A developer using the ""monetary path"" must provide funds to the Climate Trust, an independent, nonprofit organization that qualifies under the statutory requirements to receive offset funds and acquire CO2 offsets. In 1997 California created a Renewable Resources Trust Fund, administered by the California Energy Commission, with the purpose of promoting renewable generation and developing a strong consumer market for renewable energy. The law authorizes the collection of $540 million from investorowned utilities to be used as incentives or rebates for buyers, users, producers, and promoters of renewable energy in the state. The fund provides financial incentives for 10 million megawatt-hours of renewable power per year, equating to a reduction of approximately 1.6 MMTCE of greenhouse gases, along with 140 metric tons of SO2 and 1,727 metric tons of NOx, if the electricity were generated via conventional means.  Design for a high-efficiency facility in Klamath, Oregon In 1997 Oregon enacted legislation that authorizes the state's Energy Facility Siting Council to set CO2 Emission Standards for New Energy Facilities. Facilities for which the council has set standards include base-load plants, non-base load (peaking) plants, and nongenerating energy facilities. The standard for base-load gas plants requires a net emissions rate of 0.675 pounds of CO2 per kilowatthour, which is 17 percent below the most efficient plant in operation in the United States in 1999. Geothermal energy has been used in Idaho to provide heat and water since 1892. Following the energy crisis of the mid-1970s, geothermal heating gained recognition as a viable alternative to petroleum-based energy generation. To ensure the sustainability of this resource, the Idaho Department of Water Resources created the Boise Front Low Temperature Geothermal Resource Ground Water Management Area. Cur rently, the ground water management area has geothermal projects at four locations, and the projects are saving an estimated 50.4 gigawatt-hours of electricity per year, which equates to an annual cost savings of $1 million.  31   T r anspor tation   Chapter 4. Transpor tation  important breakthroughs in the development of new more fuel-efficient vehicles. Among these were the unveiling of diesel-battery hybrid concept cars that are capable of traveling 70-90 miles per gallon (gasoline-equivalent) and commitments to more fuel-efficient Sport Utility Vehicles (SUVs). Many of these breakthroughs depend on technology developed, at least in part, with the Federal government through the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles (PNGV). In 2000 a new partnership, the 21st Century Truck Initiative, was launched to develop heavy trucks aimed at doubling--and, in most cases, tripling--the fuel economy of U.S. trucks. The Federal government also is seeking to lead by example by revamping its procurement policies to help stimulate markets in more fuel-efficient and alternative fuel vehicles. For example, the Administration recently issued an Executive Order that requires Federal agencies to reduce annual gasoline and diesel fuel consumption by at least 20 percent by the end of 2005. At the state and local levels, governments are implementing a host of programs directed toward reducing transportation sector emissions by motivating consumer interest in fuel-efficient vehicles and promoting development patterns that reduce transportation demand and increase transit, bicycle, and pedestrian access.  T  he United States is pursuing an array of strategies to reduce transportation-related greenhouse gas emissions. In 2000, the ""big three"" U.S. automakers all announced a number of  33   U nit ed St at es: Domes t ic Pr o gres s on Climat e Change Accounting for 32 percent of all U.S. emissions, the transportation sector is the second largest and fastest growing source of greenhouse gases. Collectively, passenger cars and light-duty trucks contribute 58 percent of all of the sector's greenhouse gas emissions, and heavy-duty trucks contribute another 16 percent. Other sources--aviation, marine, recreational vehicles, rail, and farm equipment-- account for the remaining greenhouse gas emissions.  New diesel-battery hybrid vehicles achieve 70 to 90 miles per gallon.  ""Now is the time to lead the world in the emerging market for more fuel-efficient vehicles of all kinds."" Vice President Al Gore April 2000  Revving Up Hybrid Vehicle Incentives On May 11, 2000, Mar yland Governor Parris Glendening signed into law a new package of tax incentives for energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies. The Clean Energy Incentive Act is structured to increase the state's market for advanced technologies that save energy or generate electricity from renewable sources. Among the specific provisions included in this legislation is a $2,000 reduction in the state titling taxes for buyers of new electric or qualified hybrid vehicles.  Fuel-Efficient Trucks The 21st Century Truck Initiative is a 10-year research and development partnership that was announced by Vice President Gore in April 2000. This initiative between the U.S. government and corporate partners will seek to increase the fuel economy of four classes of vehicles that, together, account for more than 90 percent of all fuel used by U.S. trucks. The program's cost-share investments in advanced technologies will lead, within 10 years, to production prototypes that will do the following: s Triple the fuel economy (measured in tonmiles/gallon) of heavy pickups, large delivery vans, and full-sized passenger buses (relative to today's comparable vehicles). s Double fuel economy of 18 wheeler longhaul trucks. s Improve safety (technologies will be designed to cut truck fatalities in half). s Achieve superior operational performance and lower costs for truckers. s Exceed expected emission requirements for 2010 (likely to be much more stringent than today's standards).  34   Fuel-Savvy Sedans The Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles (PNGV) is a major 10-year research and development program to develop revolutionary new technologies that could triple the fuel economy (and cut carbon dioxide emissions by 67 percent) of midsize family sedans. PNGV aims to meet this stretch fuel economy goal as well as stringent criteria emissions standards by 2004 without sacrificing performance, safety, aesthetics, or affordability. In 2000, the program achieved an important milestone when each of the participating automakers introduced concept cars that go a long way toward meeting the program's visionary goals: s General Motors introduced the Precept diesel-battery hybrid vehicle, which achieves 90 mpg using diesel fuel (equivalent to 80 mpg using gasoline). s Ford Motor Company introduced the Prodigy diesel-battery hybrid, which gets about 80 mpg using diesel fuel or the equivalent of 70 mpg with gasoline. s Daimler-Chrylser introduced the ESX3 diesel-battery hybrid, which achieves more than 70 mpg in gasoline equivalent. To further promote the development of a market for advanced technology vehicles, the Administration has proposed a federal income tax credit of up to $3,000 per vehicle for consumers who purchase hybrid vehicles that meet certain design criteria. This proposal has been introduced in the U.S. Congress.  a target city fuel economy of 40 mpg. The Escape is slated for introduction to the market in 2003. In July 2000, Ford also announced that, between 2000 and 2005, it will voluntarily commit to improve the average fuel economy of its SUVs by 25 percent. s In August 2000, General Motors announced that a hybrid version of its Silverado/Sier ra full-size pickup will be offered to consumers in 2004. The new vehicle is expected to be at least 15 percent more fuel-efficient than the company's conventional version. GM further announced that it intends to be the industry leader on overall fuel economy for light trucks in 2005. Preliminary estimates by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency indicate that these commitments could result in cumulative emissions reductions of up to 100 MMTCE through 2020. In addition, Daimler-Chrysler announced that, if the Federal government offers tax incentives to make the vehicle cost-effective, it is prepared to bring out a hybrid version of its Dodge Durango SUV that would be 20 percent more fuel-efficient than its current model.  Other Advances in the U.S. Automobile Market Two Japanese automakers recently introduced advanced technology vehicles into the U.S. market, setting the stage for further progress in reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the U.S. transportation sector. s Honda introduced Insight, a gasoline-battery hybrid, in 1999. The Honda Insight offers fuel economy ratings of 61 mpg city and 70 mpg highway. Honda plans to sell approximately 6,500 of the cars during 2000. s Toyota introduced Prius, a compact, gasoline-battery hybrid, in August 2000. Toyota anticipates that the Prius, with fuel economy ratings of 45 mpg city  More Fuel-Efficient SUVs Recently, U.S. automakers announced a series of commitments to improving the fuel efficiency of SUVs: s In April 2000, Ford Motor Company announced production plans for the gasoline-battery hybrid Escape, a small SUV, with  35   U nit ed St at es: Domes t ic Pr o gres s on Climat e Change Brewing Motor Fuel in Louisiana Ground was broken for the first commercial biomass-to -et hanol plant in October 1998 in Jennings, Louisiana. BC International Corporation will use a patented, genetically engineered microorganism in its process of converting organic material to ethanol, a form of alcohol used as clean-burning motor fuel. The ethanol produced by the Jennings plant is expected to displace almost 0.5 million barrels of imported oil annually. The U.S. government invested $11 million to help with the retrofit of an existing industrial site in Jennings. The total renovation cost is estimated to be $90 million, for which the private sector is providing about 88 percent of the total capital investment. and 52 mpg highway will achieve sales on the order of 1,000 cars per month. In addition, Honda announced plans to offer a fuel cell vehicle in 2003.  Putting Clean Vehicles on the Streets Over the past six years, nearly 80 communities across the country have joined the Clean Cities program. This voluntary, locally based, public-private partnership is accelerating the deployment of alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs) and building local AFV fueling infrastructure that can supply alcohol fuels, liquefied petroleum gas, electricity, and natural gas. The Clean Cities program counts among its successes approximately 170,000 AFVs in both public and private fleets, plus more than 4,000 alternative fuel refueling stations. In 1999, these vehicles and alternative fuels displaced approximately 170 million gallons of gasoline and diesel fuel and 310,000 MTCE.  Powering Vehicle Fleets with Biodiesel A blend of 20 percent biodiesel (an alternative motor fuel produced from renewable resources such as vegetable oil or animal fats) and 80 percent diesel fuel is referred to as B20. A one-year demonstration at a U.S. government research center in Beltsville, Mar yland, began August 1999. Currently, all 64 diesel-powered vehicles on the east side of the facility use the B20 fuel blend. The vehicles include pick-up trucks, tractors, ride-on lawnmowers, and a compost turner. Fuel blending is achieved on-site in underground storage tanks, and no engine conversion is required to use B20. Replacing petroleum diesel with B20 reduces carbon dioxide emissions 16 percent. B20 also reduces emissions of carbon monoxide (13 percent), particulate matter (18 percent), and sulfates (20 percent)-- three pollutants that pose health risks in certain areas of the nation.  Leading by Example with Federal Fleets On April 21, 2000, President Clinton signed Executive Order 13149, Greening the Government through Federal Fleet and Transportation Efficiency. By the end of Fiscal Year 2005, all Federal agencies operating 20 or more motor vehicles within the United States must implement a strategy for reducing their entire fleet's annual petroleum consumption by at least 20 percent, relative to FY 1999 petroleum consumption levels. The Executive Order further directs the agencies to establish fleets by 2005 that use alternative fuels a majority of the time. In addition, agencies must increase the average fuel economy rating of their light-duty vehicle acquisitions by at least 1 mile per gallon (mpg) by 2002 and 3 mpg by 2005. They are required to explore a variety of other approaches to reducing fuel consumption, such as substituting cars for light-duty trucks, increasing vehicle load factors, and reducing vehicle miles traveled.  36   By reducing America's consumption of petroleum by some 14 million gallons and reducing greenhouse gas emissions by an amount equal to 160,000 MTCE, greening the Federal fleet will enhance U.S. energy security and reap significant environmental benefits.  Developing Cleaner Fuels In 1999, President Clinton issued the Executive Order that accelerates federal efforts to develop bioproducts and bioenergy. In the transportation sector, program goals include the development of low-cost biomass feedstocks and cost-competitive conversion technologies for producing liquid fuel from agricultural residues, forestry wastes, and energy crops. Since biofuels produce almost no net carbon on a life cycle basis, they are a promising supply side option for reducing carbon emissions in transportation. Through 1998, the use of ethanol blends in gasoline is estimated to have displaced 1.2 quads of oil-based fuels (worth $12 billion), thereby reducing carbon emissions by as much as 4 MMTCE. If Federal biofuels goals are met by 2010, annual emission reductions from using clean fuels will approach 3.4 MMTCE. Through the Ultra Clean Transportation Fuels Program, U.S. government offices are researching near-term petroleum-based transportation fuel options, intermediate options that are based on petroleum and other fossil fuel feedstocks, and long-term options for renewable fuels such as biofuels. Through the Hydrogen Research Program, the Federal government is accelerating advances in producing low-cost hydrogen production and storage systems--prerequisites to the widespread use of hydrogen as a fuel. Given the recent demonstration of high-performance Proton Exchange Membrane fuel cell systems by Daimler-Chrysler, Ford Motor Company, and other companies, hydrogen  On April 21, 2000, President Clinton signed two Executive Orders aimed at reducing pollution generated by Federal f leet vehicles and Federal commuting. has the potential to create niche fuel markets in the near future.  Commuter Choice Benefits Package The Federal government's Commuter Choice Leadership Initiative, launched in 2000, encourages employers to offer a broad range of commuting options to their employees as part of company benefits packages. Some of the options include teleworking, carpooling and vanpooling services, transit vouchers, and cash in lieu of parking spaces. In support of the Commuter Choice Leadership Initiative, the U.S. government is launching a partnership program with employers with the goal of achieving partnerships with 500 businesses by the end of 2002 and 1,000 businesses by the end of 2003. On April 21, 2000, President Clinton signed Executive Order 13150, Federal Workforce Transportation, which will reduce Federal employees' contribution to traffic congestion and air pollution. This order directs that Federal agencies in the Washington, D.C., area offer their employees up to $65 per month in transit and vanpool benefits. As part of the President's recently announced Livability Agenda, the Administration is increasing substantially the investment in trans-  37   U nit ed St at es: Domes t ic Pr o gres s on Climat e Change Intel-igent Commuting The Intel Corporation's comprehensive and aggressively promoted RideShare program is a model for companies nationwide. The program promotes the use of transit, biking, walking, skating, and telecommuting. Participation is encouraged at Intel's facilities in Arizona, California, New Mexico, Oregon, and Washington. By taking the initiative in promoting transportation alternatives, Intel has reduced traffic congestion in the communities where its facilities are located. The program provides preferential parking for carpools and vanpools, free or subsidized access to transit, and shuttles to and from transit and between Intel facilities. In addition, employees are encouraged to work from home or switch to compressed schedules to reduce the number of their commutes. Employee response has been remarkable. Forty percent of t he employees in Arizona and Washington and 32 percent in Santa Clara, California, participate. Collectively, these programs have avoided 20 million miles of vehicle travel and the resulting pollution. The success of Intel's RideShare program demonstrates t he influential role that major corporations can play in environmental policy and in making it easy and convenient for employees to use alternative modes of transportation. portation programs that will help reduce greenhouse gas emissions by improving transportation and land use planning, strengthening existing transportation systems, and promoting broader use of transportation alternatives. These investments include $6.1 billion for public transit.  Relieving Congestion and Reducing VMT The $1.6 billion per year Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement (CMAQ) program funds projects that reduce congestion and greenhouse gas emissions, as well as other air pollutants. Under CMAQ, the cities of Dallas and Fort Worth, Texas, converted their public sector vehicles to alternative fuels. The Philadelphia Bicycle Network designed and constructed a city-wide network of bicycle routes. New York City obtained $1.9 million in CMAQ matching funds to purchase a ferry and provide operating assistance for freight operations to remove 54,000 truck trips annually from the New York and New Jersey streets.  Mixed-Use Approach The city of Por tland, Oregon, is taking a holistic approach to reducing emissions from transportation. By developing new housing units in the central city area, the city aims to decrease the number of commuter trips by suburban dwellers. Portland officials estimate that for each 2,500 units of housing created in the downtown area, a total of 303 MTCE will be reduced. This translates into a total reduced fuel cost of $180,000 for those households.

Agriculture and Forestr y  A  gricultural activities contribute about 7 percent of all U.S. greenhouse gas emissions (not including fuel used on farms) and are sources of methane and nitrous oxide as well as car-  bon dioxide. Greenhouse gas emissions from the agriculture sector can be reduced through implementation of technologies that improve land and resource management practices; improve energy efficiency on farms, forests, and ranch lands; abate methane emissions directly from ruminant animals and manure handling; and reduce nitrous oxide emissions from soils.  Unlike other sectors of the U.S. economy, agricultural and forestry activities can also actively remove carbon from the atmosphere. In its submission to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Secretariat, August 1, 2000, the U.S. government reported that based on updated inventory data for 1997, 310 million metric tons of carbon (MMTCE) were sequestered in managed forests and 24 MMTCE on crop and grazing lands, for a total of about 18 percent of the U.S. greenhouse gas emissions for the year. Most of the carbon sequestration occurred in the forestry sector (approximately 90 percent), primarily from tree growth and forest soils.  Bioproducts and Bioenergy Scientific advances in agriculture, forestry, and other biological sciences are making bioproducts and bioenergy technically feasible and economically viable. In 1999, the President issued the Executive Order on Bioproducts and Bioenergy coordinating Federal efforts to accelerate these 21st century technologies, which can convert sustainably grown crops, trees, and other biomass into fuels, power, and products. The Administration set a goal of tripling U.S. use of bioproducts and bioenergy by 2010. Meeting this goal could create $15 to $20 billion in new income for farmers, forest landowners, and rural America, and reduce annual greenhouse gas emissions by 100 MMTCE--the equivalent of taking more than 70 million cars off the road. (See also Chapter 3, Electricity, and Chapter 4, Transportation.) Complementing the President's Executive Order is the Biomass Research and Development Act, signed on June 20, 2000. The Act authorizes $49 million in funding and establishes a technical advisory committee and agency board to coordinate activities related to biobased products and bioenergy. The U.S. government's Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) will accelerate commercial investment in innovative bioproduct and bioenergy technologies by providing up to $100 million in FY 2000 and up to $150  41   U nit ed St at es: Domes t ic Pr o gres s on Climat e Change Biotechnologies: Real Products, Real Applications A number of biobased products are already on the market. For example: s U.S. government scientists married cornstarch to a synthetic chemical to create a product so thirsty, it can absorb 2,000 times its own weight in water. The absorbent compound, called SuperSlurper, is used as an electrical conductor in batteries, as well as fuel filters, baby powders, and wound dressings. Superabsorbents are now a $2 billion per year market. s Xanthan gum is a natural polymer fermented from glucose, by the action of a microorganism, Xanthomonas campestris. A small amount of the gum is sufficient to turn a free-flowing liquid into a viscous solution, which is widely used as a thickening agent in foods and also in non-food uses. Sales of xanthan are approximately $80 million a year. s U.S. government scientists are working with Lambent Technologies Corpor ation of Norcross, Georgia, to develop new biodegradable hydraulic fluids made from oil seeds such as soybeans and sunflowers. This new lubricant has t he industrial quality and performance characteristics of current petroleum-based hydraulic fluids. Many others are in the pipeline, such as the following: s Fantesk is a starch-based chemical that can replace the resins used to make particle board, reducing or eliminating formaldehyde emissions, making the product safer for the consumer and the environment. s Hypoallergenic latex made from the domestic guayule plant could have a significant impact on the $3.1 billion U.S. latex glove market. Guayule, a native plant of the desert Southwest, could stimulate economic development on Native American lands. million in FY 2001 and 2002 in incentive payments to ethanol and other bioenergy producers to expand production of biobased fuels.  Methane and Nitrous Oxide Mitigation The U.S. government also is engaged in a variety of activities directed toward reducing emissions of methane and nitrous oxide associated with agricultural production. The AgSTAR Program provides important tools, guidance, and methods to encourage the use of methane recovery (biogas) technologies at certain confined animal feeding operations. The Ruminant Livestock Efficiency Program (RLEP) promotes livestock management strategies that result in lower methane emissions per unit of milk or meat produced. In addition, many of the practices recommended by the RLEP for improving forage production remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere by storing carbon in the soil as organic matter. The Nitrogen Fertilizer Efficiency program is exploring alternative systems of nitrogen management for a variety of crops including corn, cotton, potatoes, and rice in order to reduce nitrous oxide emissions.  Carbon Sequestration Carbon sinks will play a critical role in helping the world meet the challenge of climate change. Significant gains in carbon sequestration and environmental co-benefits can be made through improved management of our forest resources. Research priorities include developing forestry practices that conserve soil carbon; increasing the potential for soils, forests, and forest products to sequester carbon; developing sustainable biomass production and management systems; and improving forest carbon inventory and accounting systems. The U.S. government has begun to analyze the net carbon effects of various conservation and environmental programs and to determine how they can be enhanced  42   to foster greater sequestration. Below are descriptions of some of these programs. From its inception in 1985, the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) has planted 3.5 million acres (1.4 million hectares) of trees on cropland. The entire 36.4 million acres enrolled in the CRP is estimated to be sequestering 11.3 MMTCE per year. Additional benefits from eliminating nitrogen fertilizer applications have been estimated at 1.8 MMTCE per year. The Wetlands Reserve Program (WRP) offers private landowners financial incentives to restore wetlands in exchange for discontinuing the land's use for crop production. The Swampbuster program has preserved more than 5.8 million acres of wetlands that would otherwise have been converted to agricultural use. From 1991 to 1997, more than 1 million acres of trees were planted through the Forestry Incentives Program (FIP) program. Another 273,000 acres of trees were planted through the Stewardship Incentives Program (SIP) program. Research indicates that improved management of cropland soils through reduced tillage, erosion prevention, and cropping systems can sequester significant quantities of carbon. Improved management of grazing lands also can contribute significant sequestration benefits. Increasing soil organic content not only provides climate change benefits, but also improves water holding capacity, fertility, and productivity--helping soils resist erosion, keeping nutrients and pesticides from washing into water bodies, and reducing flooding.  Conser vation Practices for Storing Carbon Resource conservation practices on farms produce environmental benefits such as improving soil, water, and air quality on and off the farm. Economic benefits accrue from reducing the number and intensity of field operations, saving money, time, and labor. These practices, which also can enhance carbon storage in soil, include the following: s Using conservation tillage and no-till conservation systems s Rotating crops and incorporating small grains, hay, legumes, or other crops into rotations s Planting cover crops s Managing nutrients and irrigation efficiently and effectively s Installing permanently vegetated conservation buffers, such as windbreaks, grass waterways, filter strips, and riparian buffers s Restoring or protecting wetlands s Converting marginal agricultural land to perennial grassland or forest mate forecasts intended for a general audience to forecasts that will be specific to agriculture. The primary challenges are to apply the predictions to farms at time periods that are relevant to agricultural decision-making and to establish impacts on soil water and plant productivity. This information will provide opportunities for proactive planning to exploit favorable climate conditions and mitigate adverse climate extremes. The result will be information that can be used to determine the number of livestock that a farm can support during an upcoming season, the need for purchase of outside forage, decisions on winter wheat or other grains, fertilizer needs, and erosion protection.

U.S. Global Change Research Program  T  he U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) seeks to provide a sound scientific understanding of the human and natural forces that influence the Earth's climate system, and  thus provide a sound scientific basis for national and international decision-making on global change issues. The USGCRP seeks to observe, understand, predict, and assess the critical natural and human-induced dynamic states and trends of the Earth's global environmental systems across a wide range of time and spatial scales. This multi-agency National Research Program is overseen by the National Science and Technology Council, the Office of Science and Technology Policy, and the Office of Management and Budget.  FY 2001 Budget Highlights For FY 2001, the President is requesting $1.74 billion for the USGCRP, an increase of $41 million above the amount enacted for FY 2000. Of this, $845 million is for scientific research and improvements to surface-based monitoring. Another $897 million is for development of Earth-observing satellites and associated data systems to monitor climate change and other global changes. Important highlights include the following:  s $28 million to enhance surface-based climate observations, including creation of a climate reference network to provide for the first time automated, simultaneous, and ideally located measurements of changing temperatures, precipitation, and soil moisture. Measurements of atmospheric trace gases, aerosols, ocean temperatures, and ocean currents also will be expanded.  s $308 million for research on changes in the Earth's water cycle, which is one of the primary determinants of the Earth's climate. The launch of the EOS Aqua spacecraft in December 2000 will provide new global measurements of humidity, cloud properties, sea ice, precipitation, soil moisture, runoff, and snow to support this research.  s $224 million for research on the potential impacts of climate change and other stresses on forests, coastal areas, croplands, and other ecosystems. New studies will improve our understanding of the relationships among land cover, land use, climate, and weather, and on identifying ""thresholds"" for significant changes in ecosystems. s $229 million for the multi-agency carbon cycle science initiative begun in FY 2000. This request includes funds to study how carbon cycles between the atmosphere, the oceans, and land, and the role of farms,  45   U nit ed St at es: Domes t ic Pr o gres s on Climat e Change Objectives of the USGCRP s Determine the origins, rates, and likely future course of natural and ant hropogenic global changes. s Increase understanding of t he combined effects of multiple stresses on ecosystems. s Understand and model global environmental change and its processes on finer spatial scales and across a wide range of time scales. s Address t he potential for surprises and abrupt changes in the global environment. s Understand and assess the impacts of global environmental change and their consequences for the United States. forests, and other natural or managed lands in capturing carbon.  s $485 million for research on the Earth's climate system. This includes funds to study the interaction of long-term climate change and shorter-term patterns of climate variability, investigation of the radiative effects of clouds on climate, improving model simulations of the Earth's climate, and collection and analysis of new satellite observations of clouds, aerosols, trace gases, land surface and ocean properties, ice extent and topography, and the Earth's radiation budget. Other USGCRP-sponsored research focuses on the long-term climate record of the Earth, the human dimensions of global change, and changes in atmospheric chemistry.  The National Assessment The National Assessment of the potential consequences of climate variability and change undertaken by the USGCRP over the past several years has examined the potential ecological and socioeconomic impacts of climate change on the United States, and the degree to which particular regions and sectors of the nation are vulnerable to such change. Thus the National Assessment is providing important information to support decisions on how best to adapt and prepare for both the next few decades and the next century. In addition, the National Assessment will identify key information gaps and research needs (i.e., information that is still required to answer questions of interest to decision-makers).

However, the Administration is emphasizing the environmental benefits from reducing greenhouse gases and addressing possible global climate change. A significant expansion of energy tax incentives has been proposed as part of comprehensive energy policy reform legislation in the 107th Congress. Several energy tax issues are addressed in these bills: 1) tax incentives to increase the supply of oil and gas, and the demand for coal; 2) energy tax issues relating to energy conservation and energy efficiency; 3) energy tax issues relating to alternative fuels; 4) selected issues relating to electricity restructuring; and 5) expiring energy tax provisions. Legislative interest has focused on the House and Senate versions of H.R. 4, approved by the House on August 2, 2001, and by the Senate on April 25. The Senate Finance Committee approved energy tax bill (the Energy Tax Incentive Act of 2002) was modified somewhat and added as Amendment #2917 to the Senate's comprehensive energy policy bill (originally introduced as S. 517, the Securing America's Future Energy Act, but renamed the Energy Policy Act of 2002). President Bush has issued a comprehensive energy policy initiative, and more recently, a global climate change initiative, which include limited energy tax measures. The Bush Administration had originally criticized such measures as being inconsistent with its free market philosophy. Certain energy tax provisions that had expired were extended retroactively as part of the economic stimulus bill (P.L. 107-147).  Historically, federal energy tax policy promoted the supply of oil and gas. However, the 1970s witnessed 1) a significant cutback in the oil and gas industry's tax preferences, 2) the imposition of new excise taxes on oil, and 3) the introduction of numerous tax preferences for energy conservation, the development of alternative fuels, and the commercialization of the technologies for producing these fuels (renewables such as solar, wind, and biomass, and non-conventional fossil fuels such as shale oil and coalbed methane). The Reagan Administration, using a freemarket approach, advocated repeal of the windfall profit tax on oil and the repeal or phase-out of most energy tax preferences -- for oil and gas, as well as alternative fuels. Due to the combined effects of the Economic Recovery Tax Act and the energy tax subsidies that had not been repealed, which together created negative effective tax rates in some cases, the actual energy tax policy differed from the stated policy. The Bush and Clinton years witnessed a return to a much more activist energy tax policy, targeted, as in the 1970s, to energy conservation and alternative fuels. While the ultimate concern is to reduce the demand for imported oil, energy tax policy is being viewed as a tool for achieving environmental and fiscal objectives. The current posture of energy tax policy is weighted toward energy conservation -- particularly petroleum in transportation -- and alternative fuels supply. The Clinton Administration's energy tax policy was focused on reducing the demand for petroleum by encouraging energy efficiency and providing incentives to promote  Congressional Research Service  ~ The Library of Congress   IB10054  06-27-02  M  OST  RECENT DEVELOP  MENTS  On April 25, the Senate approved the Securing America's Future Energy Act, a substitute to the House energy bill H.R. 4. On March 9, President Bush signed the Job Creation and Worker Assistance Act of 2002 (P.L. 107-147), a $42 billion, ten-year tax cut that retroactively extends several energy tax provisions that had expired on December 31, 2001. On August 2, 2001, the House approved H.R. 4, a comprehensive energy policy bill that includes numerous energy tax incentives, which were marked up as H.R. 2511 ( the Energy Tax Policy Act of 2001) by the House Committee on Ways and Means on July 18, 2001. A conference committee is currently meeting, and is expected to last until fall to resolve differences in the two versions of H.R. 4.

Recurrent energy related problems since the 1970s  oil embargoes, oil price and supply shocks, wide petroleum price variations and price spikes, large geographical price disparities, tight energy supplies, rising oil import dependence, as well as increased concern for the environment  have caused policymakers to look toward energy taxes and subsidies with greater frequency. This issue brief discusses the history, current posture, and the outlook for federal energy tax policy. It also discusses recent energy tax proposals, focusing on the major energy tax policy reform bills in the House (H.R. 4), and Senate (S. 389, S. 596, and S. 517, the Senate approved version of H.R. 4). (For a general economic analysis of energy tax policy, see CRS Report RL30406, Energy Tax Policy: An Economic Analysis.)  Background The history of federal energy tax policy can basically be divided into four eras: the oil and gas period from 1916 to 1970, the energy crisis period of the 1970s, the free-market era of the Reagan Administration, and the post-Reagan era, including the most recent three year period since 1998  which has witnessed a plethora of energy tax proposals to address recurring energy market problems.  CRS-1   IB10054  06-27-02  Energy Tax Policy from 1918-1970: Promoting Oil and Gas Historically, federal energy tax policy was focused on increasing domestic oil and gas reserves and production; there were no tax incentives for energy conservation or for alternative fuels. Two oil/gas tax code preferences embodied this policy: 1) expensing of intangible drilling costs (IDC's) and dry hole costs, which was introduced in 1916, and 2) the percentage depletion allowance, first enacted in 1926 (coal was added in 1932). Expensing of IDC's (such as labor costs, material costs, supplies, and repairs associated with the drilling of a well) gave oil and gas producers the benefit of fully deducting from the first year's income (""writing off"") a significant portion of the total costs of bringing a well into production, costs that would otherwise (i.e., in theory and under standard, accepted tax accounting methods) be capitalized (i.e., written off during the life of the well as income is earned). For dry holes, which comprised on average about 80% of all the wells drilled, the costs were also allowed to be deducted in the year drilled (expensed) and deducted against other types of income, which led to many tax shelters that benefitted primarily high income taxpayers. Expensing accelerates tax deductions, defers tax liability, and encourages oil and gas prospecting, drilling, and the development of reserves. The percentage depletion allowance for oil and gas permitted oil and gas producers to claim 27.5% of revenue as a deduction for the cost of exhaustion or depletion of the deposit, allowing deductions in excess of capital investment (i.e, in excess of adjusted cost depletion) -- the economically neutral method of capital recovery for the extractive industries. Percentage depletion encourages faster mineral development than cost depletion (the equivalent of depreciation of plants and equipment). These and other tax subsidies discussed later (e.g., capital gains treatment of the sale of successful properties, the special exemption from the passive loss limitation rules, and special tax credits) reduced marginal effective tax rates in the oil and gas industries, reduced production costs, and increased investments in locating reserves (increased exploration). They also led to more profitable production and some acceleration of oil and gas production (increased rate of extraction), and more rapid depletion of energy resources than would otherwise occur which increases oil import dependency and reduces energy security. Such subsidies tend to channel resources into these activities that otherwise would be used for oil and gas activities abroad or for other economic activities in the United Relatively low oil prices encouraged petroleum consumption (as opposed to conservation) and inhibited the development of alternatives to fossil fuels, such as unconventional fuels and renewable forms of energy. Oil and gas production increased from 16% of total U.S. energy production in 1920 to 71.1% of total energy production in 1970 (the peak year).  Energy Tax Policy During the 1970s: Conservation and Alternative Fuels Three developments during the 1970s caused a dramatic shift in the focus of federal energy tax policy. First, large the revenue losses associated with the oil and gas tax preferences became increasingly hard to justify in the face of a progressively worsening fiscal picture  increasing federal budget deficits  and in view of the long-standing economic arguments against the special tax treatment for oil and gas. Second, heightened awareness of environmental pollution and concern for environmental degradation, and the increased CRS-2   IB10054  06-27-02  importance of distributional issues in policy formulation (i.e., equity and fairness), lost the domestic oil and gas industry much political support. Thus, it became more difficult to justify percentage depletion and other subsidies, largely claimed by wealthy individuals and big vertically-integrated oil companies. More importantly, during the 1970s there were two energy crises: the oil embargo of 1973  also known as the first oil shock  and the Iranian Revolution in 1979, which focused policymakers' attention on the problems (alleged ""failures"") in the energy markets and how these problems reverberated throughout the economy causing stagflation, shortages, productivity problems, rising import dependence, and other economic and social problems. These developments caused the increased use of fiscal subsidies or incentives  special tax credits, deduction, exclusions etc. to shift from of oil and gas supply toward energy conservation (reducing oil and gas demand) through: 1) a direct demand response (i.e., curbing energy use through higher prices, and reduced service or utility levels by reducing the number of miles driven or turning down thermostats in homes during the winter, etc.); 2)substitution of more energy-efficient for less energy-efficient technologies (i.e., reduced energy demand through an increased demand for more energy-efficient houses, vehicles, industrial equipment and other energy-using capital goods); and 3) an increased supply of alternative and renewable fuels (solar, wind, biomass, ethanol fuel, and non-conventional fossil fuels such as shale oil, and coalbed methane), and stimulating investment in, and demand for, technologies that used these alternative (such as renewable) sources of energy. Three broad actions through the tax code were taken to implement the new energy tax policy during the 1970s: First, the oil industry's two major tax preferences -- expensing of IDCs and percentage depletion -- were significantly reduced, particularly the percentage depletion allowance, which was 1) completely eliminated for the major integrated oil companies (which produce about 75% of all the oil in the United States), and 2) reduced for the remaining producers. Other oil and gas tax benefits were also cut back during this period. For example, oil-and gas-fired boilers used in steam generation (for example, to generate electricity) could no longer qualify for accelerated depreciation as a result of the Energy Tax Act of 1978 (as discussed below). The second broad policy action was the imposition of several new excise taxes on oil and gas (and later coal). Chief among these was the windfall profit tax (WPT) on oil first enacted in 1980 (P.L. 96-223). The WPT imposed an excise tax of 15% to 70% on the difference between the market price of oil and a predetermined (adjusted) base price. This tax, which was repealed in 1988, was part of a political compromise that decontrolled oil prices (between 1971 and 1980 oil prices were controlled under President Nixon's Economic Stabilization Act of 1970  the so-called ""wage-price freeze""). Another, but relatively small, excise tax on petroleum was instituted in 1980: the environmental excise tax on crude oil received at a U.S. refinery. This tax, which was part of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (P.L. 96-510), otherwise known as the ""Superfund"" program, was designed to charge oil refineries for the cost of releasing any hazardous materials which resulted from the refining of crude oil. The tax rate was set initially at 0.79 ($0.0079) per barrel, and was subsequently raised to 9.7 per barrel. This tax expired at the end of 1995 but legislation has been proposed since then to reinstate it as part of Superfund reauthorization. (See CRS Issue Brief IB10011.)  CRS-3   IB10054  06-27-02  The third broad action taken during the 1970s to implement the new and refocused energy tax policy was the introduction of numerous tax incentives for energy conservation, the development of the supply of alternative fuels (renewable and non-conventional fuels), and the commercialization of energy efficiency and alternative fuels technologies. Most of these new tax subsidies were introduced as part of the Energy Tax Act of 1978 (ETA, P.L. 95-618), and expanded under the WPT, which also introduced additional new energy tax subsidies. The following list describes these: !  The Residential and Business Energy Tax Credits. The ETA provided income tax credits for homeowners and businesses that invested in a variety of energy conservation products (e.g., insulation and other energyconserving components) and for solar and wind energy equipment installed in a principal home or a business. The business energy tax credits were 10% to 15% of the investment in conservation or alternative fuels technologies such as synthetic fuels, solar, wind, geothermal, and biomass. These tax credits were also expanded as part of the WPT but they generally expired (except for business use of solar and geothermal technologies) as scheduled either in 1982 or 1985. President Clinton's FY2001 budget included a solar credit that is very similar to the 1978 residential energy tax credits (see ""Tax Credits for Solar Energy Equipment,""). A 15% investment tax credit for business use of solar and geothermal energy, which was made permanent, is all that remains of these tax credits. Tax Subsidies for Alcohol Fuels. The ETA also introduced the excise tax exemption for gasohol, currently at 5.3 per gallon (out of a gasoline tax of 18.4/gal.). Subsequent legislation extended the exemption and introduced the alcohol fuels ""blenders"" tax credits (which are in lieu of the exemption), and the 10/gal., small ethanol producers tax credit. The 1998 Transportation Equity Act (P.L. 105-178) extended the exemption, which was scheduled to expire, but at reduced rates. (For more information see: CRS Report 98-435 E, Alcohol Fuels Tax Incentives.) The Gas Guzzler Tax. The ETA created a federal tax on ""gas guzzlers,"" a graduated excise tax on the sale of vehicles that do not meet the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAF) standards established by the Environmental Protection Agency. The tax rate currently ranges from $1,000 for a vehicle rated between 21.5 and 22.5 MPG (miles per gallon) to $7,700 for a vehicle rated at less than 12.5 MPG. This tax is still in effect. Percentage Depletion for Geothermal. The ETA made geothermal deposits eligible for the percentage depletion allowance, at the rate of 22%. Currently the rate is 15%. The 29 Tax Credit for Unconventional Fuels. The 1980 WPT included a $3.00 (in 1979 dollars) production tax credit to stimulate the supply of selected unconventional fuels: oil from shale or tar sands, gas produced from either geo-pressurized brine, Devonian shale, tight formations, and coalbed methane, gas from biomass, and synthetic fuels from coal. Adjusted for inflation, this credit, which is still in effect for wells, mines, or plants placed CRS-4  !  !  !  !   IB10054  06-27-02  in service by June 30, 1998 (for coal and biomass facilities) and December 31, 1991 (for all other facilities and wells), was over $6.00 per barrel of liquid fuels and about $1.00 per thousand cubic feet (MCF) of gas in 1999. The credit for tight sands gas has been fixed at the 1979 rate of $0.50 per MCF. (For more information, see CRS Report 97-679 E, Economic Analysis of the Section 20 Tax Credit for Unconventional Fuels.) !  Tax-Exempt Interest on Industrial Development Bonds. The WPT made facilities for producing fuels from solid waste exempt from federal taxation of interest on industrial development bonds (IDBs). This exemption was for the benefit of the development of alcohol fuels produced from biomass, for solid-waste-to-energy facilities, for hydroelectric facilities, and for facilities for producing renewable energy. IDBs, which provide significant benefits to state and local electric utilities (public power), had become a popular source of financing for renewable energy projects.  (During the 1970s there was also a significant increase in the number of energy laws and regulations, such as the CAF (Corporate Average Fuel Economy) standards to reduce transportation fuel use, and other interventions through the budget and the credit markets. This included some of the most extensive energy legislation ever enacted. These non-tax policy measures are not discussed here.)  Reagan's Free-Market Energy Tax Policy The Reagan era, the period from 1981-1989, witnessed the first attempt to create a more free-market energy tax policy by deregulating the energy markets, and by both reducing taxes and eliminating tax subsidies, both for conservation, alternative fuels, and for oil and gas. President Reagan's free-market views were well known prior to his election. During the 1980 Presidential campaign, he proposed repeal of the WPT, the deregulation of oil and natural gas, and the minimization of government intervention, including reduced spending and taxes. The Reagan Administration opposed using the tax law to promote either oil and gas development, energy conservation, or the supply of alternative fuels. The idea was to have a more neutral and less distortionary energy tax policy, which would make energy markets work more efficiently and generate benefits to the general economy. The Reagan Administration believed that the responsibility for commercializing conservation and alternative energy technologies rested with the private sector and that high oil prices  real oil prices (corrected for inflation) were at historically high levels in 1981 and 1982  would be ample encouragement for the development of alternative energy resources. High oil prices in themselves create conservation incentives, stimulate oil and gas production, and render tax breaks for alternative resource generally ineffective, and wasteful, as a policy tool. The Administration's energy tax policy was professed more formally in several energy and tax policy studies, including its 1981 National Energy Policy Plan and the 1983 update to this plan; it culminated in a 1984 Treasury study on general tax reform, which also proposed fundamental reforms of federal energy tax policy. In terms of actual legislation, many of the Reagan Administration's objectives were realized, although as discussed below there were unintended effects. In 1982, the business energy tax credits on most types of nonrenewable technologies  those enacted under the ETA of 1978  were allowed to expire as CRS-5   IB10054  06-27-02  scheduled; other business credits and the residential energy tax credits were allowed to expire at the end of 1985, also as scheduled. Only the tax credits for business solar, geothermal, ocean thermal and biomass technologies were extended. And as mentioned above, today the tax credit for business investment in solar and geothermal technologies, which has since been reduced to 10%, is all that remains of these tax credits. A final accomplishment was the repeal of the WPT, but not until 1988, the end of the Reagan term. The Administration's other energy tax policy proposals, however, were not adopted. The tax incentives for oil& gas were not eliminated, although they were pared back as part of the Tax Reform Act (TRA) of 1986: !  `Expensing' was retained, but there were cutbacks for integrated oil producers, (who would only be allowed to expense 70% of such costs and amortize  deduct evenly over time  the remaining 30%) and other reductions; Percentage depletion would not apply to lease bonuses, advance royalties, or any other payments made without regard to actual production from the property. This amendment applied to geothermal wells as well as oil and gas properties. Another section of TRA denied capital gains treatment on certain dispositions of interest in oil and gas property (and to geothermal property); The TRA replaced the old minimum taxes with a new alternative minimum tax that placed limits on the tax benefits to oil/gas producers from the expensing of IDCs and the percentage depletion allowance. (Taxpayers must compute both the standard income tax and the alternative minimum tax imposed on a variety of tax preferences or subsidies, and pay the larger of the two.) However, in an effort to mitigate any burdensome effects of this new tax, only the excess of the deduction above 65% of net income was to be treated as a preference item; Investments in oil and gas properties were exempted from the passive loss limitation rules that were intended to curb tax shelter investments  a working interest in an oil and gas property was not treated as a passive activity. Thus any losses and credits derived from oil and gas investments activity could be used as a tax shelter to offset the taxpayer's other income without limitations under the passive loss rules.  !  !  !  Perhaps the key characteristic of the Reagan Administration energy tax policy, however, was the extent to which its objectives of neutrality and efficiency were compromised by the combined effect of its energy tax policy and its other tax policies. While the objective was to create a free-market energy policy, significant liberalization of the depreciation system and reduction in marginal tax rates  both the result of the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 (ERTA, P.L. 9734)  combined with the regular investment tax credit and the business energy investment tax credits, resulted in negative effective tax rates for many investments including investments in alternative energy investments such as solar and synthetic fuels. CRS-6   IB10054  06-27-02  (See, for instance: CRS Report 84-85 E. Effective Tax Rates on Solar/Wind and Synthetic Fuels as Compared to Conventional Energy Resources.) Also, the retention of percentage depletion and expensing of IDC's (even at the reduced rates) rendered oil and gas investments still favored relative to investments in general. Other energy tax policy developments during the Reagan era were as follows: !  The Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 (P.L. 98-369) tinkered with several energy tax provisions including the WPT and percentage depletion. provision of the Tax Reform Act of 1975. Also, the 1984 tax law extended several of the tax incentives for alcohol fuels: (1) the tax exemption for alcohol fuels mixtures was raised from 5 to 6; (2) the law retained the prior 9-per-gallon exemption for neat alcohol fuels, i.e., those that are at least 85% alcohol, derived from alternative substances, but it provided for a new exemption of 4.5 per gallon for alcohol fuels derived from natural gas; (3) the alcohol ""blenders"" credit was raised from 50 to 60 per gallon; and (4) the duty on alcohol imported for use as a fuel was increased from 50 to 60 per gallon. In 1986 two environmental excise taxes were enacted on oil: 1) Under the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (P.L. 99-499), an increase in the Superfund oil tax from 0.79 to 8.2-per-barrel on domestic oil received and to 11.7 per barrel on imported petroleum. This tax differential violated the General Agreements on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and the Steel Trade Liberalization Program Implementation Act of 1989 (P.L. 101-221) made the rates uniform at 9.7 per barrel; and 2) Under the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986 (P.L. 99-510), imposition of the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund excise tax at 1.3 per barrel tax, which was subsequently raised to 5.0/barrel. Both these taxes expired at the end of 1995. In addition, the TRA of 1986 reduced the excise tax exemption for ""neat"" alcohol fuels, from 9 per gallon to 6 per gallon. It also permitted alcohol imported from certain Caribbean countries to enter free of the 60-pergallon duty. The TRA also repealed the tax-exempt financing provision for alcohol-producing facilities and for certain steam-generating facilities.  !  !  Energy Tax Policy After Reagan After the Reagan Revolution, several major energy and non-energy laws were enacted that amended the energy tax laws in several ways, some major: !  Revenue Provisions of the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1990. President Bush's first major tax law included numerous energy tax incentives: 1) for conservation (and deficit reduction), the law increased the gasoline tax by 5/gal. and doubled the gas-guzzler tax; 2) for oil and gas, the law introduced a 10% tax credit for enhanced oil recovery expenditures, liberalized some of the restrictions on the percentage depletion allowance, and reduced the impact of the alternative minimum tax on oil and gas CRS-7   IB10054  06-27-02  investments; 3) for alternative fuels, the law expanded the 29 tax credit for unconventional fuels and introduced the tax credit for small producers of ethanol used as a motor fuel. !  Energy Policy Act of 1992 (P.L. 102-486). This broad energy measure introduced the 45 tax credit, at 1.5 per kilowatt hour, for electricity generated from wind and ""closed-loop"" biomass systems( poultry litter was added later. (This tax credit expired at the end of 2001 for new facilities.) In addition, the 1992 law: 1) added an income tax deduction for the costs, up to $2,000,of clean fuel powered vehicles; 2) liberalized the alcohol fuels tax exemption; 3) expanded the 29 production tax credit for nonconventional energy resources; 4) liberalized the tax breaks for oil and gas. Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (P.L. 103-66). President Clinton proposed a differential Btu tax on fossil fuels (a broadly-based general tax primarily on oil, gas and coal based on the British Thermal Units of heat output), which was dropped in favor of a broadly-applied 4.3/gal. increase in the excise taxes on motor fuels with revenues allocated for deficit reduction rather than the various trust funds. Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 (P.L. 105-34). This tax cut legislation also included a variety of excise tax provisions pertaining to motor fuels excise taxes, some of which involved tax reductions on alternative transportation fuels, and some of which involved increases such as on kerosene, which on balance further tilted energy tax policy toward alternative fuels. Tax Relief and Extension Act ( H.R. 2923). Enacted as part of P.L. 106-170, the Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999, Title V of the law, the Tax Relief and Extension Act of 1999, extended and liberalized the 1.5 renewable electricity production tax credit, and renewed the suspension of the net income limitation for the percentage depletion allowance for marginal oil and gas wells.  !  !  !  As this list suggests, the post-Reagan energy tax policy returned more to the interventionist course established during the 1970s and primarily was directed at energy conservation and alternative fuels, mostly for the purpose of reducing oil import dependence and enhancing energy security. However, there is an environmental twist to energy tax policy during this period, particularly in the more recent years, as the discussion of President Clinton's proposals will demonstrate. Fiscal concerns, which for most of that period created a perennial search for more revenues to reduce budget deficits, has also driven energy tax policy proposals during the post-Reagan era. This is underscored by proposals, which have not been enacted, to impose broad-based energy taxes such as the Btu (British Thermal Units) tax or the carbon tax to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. Another interesting feature of the post-Reagan energy tax policy is that while the primary focus continues to be energy conservation and alternative fuels, no energy tax legislation has been enacted during this period that does not also include some, relatively minor, tax relief for the oil and gas industry, either in the form of new tax incentives or liberalization of an existing tax breaks (or both). CRS-8   IB10054  06-27-02  As an indication of the current posture of federal energy tax policy, Table 1 on page 16, summarizes current energy tax provisions and the corresponding revenue effects. A ""-"" sign indicates revenue losses, which means that the provision is a tax subsidy or incentive, intended to increase the subsidized activity (energy conservation measures or the supply of some alternative and renewable fuel or technology); no minus sign means that the provision is a tax, which means that it either reduces supply of, or the demand for, the taxed activity (either conventional fuel supply, energy demand, or the demand for energy using technologies, such as cars).  Energy Tax Proposals in the 107th Congress Over the last 4 years there have been a steady stream of energy tax policy measures, culminating in comprehensive energy policy reform legislation  the measure approved by the House (H.R. 4) and that pending in the Senate (S. 517). To understand the context of these measures, one needs to review both the recurrent energy market problems over this time period, which some had viewed as an ""energy crisis."" First, there have been wide fluctuations in crude oil prices. Domestic crude oil prices reached a low of just over $10 per barrel in the winter of 1998-1999, among the lowest crude oil prices in history after correcting for inflation. From 1986-1999 oil prices averaged about $17.00 per barrel, fluctuating from between $12 and $20 per barrel. Low oil prices hurt oil producers (upstream operations), reducing profits and output, while benefitting oil refiners (downstream operations). In addition, they also encourage consumption (are disincentives to conserve and invest in energy efficiency technologies) and discourage production of alternative fuels and renewable technologies. To address the low oil prices, there were many tax bills introduced during the first session of the 106th Congress (1999) to provide economic relief through the tax code for the ailing domestic oil and gas producing industry, particularly small independent drillers and producers. Proposals mainly focused on production tax credits for marginal or stripper oil, but they also included carry back provisions for net operating losses, and other fossil fuels supply provisions. By the summer of 1999, crude oil prices had recovered to about $20 per barrel; and by the summer of 2000 prices peaked at well over $30 per barrel, due largely to output reductions by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), but also due to the increased energy demand accompanying increasing growth in the world (particularly the Asian) economies. To address the high crude prices, which also caused high gasoline, diesel, and heating oil prices, legislative proposals focused on many of the same energy tax proposals made during 1999 to address the low crude prices: production tax credits and other supply incentives. The rationale was not tax relief for a depressed industry but tax incentives to increase output, reduce prices, and provide price relief to consumers. But in addition to high petroleum prices there were forces  some of which were understood (factors such as environmental regulations and pipeline breaks) and others which are still are not so clearly understood  that caused the prices of these petroleum products to spike. In response to these energy market problems, there were many proposals in the spring and summer of 2000 to temporarily either reduce (or totally eliminate) the federal excise tax on gasoline and diesel fuel, and other special motor fuels. These proposals were viewed as a way of helping consumers (including truckers) cushion the financial effect of the price CRS-9   IB10054  06-27-02  spikes. (For an analysis of this legislation, see CRS Report RL30497, Suspending the Gas Tax: Analysis of S. 2285.) The spike in gasoline prices in the Midwest during the summer of 2000 kept interest in these excise tax moratoria alive; they also engendered some interest in proposals to impose a windfall profit tax on oil companies, which were, by then, earning substantial profits due to the high prices. (For more detail on the windfall profit tax on crude oil that was imposed from 1980 until its repeal in 1988, see CRS Report 90-442, The Windfall Profit Tax on Crude Oil: Overview of the Issues.) Despite the numerous proposals to address these energy problems over the last 4 years, no major energy tax bill has been approved, although there have been three relatively minor amendments to energy tax provisions as part of non-energy tax bills during this period. Examples are Title V of the Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999, P. L. 106-170, signed by President Clinton on December 17, 1999, and the Job Creation and Worker Assistance Act of 2002 (P.L. 107-147), ) signed into law by President Bush on March 9, 2002. The latter is a $42 billion, ten-year tax cut that retroactively extends several energy tax provisions: !  The 45 Tax Credit for Electricity Produced From Wind, Biomass, and Poultry Waste. The 1.5 per kilowatt hour (in real, 1992 dollars) tax credit for electricity produced from wind technologies, ""closed-loop"" biomass, and poultry waste (as described above), is available for 10 years after the generating facility is placed in service, which was before January 1, 2002. The tax cut bill extended this deadline to December 31, 2003. Tax Credit for Electric Vehicles. The onset of the phase-out of the $4,000 tax credit for the purchase of electric vehicles began on January 1, 2002. The tax cut bill deferred the onset of the phase-out date by two years. Deduction for Clean-Fuel Vehicles and Certain Refueling Property. The deduction for clean fuel vehicles, which ranges from $2,000 to $50,000, is to be phased out over 3 years beginning on January 1, 2002. This was extended by two years to January 1, 2004. The Dyed Fuels Mandate. Beginning on January 1, 2002, registered terminals were required to store both dyed diesel fuel and dyed kerosene as a prerequisite for being allowed to sell undyed diesel and kerosene. The tax cut bill repeals this mandate effective on January 1, 2002. Percentage Depletion Allowance. The 100% net income limitation for the percentage depletion allowance on marginal wells had been suspended since December 31, 1997, but this expired on January 1, 2002, thus reinstating the limitation. The tax cut bill reinstates the suspension, thus repealing the limitation through December 31, 2003.  !  !  !  !  While no tax bill was passed that reduced taxes on oil and gas, the 106th Congress did enact a package of $500 million in loan guarantees for small independent oil and gas producers, which became public law (P.L. 106-51), in August 1999.  CRS-10   IB10054  06-27-02  Tax Provisions in the Comprehensive Energy Policy Legislation At the convening of the 107th Congress, policymakers witnessed not only the usual gamut of energy market problems just described, there was also an electricity crisis in California, and spiking natural gas prices, which increased steadily during 2000 and reached $9 per cubic foot at the outset of the 107th Congress. (At one point on the spot market prices reached about $30 per cubic foot, the equivalent of $175/barrel of oil). Recurrent energy problems had developed into an ""energy crisis."" The Republican leadership resuscitated their energy plan of the 106th Congress, particularly measures which focused on tax relief to the oil and gas industry, and proposed, a more general or comprehensive policy including major energy tax measures that would address fundamental energy problems of supply and demand. The ideas and measures in this plan were incorporated into Senator Murkowski's comprehensive energy policy reform legislation S. 389, and other Senate bills and into H.R. 4 (in the House). The Senate Energy Bills (S. 389, S. 596, and S. 517). On February 26, 2001, Senator Murkowski introduced S. 389, the comprehensive energy bill that includes significant expansion of tax incentives for energy supply, energy efficiency, and alternative fuels. (The tax incentives are title IX of S. 389, which comprises over half of the bill; the non-tax provisions were introduced on the same date as S. 388). On March 22, 2001, Senator Bingaman introduced the Democratic version of comprehensive energy policy legislation, also comprising two bills, which have separate titles: S. 596, the Energy Security Tax and Policy Act of 2001 (essentially the tax component of the comprehensive legislation) and S. 597, the Comprehensive and Balanced Energy Policy Act of 2001 (the non-tax component of the legislation). This bill is based largely on Senator Bingaman's bill in the 106th Congress ( S. 2904). Many of the tax measures in S. 389 and S. 596 are similar. However, S. 396 is weighted more toward production and supply than is S. 596 which is, on balance, slightly more weighted toward energy efficiency and alternative fuels. (For a comparison of these two bills, see CRS Report RL30953, Energy Tax Incentives: A Comparison of the National Energy Security Act of 2001 (S. 389) and the Democratic Alternative (S. 596).) On December 5, the Democratic leadership in the Senate introduced S. 1766, a newer version of comprehensive energy legislation, without tax provisions, which appears to be a revised version of Senator Bingaman's bill, S. 597. S. 1766 was replaced by a substitute bill, S. 517, which is largely the same as the original bill but which includes dramatic increases in fuel economy standards. As to the energy tax provisions of the bills, the Senate Finance Committee (SFC) held three hearings on the major Senate energy tax proposals during the first session of the 107th Congress; the Senate leadership had stated that the energy situation, was one of the key issues to be taken up after the August, 2001 recess. But declining federal budget surpluses, the waning of the electricity crisis in California, declining petroleum and natural gas prices, the terrorist situation, and economic recovery issues put this legislation on hold. On February 13, 2002, however, the SFC approved the Energy Tax Incentives Act of 2002, which was an amendment (Amendment #2917) to S. 517 on the floor added to S. 517, the Senate's energy policy bill. S. 517 was formally renamed the Securing America's Future Energy Act when the Senate approved the measure on April 25 as an amendment in the nature of a substitute to the House counterpart H.R. 4. CRS-11   IB10054  06-27-02  The House Approved Bill (H.R. 4). In the House, the major energy tax measure is the Energy Tax Policy Act of 2001, a package of $33.5 billion of energy tax incentives (over 10 years) for energy supply and conservation introduced on July 17, 2001. H. R. 2511 was marked up by the House Committee on Ways and Means on Wednesday, July 18, 2001.The marked up bill was a substitute amendment offered by Ways and Means Committee Chairman William Thomas. The bill was approved 24-17 and has been incorporated in the Republican leadership's comprehensive energy legislation, H.R. 4, which was approved by the House on August 2, 2001. The energy tax provisions of H.R. 4 are generally very similar to those in the two initial Senate bills discussed above (S. 389 and S. 596), although the mix of provisions differ. As between the two versions of H.R. 4 are in conference committee, the House bill proposes larger energy tax cuts (net of some energy tax increases), and is broader in scope than the Senate bill. H.R. 4, which reduces energy taxes by about $33 billion over 10 years, as compared with the Senate bill, which reduces energy taxes by about $15 billion over 10 years. Both bills provide tax incentives for both energy conservation  i.e., incentives that reduce the demand for energy  and the supply of conventional fossil fuels, particularly oil and gas (including nonconventional gas). But overall the House version appears to be weighted more toward stimulating the supply of conventional fuels, including capital investment incentives to stimulate production and transportation of oil and gas as well as production and transmission of electricity than is the Senate version. This seems to predicated on the belief that many of the recurring energy problems recently are due to supply and capacity shortages in the face of rapidly increasing demand, which has been increasing due to rapid economic growth and relatively low energy prices. The conservation incentives in the House bill are weighted more toward promoting alternative fuels rather than energy efficiency. The Senate bill either eliminates or significantly reduces most of incentives for fossil fuels production and supply and for nuclear power that were in H.R. 4. There are also some reductions in tax incentives for energy efficiency. The tax incentives for alternative and renewable fuels are increased over H.R. 4. As a result of these differences with the energy tax provisions of H.R. 4, which were heavily weighted toward fossil and nuclear supply, the Senate bill is evenly balanced with about half of the tax cuts accruing to fossil fuel and production and nuclear power, and the other half accruing to energy efficiency and alternative (and renewable) fuels.  Bush Administration Proposals The Bush Administration, which has proposed its own comprehensive plan to address the energy crisis, was initially against a significant expansion of energy tax incentives (whether for supply, efficiency, or alternative fuels). It has, however, recommended a limited number of energy tax measures, some of which appear in the Administration's FY2002 budget proposal and others which are incorporated in its National Energy Policy Development Group (NEPDG) report. (See CRS Report RL31096. Bush Energy Policy: Overview of Major Proposals and Legislation.) Some of these energy tax measures in the Administration's FY2002 budget and the NEPDG report also appear in the FY2003 budget, and the Presidents' global climate change initiative.  CRS-12   IB10054  06-27-02  Tax Issues Relating to Electricity Restructuring The proposed restructuring of the electricity supply industry envisions a transition from a regulated and vertically integrated monopoly to a deregulated and more competitive industry, primarily in the generation sector, with all the projected benefits: lower costs and prices, technological innovation, and greater economic efficiency (including dynamic economic efficiency) both within the industry itself and economy-wide. But some of the provisions of the federal tax code, as they relate to electric utilities, evolved within the monopoly/regulatory structure or regime and thus may be inconsistent with a more competitive restructured industry. Comprehensive as well as stand-alone restructuring legislation was introduced in the 106th Congress, but no comprehensive electricity restructuring legislation has been enacted at the federal level. Open Access and Tax Exempt Bonds. Current federal tax provisions, as they relate to the use of tax-exempt bonds by state and local government utilities (public power) effectively preclude them from participating in open-access restructuring because of the tax code's private-use rules; i.e., the bonds cannot be used for any private purpose. The private use restrictions are intended to ensure that the benefits from the tax exempt financing accrue to the general public for the welfare of all rather than to individual private entities. Opening up a public power entity's transmission lines to privately owned utilities can jeopardize the tax exempt status of its outstanding bonds  it could make the bonds retroactively taxable. If public power utilities comply with Order 888 of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) by providing other utilities comparable access to their transmission facilities; if they join independent regional system operators; if they let other power marketers use their distribution facilities; and if they sell excess power outside their traditional markets; all these could jeopardize the tax-exempt status of any outstanding bonds. The Tax Treatment of the Sale of Transmission and Distribution Lines. In general, most analysts argue that competitive electricity markets cannot work well unless the transmission systems, which are owned primarily by investor owned utilities (IOU's), are subject to independent ownership and management. For this reason, federal rules are encouraging, and certain states are mandating, IOU's to sell or divest themselves of assets used in the transmission and distribution of electricity to independent systems operators. However, under current tax rules such sales or conversions could, under typical circumstances, trigger a taxable gain, which could inhibit the sale or spin-off of the assets. Several tax bills (for example, H.R. 1459 and S. 2967) propose that these sales or spin-offs be treated as involuntary conversions, which are not taxable events provided that the funds are used to invest in similar property within two years. Contributions in Aid of Construction. Payments received from land developers (and builders) or prospective customers in reimbursement of the costs of constructing facilities and power lines needed to connect these customers to the grid and extend electricity service to them have to be reported as income to the utility subject to tax. The fees that utilities charge customers for connecting them to their homes or businesses to the distribution lines are also treated as taxable income. The utility is allowed to depreciate these types of investment expenditures, which are treated as contributions in aid of construction. Under IRC118 contributions in aid of construction are not treated as contributions to capital. Prior to 1986, such contributions in aid of construction were tax exempt as contributions to a CRS-13   IB10054  06-27-02  corporation's capital, although no depreciation was allowed on the capital. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 (P.L. 99-514) made such contributions taxable. For example, if an IOU generally requires prospective customers to pay for the cost of extending the existing wires to the customer's premises, the IOU is required to include such payments in income, although it can depreciate the additional wires. The tax on contributions in aid of construction applies to IOU's. It does not apply to public power entities, which, as government enterprises, are not taxable entities. IOU's would like to amend the tax laws and make contributions in aid of construction tax exempt, thus reverting to pre-1986 tax treatment. This proposal does not hinge on the restructuring of the electric industry. It is rather part of a compromise which includes continuation of the tax breaks for investors who purchased tax-exempt bonds for public power entities. Nuclear Decommissioning. Owners of nuclear power plants are required to establish independent trust funds, and to make contributions to those funds, to ensure that funds are available to decommission those plants when they are retired. Under present law, money set aside for the future decommissioning of nuclear power plants receives special tax treatment. Basically, the contributions into the fund are tax deductible in the year they are made, rather than in the year in which the actual decommissioning takes place as economic and accounting principles dictate. Any income earned by the fund, say from investments, is taxed at a flat rate of 20%. The rules spelling out the tax treatment of nuclear decommissioning costs  the current deduction for accrual (as opposed to cash) basis taxpayers of costs not yet incurred, but also the 20% income tax on such funds  were enacted during a time when all nuclear power plants were operated by regulated public utilities, and when any transfers of plant assets occurred between such regulated entities. One such rule states that the amount deductible cannot exceed the amount of nuclear decommissioning costs collected from ratepayers under the cost-of-service regulation. Thus, a public service commission must authorize that the costs be approved into the rate base. Under rate deregulation in a more competitive industry, there would be no cost of service amount for the nuclear generating plant owners, hence zero deduction for contributions into the nuclear decommissioning fund. Also, restructuring, with its separate ownership of generating, transmission, and distribution and retailing, is likely to lead to the sale or disposition of nuclear generating plants to parties that are not regulated public utilities as the law requires for tax exempt transactions. Under present tax rules, the transfer of decommissioning fund assets as part of the sale of a nuclear power plant is not a taxable transaction as long as both the seller and the buyer are regulated public utilities. This raises questions as to the tax treatment of the nuclear decommissioning funds in a sale to a non-utility, which is somewhat ambiguous under current tax laws. Under certain conditions, the purchaser may be required to recognize gain as taxable income. The Size of the Tax Burdens on Public Power Relative to Investor Owned Utilities (IOUs). Public power utilities are not only exempt from federal taxes (as compared with investor owned utilities, which must report and pay tax on their income), but the interest on the bonds used to finance their capital investments is also exempt from federal taxation. Restructuring could lock in the competitive advantage of public power (and cooperatives) rendered by the current tax code provisions.  CRS-14   IB10054  06-27-02  Tax Exempt Status of Electric Cooperatives. Electric cooperatives are exempt from federal taxes as long as 85% or more of their annual income comes from members. Nonmember, unrelated business income is fully taxable. Under restructuring, the fees that cooperatives would receive for retail wheeling of electricity, combined with other member income, could exceed 15%, which may jeopardize the cooperatives' tax-exempt status.  L  EGISLATION  H.R. 2511 (McCrery) The Energy Tax Policy Act of 2001. Amends the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide tax incentives to encourage energy conservation, energy reliability, and energy production. Introduced on July 17, 2001. Marked up on Wednesday, July 18, 2001, by the House Committee on Ways and Means. The marked up bill was a substitute amendment offered by Ways and Means Committee Chairman William Thomas. The bill was approved 24-17 and has been included as part of H.R. 4, the comprehensive energy legislation currently moving through the Congress. Securing America's Future Energy Act (Amendment in the Nature of a Substitute to H.R. 4) The tax provisions are basically those approved the Senate Finance Committee (SFC) as the Energy Tax Incentives Act of 2002. Amends the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide about $15 billion (over 10 years) of tax incentives for energy conservation and fossil fuels production. Marked up by the SFC on Wednesday, February 13, 2002. The bill, which was approved by voice vote, was a somewhat expanded version of the bill introduced by Senator Baucus on February 11. Added to S. 517 on the floor as Amendment #2917. The tax provisions embodied in Division H. of the Senate energy bill are a modified version of Amendment 2917. S. 596 (Bingaman)/H.R. 2108 The Energy Security Tax and Policy Act of 2001. Amends the Internal Revenue Code by providing tax credits and deductions for: (1) energy efficient property used in business; (2) residential energy systems; (3) electricity facilities and production; (4) commercial applications of advanced clean coal technologies; (5) heating fuels and storage; and (6) oil and gas production and petroleum products. Senator Bingaman introduced two bills representing what was then the Democratic version of comprehensive energy policy legislation: S. 596 (essentially the tax component of the comprehensive legislation) and S. 597, the Comprehensive and Balanced Energy Policy Act of 2001 (the non-tax component of the legislation). Introduced on March 22, 2001; referred to the Senate Finance Committee. S. 389 (Murkowski) The National Energy Security Act of 2001. A bill to protect the energy and security of the United States and decrease America's dependency on foreign oil sources to 50% by the year 2011 by enhancing the use of renewable energy resources, conserving energy resources, improving energy efficiencies, and increasing domestic energy supplies. Introduced on February 26, 2001; referred to the Senate Finance Committee.  CRS-15   IB10054  06-27-02  Table 1. Current Energy Tax Provisions and Revenue Effects (FY2001, in $ mil.)

The first commercial production of oil in Ohio was discovered in Macksburg (Washington County) in 1860. Today, Ohio has remained a leading producer of oil and gas, ranking in the top half of all producing states in the nation.   Most of Ohio's 62,902 active wells are classified as ""stripper"" wells or wells that produce less than 10 barrels (42 gallons per barrel) of oil per day or less than 60 thousand cubic feet (mcf) of gas per day. In 2002, Ohio wells produced  6 million barrels of oil (that's over 252,182,490 gallons per year!) and more  than 97 billion cubic feet of natural gas. Market value for oil and gas production totals nearly $466 million dollars. Even though Ohio's gas production accounts for only 12% of Ohio's consumption, it is equivalent to the amount required to heat over 1 million homes and businesses. In addition, the oil and gas industry paid an estimated $58 million dollars in royalty payments to landowners for oil and gas produced.   Following are additional facts and information which may be of interest to you regarding one of Ohio's most precious, but little known, natural resources.

GX235-28-4719528	Energy Resources Program  at the Geological Survey  of Alabama         Coal Resources              Coal has been mined     commercially in 21 northern Alabama counties for more than 150 years. Ranking 14th in the      United States, Alabama produces between 24 and 27 million short tons of coal each year.     About two-thirds of Alabama's coal is mined in deep underground mines, with the remainder     coming from surface mines.       Our use of coal statewide has risen to more than 30     million short tons annually. We use it to produce electricity (80%), to make steel (10%),     and for other uses (10%). In Alabama, 70% of all electricity generated is produced at     coal-fueled steam plants. Annually the total value of coal produced in Alabama exceeds $1     billion.       Geologists at the Survey are currently evaluating the     distribution and quality of deep coal resources in the Black Warrior basin. Identifying     prospective areas for future development will aid Alabama's mining industry. Coal     geologists recently mapped the resources of the Cahaba coalfield and are currently mapping     the Warrior coalfield. All coal data become part of the National Coal Resources Data     System (NCRDS), a comprehensive computerized database of coal information.       Statistics in this database and an extensive archive of reports, maps, and analyses of Alabama coal are available at the Survey for public use. Please contact Richard Carroll at 205/247-3551 or  rcarroll@gsa.state.al.us  for more information.                Oil and Gas Resources        Alabama's oil and gas industry has enjoyed a long and   remarkable history. As early as 1808, American Indians in the Tennessee Valley in   north-central Alabama were selling oil from asphaltic rocks for medicinal purposes. The   first wells drilled for oil in the southeastern U.S. were drill ed in Lawrence County   in 1865, just six years after the first oil well in the U.S. The first commercially   marketed natural gas production in the southeastern U.S. occurred in the early 1900s near   Huntsville. In 1944, oil was discovered near Gilbertown in Choctaw County. This discovery   led to the creation of the present-day State Oil and Gas Board. The discovery of Alabama's   giant Citronelle Field in Mobile County in 1955 focused national attention on our state's   oil and gas potential. World class natural gas reserves were first discovered in Alabama's   offshore waters in the late 1970s. Alabama became a world leader in the development of   coalbed methane gas as an energy resource in the 1980s. Over the past 10 years, 100 oil   and gas fields have been discovered and the number of producing wells has doubled from   2,000 to 4,000 wells. Now, Alabama is a major oil and gas producing state, ranking 9th   nationally in natural gas production and 13th in liquid petroleum production.     The oil and gas industry provides major economic   benefits to Alabama and its citizens. Over $1.3 billion dollars worth of oil and gas are   produced annually in Alabama. The state receives direct benefits of approximately $285   million annually in the form of lease bonuses, royalties, trust-fund investment income,   and severance taxes.     A focus of research at the Geological Survey is to characterize the petroleum reservoirs in Alabama. For example, Survey scientists are identifying techniques that can be used to improve oil recovery in Gilbertown Field, the oldest oil field in Alabama. Recent investigations identified the basic geologic controls on coalbed methane production and have characterized aging oil reservoirs in the Black Warrior basin and the Gulf Coast. As a result of this research, increased production has been documented from some of these reservoirs. Numerous maps and reports on oil and gas are available to the public at the Geological Survey of Alabama and the State Oil and Gas Board.

The principal ingredient of natural gas is                methane, or CH 4 , which is lighter than air and flammable.                Its flammability is the major reason why people and business buy                natural gas.               Natural gas consumed in Michigan comes from gas and oil fields                located primarily in Michigan's lower peninsula, the Texas-Oklahoma                Panhandle, on and off-shore Louisiana, and Alberta, Canada ( see                gas supply basins map                 ). Gas producers                use the knowledge gained in the United States over the past 150                years to explore for natural gas fields. They develop fields by                drilling wells into them that are then connected to gathering pipelines                that, after processing, connect to large pipelines for delivery                to places like Michigan. Most gas fields are in geological formations                that developed 150 to 200 million years ago.               All of Michigan's natural gas production is located in the lower                peninsula. Currently, the Antrim ""play"" is the most active play                in Michigan with about 7,400 wells producing gas from the Antrim                formation. MPSC records show that a handful of Antrim wells were                producing in northern lower Michigan and in the St. Clair and Jackson                County areas as far back as the 1940's. However, Antrim drilling                activity greatly increased in the late 1980's, peaked in 1993 and                is now declining with 259 standard well connection permits issued                in 2002 compared to 366 issued in 2001. At present, Michigan's Antrim                production is entirely located in the northern portion of the lower                peninsula.                In 2002, Michigan produced 215.5 billion cubic feet (6.1 billion                cubic meters) of natural gas. This ranks Michigan as the twelfth                largest natural gas producing state in the nation. Most of Michigan's                gas production is purchased by Michigan utilities for their customers,                but some is also sold to gas marketing companies that sell gas outside                of Michigan. Natural gas produced in Michigan represents about 25%                of the total gas consumed in Michigan.                Michigan's recorded production history began in the 1930's, when                the MPSC issued its first Standard Well Connection Permit to a gas                well in the Austin Field located in Mecosta County. This Michigan                Stray field was discovered in 1933. Throughout the 1930's and 1940's,                Michigan Stray was the dominant producing formation with some fields                producing from the Detroit River, Berea, Dundee, Traverse, Salina,                Sylvania, Antrim, Richfield, and Reed City formations.                In Southeastern Michigan, during the early 1960's several big                Niagaran formation discoveries were made such as Belle River Mills                and Ray fields (now natural gas storage fields). The proximity of                these fields to utilities that serve large population centers was                an added benefit. The early 1970's marked the start of northern                Michigan's Niagaran Trend which extends across the northern lower                peninsula from Manistee to Rogers City. The Niagaran Trend continued                to be Michigan's hot spot for drilling throughout the 70's and early                80's.                Central Michigan became the exploration focal point in the mid-80's                with the first well drilled in the Prairie du Chien (PdC) formation.                The number of new PdC wells peaked in 1990, with 38 Standard Well                Connection Permits issued for new PdC wells, and is now on the decline.                Some PdC wells (also referred to as deep gas wells) are drilled                to a depth of more than 10,000 feet (3,050 meters) making this formation                an expensive and technically challenging exploratory target.                At the end of their productive lives, fields were abandoned. Some                reservoirs (mostly Niagaran and Michigan Stray) were converted to                gas storage fields, and play an important part in meeting Michigan's                high winter demands for natural gas today (see                  Storage ).                    A gas well                starts with a drilling permit from the  Michigan Department of Environmental                Quality (DEQ) ,                Geological Survey Division. The DEQ has jurisdiction over spacing,                drilling, deepening, plugging, reworking and abandonment of all                wells. After the well is drilled and before production begins the                DEQ classifies each well as gas or oil. Natural gas well regulation                is split between the DEQ and the Michigan Public Service Commission                (MPSC). Before a gas well begins producing the producer, or operator,                must apply to the MPSC for a Standard Wellhead Connection Permit                (see                  Forms  page) per                  rules  and                  laws . An Allowable Withdrawal Order is issued with the permit                for all non-Antrim gas wells. Gas wells producing from the Antrim                formation are treated differently because they are low-producers                and generally not individually metered. The Allowable Withdrawal                Order contains 12-month, 6-month and 1-month allowable production                limits. The allowable production limits are based on 17 1/2% of                the calculated absolute open flow (the amount that could flow or                vent from an unrestricted well) as determined by a well flow test.                The Commission has approved allowable production limits up to 25%                of the calculated absolute open flow on a case-by-case basis if                it can be shown that the increased allowable will not create waste                or damage the well.                The MPSC monitors the production of gas wells under its rules                for                  Production and Transmission of Natural Gas  (per                  Act 9 of 1929  and                  Act 3 of 1939 ). Well operators file monthly production reports                with the MPSC for each gas well or unitized area. For Antrim gas                fields where the production from the wells is commingled through                a single meter for the field, the reports also include the number                of wells producing which allows average per well production to be                calculated. MPSC production records are available to the public                at the MPSC office. A brief  annual                summary  format and  monthly                gas production report  formats are available for downloading,                Non-Antrim gas fields with more than one well are prorated by                the MPSC. The purpose of proration is to protect correlative rights,                provide for equitable purchasing and taking of natural gas from                a common source of supply, ensure that each producer recovers production                in proportion to the recoverable gas under his land and to prevent                waste. Proration keeps each gas well in a field from producing more                than its fair share of the total field production. MPSC Staff use                field index rating percentages to monitor production imbalances                for each well producing in a prorated field. Field index rating                percentages are determined for each prorated well and are typically                based on reserve estimates and well flow tests. If production imbalances                for a prorated well become too large, production from wells within                that field are restricted to bring the field back into balance.

The principal ingredient of natural gas is                methane, or CH 4 , which is lighter than air and flammable.                Its flammability is the major reason why people and business buy                natural gas.               Natural gas consumed in Michigan comes from gas and oil fields                located primarily in Michigan's lower peninsula, the Texas-Oklahoma                Panhandle, on and off-shore Louisiana, and Alberta, Canada ( see                gas supply basins map                 ). Gas producers                use the knowledge gained in the United States over the past 150                years to explore for natural gas fields. They develop fields by                drilling wells into them that are then connected to gathering pipelines                that, after processing, connect to large pipelines for delivery                to places like Michigan. Most gas fields are in geological formations                that developed 150 to 200 million years ago.               All of Michigan's natural gas production is located in the lower                peninsula. Currently, the Antrim ""play"" is the most active play                in Michigan with about 7,400 wells producing gas from the Antrim                formation. MPSC records show that a handful of Antrim wells were                producing in northern lower Michigan and in the St. Clair and Jackson                County areas as far back as the 1940's. However, Antrim drilling                activity greatly increased in the late 1980's, peaked in 1993 and                is now declining with 259 standard well connection permits issued                in 2002 compared to 366 issued in 2001. At present, Michigan's Antrim                production is entirely located in the northern portion of the lower                peninsula.                In 2002, Michigan produced 215.5 billion cubic feet (6.1 billion                cubic meters) of natural gas. This ranks Michigan as the twelfth                largest natural gas producing state in the nation. Most of Michigan's                gas production is purchased by Michigan utilities for their customers,                but some is also sold to gas marketing companies that sell gas outside                of Michigan. Natural gas produced in Michigan represents about 25%                of the total gas consumed in Michigan.                Michigan's recorded production history began in the 1930's, when                the MPSC issued its first Standard Well Connection Permit to a gas                well in the Austin Field located in Mecosta County. This Michigan                Stray field was discovered in 1933. Throughout the 1930's and 1940's,                Michigan Stray was the dominant producing formation with some fields                producing from the Detroit River, Berea, Dundee, Traverse, Salina,                Sylvania, Antrim, Richfield, and Reed City formations.                In Southeastern Michigan, during the early 1960's several big                Niagaran formation discoveries were made such as Belle River Mills                and Ray fields (now natural gas storage fields). The proximity of                these fields to utilities that serve large population centers was                an added benefit. The early 1970's marked the start of northern                Michigan's Niagaran Trend which extends across the northern lower                peninsula from Manistee to Rogers City. The Niagaran Trend continued                to be Michigan's hot spot for drilling throughout the 70's and early                80's.                Central Michigan became the exploration focal point in the mid-80's                with the first well drilled in the Prairie du Chien (PdC) formation.                The number of new PdC wells peaked in 1990, with 38 Standard Well                Connection Permits issued for new PdC wells, and is now on the decline.                Some PdC wells (also referred to as deep gas wells) are drilled                to a depth of more than 10,000 feet (3,050 meters) making this formation                an expensive and technically challenging exploratory target.                At the end of their productive lives, fields were abandoned. Some                reservoirs (mostly Niagaran and Michigan Stray) were converted to                gas storage fields, and play an important part in meeting Michigan's                high winter demands for natural gas today (see                  Storage ).                    A gas well                starts with a drilling permit from the  Michigan Department of Environmental                Quality (DEQ) ,                Geological Survey Division. The DEQ has jurisdiction over spacing,                drilling, deepening, plugging, reworking and abandonment of all                wells. After the well is drilled and before production begins the                DEQ classifies each well as gas or oil. Natural gas well regulation                is split between the DEQ and the Michigan Public Service Commission                (MPSC). Before a gas well begins producing the producer, or operator,                must apply to the MPSC for a Standard Wellhead Connection Permit                (see                  Forms  page) per                  rules  and                  laws . An Allowable Withdrawal Order is issued with the permit                for all non-Antrim gas wells. Gas wells producing from the Antrim                formation are treated differently because they are low-producers                and generally not individually metered. The Allowable Withdrawal                Order contains 12-month, 6-month and 1-month allowable production                limits. The allowable production limits are based on 17 1/2% of                the calculated absolute open flow (the amount that could flow or                vent from an unrestricted well) as determined by a well flow test.                The Commission has approved allowable production limits up to 25%                of the calculated absolute open flow on a case-by-case basis if                it can be shown that the increased allowable will not create waste                or damage the well.                The MPSC monitors the production of gas wells under its rules                for                  Production and Transmission of Natural Gas  (per                  Act 9 of 1929  and                  Act 3 of 1939 ). Well operators file monthly production reports                with the MPSC for each gas well or unitized area. For Antrim gas                fields where the production from the wells is commingled through                a single meter for the field, the reports also include the number                of wells producing which allows average per well production to be                calculated. MPSC production records are available to the public                at the MPSC office. A brief  annual                summary  format and  monthly                gas production report  formats are available for downloading,                Non-Antrim gas fields with more than one well are prorated by                the MPSC. The purpose of proration is to protect correlative rights,                provide for equitable purchasing and taking of natural gas from                a common source of supply, ensure that each producer recovers production                in proportion to the recoverable gas under his land and to prevent                waste. Proration keeps each gas well in a field from producing more                than its fair share of the total field production. MPSC Staff use                field index rating percentages to monitor production imbalances                for each well producing in a prorated field. Field index rating                percentages are determined for each prorated well and are typically                based on reserve estimates and well flow tests. If production imbalances                for a prorated well become too large, production from wells within                that field are restricted to bring the field back into balance.

Although the regulation of the railroad industry                  provided years of drama in Texas politics, the historical significance                  of the Texas Railroad Commission rests on its authority over the                  Texas energy industry. The discovery of oil in Texas in 1901 electrified                  the entire nation and changed Texas forever. In the end, the small                  agency created to regulate the state’s rails became a national                  power.                  Early Days                 Oil springs and tar pits had been known by Texas Indians. The                  Indians occasionally used the oozings to treat rheumatism or skin                  diseases, and taught these folk remedies to the early white settlers                  as well. The Americans also used the surface oil as axel grease                  and on a small scale for lighting and fuel.                  Petroleum first began to be developed for commercial use in lighting                  (kerosene and other illuminating oils) after the 1859 discoveries                  at Titusville, Pennsylvania. Illumination remained the primary                  commercial use of petroleum until around 1900.                  The first deliberate oil strike in Texas was at Oil Springs,                  near Nacogdoches, in 1866. This first Texas oil well was capable                  of producing ten barrels a day. However, production in Pennsylvania                  was much cheaper than in remote Texas, and it would be several                  decades before drillers returned to the area.                  Questions of regulation arose with the developing industry. In                  1875, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court handed down a key decision                  in the history of oil regulation, ruling that oil and gas should                  be classified under the same rules governing the hunting of wild                  game. Under common law, a wild animal was not owned by anyone,                  because it could roam wherever it pleased. Therefore, whoever                  captured the animal on his own land became the owner of that animal.                                 Under this  rule                  of capture , oil belonged to the person under whose property                  it lay. The Pennsylvania decision blazed the trail for the ruthless                  exploitation of the nation’s oil resources over the next                  60 years. Oil lay in pools under the ground that could overlap                  the property of many persons. There was no incentive to leave                  oil in the ground when the entire pool could be pumped out by                  a well on a neighbor’s property. Thus, people competed to                  pump as much oil as possible as quickly as possible, lest the                  riches be “stolen” by a more enterprising neighbor.                  The look of an oil boom town was a forest of derricks, placed                  as close together as possible.                  The first successful well in Texas was drilled in Brown County                  in 1880. The Brown County well produced about 100 barrels a day.                  This oil was still not competitive with Pennsylvania oil for commercial                  purposes. It was used mostly as a lubricant or for medicinal purposes.                                 In 1894, crews drilling for water in Corsicana struck oil instead.                   Wildcatters                   headed for the area, which would become the first significant                  commercial oil venture in Texas. By the end of 1896, a well had                  been drilled that produced 22 barrels a day, and it was evident                  that more strikes were there for the taking.                  The result was chaos. In 1897, so many wells were drilled in                  Corsicana that production flooded the market, which was limited                  to local use and a few shipments to Austin and Dallas for use                  in making gas. Moreover, production exceeded the capacity of the                  state’s one refinery at Sour Lake. Operators with no market                  for their oil just poured the excess on the ground and kept pumping.                  The price of oil fell to less than 50 cents a barrel.                                                                                 Laborers laid pipeline by                        machine if they could, by hand if they had to                                                   To stem the waste and contamination of their city, Corsicana                  town leaders sought the services of Joseph Cullinan of Pennsylvania.                  A successful oil-man, Cullinan contracted to construct pipelines,                  storage tanks, and a refinery. The Corsicana operation was the                  beginning of modern oil refining in Texas. The company took the                  name of the Magnolia Petroleum Company, later known as Mobil.                  Cullinan and town leaders also worked on creating a market for                  the oil, promoting the use of oil over coal for fuel in railway                  locomotives and other industries, of oil-based products such as                  asphalt, and of natural gas for illumination.                  The strategy worked. Prices rose back to 98 cents a barrel, and                  useful production soared. While production in Corsicana peaked                  at over 800,000 barrels in 1900, the field remained commercially                  viable. The first oil field in Texas continues to produce today.                                 The Corsicana experience also prompted the state’s first                  attempt to regulate the industry. In 1899, the Texas legislature                  passed a law that required operators to  case                  off  oil and gas wells to prevent contamination of ground water,                  required that abandoned wells be plugged, and forbade letting                  gas escape into the air.

The litany of woes is long:  layoffs, abysmal rig count levels, stacked rigs rusting away, fallen tax revenues, etc.  The worst is hopefully behind us.  Is there reason for optimism now?  Yes, we have entered the recovery, which, slow as it may be, is at least a recovery.     Rather than fuss about statistics of the recovery and what the rig count is today versus two months or one year ago,  this report looks at what is new on the horizon in the oil patch.  This paper discusses some of the new developments that are mostly technology driven that are creating new  ""dimensions""  in opportunity for oil and gas development in Louisiana and the rest of the U.S.     For the purposes of this discussion, the term  ""producing states""  refers to the southern producing states of Louisiana, Texas, Oklahoma, Mississippi, and Alabama. Though there are some significant differences from region to region based on such variations as geology, geography, and politics, all principal producing states have much in common.  Details and examples discussed in this paper are taken mostly from Louisiana and the Department of Natural Resources (DNR), but the concepts and principles generally apply to most producing states.  Major topics covered are:   New state drilling incentives   New technology and finding what we missed   The potential of subsalt plays in the Gulf of Mexico and onshore   Offshore development   Louisiana Energy Access System (LEAS)   Retaining marginal production & protecting the environment--the Louisiana Oilfield Site Restoration Act   Compressed natural gas (CNG) motor fuel     New State Drilling Incentives   Recognizing the importance of the oil and gas industry to the economies of the producing states and the sustained struggle the industry has been having for more than ten years, the producing states have been trying to find a way to give the industry some relief at the state level.  Thus, all of the producing states in the Gulf Coast area have either just enacted or are on the verge of enacting new drilling and production incentives.     Louisiana's new incentives package was passed in the 1994 regular session of the Legislature this summer.  Its provisions are very similar to those of all of the producing states in our area.  Act 2 of the 1994 Regular Session created the following incentives.     1. Any oil well certified as a stripper well (0 - 10 barrels per day) shall be exempt from severance tax in any month in which the average posted price for a 30-day period is less than $20.00 per barrel.   2. On any horizontally drilled well or any horizontal recompletion from which production commences after July 31, 1994, all severance tax shall be suspended for a period of 24 months or until payout of well cost is achieved, whichever comes first.  Payout of well cost shall be the cost of completing the well to commencement of production.   3. For oil and gas wells returned to service after being inactive for 2 or more years or having 30 days or less of production during the past 2 years, production shall be exempt from severance tax for a period of 5 years.  Application for this exemption must be made during the period of July 31, 1994 through June 30, 1996.   4. Wells drilled to a true vertical depth of more than 15,000 feet, where production commences after July 31, 1994, shall be exempt from severance tax for 24 months from the date production begins, or until payout of well cost, whichever comes first.   5. All severance tax on production from certified new oil and natural gas discovery wells is suspended for a period of 24 months from the date of completion or until recovery of payout of well cost, whichever comes first.  The well must be completed between September 30, 1994 and September 30, 1996.     These drilling and production incentives in Louisiana and similar ones in Texas and surrounding states are too new to determine their impact.  Analysis of data over the next couple of years will be necessary before any firm conclusions can be made.     New Technology and Finding What We Missed   The preceding tax incentives will hopefully keep some older marginal wells in production and make it more economical to drill some new wells.  Now let us turn our attention to those resources that are out there still waiting for a drill bit to find, and some of the new methods and technology to help determine the right place to put a drill bit.     Historical Evolution of the Industry 1,2,3   New ideas and technology are reshaping the ways industry goes about looking for oil and gas today.  Briefly examining how oil and gas exploration and development evolved in the U.S.,  Louisiana is a good example to illustrate historical industry trends. Since the early days of production, there have been two groups that have brought the industry to where it is today--independent drillers and major oil companies, or, independents and majors.     Traditionally the major oil and gas companies (i.e., national and international corporations such as Texaco, Exxon, Royal Dutch Shell, British Petroleum, etc.) have utilized their financial and technological resources to develop primarily large volume, high grade deposits that have high up-front exploration and development costs but yield lower overall costs of production.  The problem for Louisiana and for the U.S. is that most of the remaining large field resources are located in frontier areas such as deep offshore and the Arctic within the U.S., or overseas in areas such as the Middle East and the former Soviet Union.  This is where the thrust of the new exploration of the majors is directed.     Historically in the U.S., as the majors shift their focus and resources on to the next frontier area, the independents with their lower overhead and operating costs have swept in behind the majors, developing the smaller fields not big enough to be economical for the majors and buying up properties and production the majors no longer wish to pursue.   Note, this is not intended to imply that independents are never involved in frontier exploration.   The majors happen to be the ones that have the vast resources to expend on developing new expensive resources and technology, often proprietary.  Eventually, this technology filters its way down to the independents as costs fall, and the independents apply it with gusto once it becomes accessible to them.     Examination of Louisiana's production history supports this historical evolution of oil and gas development.  The majors' thrust has gone from frontier to frontier in the state--shallow North Louisiana to deeper  South Louisiana onshore to state offshore to shallow federal offshore to deep water Gulf of Mexico--in their quest for the big, lucrative deposits.  Though the independents have followed this North to South trend, few have the resources to venture very far into the Gulf so far.  Additionally, the independents remain deeply entrenched in  all  of the older producing fields of the state; whereas, the majors have increasingly reduced their presence in the older fields.     Research led by Dr. William L. Fisher, Director of the Bureau of Economic Geology at the University of Texas at Austin, indicates that of the remaining oil fields to be discovered in the U.S., about 60% by volume and more than 95% by number are projected to be small to modest size fields of the type historically pursued by small companies (i.e., independents) with limited financial and technological resources. 1     What We Missed 1, 3-10   The significance of the preceding discussion is that the historical evolution of the way we have explored and developed oil and gas in the U.S. has led us to miss a lot of what is in the ground.  There is a school of thought led by Dr. Fisher that supports the prospects for an extremely large potential reserve base.  Dr. Fisher states, and history supports, that the major oil companies' historical approach to exploration and development, including such past practices as uniform well spacing and the pursuit of only large fields, along with the assumption of reservoir homogeneity, has resulted in the inefficient development of the ultimate oil and gas resource base, particularly that in smaller fields ignored by the majors.     This vast collection of small fields and bypassed portions of larger fields could potentially contain as much recoverable oil and gas as has already been produced. There is probably more of the extensive geological, seismic, and other technical data needed for this second search for oil available in Louisiana than in any other producing province in the country.     New Technology   Technology is constantly evolving.  Two recent developments in technology will have a profound impact on developing America's oil and gas resource base:  three-dimensional (3-D) seismology and horizontal drilling.  The former helps to better see and thus find what is in the ground, and the latter helps recover more once it has been found.     In the past the only way to produce oil or gas once it was found was to poke a hole in the ground with a vertical well.  Each vertical well has a limited radius of the producing reservoir it can drain, depending on fluid viscosity, reservoir porosity and other characteristics.  Thus, numerous vertical wells may be required to efficiently produce a reservoir.  The advent of horizontal drilling technology has enabled a single horizontal well to be drilled instead of a number of vertical wells.  Properly placed, a single horizontal well bore can cut through hundreds or even thousands of feet of producing sand or rock.  This larger production bore enables some horizontal wells to have three to five times the daily production and reserves than vertical wells.  A higher production rate translates into higher cash flow and a quicker return on investment.     Alas, the advantages of a horizontal well come at a premium.  A horizontal well is a lot more expensive than a vertical well.  A single horizontal well may cost up to as much as four vertical wells. 11,12   Additionally, reservoir dimensions and characteristics may be such in many situations that vertical wells are a better choice.  Applications that are most favorable for horizontal wells are: 11     Low reservoir rock matrix permeability (ability to conduct fluid flow through the interconnections of its pore spaces) especially in the horizontal plane   Low reservoir fracture permeability (i.e., chalk formations)   When intrusion of gas or water can be expected to interfere with recovery   Oil that has not yet migrated to a conventional trap and remains in the source rock   Injection of fluids or heat into oil or tar sand reservoirs to improve recovery     Drilling any well is an expensive proposition; drilling a horizontal well is a very expensive proposition.  Proper placement of the horizontal well bore is critical.  The advent of downhole logging, telemetry, motors, and steering enables the well bore to be placed where it is intended.  And, such things as 3-D seismology help determine where  ""intended""  should be. 13     Besides being expensive, drilling a well is an almost random way to find oil, and it is a one shot deal.  If it misses, it could be because it was drilled too shallow, too far north, south, east, or west; or it could be because there is no oil or gas down there.  If it does strike oil or gas, drilling more wells to define the boundaries of the reservoir is also very expensive and imprecise.  Therefore, the more questions that can be answered and the better the geology is understood before a well is ever drilled, the more efficient that first wildcat and subsequent development wells can be placed.  3-D seismology is a technological breakthrough that enables scientists and engineers  ""see""  deep below the surface electronically with sophisticated computers.     Going back into old fields with 3-D seismology, we are finding that there is a lot of oil and gas that was not found the first time around.  So far, with the possible exception of subsalt plays discussed later in this paper, it does not  appear  that any really huge reservoirs were missed in old producing fields.  The reason, of course, is that the big deposits are the easiest to find with older technology as well as with the new.  On the other hand, the cumulative volume of small deposits that were missed could be enormous, as previously mentioned.  These small deposits can be individual reservoirs never found or parts or branches of large producing reservoirs that were missed.     Because 3-D seismology is extremely expensive, its use is mostly confined to the majors, and currently even they primarily restrict its use to the most promising targets indicated by older, cheaper methods.  Hence, the full implications of this new technology will take years to unfold.  This leads to the next topic:     The potential of subsalt plays in the Gulf of Mexico and onshore 14,15   From time to time, significant new developments occur that alter long-standing beliefs, or sometimes just old ways of thinking.  We may be on the verge of one of those developments that could change our whole concept about producing formations below salt caps.  Until recently, it has commonly been assumed that there were no sediments below salt, or that if there were, seismic evidence of them would be impossible to discern in seismic data due to the salt-sediment velocity contrasts.     Recent advances in geophysical technology have shed new light on this subject. As nature has grudgingly revealed a few more secrets, researchers have found that underground salt comes in more different shapes than previously thought.  Many of those configurations have long horizontal reaches below which sediments lie.     Recent wildcats drilled to put this new knowledge to the test have not only proven the existence of sediments below the salt,  but have now found oil and gas as well.   In October of 1993, the  Oil & Gas Journal  reported a wildcat drilled in the Gulf of Mexico in 370 feet of water off Louisiana had test rates as high as 7256 barrels per day of oil and 9.9 million cubic feet per day of natural gas.  This well was drilled by Phillips Petroleum Co. and partners Anadarko Petroleum Corp. and Amoco Production Co.  Since that time a few additional wildcats have been drilled with promising results.     This, obviously, is a most promising development.  We are just at the beginning point of the learning curve of this new geophysical knowledge.  Engineers and scientists have developed a new capability to  ""see""  down into formations that once revealed no more than fog on seismic data. The sophisticated computer analysis and simulation that converts the once useless data into meaningful results needs much further refinement.  Furthermore, engineers and scientists need more experience in learning how to properly interpret the data which can only be proved out by drilling more wildcats.     So, what does this all mean?  Well, the implications are enormous.  Salt deposits lie under nearly two-thirds of the shallow waters in the Gulf of Mexico.  This new development  could  open up a whole new realm of production potential in the Gulf of Mexico.  Not only that, but subsurface salt is not confined to the Gulf of Mexico or to offshore.  Hence, this activity in the Gulf offers potential for new exploration and production potential well beyond the Gulf.  That is good news indeed.     Offshore Development   Now that we have taken a glimpse at some of the exciting new developments in technology and one of its nurturing grounds--the offshore Gulf of Mexico, we will shift focus and discuss the actual utilization of our offshore resources.     One of the most promising long term sources of supply of oil and gas to the citizens and industry of the United States is the offshore territory.  The following list illustrates Louisiana's leadership role in offshore development.     Pioneering Events in Louisiana offshore Development.   1910--The first over-water well ever drilled was in Caddo Lake, LA.    1933--The first offshore well  drilled was in Louisiana in 12 feet of water, approximately 3000 feet off the beach near Creole, LA.    1937-- The first offshore field developed in open, unprotected waters was the Creole Field in Louisiana located in state offshore waters 26 feet deep and 1.5 miles from shore.   1947--The first successful well drilled completely out of sight of land was on Ship Shoal block 32 which is 45 miles south of Morgan City, LA.   Louisiana federal offshore territory is the most extensively developed and matured offshore territory in the world.    Louisiana federal offshore territory has produced 90.8% of the 9.5 billion barrels of crude oil and condensate and 84.5% of the 102 trillion cubic feet of natural gas extracted from all federal waters from the beginning of time through the end of 1992.     It is only a dream to think that the U.S. will ever again be independent of foreign sources of oil or even gas.  (Canada currently supplies nearly 10% of U.S. natural gas supply.)  We can, though, become less dependent if we utilize all of the resources we have.  This means it is foolish beyond comprehension to exhaust whatever oil and gas is off the coasts of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama and not even allow companies to look off any other coasts.  This brings up  Drilling Bans.     Drilling Bans vs. Drilling Incentives   One key difference between the southern producing states and other coastal states is the attitude toward offshore development.  The Gulf Coast producing states of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama are aggressively supporting the exploration and development of both state and federal offshore waters off their coasts.  In the current session of Congress, our Congressional delegation, led by Louisiana's Senator Johnston, has been pushing for federal tax and royalty relief to stimulate development of deep water deposits in the federal offshore.     Contrast this attitude with that of California's legislature, which in early September passed legislation that was awaiting the Governor's signature to ban all future development in California's state offshore waters.  This is consistent with California's recent actions at the federal level banning future development of California's federal offshore territory.     Then, there are all of the eastern seaboard states that do not have any offshore production and little, if any, onshore production. They are doing everything within their power to ensure that there never will be exploration, much less production off their coasts by successfully invoking state and federal drilling bans.     Unfortunately, these states that have no oil and gas production and do not want to have any, are not willing to give up their insatiable appetite for energy, most of which is supplied by oil and gas.  This summer the U.S. reached its highest levels of oil imports in history, with foreign oil supplying over 50% of U.S. supply.     The record of offshore development clearly shows that the odds for environmental disaster from spilled oil is hundreds or thousands of times greater from oil tankers than from oil well production platforms.  And, though there are environmental considerations, what kind beach or water fouling do you get from a natural gas spill!     Oil and gas development should always be done in an environmentally responsible  manner to ensure that our coasts and wetlands are protected with state and federal environmental regulators looking over industry's shoulder.  But, to bury our heads in the sand and declare that by definition offshore production is bad, is misguided and dangerous.  While all this foolishness is taking place, it takes more and more tankers to bring in all that foreign oil.     Louisiana Energy Access System (LEAS)   The Louisiana Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has extensive records and data on oil and gas drilling permits, well completions, production, transportation, lease records, state royalties, etc.  DNR is the source of most Louisiana data ultimately reported in publications by others such as the U.S. Department of Energy, the American Petroleum Institute, the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission, and numerous commercial publications.  DNR data is also widely accessed directly by members of industry in DNR offices.     DNR has developed a system to extend to the public the capability to more easily access public oil and gas records.  Specifically, the Department offers dial-up on-line access to oil and gas information via the Louisiana Energy Access System (LEAS).  This system involves the transmitting of designated types of the Department's public computerized oil and gas records directly to the customer's place of business.  This ""at office"" access eliminates the need to travel to DNR offices, decreases the customer's time away from his/her office, is less costly, eliminates waiting in line at DNR for an available terminal, and features easy access and increased system usage via a dedicated terminal.     LEAS works in conjunction with the customer's personal computer (PC), telephone modem, and PC communications software capable of communicating with the Department.  LEAS is available seven days a week, 24 hours a day.  LEAS charges are by connect time in minutes with no minimum or maximum monthly billing.  LEAS features system documentation, user technical training sessions and Help Desk Support.

Box 94396, Baton Rouge, Louisiana 70804-9396 Phone 504/342-4593     Retaining Marginal Production & Protecting the Environment -- the Oilfield Site estoration Act   An issue Louisiana and many of the producing states have recently been addressing is  orphan well legislation.   The primary objective of regulations of this type is to set up some kind of fund to properly plug old wells that have been improperly closed or abandoned to prevent leakage or contamination of underground aquifers or surface land and water if the responsible party can no longer be found or has insufficient financial capability to pay restoration costs.  There are currently 2225 orphaned wells in Louisiana.  Also provided are measures to reduce improper abandonment in the future and to restore sites where leakage has already occurred.     The 1993 Louisiana Legislature in cooperation with the oil and gas industry enacted the Oilfield Site Restoration Act.  It established a fund paid by industry through a fee on production of 1 cent per barrel of oil and condensate and 1/5 cent per thousand cubic feet of natural gas on production in Louisiana.  There is also an annual fee of $10 on non-producing wells, excluding temporarily abandoned or salt water disposal wells in stripper fields.  This will generate about $4.5 million per year. Currently, there is about $2.8  million in the fund.  The production fees are escalated 5% annually to offset production decline to hold the revenue constant, and the fund has a cap of $10 million.     Another provision of this Act has a secondary benefit that will help prevent premature abandonment of older production sites.  This provision allows the voluntary creation of site specific trust accounts for well abandonment liability that will cover the cost of properly closing a well when it is no longer productive.  The trust fund stays with the well and is transferred each time the well is sold.  The amount of funding established for each trust fund has to be reviewed by the newly established Oilfield Site Restoration Commission to make certain the funds will be sufficient to properly close the well.     Many of the large producers, mostly the major oil companies, are shifting their exploration and production activities out of  the state and into the deeper waters of the federal offshore territory and foreign countries.  As they do this, they often sell or shut-in small and marginal production properties within the state that are not economical for them to operate.  Small producers, with their lower overhead and operating costs, often desire these properties and can keep them in operation for many years.     Increased environmental awareness and government regulatory enforcement of well closures combined with increasing contingent liability risks associated with selling producing properties to a buyer who might not properly close a well has led to the premature abandonment of some producing properties.  The reason is obvious; a large operator may decide that the future liability risks of the buyer not properly closing a well outweigh the revenue gained by selling the property.  In such a case, the large operator properly plugs the wells to guarantee no future liability, and the remaining production life is lost forever.  The site specific trust fund provisions of this Act should help minimize these situations and keep more oil and gas in production.     Compressed Natural Gas Motor Fuel   The environmental advantages of natural gas have come into a new light in this country's drive for clean air.  And drive is just what most producing states want people to do with clean-burning, economical, domestically produced, compressed natural gas (CNG). With federal mandates to convert various fleets to alternative motor fuels under either the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 or the Energy Policy Act of 1992, most producing states have enacted state fleet conversion mandates and incentives. For the producing states of Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Texas, the alternative fuel preferred is compressed natural gas. Louisiana's initiatives are  summarized below:     1.  Executive Order No. EWE 93-9 , of March 29, 1993 by Governor Edwin Edwards, directed the Department of Natural Resources (DNR) to convert to natural gas a minimum of  500 vehicles and up to 1500 vehicles, which is approximately 25% of the state on-road vehicle fleet.  By the end of August 1994, approximately 125 vehicles had been converted to CNG.  This program is administered in DNR by the Technology Assessment Division.  Ecogas of Louisiana, Inc. was selected by competitive bid to make the vehicle conversions and ultimately build eight CNG/LNG (Liquefied Natural Gas) refueling stations accessible to the general public as well as to state government vehicles.  Ecogas finances all conversions and stations, recouping their costs through a surcharge on the fuel.   2. The Energy Division of DNR administers the Louisiana Alternative Fuels Conversion Loan Program, which is a low interest revolving loan program available to state and local government fleets to finance vehicle conversions to CNG, LNG, or LPG (liquefied petroleum gas).  Additional information on this program is available from :   Department of Natural Resources Energy Division P.O. Box 44156 Baton Rouge, LA 70804 Phone 504/342-1399   3.  Act 927 of 1990  provides for the conversion to alternative fuels of a certain percentage of state-owned vehicles, and for the regulation of compressed natural gas.   4.  Act 954 of 1990  provides for the conversion to alternative fuels of a certain percentage of vehicles owned by local governments.   5.  Act 531 of 1990  provides for the deregulation of direct sales of natural gas used in CNG fueled vehicles.   6.  Act 1060 of 1991  provides an income tax credit of 20% for conversion of vehicles to alternative fuels usage and for installation of refueling equipment for alternative fuels.   7.  Act 516 of 1991  provides for an alternate method of paying tax on liquefied petroleum gas and compressed natural gas when used as a motor vehicle fuel.   8.  Act 1067 of 1992  creates the Louisiana Natural Gas Marketing Commission within the Department of Natural Resources to promote and market natural gas, including the development of incentives to convert motor vehicles to natural gas.   9.  Act 666 of 1993  reduces the special fuels tax rate previously provided by Act 516 of 1991 to a flat rate of $150.00 per year or a variable rate of $0.16 per gasoline equivalent gallon.   10.  Act 7 of 1994  lowers the special fuels tax rate for school buses to one-half the rate specified in Act 666.     Conclusion   All may not be well in Oil and Gas Patch, USA, but there is a lot of activity and a lot of new things on the horizon.  The industry has suffered a great deal from more than ten years of low oil and gas prices, and those who are left are survivors, poised for recovery.  Producing state economies and state treasuries have suffered a lot, forcing states, whether they wanted to or not, to diversify and develop other sources of employment and revenue.  The petroleum resources of Louisiana and the nation, though, still have much to contribute to the prosperity of the state and the country.  The Department of Natural Resources continues a high level of activity in managing the valuable oil and gas resources of the state and ensuring that these resources are developed in an environmentally responsible manner.

Harline Utah Historical Quarterly  31 #3   With the end of World War II, interest in Utah's oil and gas possibilities was renewed. The annual well-completion rate during 1945, 1946, and 1947 was double the pre-1945 rate, and the stage was set for the birth of the state's commercial petroleum-producing industry. In contrast to the earlier years, there were numerous geologists who disagreed with the ""no-oil-in-Utah"" theory. A 1947 writer analyzing the resurge of interest in Utah's oil exploration noted, ""...we have not been able to find a geologist who denies that Utah has favorable structures for oil."" The past failure to obtain commercial production was attributed to drilling ""off-formation,"" inadequate equipment, and the absence of adequate knowledge or information.   The development of the Rangely oil field in northwestern Colorado caused interest in the early postwar period to center (although not exclusively) in the Uinta Basin. But the postwar explorations were no longer a simple matter of promoting a company with limited funds and sometimes doubtful skill. The ""Majors"" were active. The list included such companies as Phillips, Standard of California, Stanolind, Texas, Continental, Tidewater Associated, Pure Oil, Sinclair, Union Oil, Carter, and others. The Carter Company was one of the biggest operators in the Uinta Basin.   But the honor of bringing in the state's first commercial oil well went not to the ""Majors"" but to an ""Independent""—the Equity Oil Company. Ashley Valley No. 1, located about 10 miles southeast of Vernal, Utah, came in at 1:43 p.m., September 18, 1948, with an initial flow of about 300 barrels a day from a depth of 4,152 feet. It is interesting to note that J. L. (Mike) Dougan, president and general manager of Equity and a Salt Lake City resident, had been drilling for oil in Utah for over 25 years.   By the end of 1948, eight more wells were drilled, and in a little over a year development drilling of the field had been completed. Production from Utah's first commercial field, since discovery, has averaged slightly less than a million barrels a year from the approximately 30 wells within the field, and until 1957, Ashley Valley was the state's largest producing oil field.   Discovery of this first Utah commercial well touched off a vigorous drilling campaign. Unlike the earlier attempts, these drillings were not shallow depth drilling of 1,000 to 2,000 feet (falling short of what was now considered normal objectives), but rather 5,000 to 8,000 feet and in some instances even deeper. The result was the discovery of the Roosevelt field in 1949, by the Carter Oil Company; the short-lived Gusher field by the California company in 1950; the Red Wash field by Standard of California, and the Duchesne field by the Carter Oil Company, in 1951; and the Brennan Bottom field by the Gulf Oil Corporation and the Chapita Wells field by Continental Oil Company, in 1953.   Of all these Uinta Basin discoveries, the Red Wash was the most important. By 1952, the year after discovery, it was producing half as much as the Ashley Valley field and, at this writing, the Red Wash and its neighboring field, Walker Hollow, are producing over five times as much as Utah's first commercial field, the Ashley Valley. Unique among the Uinta Basin discoveries was the Roosevelt field with its high pour-point, highly paraffinic crude that sets into solid wax at ordinary room temperatures.   But the big find, which was to move the state from anonymous inclusion in the ""all other"" column in national crude-oil production reports to a separate Utah listing, was still to come. This find was to occur in the complex of fields known as Greater Aneth located on either side of the San Juan River in the Paradox Basin in the extreme southeast corner of the state. The Boundary Butte field, discovered in 1947 almost on the Utah-Arizona border, had not been termed commercial. Shell Oil Company had made previous field discoveries in the Bluff field in 1951, at Desert Creek in 1954, and at Akah in 1955, but extensive drilling in the region did not begin until after the Aneth discovery. The well which set off the exploration boom was drilled at a depth of 5,896 feet in Section 23, Township 40 South, Range 24 East by the Texas Company. Initial flow was at the rate of 1,704 barrels per day—which helps explain the excitement it created. The confirmation well was completed by Superior Oil Company. By the end of the year, 20 producing wells had been completed in the field, with daily initial flows ranging from 300 to 1,900 barrels and averaging 800 barrels. Operators responsible for the drilling were the Texas Company, Superior Oil Company, Three States Natural Gas Company, Shell Oil Company, and Gulf Oil Corporation, which reads like a roster of the nation's foremost oil companies.   Greater Aneth actually includes five fields, Cahone Mesa (the smallest producer), White Mesa, Ratherford, Aneth, and McElmo Creek (the largest producer). The approximately 500 producing wells in these five related fields accounts for 70 per cent of Utah's present crude-oil production.   With the discovery and development of the Greater Aneth fields, Utah moved into the nation's top dozen producing states. In 1959, there were only 10 states which produced more crude oil than Utah's 40.1 million barrels, certainly a far cry from the half-million barrels produced in Utah in 1949—the first full year after commercial oil production began. In fact, in 1959, the value of Utah crude-oil production surpassed the value of the state's copper production, the most important mineral produced in the state (partly because of the prolonged work stoppage in the Utah copper industry). Since 1960, crude-oil production has ranked second (only copper is higher) and ahead of each of Utah's other minerals in value of product produced.   Since 1959, total barrels of crude oil produced within the state have declined somewhat. The decrease is due to (1) the usual production pattern of new fields to decrease after the initial peak and (2) the inauguration of conservation measures by the industry and the Utah State Oil and Gas Conservation Commission.   Expansion of Utah production in the future will depend primarily on the discovery of new fields. If oil and gas-leasing activity, rate of exploratory drilling, and the opinion of professional geologists are any indication, the possibility of such finds appears to be good. The discovery of the Lisbon field, south of Moab in 1960, is an example.   In August, 1959, the Pure Oil Company spudded in their Northwest Lisbon No.1 (later changed to No. 1 USA). On January 5, 1960, the attention of the entire United States industry was focused on the Paradox Basin when the well became a producer. In fact, the Northwest Lisbon field was designated as the ""discovery of the year"" by the national petroleum industry, because of the size of the industry, because of the size of the field and because the area had heretofore been considered a poor prospect for oil and gas exploration. Pure Oil's exploration techniques are a good example of the approach now being used by the industry and bode well for the future of the Utah crude-oil-producing industry. To illustrate, the Four Corners Geological Society had this to say:     Pure has shown how effective a team effort combining land, engineering geophysics, and geology can be...When Major oil reserves become hard to find, this is not the time to reduce the professional staff, but rather a time to encourage imaginative thinking with full utilization of all exploration departments.                                              Previous   |   Table of Contents   |   Utah History To Go   |   Top of Page   |   Next                                                               |  Contact Us   |   Bibliography   |  Site Map  |"
GX030-15-9256080	Testimony of David K. Garman    Assistant Secretary , Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy    U.S. Department of Energy         U.S. Energy Security: on     Options to Decrease Petroleum Use in the  Tran s portation  Sector Programs      for   Octo November 1, ber  23,  2001         M Introduction: r. Chairman, thank you for inviting me to discuss  one of  our  nation’s   most critical energy issues – our growing dependence on oil , and  the its   related  energy security implications.    opportunities to reduce petrol eum use in the transportation sector .    In keeping with the invitation, I will focus my remarks on options to decrease petroleum use in the transportation sector .            We often think of energy being consumed in three end-use sectors:    buildings, industrial, and transportation.    Of the three, transportation  consumes 27  percent  of  our total  energy and  exhibits the least variation in energy sources and uses.    The most striking feature of the transportation sector is its nearly complete dependence on petroleum as an energy source.    Our transportation sector is 9 5 percent  dependent on petroleum, and it consumes 67  percent  of all the petroleum used in our nation .          Th e situation we face today is  in some ways  more acute  than it was  during the so-called “oil crises” of the  1970 s.    In 1975, we had net imports of 5.8 million barrels per day, or 36 percent of our needs.    During the first seven months of 2001,  net  import s averaged  10.9 million barrels per day, or 55 percent of our demand.            Over the past 18 years the nation’s oil use for transportation has grown at an average annual rate of about 2 percent, with fuel use by heavy and light trucks both growing at a rate greater than 4 percent in the last decade.    Present consumption for highway vehicles is about 10 million barrels per day.     Last year, oil imports increased our balance of payments deficit by  $109  billion .         Our future dependence on imports is expected to grow because of our higher consumption, and a decline in domestic production.    Today, the U.S. uses 26 percent of the world’s oil  but it produces  only 12 percent of the total global supply  and has only 2 percent of the  world ’s  petroleum reserves  (at current prices).         There is no single strategy that  will  free us from this dependency in the near term.    Clearly:         ·          We must increase vehicle efficiency through the development and introduction of new technology.    ·          We must  promote  domestic oil  and gas  production.    ·          We should  diversify our energy sources.    ·          We should enhance the security and efficiency of our fuel delivery infrastructure. .             The first chart illustrates our decline in domestic oil production relative to the increased demand needed to fuel the growing numbers of automobiles, light trucks, and heavy trucks.    The growth in numbers of light truck passenger vehicles--which includes vans, pickups, and sport utility vehicles--is dramatically apparent in this chart.         My second chart is another view of domestic oil production measured against projected transportation oil use, with some policy actions superimposed to illustrate the challenge of closing the gap.    New oil production from the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) would certainly make a difference … but it clearly does not close the gap.    Research and development (R&D) that incrementally improves the efficiency of vehicles helps as well, but “business as usual” is also insufficient to close the gap.         Clearly, we face a serious challenge, and “business as usual” approaches are not enough.         The Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles: Some Lessons Learned         The current approach is perhaps best embodied in the program known as the “Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles,” or PNGV.    One of the goals of the PNGV program was to develop, by 2004, a production-prototype family sedan with three times the fuel efficiency of a comparable 1994 model without sacrificing affordability and marketability. Unfortunately, the program will not reach this goal.         Begun in 1993, the  PNGV program  linked the resources of seven federal agencies with those of the auto industry and acad emia to conduct cooperative  R&D  on a portfolio of technologies  with   the   potential to dramatically increase fuel economy in passenger vehicles.    Among the agencies participating in PNGV ,  The Office of Transportation ,  Technologies within   the  Department of Energy (DOE)  contributes the  vast   majority (86   % percent  in FY 2001) of the  funding  that  is   directly  relevant to the PNGV goals  in accordance with the  plans developed by  the PNGV  government-industry  t echnical  t eams.            The  PNGV program has delivered some technologies that can be seen in the market today.    Some of these results include:         ·          New composite and thermoplastic materials -   General Motors  (GM)  is using  composites to  produce the truck bed for its 2001 Silverado, saving 50 pounds over earlier models equipped with steel  truckbeds truck beds .    DaimlerChrysler  incorporated a recyclable thermoplastic hardtop in its 2001 Jeep Wrangler.         ·          Increased application of lightweight aluminum for automobile construction –  Ford is including  412 pounds of aluminum  in t he  Lincoln LS, saving 188 pounds  over   relative to  conventional construction .    GM is utilizing hydroformed aluminum door, deck and hood panels to reduce the weight of Cadillac, Oldsmobile and Chevrolet vehicles.    DaimlerChrysler experimented with an aluminum-intensive vehicle and introduced the Prowler in model year 1998.     These weight savings are accomplished without compromising safety.         ·          New manufacturing techniques -   GM Saturn vehicles are using axle shafts produced with a process controller developed with DOE support.    The resulting shaft is lighter and requires less energy to produce.    Ford has installed and is evaluating a similar controller.          While PGNV-derived hybrid-electric technologies are not yet in the market, they are expected soon.    DaimlerChrysler, Ford and  GM   have announced  that hybrid electric drive options will be available in popular market segments during  the  2003-2004  time frame : Dodge Durango (2003), Ford Escape (2003), Chevrolet Silverado (2004) and Ford Explorer ( perhaps in 2005 ).    In general, these configurations  are expected to  deliver equal or better performance while also improving fuel economy by between 15 and 35 percent. In some situations, the fuel economy gain will be even greater.          For example, the Ford Escape hybrid will offer the performance of a standard V-6, while achieving nearly double the fuel economy of a conventional Escape in city driving.    E ach of these hybrids  contains   will incorporate  technologies that were developed or enhanced through  the PNGV   DOE’s  program.    In contrast to the hybrids being offered  in low volumes  by Toyota and Honda,  we are told that  each of these  U.S.-built  hybrids will be available as options in popular, high volume market segments, and  will  be built on the same assembly lines as conventional models.            These are important results, but we will clearly have to significantly accelerate the pace of getting these and more dramatic technologies into the marketplace if we expect to make a substantial impact on our petroleum dependency.         Earlier this year Secretary Abraham expressed his concerns about the orientation and goals of this program.    He questioned the wisdom of pursuing production prototypes of passenger sedans when most new vehicle sales in this country are in the light truck category, including minivans, SUVs and pickups.    And, as we have seen, the PNGV program will not meet a key goal.    We maintain that it is not enough to validate new technology.    The advances of this program must find their way into the market, and they must deliver clearly demonstrable benefits to society.          The Secretary’s observations earlier this year are consistent with the findings of the National Research Council’s (NRC) annual review of the PNGV program, published this past August.    The NRC found that a  redefinition of the “PNGV charter and goals” is needed to “better reflect societal needs and the ability of a cooperative, precompetitive R&D program to address these needs successfully.”            Our experience with PNGV has taught us other lessons as well:         ·          The “industry partnership” approach is a good approach.    DOE and its predecessor agencies have been involved in supporting advanced automotive fuel economy research for over three decades.    In the past, R&D were conducted through contracts with individual industry partners.    PNGV pulled together ongoing advanced transportation programs under its partnership umbrella, providing valuable alignment and focus to the R&D.    PNGV differed significantly from earlier efforts with a greater reliance on technical teams comprised of scientists and engineers from government, industry and the laboratories to establish technical targets and develop detailed research roadmaps.          ·          Contrary to the criticism often leveled that government doesn’t know when to stop funding a technology that lacks promise, the PNGV partners have been successful in “deselecting” technologies, thanks in part to the approach to cost sharing.    S tirling engines, gas turbines, ultracapacitors (for  energy  storage),  and  flywheels  are all among the technologies that have been “deselected” for PGNV vehicles.            ·          R e search to develop technologies   eventually judged “less promising”  for automotive application  should not be considered a failure , since research  results  can lead  to the  c onsideration of these technologies for use in other applications.    For example, ultracapacitors  from our automotive efforts have  now  been selected as appropriate for heavy bus applications and  may be utilized in power electronics ;  gas turbine developers are employing technology  advanced  for use in transportation  for  stationary power source  applications  instead .            ·          The  PNGV program  R&D planned and guided by  our PNGV partners has  had some difficulty  responding to new technology opportunities  due to the  inflexibility of the  budgetary cycle ,  where in which  initial planning and  actual  execution may be separated by as much as 3 years.    And generally ,   only  $500,000 or  10   % percent  of appropriated R&D funds , whichever is lower,   may be  redirected without congressional approval.    When  S s uch approval  is sought, it   takes at least 6 months and is never assured.    The PNGV experience suggests  value in consider ation ing   of  multi-year funding for  major R&D efforts , and providing more flexibility in the appropriation language .         ·          The  multi-agency  funding of projects was approached primarily through capitalizing on existing, ongoing research, with the expectation of research redirection and budget augmentation.    Redirection of research did not occur to the extent expected ,  and Congress did not  grant   provide  augmentation of  the agencies ’  budget s.   to all agencies .     In retrospect ,  a modest (5   % percent ) central budget would have been valuable to apply to  “ gap filler ”  research  that  could  respond ing  to new developments until more traditional funding sources could be tapped.         The PNGV program is near the end of its 10-year charter, and as we would with any program coming to the end of its charter, we are assessing whether it represents the best approach to reducing our petroleum dependence.            The Need for a More Aggressive Approach toward Hydrogen and Fuel Cells         Secretary Abraham, at a recent DOE leadership meeting, asked us to take a bolder approach to our work.    He directed us to focus our efforts on programs that “revolutionize how we approach conservation and energy efficiency.”    He challenged us to “leapfrog the status quo and prepare for a future that, under any scenario, requires a revolution in how we find, produce and deliver energy.”         We need to do this, according to Secretary Abraham, “…not simply because many of our resources are depletable … not simply because we are increasingly dependent on energy from areas of the world that are periodically unstable … (and) not simply because questions surrounding climate change force us to confront policies that focus on a carbon-free society.”         “Success in this mission,” according to Secretary Abraham, “could well be one of the greatest contributions to our energy and national security for generations to come.”    He further asked us to seek “potentially abundant new sources of energy with dramatic environmental benefits.”         As a consequence of the Secretary’s challenge and the recommendations in the President’s National Energy Plan, we intend to be more aggressive in the pursuit of revolutionary, transforming technologies.    We view technology portfolio investments similar to the manner in which an investor would view a stock portfolio.    The portfolio as a whole can be conservative, with lower risks and modest returns.    Or it can be aggressive, with higher risk and potentially higher rewards.          The higher-risk, higher-reward strategy we have in mind leads to the use of fuel cells powered by domestically derived hydrogen.    While fuel cell technology is promising, there are significant technological barriers that must be overcome, not the least of which involve the cost and durability of fuel cells.    For example, a light duty passenger vehicle powered by a fuel cell is currently projected to cost between five and six times more than a comparable internal combustion engine-powered vehicle.    In addition, there are challenges involved in producing, moving, storing and dispensing hydrogen in an affordable manner.          The  EERE Department of Energy’s    Hydrogen Program  already  perform supports s  research and development in the areas of hydrogen production, storage and utilization.    C ooperative research includes  the development of off-board production of low-cost hydrogen through steam-methane reform ing of natural gas  at refueling stations.     This approach offers op portunities to produce hydrogen for fuel cell vehicles that can be cost competitive on a cents/mile basis with conventional gasoline vehicles.    With increasing amounts of natural gas  being consumed to generate electric power, production levels and infrastructure must be considered before adopting vehicle fuel strategies that depend on natural gas.    A However, a dvanced concepts can reduce hydrogen production costs even further.    With continued improvements in renewable power systems, hydrogen  w c ould be produced without significant carbon emissions and would further reduce our reliance on fossil fuels.    Recently ,  advances in the development of  low-weight high-pressure (5 , 000 psi) storage tanks  have  reduced the projected weight of hydrogen vehicles.    Recent b B reakthroughs in the development of transitional metal hydride storage systems offer  reduced size and pressure storage options for hydrogen that  will be important in supporting  may  accelerate   the  introduction  of fuel cell vehicles.    Continued progress over the next decade should lead to  economically competitive  refueling station networks and the deployment of hydrogen fuel   cell fleet vehicles and buses.              We believe the technical challenges we face represent a significant but acceptable risk, given the potential rewards of a hydrogen fuel cell transportation system.    But because our research is cost-shared with industry partners and funded in part with dollars appropriated by Congress, DOE alone cannot undertake this shift.    We will need your help, and the cooperation and participation of our industry partners.         We will work to  streamline and refocus our joint automotive R&D efforts to provide greater emphasis on those long-term technologies that offer major societal benefits .    While we will boost our efforts related to fuel cells and hydrogen, we will also maintain some of our  efforts in  combustion and emission control,  power electronics, advanced batteries ,   and   carbon-based materials , and advanced fuels .    However, r elatively mature technologies ,  such as  those related to  spark ignited engines  or natural gas engines,  will receive less federal emphasis; we expect that our private sector partners will assume the major burden of further development of the most promising  of  of these  mature technologies.            We understand that our private sector partners would welcome the increased flexibility that a  restructuring of the PGNV program  could provide, seeing opportunities to better align their efforts with market sectors where the best business cases  could   for advanced technologies can  be made.    Discussions are ongoing between industry and the Administration to  identify specific details of  a restructured,  refocused program.            We will be reshuffling our technology portfolio to be more aggressive, reorienting it to deliver a hydrogen/fuel cell future.    But we cannot afford to wait, nor should we wait, for the hydrogen/fuel cell solution.    As new  technologies  related to advanced internal combustion engines, exhaust aftertreatment, hybrid vehicle systems,  advanced petroleum based fuels , alternative fuels, and weight-reducing materials  are  demonstrated, we   will  work with industry to facilitate the ir   migrat ion  to the market ,  and    ultimately   reducing our  dependence   on  imported  petroleum .         Biofuels         We will also continue development of domestic biofuels as an alternative to imported petroleum.          Biofuels, in cluding ethanol and biodiesel , ha ve  been part of  DOE’s   portfolio   since the origin of the Department.    The Energy Security Act of 1978 created the Alcohol Fuels Office that supported ethanol R&D, as well as a program to financially support the development of an ethanol industry.    Today, that industry utilizes approximately 600 million bushels of corn each year to produce over 1.8  b illion gallons of ethanol.     A record number of new corn-to-ethanol plants  are  scheduled to begin production in 2001 ,  contribut ing  to the industry's ability to respond to growing market demand for clean burning octane  enhancers  and oxygenates.    Importantly, these new facilities will provide much-needed economic stimulus to rural communities faced with record low commodity prices and shrinking export markets.            This administration is continuing the support of ethanol at the national level.    Today,  ethanol can be used in gasoline blends at 10   percent  ethanol  –  90   percent  gasoline  (E10)  since no barrier exists in terms of vehicle avail ability ;  all  gasoline-fueled  cars are warranted for E10 .    The President’s National Energy Plan recommends an extension of  the ethanol excise tax exemption.    The report further acknowledges that ethanol is the most widely used biofuel.            C orn (and other gr ain) starch to ethanol is a technology that has  greatly  improve d  in efficiency over the years and is approaching a relatively high level of maturity.    Extraordinary growth in the near term is expected due to the decline in MTBE use.    To sustain significant growth in ethanol production, we will need to look beyond starch as the sole feedstock.         The Biomass R&D Act of 2000 has become an extremely important instrument in shaping the future direction of biofuels R&D at  DOE’s Office of  Energy Efficiency and Rene wable Energy  (EERE) .    It is also leading to much closer coordination  among  programs at the Department of Agriculture and  DOE .    The Act emanated from bill s  sponsored by Senator Richard Lugar of Indiana  and Representative Mark Udall of Colorado .    One of the  tenets of the Act is that a much greater research effort is needed to overcome “recalcitran t ” biomass.    In particular,   it directed that  the R&D programs on biomass conversion should be heavily pursued through the development of more efficient methods of pr etreatment and enzyme development (sometimes referred to as the sugars platform), the  improved  ability to ferment these multiple sugars to ethanol and other industrial chemicals (sometimes referred to as the yeast platform), and the  production  of multiple  products from these sugars as one approach to a “biorefinery of the future.”            2.    What is EERE doing in the area of  Bi The EERE R&D program in ethanol has been aligned to support the provisions of the Act.    Major partnerships have been developed with two  of the leading enzyme manufacturers in the world.    One of these companies recently announced that  it has  reduced the cost of production by a factor of two, well on  its   way to the  goal of having a  ten-fold  reduction in costs of enzymes  used for the producti on of ethanol.           A  commercial, biomass - to - ethanol  technology  could play a major role in reducing our reliance on imported oil.    Ethanol can be used as an octane enhancer and oxygenate blended with gasoline ,  or  with  diesel  fuel  as E-diesel .    Beyond that, gi ven investment in required infrastructure, it can  supply the growing number of ethanol flexible-fueled vehicles on the market today, and  could  be a source of hydrogen for advanced vehicle platforms of the future.         Since biomass feedstocks include agricultu ral residues ,  municipal solid wastes, wood products ,  industry wastes, and energy crops,  every  State in the union  has  a biomass to ethanol potential.            In addition to supplying needed product diversity for agricultural crops, biomass-to-ethanol technology could help a ddress other  environmental problems.    For instance,  biomass from hazardous fuels reduction in forests  could be collected and used to produce ethanol, while lessening the fuel loading problems that have led to catastrophic wildland forest fires.    Air quality problems associated with the burning of rice and other straws could be lessened through the utilization of these materials to produce ethanol, biomass power, and other industrial chemicals.    Volumes of municipal solid waste could be greatly reduced by utilizing the organic fraction to produce ethanol, steam, and electricity.         I must add an important caveat, however, that limits our ability to pursue an aggressive, coordinated biofuels program.    The result of yesterday’s House-Senate Energy and Water Development Appropriations FY 2002 Conference Report was to earmark roughly 42 percent of our biomass/biofuels funding level.    Frankly, a cohesive, results-oriented program is difficult to achieve with this level of earmarking.          Alternative Fuel Vehicles         We also  believe that alternative fuel vehicles can make  a potentially vital   an important  contribution to  helping  our transportation sector  diminish   decrease its  reliance on petroleum.    Over the next several years, we will continue our deployment efforts, with a particular focus on niche markets where alternative fuel vehicles can be most competitive.            The Department’s Clean Cities program now has over 80 participants and 4,000 stakeholders who have voluntarily committed to the increased use of alternative fuel vehicles.    In addition to public information programs, tools, and training, this past year the Clean Cities program issued grants of over $4 million for 50 projects in 35 states , focused on    for i i nnovative  projects approaches  to deploy alternative fuel vehicles and infrastructure.    This Federal investment leveraged over $40 million in other private and public cost-share.         O ver several years, o ur demonstration and deployment work has evolved from small-scale information programs and fleet demonstrations to sophisticated web-based information dissemination and targeted demonstration and deployment projects that facilitate  niche  market development.    For example, the purchase by the U.S. Postal Service  (USPS)  of electric vehicles  (EVs)  is an excellent match between the clean, efficient electric technology and the short-route delivery requirements of the USPS.    I understand the Postal Service is planning to order a second round of 500 EVs under its contract .    We continue to work with the USPS to evaluate the benefits of using EVs.                 21 st  Century Truck Program         The growth of petroleum use in the heavy truck sector led to the creation of a new program in 2000, the 21 st  Century Truck program.    Like PNGV, this is designed as a partnership between the government and leading heavy vehicle and engine manufacturers to develop advanced technologies to double the fuel economy of long-haul trucks and triple the fuel economy of busses and other vehicles—while also reducing emissions and improving safety.    This program is too new to show much in the way of results.    Moreover, some industry partners feel the goals are unrealistic and do not represent a true consensus.    Therefore, we will reevaluate this program as well.         Conclusion         We must, as a nation, move more aggressively to i ncreas e   and diversify  domestic  energy  supplies  and radically increase vehicle fuel economy through technological advances, while maintaining vehicle safety, affordability and performance.         Secretary Abraham has challenged the Department to “leapfrog the status quo,” and to reach toward revolutionary, transformational technologies.    Our ultimate goal is to achieve emission-free, carbon-free, safe and affordable personal transportation.    We will reshuffle our technology portfolio toward that eventual goal.    This will entail more risk, but will invite greater reward.                                                                                                   Our scientists and engineers are being called upon to think beyond conventional wisdom and explore revolutionary approaches. Given the magnitude of this challenge,  it is vital that our scientists and engineers exchange ideas with their counterparts in other countries.    Toward that end, next week, we are sponsoring an international conference called the  2002 Future Car Congress  to exchange ideas on advanced light-duty passenger vehicle technologies.    This congress, which will be held in Arlington,  Virginia Virginia,  will be attended by  a broad spectrum of domestic and foreign representatives of government, industry, national laboratories, academia, and private research institutes.  The technological research that will be addressed during this conference is key to enabling future vehicles to meet our personal transportation needs while enhancing society’s overall energy security and environment.          NOW, THEREFORE, I GEORGE W. BUSH, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 2 through June 8, 2002, as National Future Car Week. I call upon all Americans to observe this week by making a conscientious effort to become better informed about the fuel economy of the many vehicle options available to them and to seriously consider the contribution that their purchase  decisionscan decisions can  make to this nation’s energy security.     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I HAVE HEREUNTO SET MY HAND THIS _________ DAY    OF ______, 2002 in the year of our Lord two thousand and two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-fifth.

One of the key aspects of the recent MMS reorganization was the creation of an RIK                 Office in the Minerals Revenue Management that will focus on the development and operation                 of MMS’ RIK program. Although it is impossible to determine at this point what properties may meet                 this test because of changing production trends and the future market, it is the agency's                 intent to move toward a continuing RIK program to gain maximum benefit for the American                 taxpayer. We believe that a viable RIK program should benefit both the taxpayer and                 industry through: increased revenues, lower administrative costs; lower costs of audits,                 appeals and litigation; and greater certainty on fulfillment of royalty obligations.                   We are currently in the Pilot Stage, which is allowing the                 agency to learn more about the royalty interests of the Federal Government, learn about                 the market opportunities for RIK products, and gather data on the effectiveness and                 utility of the RIK program. Important knowledge and experience has already been gained                 from managing RIK in a live environment. As MMS starts to analyze the data from the                 pilots, it is beginning to identify those successful efforts that can be incorporated as                 one of our management tools into the Minerals Revenue Management. Pilot outcomes will also                 guide the design and evolution of the future RIK operational activity. Along the same                 timelines, we have been reengineering new compliance and asset management processes (CAMP)                 to support the collection of royalties whether taken in value or in kind.                   The MMS believes that the discretionary use of RIK can make                 good business sense and the agency will work closely with industry, Congress, and other                 constituents to develop an effective RIK program. The clear goal of MMS is to use RIK to                 manage the public mineral interests to the maximum benefit of the American taxpayer.                                                                                                        BACKGROUND                                                   Pilot Goals:                                                                       To determine the circumstances (market conditions) in which                     RIK makes sense and identify those key success factors.

The Subcommittee expects that testimony will center upon the relationship between national security and the Nation's dependence on imported petroleum, particularly in the transportation sector. The Subcommittee will explore the extent to which research and development on alternative fuels—such as electricity and biofuels—and enhanced vehicle fuel efficiency can help enhance energy security. The Subcommittee also expects to hear testimony on the status of the public-private sector Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles (PNGV) and the United States Council for Automotive Research, or USCAR, an industry research and development (R&D) consortium.        The Subcommittee will receive testimony from James Woolsey, former Director of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency; David Garman, Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy at the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE); Gregory Dana, Vice President of Environmental Affairs at the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers; Robert H. Burnette, Project Manager for Bulk Power at Dominion Virginia Power representing the Electric Vehicles Association of the Americas (EVAA); David D. Doniger, Policy Director of the Climate Center at the Natural Resources Defense Council; and Dr. James J. MacKenzie, Senior Associate for the Climate, Energy and Pollution Program at the World Resources Institute.    2. Overview        The attacks of September 11th underline the Nation's vulnerability to terror attacks; the economic repercussions of the attacks will be felt for some time. The U.S. economy is highly dependent on imported oil; around 56 percent of U.S. petroleum demand comes from overseas with around 20 percent coming from the Middle East. A disruption of petroleum supplies, as witnessed after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, could have a devastating effect on the already weakened worldwide economy.     Page 11         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC      In 1998, the U.S. accounted for about 23 percent of the world's oil consumption. U.S. consumption ran at around 17.2 million barrels per day mb/d of which approximately 11.5 mb/d was used in the transportation sector. (see footnote 1)  Remaining U.S. domestic oil reserves, estimated at nearly 21.8 billion barrels, are becoming increasingly costly to produce because much of the lower-cost oil has already been largely recovered. (see footnote 2)  The remaining resource has higher exploration and production costs and greater technical challenges because they are located in geologically complex reservoirs, (e.g., deep water and harsh environments).        U.S. oil production is expected to decline over the next two decades—from about 5.9 million barrels per day to 5.05 million barrels per day. One result—without factoring in significant conservation, energy efficiency or increases in domestic alternative energy production—would be further increases in U.S. dependence on imported oil.        The Committee on Science has jurisdiction over energy efficiency and alternative fuel R&D. These are essential tools to promote U.S. energy independence, or at least minimize our dependence on imported energy. Recently, the Science Committee played a major role in H.R. 4, a bill that would provide for significant increases for Federal energy R&D funding.    PNGV History and Funding        R&D to develop more energy efficient vehicles took on a new urgency during the energy shocks of the 1970's. The fruits of these R&D efforts have brought significant increases in mileage from both improved engine designs and advanced, lightweight materials used in vehicle bodies. President Clinton created the PNGV (see footnote 3)  program in September 1993, which had among its goals the development of an environmentally friendly car that would triple the fuel efficiency of present day mid-sized cars without any decrease in performance, safety or increase in price relative to comparable vehicles. PNGV combined the resources of seven Federal agencies, the national labs, universities and USCAR (see footnote 4)  (a research consortium between DaimlerChrysler, Ford and GM) in an effort to reduce U.S. dependence on oil, improve the environment and enhance safety. Production prototype vehicles were to be available by 2004. In recent years, R&D efforts have focused on innovative engine designs and lightweight materials.     Page 12         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC  75842k3.eps        PNGV research programs are to continue under a new name and with a new focus under the Bush Administration. The program will apparently abandon the goal of an 80 mile-per-gallon mid-size sedan, and move to increase mileage in larger vehicles, including SUVs. Changes in program structure and emphasis make it difficult to track comparable funding levels from the FY 2001 request to the FY 2002 budget.    DOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) R&D Funding        The Department of Energy budget contains funding for R&D for transportation, biomass and biofuel, and hydrogen research as indicated in the table below. DOE also devotes significant funds to wind, solar and hydropower generation, as well as related areas of energy efficient electricity generation. The Federal government has also invested in research and development on other renewable, alternative fuels for power generation. These include biomass, biofuels, solar, geothermal and wind power.    75842l3.eps    Alternative Transportation Fuels        The transportation sector of the U.S. economy runs primarily on fuels derived from petroleum. The primary transportation fuels are gasoline and diesel fuel. Other fuels used in transportation include natural gas, electricity, bio-based fuels and fuel blends such as bio-diesel and E–85 (ethanol 85% gasoline 15%), among others.     Page 13         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC      A brief survey of the leading transportation fuels follows:    Natural Gas        The U.S. natural gas resource is large-estimated at over 170 trillion cubic feet. (see footnote 5)  However, U.S. conventional production is projected to peak as early as 2015, while demand for natural gas will most likely continue to outpace domestic production. (see footnote 6)  Increasingly, the U.S. will have to rely on natural gas from unconventional resources, such as tight sands, deep formations, deep water, and gas hydrates. Much of the increased demand for natural gas will come from electric utilities. This demand may increase further if low or zero-emissions vehicle mandates are imposed on a large scale requiring at least part of the fleet to convert to natural gas or electric drive vehicles. While electric cars may be able to recharge during off-peak hours, they will further increase the demand for natural gas.    Electricity        Electricity may be used in transportation in several ways: battery storage and electric motors, gas/electric hybrids and on-board generation of electricity using hydrogen fuel cells. Much of the electricity to power so-called ''plug-in'' electric vehicles will be generated at centralized electric utility plants. Gas/electric hybrids will continue to be powered by gasoline, though at much higher efficiencies, reducing gasoline consumption significantly. Hydrogen fuels cells will either operate on fuels converted to hydrogen using on-board reformers, or will require an extensive pure hydrogen infrastructure.     Page 14         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC      Electric drive trains can get their energy from a number of feedstocks. This flexibility may become attractive to manufacturers and consumers in the future, especially if specific fuel supplies become uncertain. Battery electric vehicles have a drawback of limited range. This may be addressed through a number of R&D approaches such as new battery storage designs, or quick charge capability. On-board generation of electricity using hydrogen fuel cells could be an attractive option because it will extend range.    Alternative Fuels and Biofuels        An increasing number of vehicles can run on alternative fuels, including ''flexible fuels'' and other biofuels such as E–85, which is derived from many different types of biomass, ranging from corn to agricultural waste. Other sources include synfuels from oil shale and tar sands and coalbed methane. Many of these sources are unable to compete with gasoline or diesel prices without a subsidy at current gas price levels.        The ability to use alternative and renewable fuel derived from fossil synfuels and agricultural biofuels in a significant portion of the Nation's automotive fleet will be critical. To gain widespread acceptance, alternative fuels will have to meet or exceed emissions standards while being economically competitive with traditional fuels.    Questions:     What role does imported petroleum play in national security and how can alternative fuels reduce our national dependence on imported transportation fuels?     Page 15         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC   What specific options are currently available, or are likely to be available in the future to reduce the Nation's consumption of petroleum for transportation? How will these changes affect consumption?     What is the status of DOE and government-wide research efforts to improve transportation energy efficiency and promote the use of alternative fuels?     How will industry research improve energy efficiency and promote the use of alternative fuels in vehicles?     How can industry or the Federal Government promote the use of electricity as a transportation fuel?     What role do the Nation's universities play in research to improve energy efficiency in the transportation sector and how do these efforts differ from government research programs, such as PNGV?        Chairman  BARTLETT.  We will now convene the hearing. The hearing will come to order. Today we will hear from a distinguished panel of witnesses on the Nation's energy security, an issue that has taken on renewed importance since the terrorist attacks of September 11.        This Subcommittee has already held a number of hearings this year on the realities of our energy situation. Today's hearing adds the additional critical element of national security. We have seen how vulnerable this country, our people, and our economy can be to savage terrorist attacks. Our energy situation contributes to our vulnerability. We need to address these concerns in an urgent manner.     Page 16         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC      In 1973, at the time of the Arab Oil Embargo, we imported 34 percent of our oil. Today we import 56 percent of our oil. It is really unconscionable that we should have permitted ourselves to be in this very vulnerable position. It was bad enough in 1973 with that brief Arab Oil Embargo. What would happen today if a single tanker were sunk in the Straits of Hormuz, through which a very large percentage of our oil comes.        Today, this country imports 56 percent of its petroleum. The lion's share of that goes into transportation fuels. Around 20 percent of this petroleum comes from the Persian Gulf. The Gulf has seen more than its share of conflict over the last 30 years. Ten years ago we fought a war to keep an unfriendly government from gaining hegemony in the area. Twenty years ago, two major oil-producing countries in the Persian Gulf were at war with each other. Somehow we have managed to keep the oil flowing through the Straits of Hormuz, but we should not count on our luck holding forever.        We also have a long-term problem—world oil production rates are expected to peak later this decade, while demand continues to rise.        Today, I will ask our witnesses to soberly assess our energy vulnerabilities, particularly as they relate to the transportation sector. I do not wish to dwell on disaster scenarios. We have had enough of those lately. Rather, I hope to focus on possible solutions to our energy security problems, so that we will not have disasters in the future.        I see today's hearing is very well attended. It is also well attended by visitors to our Committee, and I want to thank those who are here on the dais who are not members of our Subcommittee. That is certainly a sign of the importance that this Committee places on finding solutions to our problems through science. There are several ways this Committee is involved in enhancing the Nation's energy position, two of which are energy efficiency and alternative energy research and development. And I am very pleased that in our authorization bill this year there is a large commitment to renewable and alternative energy development.     Page 17         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC      Conservation also plays an important role in reducing energy use, and certainly will be a part of the discussion today. I would just like to note that the absence of blackouts in California this summer, widely predicted, was probably attributable to the fact that Californians voluntarily reduced energy consumption by 11 percent. Nobody thought that that kind of voluntary conservation was doable, but they did it. And I think that we need a larger focus on conservation across the country.        It is simple common sense to get as much energy out of a gallon of gas or a watt of electricity as you can. I drive a highly efficient hybrid electric vehicle that squeezes twice the mileage out of a gallon of gas as an average vehicle, without sacrificing comfort, convenience, or safety. And, by the way, it pollutes as little as 1/10 as much as the other cars in its class.        Unfortunately, energy efficient vehicles alone cannot address our energy security concerns. We need to develop alternative sources of energy that can be used in place of petroleum by both our existing and future vehicles. These new sources of energy should be sustainable, if possible, and take into account concerns about emissions.        I know that Americans are resourceful and resilient people. The attacks of September 11 have steeled our resolve against terrorism. I also think that the American people are ready to accept change and sacrifice, especially if that sacrifice, in the short term, brings long-term benefits. The challenge to scientists and to this Committee is to help find ways to stretch our existing energy reserves through efficiency. That may give us sufficient time to transition to the new forms of energy that will be discussed in this hearing. It is incumbent on all of us, as Americans, to help out wherever possible by using our common sense to conserve energy and to be as efficient as we can in our daily lives.     Page 18         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC      The House recently passed H.R. 4, the S.A.F.E. Act, which not only increases funding for R&D on energy efficiency and alternative fuels, but also encourages adoption of alternative fuel vehicles in the Federal fleet. That will be an important step in gaining acceptance and building alternative fuel infrastructure around the country. There are many other provisions in H.R. 4 that are forward looking and a few that I do not agree with, but, on balance, I think it is a very good effort by this House.        Today, our witnesses will discuss how efficiency and alternative fuel research and development are meshing together, both in the lab and out on the road. As we speak, there are electric, natural gas, and hybrid electric vehicles on the road in and around the Capitol. Many of these alternative-fuel and hybrid vehicles were purchased to help improve air quality in Washington.        We also recently had a visit to the Hill by a number of hydrogen internal combustion engine and fuel cell vehicles. I joined other members in putting these vehicles through their paces. They were excellent examples of how research over the last couple of decades will improve our lives today.        Our witnesses today are Mr. Jim Woolsey, Former Director of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency; Dave Garman, Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy at the U.S. Department of Energy; and, sir, if you don't do your job well, we may be in a heap of trouble in the future.

Before we get started, however, I would like to remind the members of the Subcommittee and our witnesses that this hearing is being broadcast live on the Internet, so please keep that in mind during today's proceedings.        I would also like to ask unanimous consent that all members who wish may have their opening statements entered into the record. Without objection, so ordered. Our Full Committee chair has joined us and I would like to recognize him now for any statement that he might wish to make.        [The prepared statement of Mr. Bartlett follows:]    PREPARED STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN ROSCOE BARTLETT        Today we will hear from a distinguished panel of witnesses on the Nation's energy security, an issue that has taken on renewed importance since the terrorist attacks of September 11th. This Subcommittee has already held a number of hearings this year on the realities of our energy situation. Today's hearing adds the additional critical element of national security. We have seen how vulnerable this country, our people, and our economy can be to savage terrorist attacks. Our energy situation contributes to our vulnerability. We need to address these concerns in an urgent manner.        Today, this country imports 56 percent of its petroleum. The lion's share of that goes into transportation fuels.

Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I do appreciate it. And this is the subject of a very important—of great importance to America. I have just come back from the Senate where I testified on a bill over there before Energy and Public Works, and one of the interesting exchanges we had dealt with reducing our dependence on foreign-source oil. And one of the recommendations I had, and it won't surprise anyone, is that we increase CAFE standards for light trucks and SUVs. We will save a lot of oil by doing that.        But I am anxious to be here as long as I can be before going on to the next thing and to hear our distinguished panel of witnesses. And I want to thank them for being resources for this Committee. We value greatly your input and, thank you, Mr. Chairman, for that courtesy.        Chairman  BARTLETT.  Well, thank you very much. I now turn to my distinguished colleague, Ms. Woolsey, for an introduction and—I am sorry—and her opening remarks.     Page 23         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC      Ms.  WOOLSEY.  Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, Mr. Super Chairman, for being here and being interested in this today and for rescheduling this hearing. I am really impressed with this panel and I think we are going to learn a lot. I would like, for the record, everybody to know that I am not related to Director Woolsey, but he looks so much like my ex-brother-in-law, that I think we are related somehow. I mean, we just have to know that. We—some time we need to sit down and figure out where those lines go. Yeah. It is. The hairstyle and the face.        Earlier this year, when the Committee—this Committee debated National Energy Policy, the issue of energy independence was brought up over and over again and it was referred to frequently by members on both sides of the aisle. But now, as we contemplate the world of post-September the 11th, the topic takes on a more urgent tone as it is mostly spoken about in relation to our national security.        In this sense, I don't think there is any dispute, particularly in this room, that we must decrease our dependence on foreign oil. With the transportation sector being the biggest user of petroleum, it has become—actually it has become a no-brainer that it is a smart place to start in cutting petroleum usage.        The American people are behind us because they know it is also in their interest, as consumers, to be independent of foreign oil. What this debate actually focuses on, and where I know our witnesses will share their professional insight with us, is how and by what means we reduce our oil/petroleum reliance.       Page 24         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC     On behalf of my constituents in Marin and Sonoma Counties, the two counties just north of San Francisco, across the Golden Gate Bridge, I have long championed that our focus must be to reduce our overall reliance on fossil fuels and instead make renewable energy and energy efficiency a much greater priority in this Nation.        By adapting this philosophy, we know that we will be able to improve the transportation sector arguments for greater funding in this regard. Likewise, we could help reach the goal of reducing our dependence on petroleum by strengthening CAFE standards for all cars and SUVs. And what my constituents and I also know, and many of my colleagues agree, is that we absolutely should not drill the 1b million acres of pristine wilderness up in Alaska to get a meager 6-months' supply of oil in—just so that we can say we are getting our oil domestically. We know there is a cause and effect and a balance that must be struck, and that is not part of it.        While CAFE standards and drilling in the arctic refuge may not be under the jurisdiction of this Committee, and I know it isn't, we do have the ability to increase R&D funding in areas that show promise to help reduce petroleum usage in the transportation sector. That is why, Mr. Chairman, I look forward—and to the panel—hearing our panel's recommendations on what alternative methods they would propose on our path to increase national security through more diverse energy sources, and what type of R&D investments are needed to make this vision a reality, because that is where we can help you. Thank you. With that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back my time.        Chairman  BARTLETT.  Thank you very much. Without objection, the full written testimony of all the witnesses will be entered into the record. If you can summarize your remarks, rest assured that there will be more than ample opportunity to expand on any point you wish to expand on during the question and answer period. And time always seems much shorter when you are answering somebody's question than when you are—than when you are giving your opening statement. So if you could summarize your testimony, there will be plenty of time for expansion of your interest.     Page 25         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC      Generally, we face a serious energy security predicament. How do you suggest we get ourselves out? Director Woolsey, I read, with great interest, your article with Richard Lugar, published several years ago on how we might, with engineered—bioengineered bacterium, split cellulose into glucose molecules, which can then be fermented to produce alcohol. We are really pleased that you are with us today, and you may proceed.    STATEMENT OF R. JAMES WOOLSEY, SHEA & GARDNER, AND FORMER DIRECTOR, U.S. CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY        Mr.  WOOLSEY.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, Congressman Woolsey, I feel particularly welcome before this Committee, given its interests and my last name, as well. I thank the Committee for its indulgence. I submitted Senator Lugar's and my article, but due to travel and just getting back last night, I have not submitted a written statement. I will seek to summarize the points here very briefly on what the Committee is interested in.        First of all, our dependence on foreign oil, and particularly the world's dependence on Mid-Eastern oil, is bad and getting worse. The Middle-East holds h to j of the world's proven reserves, depending on whether you count the Caspian Basin or just the Persian Gulf. And, although deep exploration alternatives are interesting and useful, most of this technology relates to more rapid exploitation of fields rather than to new fields.        And if one sets aside the heavy oil and tar sands, which are—we are going to have rather high environmental and economic costs for exploitation—one ends up with a range of estimates of between one trillion and two trillion barrels of proven reserves. And what that means is that world production begins to turn down some time between 2010 and 2020, or between the time when a child born this year graduates from, say, the third grade and a child born this year graduates from high school. So as each year goes on, our dependence on the Mid-East, the world's dependence on the Mid-East is going to get greater and greater.     Page 26         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC      Approximately four million oil wells have been drilled since the 1860's and approximately three million of them have been drilled in the United States. So we are not going to discover any Kuwaits underneath our territory. Indeed, Kuwait, alone, has about three times our reserves. We import more oil than any country in the world uses. And of our deficit of over a billion dollars a day in current accounts, we borrow a billion dollars a day from the rest of the world, more, really, last year, to finance our consumption. Over 100 billion of that, the largest single component, is for imported oil.        Now, since we are all depending more and more on the Mid-East, and since the Mid-East constitutes a set of governments outside Israel and Turkey, which, unfortunately, don't have any oil, that is composed either of pathological predators or vulnerable autocrats, this is not a recipe for long-term stability. And I trust even those who are reluctant to face that issue, as of last September 10, came to realize, at least by the afternoon of September 11, that dependence for the world on the Mid-East, for the foreseeable future, for our petroleum, is a disaster waiting to happen.        Second, we are a Nation of a lot of networks, whether it is the Internet or oil and gas pipelines or food distribution, and dozens and dozens of them—virtually, none of these were put together with a single thought being given to their vulnerability to terrorist attack or to centralization. They were put together reasonably well to deal with natural disasters or with random failures, but terrorist exploitation is quite another thing.        And, as we have seen now, two of these networks, civil air transport and mail delivery, can be used cleverly by terrorists, and we have to realize that our fuel distribution and our energy distribution and transmission systems are almost certainly going to come under attack in some way. Their high degree of centralization and their fragility to terrorist attack is a serious matter.     Page 27         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC      And one thing we ought to always be looking at, as the years go on—and I fear we are going to be in this war that we are in now for a number of years—one thing we have to be looking at is how to decentralize and how to make more flexible and more—and less fragile our energy distribution networks. To me, that means more small electric generators, for example, rather than a few centralized ones. It means local production of renewable fuels and alternate energy, rather than relying on imports and central fuel stations and the like.        Approximately 20 years ago, Hunter and Amory Lovins wrote a book called, ''Brittle Power,'' about the vulnerability of the American energy system. The former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Tom Moorer, and I wrote the foreword to that. Some people remarked, at the time, that the hawks met the greens and I said, yes, we hawks need a place—nice places to nest, and trees are a good place for hawks to nest and there is no incompatibility between being a hawk and being a green. Hunter and Amory said in that book that a few people without leaving Louisiana in one night could probably shut down something like h of the country's oil and gas pipelines. I don't know that that is still true, but I asked Amory Lovins the other day if it was close to true and he said it is a little better, but not much.        So we have a huge set of problems with respect to the vulnerability of our energy systems and the need to decentralize them and make them more flexible, make them more resilient, make them more representative in a sense of the genius of this country, which is decentralization and federalism and local autonomy and local independence.        Let me say a quick word about several potential steps and then I leave it for others to make their statements. Certainly, I think, renewable and alternate fuel credits are extremely important. I believe that one major untapped resource in this country is waste of all sorts. And, by volume, agricultural wastes are far and away the largest, not only from the fields, but also from packing plants, from pig farms, and the like. There are processes that turn this type of waste into energy and we should give as much credit as possible to exploiting those as much as we can.     Page 28         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC      Flexible fuel vehicles—alternative fuel vehicles are an excellent idea, but one interesting aspect of flexible fuel vehicles, FFVs, which now get CAFE standard credit, is that they can use up to 85 percent ethanol. And they have come under criticism, from some in the environmental community in recent years, because—that is, the credits have come under criticism because there is not the ethanol there to use. And there will never be the ethanol there to use as long as ethanol is only made from feed grains, because feed grains' starch constitutes way under 1 percent of what grows in the world.        But if one can make transportation fuel out of waste, then we are beginning to have something. And if we have a fleet of flexible fuel vehicles in being so that that energy may be used in those vehicles, even though they burn gasoline now, they could burn other things later, including particularly ethanol gasoline mixtures, then we don't have to wait year by year for just a few electric vehicles or a few of these or a few of those or a few fuel cell cars to be produced to make an impact on our fuel use. We have a fleet in being that can burn up to 85 percent ethanol. And this is not rocket science. All cars in Brazil are flexible fuel vehicles. This is a computer chip in the fuel system and a little bit of different kind of plastic in the fuel line. And millions of them have come off the production lines already.        So as we look at the steps we want to take, by way of giving production credits for the right types of alternative fuels and renewable fuels, as we give CAFE standard credits for the right types of vehicles, we need to look at what we can do quickly and what can be done in order to make the current infrastructure compatible with changes that could occur with relative quickness compared to long-term ideal solutions. And to my mind, that means rapid commercialization of some of these technologies. It means a great deal of attention to what can be done with the current infrastructure, modestly adapted, as distinct from brand new and ideal situations.     Page 29         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC      Finally, Mr. Chairman, let me say that I know the issue of the ANWR has sharply divided the Congress and public debate. My view on that issue is not driven by the environmental concerns. Having grown up in Oklahoma, hunting and fishing around stripper wells, I am—I have always been, and I guess a lot of Okies are, somewhat tolerant of having oil wells around. That doesn't bother me so much, although I recognize that Alaska is a fragile situation. I think the problem with ANWR is not so much the environmental issue as it is the Trans-Alaska Pipeline, which is exactly the kind of example of a brittle part of the infrastructure, easily interfered with and easily disrupted, that I am concerned about.        So as the Committee looks at research and development, as it looks at public policy issues of that sort, it seems to me it is the vulnerability and the brittle nature of our energy and our energy transmission systems that ought to draw our—in these days and times, ought to draw our first and foremost concern. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.        [The prepared statement of Mr. Woolsey follows:]    75842a.eps    75842b.eps    75842c.eps    75842d.eps       Page 30         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC 75842e.eps    75842f.eps    75842g.eps    75842h.eps    75842i.eps    75842j.eps    75842k.eps    75842l.eps    75842m.eps    75842n.eps    75842o.eps    75842p.eps    BIOGRAPHY FOR R.

Thank you very much. Mr. Garman.    STATEMENT OF THE HONORABLE DAVID K. GARMAN, ASSISTANT SECRETARY FOR ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND RENEWABLE ENERGY, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY        Mr.  GARMAN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for this opportunity to discuss our growing dependence on imported oil. I will focus my remarks on options to reduce petroleum use in the transportation sector.        The transportation sector, of course, is key since it consumes 67 percent of all the petroleum we use and is 95 percent dependent on petroleum. Our dependence on imported oil is expected to grow, and there is no single strategy that will free us from this dependency in the near term. Clearly, we must increase vehicle efficiency through new technology. We must promote domestic oil and gas production, and we must diversify our energy resources.        My first chart illustrates our decline in domestic production relative to increased demand. The growth of light-truck passenger vehicles, which includes sport utility vehicles, vans, and pickups, is dramatically apparent in this chart. That is the light blue section.     Page 34         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC      The next chart is another view of domestic oil production measured against projected transportation oil use with some policy action superimposed to illustrate the challenge we face in closing the gap. New oil production from the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge would certainly make a difference, but it does not close the gap. Research and development that incrementally improves the efficiency of vehicles helps as well, but business-as-usual R&D is also insufficient to close the gap.        The current business-as-usual approach is embodied in the program known as the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles, or PNGV. One of the goals of the PNGV program was to develop, by 2004, a production-prototype family sedan with three times the fuel efficiency of a comparable 1994 model without sacrificing affordability or marketability. While the PNGV program has delivered some technologies that can be seen in the market today, the program will not reach its 2004 goal.        Earlier this year, Secretary Abraham expressed his concerns about the orientation and goals of the PNGV program. He questioned the wisdom of pursuing production prototypes of passenger sedans when most new vehicle sales are in the light-truck category. The Secretary's observations were later validated through the National Research Council's annual review of the PNGV program. The Council found that a redefinition of the PNGV charter and goals is needed to better reflect societal needs and the ability to—of a cooperative, pre-competitive R&D program to address these needs successfully.        The PNGV program is near the end of its 10-year charter. And, as we would with any program coming to the end of its charter, we are assessing whether it represents the best approach to increasing vehicle efficiency and reducing our petroleum dependence.     Page 35         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC      Secretary Abraham, at a recent DOE leadership meeting, asked us to take a bolder approach to our work. He directed us to focus our efforts on programs that revolutionize how we approach conservation and energy efficiency. He challenged us to ''leapfrog the status quo and prepare for a future that, under any scenario, requires a revolution in how we find, produce, and deliver energy.'' He challenged us to seek potentially abundant new sources of energy with dramatic environmental results.        As a consequence of the Secretary's challenge and the recommendations in the President's National Energy Plan, we intend to be more aggressive in the pursuit of revolutionary transforming technologies. We view technology portfolio investment similar to the way that a stock investor would view a stock portfolio. The portfolio, as a whole, can be conservative with lower risks and modest returns, or it can be aggressive with potentially higher risks and potentially higher rewards.        The higher risk, higher reward strategy we have in mind leads to the use of fuel cells powered by domestically derived hydrogen. There is a risk is overcoming the significant technological barriers along this path, not the least of which involve the cost and durability of fuel cells.        While we will boost our efforts related to fuel cells and hydrogen, we will also maintain some of our efforts in combustion and emissions control, power electronics, advanced batteries, materials, and advanced fuels. However, relatively mature technologies, such as those related to spark-ignited or natural gas engines, will receive less Federal emphasis. We expect that our private sector partners will assume the major burden of further development of the most promising of these mature technologies.     Page 36         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC      And although we will be reorienting our technology portfolio to deliver a hydrogen fuel cell future, we cannot afford to wait, nor should we wait for the hydrogen fuel cell solution. As new technologies related to advanced internal combustion engines, hybrid vehicle systems, weight-reducing materials, and fuels are demonstrated, we will work with industry to facilitate their migration to the market.        My written statement goes into further detail on biofuels, alternatively fueled vehicles, and advanced truck R&D, however, with respect to biofuels, I must raise an important issue that limits our ability to pursue an aggressive, coordinated biofuels program. Yesterday's Energy and Water Development Appropriations Confidence Report came out and earmarked roughly 42 percent of our biomass, biofuels funding level. Frankly, a cohesive, results-oriented program will be difficult for us to achieve with this level of earmarking.        To conclude, we must, as a Nation, move more aggressively to increase fuel and diversify our domestic energy supplies and radically increase vehicle fuel economy through technology advances while maintaining vehicle safety, affordability, and performance.        Secretary Abraham has challenged us to leapfrog the status quo and to reach toward revolutionary transformational technologies. Our ultimate goal is to achieve emission-free, carbon-free, safe, and affordable personal transportation. We will reshuffle our technology portfolio toward that eventual goal. This will entail more risk, but it will invite greater reward. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.        [The prepared statement of Mr. Garman follows:]     Page 37         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC  PREPARED STATEMENT OF DAVID K. GARMAN        Mr. Chairman, thank you for inviting me to discuss one of our Nation's most critical energy issues—our growing dependence on oil, and its related energy security implications. In keeping with the invitation, I will focus my remarks on options to decrease petroleum use in the transportation sector.        We often think of energy being consumed in three end-use sectors: buildings, industrial, and transportation. Of the three, transportation consumes 27 percent of our total energy and exhibits the least variation in energy sources and uses. The most striking feature of the transportation sector is its nearly complete dependence on petroleum as an energy source. Our transportation sector is 95 percent dependent on petroleum, and it consumes 67 percent of all the petroleum used in our Nation.        The situation we face today is in some ways more acute than it was during the so-called ''oil crises'' of the 1970s. In 1975, we had net imports of 5.8 million barrels per day, or 36 percent of our needs. During the first seven months of 2001, net imports averaged 10.9 million barrels per day, or 55 percent of our demand.        Over the past 18 years the Nation's oil use for transportation has grown at an average annual rate of about 2 percent, with fuel use by heavy and light trucks both growing at a rate greater than 4 percent in the last decade. Present consumption for highway vehicles is about 10 million barrels per day. Last year, oil imports increased our balance of payments deficit by $109 billion.     Page 38         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC      Our future dependence on imports is expected to grow because of our higher consumption, and a decline in domestic production. Today, the U.S. uses 26 percent of the world's oil but it produces only 12 percent of the total global supply and has only 2 percent of the world's petroleum reserves (at current prices).        There is no single strategy that will free us from this dependency in the near term. Clearly:     We must increase vehicle efficiency through the development and introduction of new technology.     We must promote domestic oil and gas production.     We should diversify our energy sources.     We should enhance the security and efficiency of our fuel delivery infrastructure.        The first chart illustrates our decline in domestic oil production relative to the increased demand needed to fuel the growing numbers of automobiles, light trucks, and heavy trucks. The growth in numbers of light truck passenger vehicles—which includes vans, pickups, and sport utility vehicles—is dramatically apparent in this chart.        My second chart is another view of domestic oil production measured against projected transportation oil use, with some policy actions superimposed to illustrate the challenge of closing the gap. New oil production from the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) would certainly make a difference. . .but it clearly does not close the gap. Research and development (R&D) that incrementally improves the efficiency of vehicles helps as well, but ''business as usual'' is also insufficient to close the gap.     Page 39         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC      Clearly, we face a serious challenge, and ''business as usual'' approaches are not enough.    The Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles: Some Lessons Learned        The current approach is perhaps best embodied in the program known as the ''Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles,'' or PNGV. One of the goals of the PNGV program was to develop, by 2004, a production-prototype family sedan with three times the fuel efficiency of a comparable 1994 model without sacrificing affordability and marketability. Unfortunately, the program will not reach this goal.        Begun in 1993, the PNGV program linked the resources of seven federal agencies with those of the auto industry and academia to conduct cooperative R&D on a portfolio of technologies with the potential to dramatically increase fuel economy in passenger vehicles. Among the agencies participating in PNGV, the Department of Energy (DOE) contributes the majority (86 percent in FY 2001) of the funding that is directly relevant to the PNGV goals in accordance with the plans developed by the PNGV government-industry technical teams.        The PNGV program has delivered some technologies that can be seen in the market today. Some of these results include:      New composite and thermoplastic materials— General Motors (GM) is using composites to produce the truck bed for its 2001 Silverado, saving 50 pounds over earlier models equipped with steel truck beds. DaimlerChrysler incorporated a recyclable thermoplastic hardtop in its 2001 Jeep Wrangler.     Page 40         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC    Increased application of lightweight aluminum for automobile construction— Ford is including 412 pounds of aluminum in the Lincoln LS, saving 188 pounds relative to conventional construction. GM is utilizing hydroformed aluminum door, deck and hood panels to reduce the weight of Cadillac, Oldsmobile and Chevrolet vehicles. DaimlerChrysler experimented with an aluminum-intensive vehicle and introduced the Prowler in model year 1998. These weight savings are accomplished without compromising safety.      New manufacturing techniques— GM Saturn vehicles are using axle shafts produced with a process controller developed with DOE support. The resulting shaft is lighter and requires less energy to produce. Ford has installed and is evaluating a similar controller.        While PGNV-derived hybrid-electric technologies are not yet in the market, they are expected soon. DaimlerChrysler, Ford and GM have announced that hybrid electric drive options will be available in popular market segments during the 2003–2004 time frame: Dodge Durango (2003), Ford Escape (2003), Chevrolet Silverado (2004) and Ford Explorer (perhaps in 2005). In general, these configurations are expected to deliver equal or better performance while also improving fuel economy by between 15 and 35 percent. In some situations, the fuel economy gain will be even greater.        For example, the Ford Escape hybrid will offer the performance of a standard V–6, while achieving nearly double the fuel economy of a conventional Escape in city driving. Each of these hybrids will incorporate technologies that were developed or enhanced through DOE's program. In contrast to the hybrids being offered in low volumes by Toyota and Honda, we are told that each of these U.S.-built hybrids will be available as options in popular, high volume market segments, and will be built on the same assembly lines as conventional models.     Page 41         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC      These are important results, but we will clearly have to significantly accelerate the pace of getting these and more dramatic technologies into the marketplace if we expect to make a substantial impact on our petroleum dependency.        Earlier this year Secretary Abraham expressed his concerns about the orientation and goals of this program. He questioned the wisdom of pursuing production prototypes of passenger sedans when most new vehicle sales in this country are in the light truck category, including minivans, SUVs and pickups. And, as we have seen, the PNGV program will not meet a key goal. We maintain that it is not enough to validate new technology. The advances of this program must find their way into the market, and they must deliver clearly demonstrable benefits to society.        The Secretary's observations earlier this year are consistent with the findings of the National Research Council's (NRC) annual review of the PNGV program, published this past August. The NRC found that a redefinition of the ''PNGV charter and goals'' is needed to ''better reflect societal needs and the ability of a cooperative, pre-competitive R&D program to address these needs successfully.''        Our experience with PNGV has taught us other lessons as well:     The ''industry partnership'' approach is a good approach. DOE and its predecessor agencies have been involved in supporting advanced automotive fuel economy research for over three decades. In the past, R&D were conducted through contracts with individual industry partners. PNGV pulled together ongoing advanced transportation programs under its partnership umbrella, providing valuable alignment and focus to the R&D. PNGV differed significantly from earlier efforts with a greater reliance on technical teams comprised of scientists and engineers from government, industry and the laboratories to establish technical targets and develop detailed research roadmaps.     Page 42         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC   Contrary to the criticism often leveled that government doesn't know when to stop funding a technology that lacks promise, the PNGV partners have been successful in ''deselecting'' technologies, thanks in part to the approach to cost sharing. Stirling engines, gas turbines, ultracapacitors (for energy storage), and flywheels are all among the technologies that have been ''deselected'' for PGNV vehicles.     Research to develop technologies eventually judged ''less promising'' for automotive application should not be considered a failure, since research results can lead to the consideration of these technologies for use in other applications. For example, ultracapacitors from our automotive efforts have now been selected as appropriate for heavy bus applications and may be utilized in power electronics; gas turbine developers are employing technology advanced for use in transportation for stationary power source applications instead.     The R&D planned and guided by our PNGV partners has had some difficulty responding to new technology opportunities due to the inflexibility of the budgetary cycle, in which initial planning and actual execution may be separated by as much as three years. And generally, only $500,000 or 10 percent of appropriated R&D funds, whichever is lower, may be redirected without congressional approval. When such approval is sought, it takes at least 6 months and is never assured. The PNGV experience suggests value in considering multi-year funding for major R&D efforts, and providing more flexibility in the appropriation language.     The multi-agency funding of projects was approached primarily through capitalizing on existing, ongoing research, with the expectation of research redirection and budget—augmentation. Redirection of research did not occur to the extent expected, and Congress did not provide augmentation of agencies' budgets. In retrospect, a modest (five percent) central budget would have been valuable to apply to ''gap filler'' research that could respond to new developments until more traditional funding sources could be tapped.     Page 43         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC      The PNGV program is near the end of its 10-year charter, and as we would with any program coming to the end of its charter, we are assessing whether it represents the best approach to reducing our petroleum dependence.    The Need for a More Aggressive Approach Toward Hydrogen and Fuel Cells        Secretary Abraham, at a recent DOE leadership meeting, asked us to take a bolder approach to our work. He directed us to focus our efforts on programs that ''revolutionize how we approach conservation and energy efficiency.'' He challenged us to ''leapfrog the status quo and prepare for a future that, under any scenario, requires a revolution in how we find, produce and deliver energy.''        We need to do this, according to Secretary Abraham, ''. . .not simply because many of our resources are depletable. . .not simply because we are increasingly dependent on energy from areas of the world that are periodically unstable. . .(and) not simply because questions surrounding climate change force us to confront policies that focus on a carbon-free society.''        ''Success in this mission,'' according to Secretary Abraham, ''could well be one of the greatest contributions to our energy and national security for generations to come.'' He further asked us to seek ''potentially abundant new sources of energy with dramatic environmental benefits.''        As a consequence of the Secretary's challenge and the recommendations in the President's National Energy Plan, we intend to be more aggressive in the pursuit of revolutionary, transforming technologies. We view technology portfolio investments similar to the manner in which an investor would view a stock portfolio. The portfolio as a whole can be conservative, with lower risks and modest returns. Or it can be aggressive, with higher risk and potentially higher rewards.     Page 44         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC      The higher-risk, higher-reward strategy we have in mind leads to the use of fuel cells powered by domestically derived hydrogen. While fuel cell technology is promising, there are significant technological barriers that must be overcome, not the least of which involve the cost and durability of fuel cells. For example, a light duty passenger vehicle powered by a fuel cell is currently projected to cost between five and six times more than a comparable internal combustion engine-powered vehicle. In addition, there are challenges involved in producing, moving, storing and dispensing hydrogen in an affordable manner.        The Department of Energy's Hydrogen Program already supports research and development in the areas of hydrogen production, storage and utilization. Cooperative research includes the development of off-board production of low-cost hydrogen through steam-methane reforming of natural gas at refueling stations. This approach offers opportunities to produce hydrogen for fuel cell vehicles that can be cost competitive on a cents/mile basis with conventional gasoline vehicles. With increasing amounts of natural gas being consumed to generate electric power, production levels and infrastructure must be considered before adopting vehicle fuel strategies that depend on natural gas. However, advanced concepts can reduce hydrogen production costs even further. With continued improvements in renewable power systems, hydrogen could be produced without significant carbon emissions and would further reduce our reliance on fossil fuels. Recently, advances in the development of low-weight high-pressure (5,000 psi) storage tanks have reduced the projected weight of hydrogen vehicles. Breakthroughs in the development of transitional metal hydride storage systems offer reduced size and pressure storage options for hydrogen that will be important in supporting the introduction of fuel cell vehicles. Continued progress over the next decade should lead to economically competitive refueling station networks and the deployment of hydrogen fuel cell fleet vehicles and buses.     Page 45         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC      We believe the technical challenges we face represent a significant but acceptable risk, given the potential rewards of a hydrogen fuel cell transportation system. But because our research is cost-shared with industry partners and funded in part with dollars appropriated by Congress, DOE alone cannot undertake this shift. We will need your help, and the cooperation and participation of our industry partners.        We will work to streamline and refocus our joint automotive R&D efforts to provide greater emphasis on those long-term technologies that offer major societal benefits. While we will boost our efforts related to fuel cells and hydrogen, we will also maintain some of our efforts in combustion and emission control, power electronics, advanced batteries, carbon-based materials, and advanced fuels. However, relatively mature technologies, such as those related to spark ignited engines or natural gas engines, will receive less federal emphasis; we expect that our private sector partners will assume the major burden of further development of the most promising of these mature technologies.        We understand that our private sector partners would welcome the increased flexibility that a restructuring of the PGNV program could provide, seeing opportunities to better align their efforts with market sectors where the best business cases for advanced technologies can be made. Discussions are ongoing between industry and the Administration to identify specific details of a restructured, refocused program.        We will be reshuffling our technology portfolio to be more aggressive, reorienting it to deliver a hydrogen/fuel cell future. But we cannot afford to wait, nor should we wait, for the hydrogen/fuel cell solution. As new technologies related to advanced internal combustion engines, exhaust after-treatment, hybrid vehicle systems, advanced petroleum based fuels, alternative fuels, and weight-reducing materials are demonstrated, we will work with industry to facilitate their migration to the market, ultimately reducing our dependence on imported petroleum.     Page 46         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC  Biofuels        We will also continue development of domestic biofuels as an alternative to imported petroleum.        Biofuels, including ethanol and biodiesel, have been part of DOE's portfolio since the origin of the Department. The Energy Security Act of 1978 created the Alcohol Fuels Office that supported ethanol R&D, as well as a program to financially support the development of an ethanol industry. Today, that industry utilizes approximately 600 million bushels of corn each year to produce over 1.8 billion gallons of ethanol. A record number of new corn-to-ethanol plants are scheduled to begin production in 2001, contributing to the industry's ability to respond to growing market demand for clean burning octane enhancers and oxygenates. Importantly, these new facilities will provide much needed economic stimulus to rural communities faced with record low commodity prices and shrinking export markets.        This Administration is continuing the support of ethanol at the national level. Today, ethanol can be used in gasoline blends at 10 percent ethanol—90 percent gasoline (E10) since no barrier exists in terns of vehicle availability; all gasoline-fueled cars are warranted for E10. The President's National Energy Plan recommends an extension of the ethanol excise tax exemption. The report further acknowledges that ethanol is the most widely used biofuel.        Corn (and other grain) starch to ethanol is a technology that has greatly improved in efficiency over the years and is approaching a relatively high level of maturity. Extraordinary growth in the near term is expected due to the decline in MTBE use. To sustain significant growth in ethanol production, we will need to look beyond starch as the sole feedstock.     Page 47         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC      The Biomass R&D Act of 2000 has become an extremely important instrument in shaping the future direction of biofuels R&D at DOE's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE). It is also leading to much closer coordination among programs at the Department of Agriculture and DOE. The Act emanated from bills sponsored by Senator Richard Lugar of Indiana and Representative Mark Udall of Colorado. One of the tenets of the Act is that a much greater research effort is needed to overcome ''recalcitrant'' biomass. In particular, it directed that the R&D programs on biomass conversion should be heavily pursued through the development of more efficient methods of pretreatment and enzyme development (sometimes referred to as the sugars platform), the improved ability to ferment these multiple sugars to ethanol and other industrial chemicals (sometimes referred to as the yeast platform), and the production of multiple products from these sugars as one approach to a ''biorefinery of the future.''        The EERE R&D program in ethanol has been aligned to support the provisions of the Act. Major partnerships have been developed with two of the leading enzyme manufacturers in the world. One of these companies recently announced that it has reduced the cost of production by a factor of two, well on its way to the goal of having a ten-fold reduction in costs of enzymes used for the production of ethanol.        A commercial, biomass-to-ethanol technology could play a major role in reducing our reliance on imported oil. Ethanol can be used as an octane enhancer and oxygenate blended with gasoline, or with diesel fuel as E-diesel. Beyond that, given investment in required infrastructure, it can supply the growing number of ethanol flexible-fueled vehicles on the market today, and could be a source of hydrogen for advanced vehicle platforms of the future.       Page 48         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC     Since biomass feedstocks include agricultural residues, municipal solid wastes, wood products, industry wastes, and energy crops, every State in the union has a biomass to ethanol potential.        In addition to supplying needed product diversity for agricultural crops, biomass-to-ethanol technology could help address other environmental problems. For instance, biomass from hazardous fuels reduction in forests could be collected and used to produce ethanol, while lessening the fuel loading problems that have led to catastrophic wildland forest fires. Air quality problems associated with the burning of rice and other straws could be lessened through the utilization of these materials to produce ethanol, biomass power, and other industrial chemicals. Volumes of municipal solid waste could be greatly reduced by utilizing the organic fraction to produce ethanol, steam, and electricity.        I must add an important caveat, however, that limits our ability to pursue an aggressive, coordinated biofuels program. The result of yesterday's House-Senate Energy and Water Development Appropriations FY 2002 Conference Report was to earmark roughly 42 percent of our biomass/biofuels funding level. Frankly, a cohesive, results-oriented program is difficult to achieve with this level of earmarking.    Alternative Fuel Vehicles        We also believe that alternative fuel vehicles can make an important contribution to helping our transportation sector decrease its reliance on petroleum. Over the next several years, we will continue our deployment efforts, with a particular focus on niche markets where alternative fuel vehicles can be most competitive. The Department's Clean Cities program now has over 80 participants and 4,000 stakeholders who have voluntarily committed to the increased use of alternative fuel vehicles. In addition to public information programs, tools, and training, this past year the Clean Cities program issued grants of over $4 million for 50 projects in 35 states, focused on innovative approaches to deploy alternative fuel vehicles and infrastructure. This Federal investment leveraged over $40 million in other private and public cost-share.     Page 49         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC      Over several years, our demonstration and deployment work has evolved from small-scale information programs and fleet demonstrations to sophisticated web-based information dissemination and targeted demonstration and deployment projects that facilitate niche market development. For example, the purchase by the U.S. Postal Servics (USPS) of electric vehicles (EVs) is an excellent match between the clean, efficient electric technology and the short-route delivery requirements of the USPS. I understand the Postal Service is planning to order a second round of 500 EVs under its contract. We continue to work with the USPS to evaluate the benefits of using EVs.    21st Century Truck Program        The growth of petroleum use in the heavy truck sector led to the creation of a new program in 2000, the 21st Century Truck program. Like PNGV, this is designed as a partnership between the government and leading heavy vehicle and engine manufacturers to develop advanced technologies to double the fuel economy of long-haul trucks and triple the fuel economy of busses and other vehicles—while also reducing emissions and improving safety. This program is too new to show much in the way of results.        Moreover, some industry partners feel the goals are unrealistic and do not represent a true consensus. Therefore, we will reevaluate this program as well.    Conclusion        We must, as a Nation, move more aggressively to increase and diversify domestic energy supplies and radically increase vehicle fuel economy through technological advances, while maintaining vehicle safety, affordability and performance.     Page 50         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC      Secretary Abraham has challenged the Department to ''leapfrog the status quo,'' and to reach toward revolutionary, transformational technologies. Our ultimate goal is to achieve emission-free, carbon-free, safe and affordable personal transportation. We will reshuffle our technology portfolio toward that eventual goal. This will entail more risk, but will invite greater reward.    75842u.eps    75842v.eps    BIOGRAPHY FOR DAVID K. GARMAN     Assistant Secretary, Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Department of Energy        David Garman was nominated by President George W. Bush to serve as Assistant Secretary on April 30, 2001 and was confirmed unanimously by the United States Senate on May 25, 2001. He assumed the position after being sworn in by Secretary Abraham on May 31, 2001.        Assistant Secretary Garman previously served in a variety of positions on the staff of two U.S. Senators and two Senate Committees during a career spanning nearly 21 years. Most recently, Mr. Garman served as Chief of Staff to Alaska Senator Frank H. Murkowski. Mr. Garman also served on the professional staff of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee and the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.       Page 51         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC     Throughout his career, Mr. Garman's work has focused mainly on energy and the environment. For example, while serving on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, Mr. Garman worked in the newly emerging area of ''environmental intelligence and security,'' working on issues such as global climate change, transboundary pollution, and regional environmental threats from the Former Soviet Union. While on the staff of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, Mr. Garman's portfolio included energy research and development, science and technology, and global climate change.        Mr. Garman also served as a U.S. Senate observer at virtually all of the major negotiations under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change from 1995–2000.        Mr. Garman holds a Bachelor of Arts from Duke University, and a Master of Science in Environmental Sciences from the Johns Hopkins University.

DANA, VICE PRESIDENT, ENVIRONMENTAL AFFAIRS, ALLIANCE OF AUTOMOBILE MANUFACTURERS        Mr.  DANA.  Good morning, Mr. Chairman, and, members of the Committee. Mr. Chairman, thank you for the opportunity to testify before you Subcommittee regarding energy security issues. I represent the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a trade association of 13 car and light-truck manufacturers. Total R&D spending by the automobile industry is approximately $18.4 billion per year, with much of it in the high-tech sector.     Page 52         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC      Auto manufacturers are working on future technologies that may lead to substantial improvements in efficiency and emissions performance without sacrificing safety, utility, and performance, features that consumers demand. Successful introduction of these technologies need cooperative efforts that bring all the key stakeholders together, including automakers, energy providers, policy makers, and, most importantly, customers.        The Alliance supports efforts to create an effective energy policy based on broad, market-oriented principles. Policies that promote research and development and deployment of advanced technologies, and which provide customer-based incentives to accelerate demand of these advanced technologies, set the foundation.        The Alliance commends the House in endorsing consumer tax credits for highly fuel efficient advanced technology and alternative fuel vehicles when it passed H.R. 4 on August 1. I would now like to address some of these technologies.        The most promising long-term technology, fuel cells, offers breakthrough fuel economy improvements, zero emissions, and a shift away from petroleum-based fuels. Hydrogen fuel cells offer the biggest improvement in efficiency and emissions, but present major infrastructure challenges and onboard hydrogen storage also presents some issues. Gasoline infrastructure is well established, but gasoline reformers are the least developed and the most costly of reformer technology. Current sulfur content in gasoline will need further reduction to zero or near zero levels.        Hybrid-electric vehicles can offer a significant improvement in fuel economy. These products capture power through regenerative braking. Instead of losing breaking energy to the air, a decelerating hybrid vehicle can convert kinetic energy into stored energy that can be reused during the next acceleration.     Page 53         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC      Vehicles that utilize stored energy from plug-in rechargeable batteries offer zero emissions. Battery electric vehicles continue to face weight, energy density, range, and cost challenges that limit their customer appeal and affordability.        Vehicles that are powered by advanced lean burn technology, such as clean, direct injection diesels, are faced with a significant challenge in meeting the new California and Federal exhaust emission standard. If the technology challenges can be overcome, these vehicles could provide fuel economy gains in excess of 25 percent.        Much of the discussion regarding fuel economy centers on motor vehicles. But it is important not to forget about a vital component for any vehicle—the fuel upon which it operates.        Low sulfur gasoline is vital to ensuring that vehicle pollution control devices, such as catalytic converters, work more efficiently. In 1999, new EPA rules were issues which direct oil refiners to reduce the amount of sulfur in gasoline to an average of 30 parts per million, a reduction of over 90 percent from current levels. Further improvements will be needed, especially if gasoline will be used in fuel cells.        Another promising technology is diesel engines using lean burn technology, which has gained wide acceptance in Europe and other countries. Automakers have been developing a new generation of highly fuel-efficient clean diesel vehicles, using turbo-charged direct injection engines as a way to significantly increase fuel economy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, their use in the United States must be enabled by significantly cleaner diesel fuel.     Page 54         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC      Beyond gasoline, the auto industry is working with a variety of suppliers of alternative fuels. In fact, the industry already offers more than 25 vehicles powered by alternative fuels. Approximately two million of these vehicles are on the road today and more are coming.        Today, we find vehicles that use natural gas, which reduces carbon monoxide emissions; ethanol, a renewable fuel domestically produced with the longer term potential to substantially reduce greenhouse gases; liquefied petroleum gas, or propane, the most prevalent of the alternative fuels, which reduces VOC emissions; and, for the future, hydrogen, which has the potential to emit nearly zero pollutants, depending on the feed stock. But all these are dependent on the expansion of the existing alternative fuel infrastructure.        Automobile companies, from the top executives to the lab engineers, are constantly competing for the next breakthrough in innovation. If I can leave one message with the Subcommittee today, it is to stress that all manufacturers have advanced technology programs to improve vehicle fuel efficiency, lower emissions, and increase motor vehicle safety. Thank you for the opportunity to testify before the Subcommittee today. I would be happy to answer any questions.        [The prepared statement of Mr. Dana follows:]    PREPARED STATEMENT OF GREGORY J.

Overall, a recent University of Michigan study found that the entire automobile industry creates more than 6.6 million direct and spin-off jobs in all 50 states and produces almost $243 billion in payroll compensation annually.    Alliance R&D Focus:        The University of Michigan study also found that the total R&D spending by the industry is approximately $18.4 billion, with much of it in the high tech sector. In fact, the study stated the following: ''The level of automotive R&D spending and the relatively high employment of research scientists and engineers in the U.S. auto industry has traditionally earned it a place in any U.S. government listing of high technology industries generally thought to be central to the long-term performance of the U.S. economy.''        As we begin the 21st century, the auto industry is committed to developing and utilizing emerging technologies to produce cleaner, more fuel-efficient cars and light trucks. According to EPA data, fuel efficiency has increased steadily at nearly two percent per year on average from 1975 to 2001 for both cars and light trucks. The National Academy of Sciences (NAS), in a recent report to Congress, introduced their discussion of promising technologies by stating that ''the 1992 NAS report outlined various automotive technologies that were either entering production at the time, or were considered ''emerging'' based upon their potential and production intent. Since then, many regulatory and economic conditions have changed. In addition, automotive technology has continued to advance, especially in microelectronics, mechatronics, sensors, control systems, and manufacturing processes. Many of the technologies identified in the 1992 report as ''proven'' or ''emerging'' have already entered production.''     Page 56         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC      Auto manufacturers are working on future technologies such as hybrid and fuel cell vehicles that may lead to substantial improvements in efficiency and emissions performance without sacrificing safety, utility, and performance. Fuel cell technology also serves as a potential vehicle to move away from a petroleum dependent transportation sector. Successful introduction of these new and emerging technologies all share the need for cooperative efforts that bring all the key stakeholders together. . .including the automakers, energy providers, government policy makers and most importantly, the customers.    Key Energy Policy Initiatives:        1) Promoting Market Based Principles:        The Alliance supports efforts to create an effective energy policy based on broad, market-oriented principles. Policies that promote research and development and deployment of advanced technologies and provide customer based incentives to accelerate demand of these advanced technologies set the foundation. This focus on bringing advanced technologies to market leverages the intense competition of the automobile manufacturers worldwide. This competition drives automakers to develop and introduce breakthrough technologies to meet a variety of demands and customer needs in the marketplace.        The National Academy of Sciences summarized this diversity of demand and priorities in the marketplace when it stated that ''automotive manufacturers must optimize the vehicle and its powertrain to meet the sometimes-conflicting demands of customer-desired performance, fuel economy goals, emissions standards, safety requirements and vehicle cost within the broad range of operating conditions under which the vehicle will be used. This necessitates a vehicle systems analysis. Vehicle designs trade off styling features, passenger value, trunk space and utility. These trade-offs will likewise influence vehicle weight, frontal area, drag coefficients and powertrain packaging, for example. These features together with the engine performance, torque curve, transmission characteristics, control system calibration, noise control measures, suspension characteristics and many other factors, will define the drivability, customer acceptance and marketability of the vehicle.''     Page 57         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC      This is a long way of saying that in the end, the customer is in the driver's seat. Market based incentives and approaches ultimately will help consumers overcome the initial cost barriers of advanced technologies during early market introduction and increase demand, bringing more energy efficient vehicles into the marketplace. This will also accelerate cost reduction as economies of scale are achieved in a timelier fashion.        The Alliance is pleased that Vice President Cheney's National Energy Policy report recommends and supports a tax credit for advanced technology vehicles. In addition, the report supported the broader use of alternative fuels and alternative fuel vehicles. This is consistent with the Alliance's position of supporting enactment of tax credits for consumers to help offset the initial higher costs of advanced technology and alternative fuel vehicles until more advancements and greater volumes make them less expensive to produce and purchase.        The Alliance commends the House in endorsing consumer tax credits for highly fuel efficient advanced technology vehicles when it passed H.R. 4 on August 1. The Alliance believes that the overall concepts and provisions found in the bill are the right approach and would benefit American consumers. H.R. 4 would ensure that advanced technology is used to improve fuel economy and energy independence. Performance incentives tied to improved fuel economy are incorporated into the legislation in order for a vehicle to be eligible for the tax credits. These performance incentives are added to a base credit that is provided for introducing the technologies into the marketplace.        2) Maintaining Technology Focus:       Page 58         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC     The Alliance and its 13 member companies believe that the best approach for improved energy security and fuel efficiency gains is to aggressively promote the development of advanced technologies—through cooperative, public/private research programs and competitive development—and incentives to help pull the technologies into the marketplace as rapidly as possible.        The automobile companies are convinced that advanced technologies with the potential for major fuel economy gains are on the horizon which will allow automakers to continue offering products that consumers demand without sacrificing safety, performance or cargo features. As a nation, we need to get these technologies on the road as soon as possible in an effort to reach the national energy goals as fast and as efficiently as we can.    New Technologies. . .Promises and Challenges    Focus on Powertrain and Vehicle Technologies:        Automobile companies around the globe have dedicated substantial resources to bringing cutting-edge technologies—electric, fuel cell, and hybrid electric vehicles as well as alternative fuels and powertrain improvements—to the marketplace. Each of these technologies bring a set of unique advantages to the marketplace. At the same time, each technology has a unique set of challenges that inhibit widespread commercialization and acceptance. The internal combustion engine, fueled by relatively inexpensive gasoline, has been and continues to be, a formidable competitor against which all new technologies must compete.        For consumers sensitive to cost, fuel economy gains must be compared to the increased investment costs and risks in their new vehicle purchase decision. Assuming a fuel cost of $1.50 per gallon, a 20 percent increase in vehicle fuel efficiency offers an annual fuel savings of just over $100. This cost must be weighed against the convenience, utility and performance of the alternative. As automakers, we are keenly aware of the importance of consumer choices and the challenges we have to deliver new technologies that meet their affordability, performance and utility needs.     Page 59         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC  Fuel Cell Vehicles:        The most promising long-term technology offers breakthrough fuel economy improvements, zero emissions and a shift away from petroleum-based fuels. From a vehicle perspective, hydrogen-fueled fuel cells offer the biggest improvement in efficiency and emissions but at high cost and with major infrastructure challenges. On-board hydrogen storage also presents some difficulty. Gasoline infrastructure is well established, but gasoline reformers are the least developed and the most costly of reformer technology. Current sulfur content in gasoline will most likely need further reduction to zero or near zero levels.        A robust fuel cell commercialization plan incorporates breakthroughs and complementary research in stationary power units. A primary challenge in the introduction of fuel cells into America's light vehicle passenger and truck fleet are the packaging restrictions of size and weight. Experience and commercial expansion of stationary power units, relatively unconstrained by size and weight will be helpful gaining the experience necessary to meet the cost targets for commercialization in the vehicle sector.    Hybrid-Electric Vehicles:        Hybrid-electric vehicles can offer a significant improvement in fuel economy. These products capture power through regenerative braking. When decelerating an internal combustion vehicle, the brakes convert the vehicle's kinetic energy into heat, which is lost to the air. By contrast, a decelerating hybrid vehicle can convert kinetic energy into stored energy that can be reused during the next acceleration. Hybrid vehicles do not require additional investment in fuel infrastructure which helps reflect their potential for near term acceptance.     Page 60         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC  Battery Electric Vehicles        Vehicles that utilize stored energy from ''plug-in'' rechargeable batteries offer zero emissions. Battery electric vehicles continue to face weight, energy density, and cost challenges that limit their customer range and affordability.    Advanced Lean Burn Technology Vehicles        Vehicles that are powered by advanced lean burn technology such as clean, direct injection diesels are faced with a significant challenge in meeting the new California and Federal exhaust emission standard. If the technology challenges can be overcome, these types of vehicles could provide fuel economy gains in excess of 25 percent above comparable conventional vehicles.    Focus on Fuels and Infrastructure        Much of the discussion regarding fuel economy centers on the vehicles of the automobile manufacturers and their role in a national energy policy. But it is important not to forget about a vital component for any vehicle—the fuel upon which it operates. As automakers looking at the competing regulatory challenges for our products—fuel efficiency, safety and emissions—and attempting to move forward with advanced technologies, we must have the best possible and cleanest fuels. EPA has begun to address gasoline quality but fuel needs to get even cleaner. This is important because gasoline will remain the prevalent fuel for years to come and may eventually be used for fuel cell technology.     Page 61         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC  Low Sulfur Gasoline:        In 1999, new EPA rules were issued which direct oil refiners to reduce the amount of sulfur in gasoline to an average of 30 parts per million, a reduction of 90 percent over current levels. Low sulfur gasoline is vital to ensuring that vehicle pollution control devices, such as catalytic converters, work more efficiently. The so-called Tier II regulations were required under the 1990 Clean Air Act and will be phased in beginning in the 2004 model year. Further improvements will be needed especially if gasoline is to be used in fuel cells.    Low Sulfur Diesel:        In addition to alternative fuels, companies are constantly evaluating fuel-efficient technologies used in other countries to see if they can be made to comply with regulatory requirements in the United States. One such technology is diesel engines, using lean-burn technology, which has gained wide acceptance in Europe and other countries. Automakers have been developing a new generation of highly fuel-efficient clean diesel vehicles—using turbo-charged direct injection engines—as a way to significantly increase fuel economy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, their use in the U.S. must be enabled by significantly cleaner diesel fuel.        Earlier this year, EPA promulgated its heavy-duty diesel rule that the Alliance supports, as far as it goes. The rule reduces the amount of sulfur in the fuel. Low sulfur diesel fuel is necessary to enable the new clean diesel technology to be used in future cars and light trucks. Providing cleaner fuels, including lowering sulfur levels in gasoline  and  diesel fuel, will provide emission benefits in existing on-road vehicles. Unless there are assurances that such fuels will be available, companies will not invest in new clean diesel technologies. Efforts to reduce sulfur content will provide environmental benefits and allow vehicles to operate more efficiently.     Page 62         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC      Beyond gasoline, the auto industry is working with a variety of suppliers of alternative fuels. In fact, the industry already offers more than 25 vehicles powered by alternative fuels. Approximately 2 million of these vehicles are on the road today and more are coming. Today, we find vehicles that use:     Natural gas, which reduces carbon monoxide emissions;     Ethanol, a renewable fuel domestically produced with the longer term potential to substantially reduce greenhouse gases;     Liquefied petroleum gas (propane), the most prevalent of the alternative fuels, which reduces VOC emissions; and     For the future, hydrogen, which has the potential to emit nearly zero pollutants depending on feedstock.        One of the key hurdles to overcome in commercializing alternative fuel vehicles is the lack of fueling infrastructure. For nearly a century, infrastructure has focused primarily on gasoline and diesel products. Infrastructure and fuel incentives will help the distributors overcome the costs to establish the alternative fuel outlets and support distributors during initial lower sales volumes as the number of alternative fuel vehicles increases.        As you can tell, the automobile companies—from the top executives to the lab engineers—are constantly competing for the next breakthrough innovation. If I can leave one message with the Subcommittee today, it is to stress that  all manufacturers  have advanced technology programs to improve vehicle fuel efficiency, lower emissions and increase motor vehicle safety. These are not ''pie in the sky'' concepts on a drawing board. In fact, many companies have advanced technology vehicles in the marketplace right now or have announced production plans for the near future. That's why now is the perfect time for the enactment of tax credits to help spur consumers to purchase these new vehicles which years of research and development have made possible.     Page 63         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC      The Alliance and its member companies would urge that public policy decisions focus on the steps that will achieve real reductions in fuel consumption and which support our national energy goals. As I mentioned earlier, the advanced technology fuel-efficient vehicles are typically more expensive than their gasoline counterparts because of the new technologies. Therefore, market penetration is a challenge. As a result, the Alliance is pleased that H.R. 4 would provide for personal and business tax incentives for the purchase of qualifying advanced technology hybrid and fuel cell powered vehicles as well as alternative fueled vehicles and infrastructure development. These tax incentives should help ''jump start'' the market penetration of these highly fuel efficient vehicles leading to increased sales and volumes so that the cost will come down in the long-term with positive implications for energy security.        Thank you for the opportunity to testify before the Subcommittee today. I would be happy to answer any questions you may have.    BIOGRAPHY FOR GREGORY J. DANA        Gregory J. Dana is the Vice President, Environmental Affairs for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers. He took this position on August 30,1999. In this role, he is responsible for all Federal and State environmental issues that affect vehicle design and automotive production facilities.        Prior to joining the Alliance, Mr. Dana held the position of Vice President and Technical Director of the Association of International Automobile Manufacturers (AIAM). He joined AIAM in June 1986. In this position he handled environmental and vehicle safety issues for AIAM. Before that date, he was employed by the Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Mobile Sources. He worked for the Agency from 1973 to 1986. Mr. Dana worked both in the Ann Arbor Emissions Laboratory and in the Washington D.C. Headquarters for the Mobile Source Office Director.

Mr. Burnette.    STATEMENT OF ROBERT H. BURNETTE, PROJECT MANAGER, BULK POWER, DOMINION VIRGINIA POWER, ON BEHALF OF THE ELECTRIC VEHICLES ASSOCIATION OF THE AMERICAS        Mr.  BURNETTE.  Mr. Chairman, and, members of the Committee, I am Bob Burnette, Project Manager, Bulk Power, for Dominion Virginia Power. Dominion, headquartered in Richmond, Virginia, has four million electric and natural gas customers and more than 15,000 employees to serve them through a variety of subsidiaries. Dominion is the largest fully integrated electric and gas company in the United States and the third largest energy producer in the United States.        I appear today as a representative of the Electric Vehicle Association of the Americas whose membership includes international vehicle and component manufacturers, energy providers, and technology developers. I thank you for this opportunity to discuss the role that electricity can play in the transportation sector. I will focus my remarks on the important benefits that can accrue from the increased use of electric drive technologies.       Page 65         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC     EVAA believes that reducing dependence on foreign oil demands that we transition the country's biggest consumer of this commodity, the transportation sector, to the use of other fuels. Electricity is an attractive alternative. It is clean, efficient, affordable, and is produced domestically from a variety of fuel sources. The use of electricity can greatly enhance our energy's security since today's U.S. electric generation base is less than three percent reliant on petroleum.        EVAA encourages the development and use of battery-powered vehicles, fuel cell vehicles, and hybrid-electric vehicles. My written statement details the benefits of using electric transportation and describes the changes we face in commercializing these technologies. I would like to highlight actions that both industry and government might take to assist in the transition of our transportation network to electricity.        Dominion has been promoting programs and policies that encourage the development and use of electric-drive technologies for many years through the use of EVs in our fleet and the installation of charging infrastructure. In addition, we are encouraging Virginia—we encourage Virginia to provide the existing state tax credits to purchase battery electric vehicles and to allow the use of these vehicles in high occupancy vehicles lanes.        Also, Dominion and its partners, American Maglev Technology, Lockheed Martin, the Commonwealth of Virginia, and Old Dominion University, are now building a maglev system at Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Virginia. The project is scheduled to begin transporting passengers in the summer of 2002.        With respect to the Federal Government's role, EVAA applauds the House of Representatives, and particularly this Committee, for adopting comprehensive energy legislation that includes important incentives to encourage the use of electric modes of transportation. EVAA believes that tax incentives are the single most effective means of jump-starting the market for electric and other clean fuel transportation options, and we are hopeful that the incentives, as included in H.R. 4., will be enacted into law this year.     Page 66         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC      Also, in H.R. 4, are important programs crafted by members of this Committee and strongly supported by EVAA. Of particular note is the program proposed by Representative Jackson Lee to authorize a 3-year program to provide DOE cost share to electric utilities and others interested in demonstrating the benefits of using spent EV battery backs and stationary applications. By encouraging the development of this secondary market, we can reduce the high cost of advanced batteries.        Second, the Chairman of the House Science Committee, Sherwood Boehlert, introduced legislation to create a nationwide program that would demonstrate a variety of electric and other alternative fuel technologies. This proposal will assist in creating seamless, intermodal transportation systems in urban environments and are—that are fuel by clean alternatives, like electricity.        The AFV Acceleration Act was also incorporated into the House Energy Bill. EVAA encourages this Committee to assure that the legislation establishing and AFV Acceleration Program is enacted into law, whether as a stand-alone bill or as part of comprehensive energy legislation.        One issue that H.R. 4 does not cover is review of the Energy Policy Act Provisions that required governments and fuel provider fleets like electric and natural gas utilities, to acquire alternative fuel vehicles. The current program is failing to meet the Congressionally mandated goal of reducing transportation sector petroleum use. EVAA believes that flexibility must be built into the program in order to ensure that EPACT's future petroleum displacement goal is achieved. My written statement details specific amendments to EPACT to provide this needed flexibility.     Page 67         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC      Finally, hydrogen fuel programs should be addressed in any legislation. Our interest in hydrogen is simple. It is the fuel required to power fuel cell vehicles. In June, EVAA submitted written testimony to this Committee asking that any legislation recognized the need to coordinate ongoing hydrogen, fuel cell, and distributed energy R&D programs. As the Committee considers hydrogen fuel cell development and the energy needed to power a mobile society, we urge you to establish public and private partnerships to address these challenges.        That concludes my formal remarks. I thank you again for the opportunity to appear, and I will be happy to answer any questions.        [The prepared statement of Mr. Burnette follows:]    PREPARED STATEMENT OF ROBERT H. BURNETTE   On behalf of the Electric Vehicle Association of the Americas    Introduction and Overview of Statement:        This testimony is submitted on behalf of the Electric Vehicle Association  of the  Americas (EVAA), a national non-profit organization that advocates the use of electric transportation technologies, including battery, hybrid and fuel cell electric vehicles, as a means of addressing national energy security, energy efficiency  and  air quality goals. Members of the organization include international automotive and other equipment manufacturers, energy providers, national associations and government entities. (A complete membership roster is attached to, and made a part of, this testimony.)     Page 68         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC      EVAA applauds the Energy Subcommittee's investigation to determine means by which the Federal Government might cause, or help to cause, a reduction in the use of petroleum. The statement of EVAA will be confined to addressing those options that can reduce petroleum use in the transportation sector, which is by far the greatest consumer of petroleum in the U.S., accounting for approximately 70% of our current consumption. And the consumption of energy by the transportation sector is growing at an alarming rate. By 2020, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) predicts that total energy demand for transportation in the U.S. will be 38.5 quadrillion Btu, compared with only 26.4 quadrillion Btu in 1999. Therefore, while the Committee can and should consider options for reducing petroleum use within every sector of the economy, a critical key to reducing U.S. dependence on foreign oil is to transition the transportation sector—particularly the light duty vehicle segment—to use of alternatives to gasoline and diesel fuels, like electricity and/or hydrogen. The results of inaction—continuing consumption at current trends—are alarming. EIA projects U.S. petroleum demand will grow from its 1999 level of 19.5 million barrels per day to 25.8 million in 2020.        Electric transportation represents an exciting technology solution to the energy security and environmental problems associated with the use of petroleum—electric drive systems can be powered by domestically-produced energy derived from a diverse array of feed stocks, they have little-to-no emissions in operation, and they are highly efficient in their use of energy. Electric transportation technologies are being used effectively in the transportation sector today, notably in light rail and train applications, with exciting new technologies like hybrid-electric passenger cars and hybrid-electric buses being brought to the market. With electric modes of transportation, we have the ability to continue the high level of mobility in the U.S. without relying on petroleum products and without further degradation to our air quality. This testimony:     Page 69         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC   highlights the important national benefits accruing from the widespread adoption of electric transportation technologies into our transportation network;     discusses the current technological, market-entry and infrastructure challenges to such widespread deployment of electric transportation technologies; and,     outlines Federal policies and programs that EVAA's members believe are critical to assuring that electric transportation technologies can be a significant segment of the U.S. transportation sector in the 21st century.    Benefits of Electric Transportation Technologies:        There is a family of electric transportation technologies being developed and/or commercialized. EVAA defines an electric vehicle as any technology that employs an electric drive system to power the vehicles. Electric transportation technologies under development and/or commercially available today include battery electric powered systems, hybrid electric powered systems (using an internal combustion engine and an electric motor) and fuel cell powered systems that create electricity on-board through a combination of hydrogen and air. And, the platforms using—or planning to use—electric drive systems include passenger and light duty vehicles, buses, trains; low-speed or neighborhood vehicles and off-road equipment such as airport equipment. Each of the technology categories—battery, hybrid-electric and fuel cell—offers significant energy security and environmental benefits, and together represents the cleanest, most advanced alternatives to conventional vehicles on the road or under development.     Page 70         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC  Battery Electric Transportation Options:        Battery electric vehicles (BEVs) charged off the Nation's electric utility grid use ''fuel'' created from a variety of feedstocks, from wind to nuclear. Importantly, petroleum represents a diminimus fuel feedstock for electricity production in the U.S. Less than 3% of the current U.S. generation base relies on petroleum. Electricity is a domestically produced, relatively stably priced fuel that affords us ''fuel diversity'' for the transportation sector. Further, the primary charging for BEVs is expected to occur overnight, when electricity demand is at its lowest, allowing for widespread adoption of the technology without adding new capacity.        In addition to significant energy security benefits, BEVs offer the opportunity for continued personal mobility without degradation to the environment. Nearly 100 cities across the U.S. fail to meet Federal air quality standards, and approximately 62 million people live in counties where monitored data show unhealthy air for one or more of the six principal pollutants [carbon monoxide (CO), lead (Pb), nitrogen dioxide (NO), ozone (O), particulate matter (PM), and sulfur dioxide (SO)]. For many urban areas, electric transportation can be a particularly important means to substantially reduce emissions of mobile source pollutants, including volatile organic compounds and oxides of nitrogen that are the precursors of smog. Battery electric cars and buses are truly ''zero emission'' transportation modes. They produce no tailpipe emissions and generate insignificant, ancillary emissions during operations. They also have the added benefit of mitigating noise pollution and using energy more efficiently than conventional modes.       Page 71         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC     Battery electric vehicles in the market today include buses for shuttle and transit service, passenger and light duty vehicles, and low speed or ''neighborhood'' vehicles.    Hybrid Electric Vehicles:        Hybrid electric vehicles, which combine the benefits of electric power with conventional gas powered engines, can significantly improve the efficiency and environmental performance of vehicles, thereby reducing fuel use and contributing to improved air quality. HEVs on America's roadways today evidence the tremendous advantages that this technology provides. The Toyota Prius has a stated fuel economy of 67 mpg, and a California environmental rating of ''SULEV'', or ''Super Ultra Low Emission Vehicle,'' with only about b of the carbon dioxide and 1/10 of the nitrogen oxide emissions associated with a comparable, gasoline powered vehicle; the Honda Insight is rated at 70+ mpg and meets California's ''ULEV'' emissions rating. All international auto manufacturers have announced plans to bring hybrid electric vehicles to the market place in the coming years.        A recent study commissioned by EPRI has indicated that the benefits of hybrid electric vehicles may be greatest through the implementation of plug-in (those that store/use electricity provided from the electric gird) hybrid electric vehicles. Results of the study indicated that such a technology configuration could provide the gasoline equivalent mileage of more than 80 mpg. The study indicated, further, that the electricity for charging such vehicles would be provided largely during offpeak—the most desirable for efficient and inexpensive generation.       Page 72         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC     In addition to the passenger and light duty vehicles planned by the automakers, there are a growing number of hybrid-electric buses in transit and shuttle operations in major urban centers around the U.S.    Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles:        Fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs), which harness the chemical energy of hydrogen and oxygen to generate electricity, have the potential to change the way we think about energy. Fuel cells are more efficient than other technologies that rely on direct combustion, and they produce zero, or near zero emissions. When fueled directly by hydrogen, the only by-product of a fuel cell electric vehicle is water.        Like electricity, hydrogen does not occur naturally in a usable form on Earth; it must be generated or produced by consuming fuels or other forms of energy. Yet, also like electricity, multiple feed stocks can be used, creating fuel diversity and thereby enhancing national energy security. Fuel processors ''on-board'' a vehicle can produce hydrogen from natural gas, methanol, ethanol, gasoline, or diesel. ''Off-board'' processors can use all of these feedstocks and can also make hydrogen from the electrolysis of water.        While fuel cell technology is not as fully developed as its sister electric drive systems, significant investment is being made in the development of a wide variety of fuel cell electric options by industry and governments around the world. Manufacturers and technology developers have shown concepts for fuel cell-powered buses, bicycles, family cars and heavy-duty trucks.       Page 73         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC Magnetic Levitation:        Also included in the ''family'' of electric transportation options is a technology that promises rapid and safe movement of large numbers of people and/or freight. Magnetic levitation technology is an electronic rail system that is projected to accommodate safe travel at speeds up to 300 mph. This technology holds the promise of dramatically reducing commute times between major cities while simultaneously reducing highway and airport congestion and pollution. Demonstrations of this technology have been undertaken successfully in Germany and Japan.        In the U.S., an exciting demonstration of the technology. is being built at the Old Dominion University in Hampton Roads, Virginia, which is intended to prove the economics and viability of using magnetic levitation systems for meeting mass transportation needs. The project, which is being sponsored by the University, the Commonwealth of Virginia and EVAA members Dominion Virginia Power and American Maglev Technology, is scheduled to begin transporting passengers from one end of the University Campus to another in the summer of 2002.    Challenges to Widespread Adoption of Electric Transportation Technologies:        Despite the significant societal benefits accruing from their use, years of research and development by companies and governments across the globe, and mandates for commercialization of such vehicles, electric transportation technologies have not yet become a meaningful part of the U.S. transportation network. Since 1996, a total of only 4,427 battery electric vehicles have been leased and/or sold in the U.S. And, while sales of HEVs are growing quickly, there still have been only 23,884 put into service to date. In addition to these light duty automotive offerings, there have been about 250 electric and hybrid-electric buses and over 6,000 low-speed, battery electric vehicles placed into service.     Page 74         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC      While the sum of all of these vehicles—which is less than 30,000 as compared to 1999 vehicle sales in the U.S. of 16.5 million—may be insignificant statistically, they represent an enormous step toward development of along-term and sustainable market for such vehicles in the U.S. The technology—with respect to battery and hybrid electric vehicles—is proven and maturing; customer reception to the vehicles has been tremendous and sales have been constrained more by product availability than by demand; and, incentives to encourage consumer purchase are in place and/or being considered by government at all levels. However, more must be done if these vehicles are to become an integral part of our transportation network.        Costs for immature and low-volume technologies will be higher than those of comparable, conventional vehicles. Until a supplier base can be built, the technology matured and volume production established, the incremental costs of electric transportation technologies must be addressed in order to assure consumer acceptance. Fortunately, battery, hybrid and fuel cell vehicles share a number of subsystems (e.g., power electronics, motors, regenerative brakes). Therefore establishing a supplier base for battery electric vehicles, for example, can help to lower the costs of early commercial fuel cell vehicles when they are brought forward.        Infrastructure support systems, from re-fueling and charging to service and maintenance, must be put in place to support the convenient and safe operation of electric transportation technologies. Deploying the infrastructure systems—particularly those to support a hydrogen-based economy—represents a vast and expensive undertaking.        Building markets for electric transportation will require consumer awareness and experience with the technology to establish confidence in the products.     Page 75         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC      Finally, with respect to fuel cell electric vehicles, there is a continuing need for research and development of the subsystems and components that will allow industry to bring forward a consumer-attractive FCEV.    Role for Government in Overcoming the Technological and Market Challenges to Electric Transportation Technologies:    Consumer Tax Incentives:        Targeted tax incentives can be an effective means by which government can help assure that electric drive technologies are successfully introduced into the marketplace. EVAA members believe that such incentives should be limited in their scope and duration, and available now and in the immediate future as these new and dramatically different technologies are introduced to consumers.        EVAA members are encouraged that the House has included tax incentives for electric and other alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs) as part of its omnibus energy bill, Securing America's Future Energy Act, H.R. 4. These incentives, which were derived from the Clean Efficient Automobiles Resulting from Advanced Car Technologies Act'' (''CLEAR ACT''), H.R. 1864, introduced by Congressman Dave Camp (R–MI) and others, can help drive the biggest consumer of petroleum—the transportation sector—toward use of cleaner, domestically produced alternatives. EVAA is concerned, however, that the momentum for passage of such legislation in this Congress may wane, and we ask that such incentives be considered separately, or as part of another appropriate vehicle, should a comprehensive energy plan prove unachievable. All major vehicle manufacturers are poised to bring battery, hybrid and/or fuel cell electric cars and buses to the market. Federal tax incentives, as called for in the CLEAR ACT, would allow the technology to spread quickly by lowering purchase prices and encouraging deployment of supporting infrastructure.     Page 76         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC      We believe a very important feature of the CLEAR ACT is its recognition that vehicles which provide the greatest societal benefits in terms of environmental and efficiency performance are deserving of the most generous benefits. Also, the CLEAR ACT recognizes that fuel cell electric vehicles will be entering the market later than other electric and alternative fuel vehicles, and has provided for incentives for this category of technology to continue for a longer period of time to ensure that the market has matured sufficiently before the incentives expire.    Federal Program to Introduce Advanced Vehicle Technologies to U.S. Cities:        Cities and communities plagued with poor air quality and traffic congestion stand to be the greatest beneficiaries of the successful commercialization of electric and other alternative fuel vehicles; yet, to date, the technologies are largely unknown and ''untried.'' Deploying electric transportation technologies, from battery-powered bikes to fuel cell electric buses, can result in the clean and efficient transport of people and goods in the urban environment.        Another provision of the omnibus energy legislation adopted by the House creates a Federal program to support the introduction of electric and other alternative fuel vehicles in linked transportation systems in up to 15 cities in the U.S. The provision, which was first introduced by the Chairman of this Committee, Mr. Boehlert (R–NY), as H.R. 2326, the ''AFV Acceleration Act of 2001,'' provides $200 million in Federal cost-share funding to help communities deploy clean, efficient modes of transportation and to build the infrastructure that can assure the subsequent widespread adoption of these technologies. Creating these models of efficient and clean transportation will allow for transit operators, public officials and the citizens who experience the benefits of the technology in their daily lives to gain the experience and confidence necessary to transition to these radically new technologies.     Page 77         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC      As with the tax incentives included in H.R. 4, EVAA encourages this Committee to assure that the legislation establishing an AFV Acceleration program, as envisioned in H.R. 2326, is enacted into law whether as a stand-alone bill or as part of comprehensive energy legislation. Forming partnerships and alliances between governments at the local, state and Federal levels, and leveraging Federal dollars with those of industry and other levels of government, is an effective means of introducing and deploying alternative fuel vehicles to communities and citizens across the country.    Federal Program to Assist in Making Advanced EV Batteries Economically Viable:        In addition to consumers' lack of familiarity with electric vehicles, other challenges to market penetration of the initial series of electric vehicles are high purchase prices and limited range. Manufacturers currently are not producing greater numbers of EVs, having reached conclusions that the costs are too high and the market too limited. The cycle of high costs and limited sales is broken only if costs are reduced and/or volume is increased dramatically. One of the primary contributors to the high costs of EVs is the advanced battery necessary to provide the minimum range deemed acceptable to consumers. While it is estimated that prices for batteries begin to fall when the volume reaches 10,000 packs (i.e., enough to power 10,000 EVs) per year, auto manufacturers believe that volume alone cannot address the prohibitive costs of advanced technology batteries necessary to create consumer demand for EVs because the materials needed for such batteries (e.g., nickel) are expensive.        To assure volume sales of EVs, a dramatic reduction in the cost of batteries is required. An innovative approach to addressing this issue may be to ''extend'' the life—or value—of the batteries beyond vehicular use. Once the batteries have been ''used'' in a vehicle, there is an opportunity to refurbish, then ''re-use'' the batteries in a stationary application. For example, electric utilities could ''re-use'' EV battery packs in peak shaving, transmission deferral, back-up power and transmission quality improvement applications. If successfully demonstrated for secondary, stationary-use applications, the effective price of battery systems is projected to make EVs more competitive.     Page 78         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC      Preliminary studies have shown that if a secondary market is created that pays $100 to $200/kWh for EV batteries, the costs of such batteries for use in the first application (i.e., the vehicle) could be reduced to $100 to $150/kWh—the price point which auto manufacturers believe is necessary to assure an affordable EV. Combining the value for using the battery in both a vehicle and then later a stationary application likely would cover the cost of producing the battery pack, even at low volume (estimated at $400/kWh).        EVAA is encouraged that this Committee, with the leadership of Representative Jackson Lee (D–TX), included a provision in H.R. 4 to establish a $15 million program within the Department of Energy to assist industry in demonstrating that ''spent'' EV batteries can be cost-effective and high-performing in secondary, stationary applications as part of any national energy package it develops. The program will demonstrate up to 1000 kWh of ''used'' batteries (approximately 33 vehicle battery packs) in a minimum of 10 stationary use applications. These ''used'' batteries would demonstrate electric utility stand-by, peak-shaving and transmission quality improvements and would help to validate the value of ''used'' batteries as a means to store electricity for purposes beyond use in EVs.    Providing Flexibility in Compliance with EPACT Fleet Requirements:        EVAA requests that this Committee examine the existing provisions of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPACT), P.L. 102–486, that require state and Federal governments and the providers of alternative fuels (e.g., electric utilities, natural gas utilities, and other producers/suppliers of fuels defined as alternatives to gasoline under the Act) to convert their vehicle fleets to alternative fuel vehicles. The rationale of building volume and market demand through government fleets and the fleets of those in the business of producing, supplying and/or selling alternative fuels is sound, though the execution of the program to date has not achieved the goals of the ACT, namely to replace 10% of the petroleum used in the light duty vehicle sector by 2000, and fully 30% by the year 2010.     Page 79         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC      While committed to building a long-term, self-sustaining market for electric vehicles, EVAA's electric utility members have found compliance with the existing EPACT alternative fuel providers' program difficult given the limited availability, high initial purchase price and limited performance of electric vehicles. These alternative fuel providers, as well as others struggling to meet the dictates of the DOE-administered program, are looking for flexibility in the program and recognition for actions taken that can help to develop the markets for electric and alternative fuel vehicles. For example, some electric utilities who are unable to incorporate so-called ''full function'' EVs due to limited availability, have begun to purchase and deploy low-speed electric vehicles to replace the duty cycle of a conventional vehicle; others have made investments in EV charging infrastructure to help encourage the market; and still others have begun to deploy hybrid-electric vehicles to help build demand in that segment and thereby ''drive-down'' the costs of components that are shared with battery and fuel cell electric vehicles. These actions, EVAA believes, should be recognized under the EPACT alternative fuel providers' program.        EVAA, in partnership with other alternative fuel interest groups, has crafted a set of modifications to the EPACT alternative fuel vehicle programs that will create flexibility in meeting the goals of the law, while assuring that the goals of the existing law, i.e., displacement of petroleum use in the transportation sector, can be achieved. The proposed modifications are attached to, and made a part hereof, this testimony. [Attachment ''B'']    Integrating Federal Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Development Efforts:        The world's major automobile and heavy duty vehicle manufacturers who are engaged in efforts to commercialize fuel cell vehicles all face the same technically challenging issue: How can hydrogen be provided to the fuel cell that will power the vehicles? Whether hydrogen is produced elsewhere and then stored on-board the fuel cell vehicle or is produced on the vehicle by use of an on-board fuel processor, hydrogen is a key enabler to the success of these vehicles. And, not only can hydrogen fuel much of tomorrow's transportation systems, but its versatility could provide the clean energy needed to satisfy our electric as well as our mechanical and thermal energy needs—powering office buildings, homes, industrial complexes and shopping malls.     Page 80         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC      The reality of the marketplace is that the role of hydrogen in the transportation sector, and to a large extent in the stationary applications sector, is coupled closely with fuel cell development. While hydrogen R&D is essential in its own right, the success of fuel cells is very dependent upon the success of hydrogen production, storage, transportation and use. The recently released report of the National Energy Policy Development Group, led by Vice President Cheney, specifically recommended that the President direct the Secretary of Energy to focus R&D efforts on  integrating  current programs regarding hydrogen, fuel cells and distributed energy.        EVAA submitted testimony to this Committee in June, as the Members considered reauthorization of the Hydrogen Future Act of 1996. We asked that any legislation reported by the Committee recognize the need to integrate on-going hydrogen, fuel cell and distributed energy research and development programs and to consider specific mechanisms and programs to insure that coordination is achieved in government and industry efforts to pursue both hydrogen and fuel cell development.        One means for organizing public and private partnerships to address the technical challenges might be to undertake a very significant, large-scale demonstration that invites, under one tent, today's leading fuel cell and hydrogen participants to focus on maturing the technologies and deploying the infrastructure that will allow us to move to this renewable and clean energy resource as quickly as possible. An example of such a collaborative undertaking can be found in the California Fuel Cell Partnership (CaFCP), which includes participation by the Federal Government, and is organized to comprehend the infrastructure requirements within the state of California to support use of fuel cell electric vehicles.     Page 81         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC  Conclusion:        Electric transportation technologies, whether powered by batteries, fuel cells or a combination of batteries and an internal combustion engine, collectively represent our transportation future. Transitioning to electric drive systems ensures continued mobility without reliance on insecure and often costly sources of foreign oil, and importantly, without degradation to the environment. Federal partnerships—whether in the form of consumer tax incentives, cost-share for research, development and demonstration, and/or assistance in deployment—to assist industry in bringing electric transportation technologies to the marketplace is a wise and cost-effective investment in our future energy security and in our citizens' quality of life. EVAA encourages this Committee to consider the industry's recommendations for programs and policies that can effectuate these strategic partnerships between government and industry.    75842x.eps    75842y.eps    75842z.eps    75842aa.eps    75842bb.eps    BIOGRAPHY FOR ROBERT H.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My name is David Doniger. I am the Policy Director of the Climate Center of the Natural Resources Defense Council, which has 500,000 members nationwide. I am very glad to see the focus of this hearing, recognizing that the problem we have in front of us is one of excessive demand for oil from all sources, foreign and domestic.        The first Bush Administration acknowledged this in 1991 at its National Energy Strategy, which said—and I quote, ''Popular opinion aside, our vulnerability to price shocks is not determined by how much oil we import.'' And the report went on to say that the number one—the number one factor making us vulnerable, ''how much—excuse me—how oil dependent our economy is.''        I won't rehearse the arguments that you know well from our community on why the Arctic Refuge drilling is not the answer. I would only note that it would increase our share of proven world oil reserves by 3/10 of one percent and never play more than a two percent role in meeting our oil consumption needs, even after 2027, the year of its peak production.        There is a faster, cheaper, cleaner alternative, and this is to increase fuel economy, to make cleaner fuels from America's farms, and to make faster deployment of hybrid and fuel cell technologies. There is a lot in what I have heard from previous witnesses that we very much agree with.        Well, September 11, people say, changes everything. And this is something I wish to, even though it is not the Committee's jurisdiction, directly address the issue of fuel economy standards. And in the wake of the terror attacks and with a new appreciation of the energy security risks posed by our excessive demand for oil, we urge the House to reconsider its vote this summer on raising fuel economy standards. Closing the SUV loophole would be just a down payment. Congress should boost fuel economy standards for the combined car and light-truck fleet, in steps every several years, to reach 40 miles per gallon by 2012 and 55 miles per gallon in 2020.     Page 84         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC      If we had a 40-mile-per-gallon standard, we would be saving 2.2 million barrels of oil per day by 2012. That is over 9 percent of the total projected U.S. demand for oil, and 21 percent reduction in the projected demand for oil by passenger vehicles.        If the standard is flattened out at 40 and stayed there, oil savings would continue to grow as new vehicles replace old ones. They would reach 3.6 million barrels of oil per day in 2015 and 5.4 million barrels of oil per day in 2020. And by 2020, our total oil demand would be 20 percent below what it is projected to be, 43 percent below what it is projected to be just for the passenger fleet.        This would save money for the consumer, depending upon the source, between $1,000 and $5,000 over the life of the car, and it would reduce heat-trapping carbon dioxide pollution by nearly a billion tons per year in the year 2020.        We think automakers can reach a 40-mile-per-gallon standard using available technology. A 55-mile-per-gallon standard could be reached if a majority of the fleet were passenger—of the passenger fleet were hybrid vehicles, like the Toyota and Honda ones already on the market, the Ford Escape, coming next year, another hybrid Honda Civic coming within the next year or two, and this is a very promising technology. I love my Prius.        Now, let me turn to some other simple steps, some simple and some taking more vision and more investment. The simplest thing on my list would be a standard for the rolling resistance of replacement tires. Tires you buy and I buy when we go to get a second set of tires don't—well, they have more friction than the tires the automakers choose on average to put on the new cars. The automakers choose the lowest friction tires in order to help meet the CAFE standards. But there is no standard and no information to help consumers choose tires of equal quality when they get their second set. The tires of the quality that offer the low rolling resistance would cost about $2.50 to $5 extra per tire and they would return you $90 in savings over the 40,000-mile life of the tire because you would use less fuel. It would translate into about a three percent increase in the fuel economy of the total fleet if we had such a standard.     Page 85         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC      We—the third measure—we support the tax incentives for hybrid vehicles and other—and fuel cells and other advanced technology vehicles, although in the original form, not in a watered-down form that was included in H.R. 4. But it would be a very important step to help achieve consumer acceptance, faster penetration of the hybrid vehicles.        I certainly would endorse what Mr. Woolsey said about the potential for making fuels from farm wastes. We need to make ethanol and other fuels from the farm wastes. Corn ethanol is not a long-term plus or a long-term viable solution, nor would it ever tap the potential here. So we would endorse, for example, the support by this Committee of commercialization—excuse me—construction of commercial-scale pilot plants to make ethanol from cellulosic processes with the new technologies DOE has been working on.        Fifth, we need an ''Apollo project'' for fuel cells and hydrogen fuels. I am encouraged by what Assistant Secretary Garman says on the subject of fuel cells and hydrogen fuels, but the commitment is not sufficient and there are no production goals associated with it yet. There should be, articulated by this Congress, the goal of having 100,000 fuel cell vehicles minimum by 2010 and a million a year by 2020.        There is work needed also on hydrogen fuel infrastructure to make direct hydrogen, meaning the production of hydrogen outside the car, feasible and commercially feasible. We think it can be done and there are processes available with a range of fuels from agricultural and natural gas to even coal, which can be used to produce hydrogen with up to an 80 percent reduction in carbon dioxide emissions. In the case of coal, this would require sequestering the carbon dioxide underground. And this is something that is also a priority for research and development and commercialization.     Page 86         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC      My prepared testimony mentions the importance, as well, of investing—reinvesting in public transit and in inter-city rail. We have a tremendous potential in those two areas to save fuel by giving people the opportunity, the transportation opportunities, to drive less in their own cars. Cities are expanding rail and bus systems to meet surging demand. There are nearly 1,500 miles of new light rail and heavy rail in proposal, planning, design, or construction in the year 2000, and this is a good subject for the stimulus package.        We also should—we would also recommend that this Congress support ''smart growth'' initiatives. The dependence on oil that we have is strongly contributed to by the suburban sprawl pattern of development since the '50's. A very interesting visualization of this in the PBS television series on the history of New York that ran in September. The road-building and development patterns established in that time are responsible for the oil consumption that we have now.        Many cities and communities are pursuing smart growth, which leads to more efficient distribution of homes and businesses in the landscape and less need for driving to get our commuting and our jobs and our recreational activities done. There are some legislative initiatives in this—mentioned in this testimony that this Congress could support to enhance smart growth.        And let me conclude by saying that our oil dependence didn't just happen. It is the result of policy choices made over many decades, and it is something we can change with smart policies such as I have outlined today. Each of these policies supports other critical environmental and economic objectives—cleaner air, reduction of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, and they save consumers billions of dollars per year. There are no supply-side policy alternatives that can effectively reduce our dependence on oil and deliver these other benefits.     Page 87         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC      The policy choices before you are not new, but the tragedies of September 11 may have changed how we will look at them. And I urge this Committee to take the lead in turning Congress in a new direction. Thank you.        [The prepared statement of Mr. Doniger follows:]    PREPARED STATEMENT OF DAVID D. DONIGER        Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for the opportunity to testify today on the importance of reducing our dependence on oil in America's transportation system. My name is David Doniger, and I serve as Policy Director for the Climate Center of the Natural Resources Defense Council. NRDC is a national, non-profit organization more than 500,000 members nationwide and a staff of scientists, lawyers and environmental specialists dedicated to protecting public health and the environment.        Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, the security of our Nation, the safety of our people, and the stability of our economy have become paramount concerns for the American public and our elected leaders. Americans are justifiably worried about energy security, especially our vulnerability to political turmoil in far-off places that could cause a disruption in oil supplies or a surge in world oil prices.        In the weeks following the attacks, some members of Congress have attempted to frame our vulnerability exclusively as a question of oil  supplies.  They argue that the answer lies in ever more domestic drilling, even in our last pristine wilderness areas such as the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. This path, however, would not ensure our energy security or national security.     Page 88         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC      Our dependence on oil, and our vulnerability to disruptions or price spikes, is due to our Nation's excessive  demand  for oil—from all sources, foreign and domestic. The first Bush Administration acknowledged this fact in its 1991 National Energy Strategy, which said: ''Popular opinion aside, our vulnerability to price shocks is not determined by how much oil we import.'' The number one factor making us vulnerable: ''how oil dependent our economy is.'' (see footnote 7)        Drilling in the Arctic Refuge would have no effect on our current situation. Americans consume 25 percent of the world's produced oil, but our nation holds only between two and three percent of the world's proven oil reserves. (see footnote 8)  The amount of economically recoverable oil in the Arctic Refuge, according to U.S. Geological Survey estimates, would raise our share of proven world reserves by only 0.3 percent (see footnote 9) —not nearly enough to make a significant dent in our imports, and too little to influence petroleum prices. If we opened the area to oil development today, it would take seven to 10 years for refuge crude to begin arriving at refineries. (see footnote 10)  Nor would refuge oil play a significant role in decades to come. Even at the point of its peak production rate in 2027, it would likely equal less than two percent of projected U.S. consumption for that year. (see footnote 11)  And over the field's 50-year life, it would likely produce less than what our country now consumes in six months, and less than one percent of the oil we are projected to consume over those 50 years. (see footnote 12)       Page 89         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC     There is a faster, cleaner and cheaper alternative, a path to energy security that would save many times more oil than could ever come from drilling in the Arctic Refuge or our other pristine protected places. The cornerstone of this path is to reduce demand for gasoline with better gas mileage, cleaner fuels from America's farms, and faster deployment of hybrid and fuel cell technologies.        So allow me to outline seven key energy security policies that NRDC believes would significantly reduce U.S. oil dependence starting in the next few years, and continuing for the next three decades.    1. Raise fuel economy standards to 40 mpg by 2012 and 55 mpg by 2020.        September 11, people say, changes everything. In the wake of the terror attacks and with a new appreciation of the energy security risks posed by our excessive dependence on oil, the House should reconsider its vote this summer on raising fuel economy standards. Closing the SUV loophole would be just a down payment. Congress should boost fuel economy standards for the combined car and light truck fleet in regular steps every several years, reaching 40 miles per gallon by 2012 and 55 mpg by 2020.        Passenger cars use more than 40 percent of the oil consumed in America, nearly 8 million barrels per day. Drivers spent $186 billion on fuel last year. Without vehicle fuel economy improvements, Americans' gasoline bill will rise to an estimated $260 billion in 2020. (see footnote 13)        Sadly, however, the combined average fuel economy of new cars, SUVs, and minivans is actually  falling.  Due to decades of federal inaction on standards and a surge in sales of SUVs and minivans, the fuel economy of the new vehicle fleet dropped last year to its lowest point in nearly 20 years. (see footnote 14)     Page 90         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC      A 40 mpg standard would save about 2.2 million barrels of oil per day by 2012. That's a 9.2 percent reduction in projected U.S. oil demand and a 21 percent reduction in projected passenger vehicle fuel demand. Oil savings would continue to grow as new vehicles continue to replace old ones—reaching 3.6 million barrels per day by 2015 and 5.4 million barrels per day by 2020. By 2020, U.S. oil demand would be reduced by 20 percent—a 43 percent reduction in projected passenger vehicle fuel demand. (see footnote 15)        Over the next 50 years, a 40 mpg standard would save more than 50 billion barrels. That is more than 15 times the likely yield of economically recoverable oil from the Arctic Refuge. (see footnote 16)  Raising the standard to 55 mpg in 2020 would lift that savings to more than 20 times the Arctic Refuge's likely yield over that period. (see footnote 17)        According to the Union of Concerned Scientists, a 40 mpg standard would save car owners $3,000 to $5,000 at the gas pump over the life of their cars, more than offsetting increased vehicle costs. (see footnote 18)  The recent National Academy of Sciences study also concluded that, at a discount rate of five percent, consumers' fuel savings will exceed the front-end cost of meeting a 40 mpg standard by nearly $1000. (see footnote 19)  And U.S. emissions of heat-trapping carbon dioxide would be reduced by nearly 900 million tons per year by 2020. (see footnote 20)     Page 91         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC      Automakers could reach a 40 mpg standard using available technologies to improve conventional gasoline vehicles. They could reach a 55 mpg standard if they made a majority of their passenger vehicles hybrid-electrics. Two hybrids, the Toyota Prius and Honda Insight, are already on the road. A hybrid Ford Escape and a hybrid Honda Civic will be available within the next year or two.    2. Require fuel-efficient replacement tires by 2002.        One of the simplest, quickest steps towards oil savings would be for Congress to require ''after-market'' replacement tires to be as fuel-efficient as original equipment tires by 2002. This simple step would save 5.4 billion barrels of oil over the next 50 years—more than one-and-a-half times the total amount of oil that is likely to be economically recoverable from the Arctic Refuge over the same time period. (see footnote 21)        Most replacement tires now on the market have more ''rolling resistance''—more friction—than original equipment tires. Automakers choose low rolling resistance tires to help meet existing CAFE targets. However, there are no standards for replacement tires, and so most consumers unwittingly purchase less efficient tires when their originals wear out. Higher friction replacement tires lower fuel efficiency. A rolling resistance standard would cut the gasoline consumption of all U.S. vehicles by about three percent when fully phased in. (see footnote 22)       Page 92         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC     The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimates that fuel-efficient tires would cost consumers no more than $5 per tire. (see footnote 23)  Michelin has put that figure at less than $2.50 per tire. (see footnote 24)  Even using the higher figure, the average driver would recoup the additional expense in fuel savings in just one year, and would save an additional $90 over the 40,000-mile life of the tires.    3. Enact tax incentives for hybrids and fuel cell vehicles.        Congress should enact tax incentives for advanced vehicle technologies, including alternative fuel vehicles, hybrid gasoline-electric vehicles and fuel cell vehicle—technologies that would enable the Nation's fleet to meet a 55 mpg standard in 2020.        Congress should pass this tax credit in the form it was originally introduced in the House and Senate, not the watered-down version included in the House energy bill. This tax incentive would greatly speed up the commercialization of hybrids. As an example, the buyer of a mid-size hybrid-electric car that gets 60 mpg (2.25 times the current class average) would receive a $3,500 rebate. As noted, Toyota and Honda already have hybrids on the road, and Ford and Honda are bringing out new hybrid models next year. The tax incentive would also give a critical boost to fuel cell vehicle technology.    4. Make fuel from farm wastes.        Congress should fund accelerated construction of commercial-scale pilot plants for making ethanol motor fuel from agricultural wastes. Tapping agricultural wastes and other renewable feedstocks to produce fuel has tremendous potential to reduce U.S. oil dependence.     Page 93         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC      New ethanol conversion processes would greatly improve current methods of making ethanol from corn, which require substantial amounts of energy. Ethanol from corn now supplies about one percent of motor fuel. Much larger oil savings and pollution reductions are possible over the medium term by deploying these new processes. New technologies would make it economical to make ethanol from crop wastes and other woody parts of plants (called ''cellulosic'' biomass). Cellulosic ethanol production can start using agricultural wastes such as corn stalks, sugar cane wastes and rice hulls. Once these are fully exploited, dedicated energy crops (such as switch grass and hybrid poplars) could be planted to increase the supply.        As ethanol use increases, it will be necessary to make continued improvements in vehicle emission controls in order to achieve and maintain the public health benefits of now required of cleaner burning gasoline.    5. Launch an ''Apollo Project'' for fuel cells and hydrogen fuel.        Congress should set a goal of converting America's passenger transportation to fuel cell vehicles running on hydrogen, the ultimate ''green'' energy source whose only byproduct is water. Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles would use no gasoline and, on a full fuel-cycle basis, would emit dramatically lower levels of urban air pollutants and heat-trapping carbon dioxide.        As suggested by House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt (D–MO), Congress should create a project on the level of NASA's Apollo moon mission to accelerate the commercial feasibility of fuel cell technology. Such a program would sharply increase funding for research and development of fuel cell vehicles and hydrogen fuel distribution systems. The federal fuel cell R&D goal should be production of 100,000 fuel cell vehicles by 2010 and expanding to 1,000,000 vehicles by 2020.     Page 94         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC      Congress should focus hydrogen fuel R&D on ways to make hydrogen with 80 percent lower emissions of carbon dioxide (on a full-fuel-cycle basis) than conventional gasoline. Promising approaches include: Using solar energy or wind power to split water; converting biomass energy crops to hydrogen or alcohol, which then is converted to hydrogen on-board the vehicle; and using natural gas or coal to produce hydrogen, electricity and steam for industrial processes, with underground carbon dioxide disposal.    6. Reinvest in public transit and inter-city railroads.        Until now, I have spoken of measures that directly affect the efficiency of passenger motor vehicles and the fuels they use. At the same time, Congress could further reduce our oil dependence by offering states and cities more help to meet the surging demand for public transportation. Funding backlogged bus and rail transit projects, and rebuilding inter-city rail systems, would reduce U.S. oil dependence, reduce traffic congestion, and clean the air.        According to the Federal Transit Administration, starting in the early 1990s public transit saved the country 1.5 billion gallons of fuel annually—nearly 36 million barrels of oil. (see footnote 25)  Cities are expanding rail and bus systems to respond to meet growing demand—nearly 1,500 miles of new light rail and heavy rail lines were in proposal, planning, design or construction phases in 2000. (see footnote 26)        Congress also should increase investments in high-speed inter-city rail transportation as a rapid, safe and energy-efficient mode of travel, providing more transportation choices for the public as well as protecting our energy security and environment. Rebuilding our rail capacity to capture a larger share of trips of 500 miles or less would save oil, and reduce congestion in the air and on our roads.     Page 95         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC  7. Promote ''smart growth.''        Not only are we overly dependent on oil; we are also overly dependent on driving. Since the 1950s, the predominant urban development pattern in the United States has been ''suburban sprawl.'' The drivers and impacts of sprawl were strikingly illustrated recently in episodes of the PBS series on the history of New York City.        During the last decade, ''smart growth'' has emerged as an antidote to more of the same mindless sprawl development. Congress should reform federal transportation, housing, tax and land management policies to support, rather than undermine, state and local ''smart growth'' initiatives. Over the long term, ''smart growth'' can reduce suburban sprawl and cut the need for driving, reducing oil consumption while improving our quality of life.        By coordinating transit planning and development, Portland, Oregon, absorbed a 26 percent growth in population from the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s with only a two percent growth in traffic. Portland residents now have shorter average commute times and cleaner air. By contrast, Atlanta's traffic grew 17 percent over the same period while its population increased 32 percent. Energy consumption per capita in Portland dropped eight percent, but it increased 11 percent in Atlanta. (see footnote 27)        Congress should pass the Urban Sprawl and Smart Growth Study Act (H.R. 1739), which would add Federal impacts on suburban sprawl as part of the environmental assessment required by the National Environmental Policy Act. Congress should direct Fannie Mae to aggressively promote ''Location Efficient Mortgages sm''—mortgages with favorable terms for homes located in central areas or near public transit—recognizing that homeowners with low transportation costs can carry larger mortgages. Congress should provide tax incentives and funding for transit-oriented development, urban revitalization, and rural land conservation.     Page 96         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC      Our oil dependence didn't just happen. It is the result of policy choices made over many decades. And it is something we can change, with smart policies such as I have outlined today. Each of these policies supports other critical environmental and economic objectives—they will bring cleaner air, reduce the heat-trapping pollution that is causing global warming, and save consumers billions of dollars per year. There simply are no supply-side policy alternatives that can effectively reduce our dependence on oil or deliver these other benefits.        The policy choices before this Congress are not new, but the tragedies of September 11 may have changed how we will look at them. I urge this Committee to take the lead in turning Congress in a new direction, towards a real energy security policy that actually reduces America's dangerous oil dependency.    BIOGRAPHY FOR DAVID D. DONIGER        David Doniger is policy director of the Natural Resources Defense Council's (NRDC) Climate Center. Mr. Doniger rejoined NRDC in March 2001 after serving for eight years in the Clinton administration, where he was Director of Climate Change policy at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and, before that, counsel to the head of the EPA's clean air program. He also served for a year at the Council on Environmental Quality. Mr. Doniger first began at NRDC in 1978 and worked on clean air issues for the next 14 years, helping to win the Montreal Protocol to stop depletion of the ozone layer and the Clean Air Act amendments of 1990.    75842cc.eps     Page 97         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC  75842dd.eps    75842ee.eps        Chairman  BARTLETT.  Thank you very much. The bells you heard were calling for a vote, so we will need to break. We have about five minutes remaining to make the vote, and we will return as quickly as we can. I would like to note that I also drive a Prius. We have driven it now for over 25,000 miles and couldn't be more pleased with it.        I also am opposed to drilling in ANWR, probably not for the reasons that you are opposed to it. We have only two percent of the known reserves of oil in the world. I don't think that it is bright to rush out and find and pump those two percent of reserves of oil that we have. I would like to buy all the Arab oil that they will sell us and save our oil for a rainier day. We will recess now and return as quickly as we can.        [Recess]        Chairman  BARTLETT.  We will reconvene our hearing and welcome now the testimony of Dr. MacKenzie.    STATEMENT OF DR. JAMES J. MACKENZIE, SENIOR ASSOCIATE, CLIMATE, ENERGY, AND POLLUTION PROGRAM, WORLD RESOURCES INSTITUTE       Page 98         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC     Dr.  MACKENZIE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think you did an admirable job at the beginning of this hearing summarizing the problem, namely that the domestic production is declining, ANWR is really not the answer, that global oil production is going to peak probably 10 to 20 years from now, and, lastly, that climate considerations have to be taken into account when we deal with the problem of oil.        In my remarks this morning, I would like to give you three classifications of actions that I think we should be taking to deal with the problems, short-term, medium-term, and long-term. Is this better? Okay.        There are many things that consumers could do that would instantly reduce oil use. I was going to give a quiz, but I won't do that. But I think that most people would not know, for example, the effect of tire pressure on fuel efficiency or taking weight out of the trunk, what that would do to improve fuel efficiency, or in speeding. I will give you the answer there. If you drive 55 rather than 75, you save 30 percent of the fuel that you would otherwise use, an enormous savings, and, yet, most people don't know that. And, in fact, the Congress repealed the Federal speed limit from 55, so they made the problem worse unfortunately.        But how do you make it happen? That is the trick. And there are three tools you can use to make things happen. One is you can get the prices right. And Americans loathe that because that means taxing. But I am going to suggest that if we reduce other taxes, we can make something tax neutral and still achieve your goal. You can subsidize, which is the good, old American way, or you can regulate, which is another preferred one rather than paying the prices.        I would suggest that to deal with this consumer ignorance in the short term that we ought to mount a federally financed public relations campaign along the lines that we have done for smoking, for diet, and, well, other goals that we seek to achieve as—nationally. And that the motivation could be gotten from a gradually phased-in increase in fuel taxes that would be offset by reduction in Social Security or income taxes. I know this is a difficult one for the Congress, but I think it needs to be stressed that it is necessary, if not sufficient, to price things right if we are going to use them right. And Congress calls it internalizing.     Page 99         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC      Medium term—you can buy more efficient cars, such as the hybrid, which you have already done, and I commend you for that, which will reduce fuel use by about 50 percent. Secondly, I think we should, as has been mentioned here already, phase in the CAFE standards for SUV's and minivans and light-duty trucks as personal-use vehicles as they are generally used. This could help meet the goals as well. So combining CAFE with price incentives and consumer information would go a long way, I think, in the medium term, to improve fuel efficiency.        Long term is the interesting one, in my view. And I think that we have to do several things. We have to change the energy source, clearly, away from fossil fuels, which are—have the burden of greenhouse gas emissions. And we need new kinds of public transit systems.        There is one which has been developed and prototyped out by Raytheon called the Personal Rapid Transit. It is—and is—it looks as though it is about 10 percent the cost of a heavy rail system. It is comprised of a electrified guideway with small electric vehicles on them, which are computer-driven so that the consumer has his or her own vehicle taking you nonstop to wherever you want to go without parking problems at the end. And I give, in my testimony, the website for the developer of this technology, which is patented and owned by the State of Minnesota, of all places.        Secondly, we need—and I think that a Federal subsidy for the construction of a quasi-commercial PRT system would really be an enormous help. It would take the load off—the burden of commuting off, off of automobiles and provide a vastly more efficient system than what we have today.     Page 100         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC      Next, we need new fuels. We all have talked about that this morning. And not all fuels are created equal. At the end of my testimony I have a chart which shows the fuel—the carbon dioxide emissions, greenhouse gas emissions per mile for the various fuels. If you make your fuels to substitute for oil, for example, from heavy oil sands from Canada, you actually increase the greenhouse gas emissions, which is not such a great idea. If you use CNG, try to substitute CNG for gasoline, you get a very minor reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, 25 percent. And moreover, it—we don't have that much gas.        The hybrids give you a 50 percent reduction. And that is a good transition vehicle, because it introduces electro-technology that you are going to need in the electro-EV driven cars and whether it is powered by batteries or hydrogen fuel cells.        How do we make—so if you look at this chart, it turns out there are two sources that eventually give you zero emission vehicles, and, therefore, I think the long-term goals—one is battery-driven, electric vehicles, and the other one is the hydrogen fuel cell vehicles.        And the battery vehicles have the advantage that there is an infrastructure in place now. We all have wired houses and you just have to plug them in. They are pricey. That is the problem and that is a matter of purchasing large volumes, in my opinion.        The hydrogen fuel cell is great. The fuel cells are coming along. The storage, I think, compressed gas is good enough. We don't have any infrastructure though. We have no place to generate the hydrogen. And this is an area where the Federal research ought to be increased, to look at the alternative systems for creating, transmitting, and storing hydrogen so that you can have electricity at night when the wind doesn't—when the sunlight doesn't shine, for example, with photovoltaics or wind systems, as well.     Page 101         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC      So how do we make—what should we be doing? I think that something that has not been mentioned is using the Federal purchasing power to create the marketplace, to expand production and reduce costs. For example, Congress could establish a 10-year purchasing and leasing program for as many cars and vehicles for Federal use as can meet the standards. In other words, you say you will buy all the vehicles, electric or battery or hydrogen, that will meet performance standards and cost standards. Give this—and then gradually reduce the goals to bring down costs over time.        You could also have the Congress adopt or—its own fleet of electric vehicles for use in the city here. You could have them charged in the underground garage where maybe 100 electric cars could be used for urban use, or even personal use of the Congress around town, to get you used to the technologies, and hydrogen as well.        Lastly, I think that the infrastructure needs to be examined much more thoroughly, and this is a good job for the national laboratories. Let me summarize my—the major policy recommendations that I think would achieve most of these goals over the short, medium, and long term.        Public education program on gasoline use and efficiency, along the lines that we have already seen for other nationally desired goals. Phased-in tax shift on gasoline with reduced taxes on personal income or Social Security taxes, so that the tax would be neutral, and you could call it a national security tax, if you would like. You can phase it in over time so that you get consumers used to the idea that gasoline's prices are going to be going up as they buy the new cars.     Page 102         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC      Inclusion of light-duty trucks, minivans, and SUVs under the CAFE standard. Federal support for PRT commercial demonstration. And a subsidized fleet purchase or leasing for EVs powered by batteries or hydrogen fuel cells for the general public, and as well as for the Congress itself. And research on infrastructure design and options that will allow us to make a phased transition to these sustainable transportation systems. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.        [The prepared statement of Dr. MacKenzie follows:]    PREPARED STATEMENT OF JAMES J. MACKENZIE        Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for the opportunity to appear before the Energy Subcommittee.        I have been asked to address the issue of identifying fuels and policy measures that would lead to major oil reductions, on the order of 20 percent, in the transportation sector. In addressing such a complex and politically charged issue—everyone, after all, is an expert on cars—I think it is helpful to distinguish between short-term actions, those that can be taken within hours to a few weeks, and medium and long-term actions involving the major introduction of fundamentally new fuels, technologies, and patterns of land use development.        Although today we are necessarily focusing on the short term—achieving a 20% reduction is no simple task—it is essential for the nation that we not ignore the long term if we are to evolve a transportation system that is truly sustainable. Our transportation system is certainly not sustainable today and it would take many decades to make it so. U.S. oil production has been declining since 1970 and global production will probably peak between 2010 and 2020. Hence we face a tightening oil situation beginning in one to two decades. Moreover, the bulk of the world's remaining oil is in the unstable Persian Gulf. Compounding the depletion problem, we must begin a shift away from fossil fuels if we are to cope with global climate change. Hence we have to meet the challenge of developing both non-oil energy sources and non-fossil as well.     Page 103         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC  Short-Term Measures to Reduce Oil Consumption        Some of the actions that can be taken almost immediately involve minor adjustments to the car. Others involve relatively painless changes in driving behavior. The cumulative effect on U.S. oil consumption depends on how many consumers make the changes which in turn depends on how well they are informed and whether there are financial incentives. A fairly substantial amount of analysis would be required to address these issues.        The first category involves improvements in fuel economy that can be achieved by periodic tuneups and measures such as proper tire inflation and removal of heavy objects from the trunk that simply add weight and reduce fuel economy. It is estimated that for every three pounds of pressure below the recommended value, mpg declines by one percent. (see footnote 28)  Carrying around an extra 100 pounds of unneeded weight can also cut mpg by about one percent. (see footnote 29)        Significant energy savings can be achieved quickly by changes in our driving habits. These involve decisions to combine trips, ride share, use of HOV lanes by single drivers (for which a toll is paid), avoiding jack rabbet starts, and—very importantly—not speeding. According to ORNL, driving at 75 mph rather than 55 mph reduces fuel efficiency (mpg) by almost 25 percent. (see footnote 30)  Conversely, driving 55 mph rather than 75 mph can increase mpg by 30 percent.        One can also choose to drive the most efficient vehicle in the household at least for short trips. One hardly needs a 15 mpg SUV, minivan, or pickup truck to go to the grocery store for a quart of milk.     Page 104         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC      Whatever actions one chooses, consumers need to be informed of the tradeoffs, which they are unlikely to be today. As a result they fail to take actions that are reasonable and economically attractive.    Medium Term        When gasoline prices rise rapidly, drivers react in the near term by simply driving less. They cut discretionary driving. If high prices persist over a period of months they may choose to buy a more efficient vehicle either in place of or in addition to their gas guzzler. Or they may choose to move to areas where they do not have to drive as much, either to work or to other activities. These are often areas of high residential density development with shops, retail stores, and public transportation stations nearby, within walking distance. This is the way many European cities were laid out and it results in less need to drive and lower fuel consumption. It takes years to evolve this option. But one can see it beginning around some of the METRO stations in the DC area.    Long-Term        Over the long term, years, there are major opportunities to move to other fuels, which are domestically available, to other kinds of propulsion systems, such as vehicles powered by fuel cells or electric batteries, and to new forms of public transit and land use planning.        One especially attractive new form of transit is the PRT, Personal Rapid Transit, which would be powered by electricity and so would not rely on oil at all. (For more information, visit the following website: www.taxi2000.com) A prototype of such a system was built by Raytheon Company in Boston. The system is comprised of computer guided small (four seats) electric vehicles running on their own guide ways. The system has many attractive features. It provides privacy, a guaranteed seat, no parking to worry about, and non-stop travel from station to station.     Page 105         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC      It is accessible to the young, the elderly, and the handicapped. The system can be largely built in a factory and simply site erected. Hence the time from proposal to operation can be reasonably short. The cost of a PRT system looks attractive, much less than heavy rail.    Alternative Fuels, Ranked By Their Greenhouse Emissions        In the meantime, it is important to think long-term about new fuels for vehicles. Oil poses not only a threat to national security but a threat to the global climate. Hence, in seeking a long-term substitute for oil we should seek energy systems that are also climate friendly, emitting very low or no emissions at all of carbon dioxide. Hydrogen for use in fuel cell cars where the hydrogen is made from electrolysis of water using renewable energy sources or nuclear power would be a clean, climate friendly domestically produced and sustainable form of energy. Battery powered electric vehicles would also provide similar advantages including an infrastructure of electrical distribution lines already in place.        There are many so-called alternative fuels being proposed to take the place of oil. Depending on the sources from which they are derived they can have greatly different greenhouse gas emissions (GHG). The accompanying figure shows the relative life-cycle GHG emissions of 9 kinds of fuels and/or vehicles. The lower the GHG emissions, all things being equal, the more attractive the fuel-vehicle combination from a climate perspective. Most of these results depend on work done at DOE's Argonne National Laboratory.        The top line shows emissions made from gasoline refined from Canadian oil sands. It shows that, taking the entire fuel cycle into account, this source results in 10–15 percent higher GHG emissions than from conventional gasoline from crude oil. Clearly, not an attractive substitute for conventional gasoline from a climate viewpoint.     Page 106         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC      The second row shows conventional gasoline whose emissions we set equal to 100%.        The third row shows emissions for CNG burned in an internal combustion engine. Emissions are about 25% below conventional gasoline. Not bad, but not the answer. U.S. natural gas production is static and Canada doesn't have enough natural gas to replace U.S. oil.        The fourth row shows emissions for a hybrid with a gasoline charger on the vehicle. An example of this would be the Toyota Prius. It has a 50% reduction in GHG. This combination is a good transition vehicle with impressive reductions in GHG and pollution emissions.        The fifth and sixth rows are hydrogen fuel cell vehicles and both achieved 60% reductions in GHG emissions. The first of these uses hydrogen made on board the vehicle by reforming methanol, wood alcohol. The methanol in turn is made at a refinery from natural gas. The other vehicle uses compressed hydrogen stored in the vehicle. The hydrogen is also made from natural gas at a refinery. Of these, the second would be considered preferable because the infrastructure changes would be smaller as a hydrogen economy is phased in.        The seventh vehicle is a battery operated vehicle with the electricity generated by a very efficient combined cycle power plant burning natural gas. Its GHG emissions are only 30% those of a conventional gasoline car.        The last two vehicles have nominally zero GHG emissions. The first is a hydrogen fuel cell vehicle with the hydrogen supplied by renewable resources such as Pvs or wind. Honda has constructed such a system in California. The 9th vehicle is battery powered with the electricity also derived from Pvs or wind. These vehicles are arguably the only long-term sustainable options that will reduce transportation climate and pollution emissions. Prototypes of this kind of vehicle have also been developed.     Page 107         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC  The Federal Role        The Federal Government can play an important role in encouraging the changes and programs that I have outlined above. There are at least three important areas where Federal actions are warranted.        Fuel Pricing and Public Education        First the Congress can adopt tax changes that will gradually shift taxes from income and savings to the purchase prices of fossil fuels. While the net change in tax revenue would be zero, the tax shift would have the effect of giving consumers the economic signal that they must become more efficient in their transportation decision-making. We all recognize that present fuel prices are so low that they provide little incentive to buy more efficient vehicles or to change their driving habits.        This is not to imply that higher prices, by themselves, will lead to major changes in consumer behavior. A well functioning free market also requires that consumers be informed as to the consequences of their decisions and I believe that is not the case today. I urge the Congress to authorize a nationwide public information program, much as we did for to influence eating habits, smoking, and drug use; the goal would be to educate consumers regarding energy efficiency and what they can do to save energy and money.    Federal Purchasing Power       Page 108         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC     Second, the government can use its considerable purchasing muscle to expand the markets and reduce the costs of vehicles that are more sustainable in their use of fuels. As things stand today, the government buys mostly CNG vehicles because battery Evs and hydrogen vehicles are not available in large numbers. I urge the Congress to establish a ten-year purchasing or leasing program that would have the government offer to buy, for a given year, as many Evs or hydrogen fuel cell vehicles as meet established prices and performance goals. Each year the goals and prices would change. Over time, the prices offered for purchase (or lease) would be reduced and performance goals would increase. The net effect would be a guaranteed market for sustainable vehicles with corresponding performance and cost benefits for the American public.        The Congress could itself buy or lease a fleet of several hundred Evs and/or hydrogen vehicles for its own use. These could be refueled at special stations near the Capitol and would be available to Congressmen and Senators, at no charge, for their use in personal or official business. Such a fleet would provide first hand experience for the Congress in the practicality and performance of these rapidly improving technologies.    Infrastructure Research        Finally, there is a need for more basic research on batteries, supercapacitors, and similar electric and hydrogen storage systems. There is a particular need to understand better the tradeoffs in various possible forms of hydrogen infrastructures. Questions that need to be studied include: Where and how should the hydrogen be made? Where and how should it be stored? How transmitted? In short, what are the strategic infrastructure options available in a hydrogen economy?       Page 109         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC     Finally, I would urge you not to support making synthetic oil from coal, shales, and other solid hydrocarbon sources. Such synthetic fuels will only compound the climate problem by increasing the GHG emissions over the levels from conventional vehicle fuels.    75842ff.eps    91  75842gg.eps        Chairman  BARTLETT.  Thank you very much. I want to thank all of the witnesses for their very excellent testimony. And let me turn now to my Ranking Member, Ms. Woolsey, for her questions and comments.    U.S. Market for Energy Efficient Vehicles        Ms.  WOOLSEY.  Well, Thank you, Mr. Chairman. While you were speaking, all of you, I keep thinking about the economy and about the auto industry and how this would go hand in hand to produce the right cars. I mean, you have to tell me, is there no market for these cars? I mean, it would be an excuse, a reason for people to invest in new automobiles and it would work all the way around. I guess, Mr. Dana, I am going to ask you—do you understand what I am asking without me going on and on and giving a speech, because I would like to ask other questions?        Mr.  DANA.  Congresswoman Woolsey, I think you are asking if we can do more in fuel efficiency.     Page 110         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC      Ms.  WOOLSEY.  No. I want to know if there is not a way to encourage the consumer to—by having American cars that do the right thing for the economy and the environment.        Mr.  DANA.  Well, Congresswoman, there are many vehicles today that get very good mileage that are not very popular with the public. There are over 25 models that get more than 30 miles per gallon today that don't sell.        Ms.  WOOLSEY.  Well——        Mr.  DANA.  We don't—the consumers are not interested, from our surveys, in fuel economy, per se, in terms of the preferences they, you know, show us in terms of what they want to buy.        Ms.  WOOLSEY.  Okay. Well, I am going to just ask—go one more step on this then. Is there no way, in this very creative country we live in and this very hardy industry that is having some troubles, to make them interested because we provide a car that actually is interesting?        Mr.  DANA.  Congresswoman, well, we have supported H.R. 4 and the tax credits there as a way to get consumers interested in advanced technology vehicles like hybrids, like alternate-fuel vehicles, like fuel cell vehicles. We think those are the promising technologies that are available today, and the tax incentives in H.R. 4 will help involve consumers in those decisions.     Page 111         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC  Value of PNGV Approach        Ms.  WOOLSEY.  Okay. But I don't think we are doing enough, but, okay. In Secretary Garman's statement, it was clear that, I believe, that you don't think that PNGV is going to be as effective a tool as we had hoped to increase energy efficiency. And I would like to know if the rest of the panelists—what they think about this, starting with Mr. Woolsey.        Mr.  WOOLSEY  [continuing]. That the partnership for new generation of vehicles is not going to do enough.        Ms.  WOOLSEY.  What we had hoped.        Mr.  WOOLSEY.  I think the problem now is that we need to refocus away from fuel economy to fuel-you-worry-about economy. Let us call that FYWA, F–Y–W–A. All right. If you are using 15 percent ethanol and—15 percent gasoline and 85 percent biomass ethanol in a vehicle, a Ford Taurus that is out there on the road right now, a flexible-fuel vehicle, you are getting maybe 20 miles per gallon of fuel, but of fuel that you worry about, you are getting about 85 miles per gallon. Because this illustration is in Senator Lugar's and my article.        Ms.  WOOLSEY.  Uh-huh.        Mr.  WOOLSEY.  Because although you are using a bit more fuel, because ethanol is only 70 percent as efficient as gasoline, although it is a higher octane, you are—what you are worried about is the gasoline. The biomass ethanol does not come from the Mid-East. It does not contribute essentially anything to global warming, because with biomass ethanol you are just recycling the CO from the plant fixing the CO in photosynthesis and you turn the same CO loose. You are not digging any new CO up from underneath the ground. You are not contributing to pollution because ethanol and E–85 is much cleaner than gasoline. And furthermore, you are producing—for every billion dollars of imports you replace, you are producing ten to 20,000 jobs in the United States.     Page 112         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC      So even though you are only getting 20 miles to the gallon maybe, in that Taurus, of fuel, you are getting 80 miles to the gallon of fuel you worry about, namely, gasoline. So part of the problem here is that we have been focusing solely on getting fuel economy, and people like to drive SUVs. All right. But if the SUV isn't running on gasoline from the Mid-East, if it is running on biomass ethanol, or, for that matter, if it is running on diesel fuel, 85 percent of which is produced from chicken manure that would have otherwise gone to pollute the Chesapeake——        Ms.  WOOLSEY.  Rivers.        Mr.  WOOLSEY  [continuing]. And otherwise turned into methane, which is 25 times worse as a global warming gas than CO—if you are doing something good with the fuel, you don't care that much whether you are getting 20 miles to the gallon or 25 miles to the gallon. You have replaced a big chunk of the fuel with fuel that you don't mind burning.        And so it seems to me what we need to do is rethink the notion of what we are trying to do and we—with different kinds of fuel we can have a much bigger impact sooner than simply focusing on getting better standards. As the standards go on, then if you are using ethanol, biomass ethanol, in a hybrid, you are using a tiny share of it, or in a fuel cell, you are doing even better. But you can do a lot——        Ms.  WOOLSEY.  Uh-huh.        Mr.  WOOLSEY  [continuing]. Just by changing the fuels.     Page 113         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC      Ms.  WOOLSEY.  Okay. I have been given permission to ask if any of the rest of the panel would like to respond. Dr. MacKenzie. No. I mean, Mr. Doniger.        Mr.  DONIGER.  Thank you, Congresswoman. The PNGV is a good effort. It does need some refocus. We have been concerned about several things over the years. One, that there is no production commitment at the end of the rainbow. And it—for putting Federal resources into these kinds of programs, the expectation was that the automakers were going to produce these cars. And now we have come to the end when the production should start and the automakers are moving away from production promises and the Bush Administration is moving away from the production commitment. We would like to see production of these vehicles because the hybrids that are already on the road and the hybrids that are coming are a demonstration of what could be done.        And it is also not a fair criticism, in my view, to say, while the production was focusing on tourist-like vehicles, it should have been focusing on SUVs because the technologies that are being developed are applicable to anything, from the smallest cars to the biggest SUVs. And the automakers should be able to put those into production.        We have concerns to make sure that the emission standards for the targets for these vehicles are tight emission standards so we don't have any decline in air quality performance.        Ms.  WOOLSEY.  Yeah. I think——       Page 114         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC     Mr.  DONIGER.  And the new hydrogen vehicles program should have production commitments to it.        Ms.  WOOLSEY.  All right. I have overstayed my five minutes—my—anybody else want to answer that? All right. I yield. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.        Chairman  BARTLETT.  Thank you. And, Mr. Smith.    Promoting Energy Efficiency        Mr.  SMITH.  Mr. Chairman, thank you. Thank our witnesses for being here, extremely important effort. As—and I am going to excuse myself after a couple of comments since I am going to an International Relations Committee—would like to introduce some guests that Mr. Ehlers and I viewed some of their suggestions and their effort. It is Paice Company that are developing the proposal for a more efficient automobile and its generation and transmission.        I guess one of my questions, and I am not sure it can take on a response, but as important as energy is, as important as our research effort in terms of increasing our efficiency and reducing our dependence on energy, it seems—it seems wrong for this to—for whatever reason, to be held up in the Senate and not move ahead with some kind of energy policy. Maybe it has generated into a question of ANWR rather than other elements of that energy policy that are going to increase the efficiency and reduce the pollution from coal and that research, and alternative energy source research, and the rest of that energy bill.     Page 115         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC      So I would just call on all of the Panel, to the best of your ability, to encourage the Senate to move ahead, whether it is a compromised version or not, to move ahead with what this country has long needed is a solid energy policy.        I was Director of Energy for the U.S. Department of Agriculture during the Arab Oil Embargo in the early 1970's. And at that time, of course, we went to the White House with Bill Simon and met every day on how we could increase our energy supplies and reduce our dependence on foreign fuels. And that effort of conservation and expanding our research was short-lived when energy prices went down again. And then it was not only four years later that we saw OPEC increase those prices again.        So I am looking for ways that can also encourage greater efficiency, encourage the research and development, but also somewhat concerned with not leaving a total option with the American consumer on what kind of a vehicle they want to buy and what kind of fuel consumption they want to have for their particular pocketbook. So I am like Ms. Woolsey—I am looking for alternative ways for—to encourage the American consumer in their choice. And I suspect that part of that is information. And so if we can get some of that information out to the American consumer, especially at this time, it seems to me that it would result in some advantage.    Vulnerability of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System (TAPS)        Mr. Garman, I would like to explore with you just one question on the vulnerability of the Alaskan Pipeline. And I assume that you are talking about the potential for terrorist attacks on that pipeline like we have seen in South America. I am sorry.     Page 116         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC      Mr.  WOOLSEY.  Woolsey.        Mr.  SMITH.  Yes. Apologize. Are you talking about the——        Mr.  WOOLSEY.  Yes.        Mr.  SMITH  [continuing]. Vulnerability for attacks from terrorists or a disruption of that supply from damage to the pipeline?        Mr.  WOOLSEY.  Yes. One fellow was planning, a few years ago, to shut it down with a bomb and then take advantage of the price of oil in the stock market with his purchases. Somebody shut it down briefly with a rifle shot the other day. There is—it is—my friend, Amory Lovins, calls it a 900-mile long piece of Chapstick waiting to happen in winter. It is a very fragile thing.        And were it not for TAPS (Trans-Alaska Pipeline System), I would not have a problem personally with drilling even in the Arctic and certainly with drilling in the United States. I think domestic oil is, for national security reasons, better than oil from—imported, even though I take the Chairman's point that maybe we wouldn't want to use it right away. But having it available seems to me to be good. But having it available through the Trans-Alaska Pipeline seems to me to be a very vulnerable situation indeed.        Mr.  SMITH.  And, Mr. Chairman, I would yield—well, unless Dr. Ehlers would like me to yield him the balance of my time. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.     Page 117         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC      Chairman  BARTLETT.  Let me turn next to Mr. Lampson, and then we will get back to Dr. Ehlers. Thank you.    Biomass Ethanol        Mr.  LAMPSON.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I thank you for calling this meeting. Your testimony has been most interesting. If I can ask Mr. Woolsey first, give me a very short answer—my district in southeast Texas represents probably as much as 20 percent of the petrochemical processing capacity of the country. How do you get the oil folks to buy into your biomass ethanol?        Mr.  WOOLSEY.  I think the natural place for a lot of the processing to be done initially would be oil refineries. I think, frankly, our European friends, BP and Shell, have latched onto this far more quickly than the American oil companies. Because it seems to me that blending, processing a lot of this, can easily be done at refineries. And there is no reason why energy companies that now mainly process petroleum shouldn't regard themselves as energy companies that process a number of different types of raw material into fuel. There is plenty of time to do this. We need—I mean, this is going to be a relatively slow process even if we move as fast as possible introducing ethanol——        Mr.  LAMPSON.  What kind of education is it going to take to make it happen? Who is going to have to reach out to whom?        Mr.  WOOLSEY.  I think the science is very close to being here. I don't think this is a basic research matter. The renewable energy laboratory at Golden, Colorado, has done a lot of work in hydrolyzing cellulose, which is what we are mainly talking about here, quick ways, mainly using enzymes to break cellulose polymers down into constituent sugar molecules. And several private companies have done it as well. It is really a matter of commercialization. And I think if we gave the oil companies and refinery companies the right kind of initial incentive to move into this area, they could do a very good job of combining some of the processing of petroleum and——     Page 118         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC      Mr.  LAMPSON.  If you get other information along the way that you might be able to share, I would appreciate that——        Mr.  WOOLSEY.  Certainly.    Clean Diesel        Mr.  LAMPSON  [continuing]. And maybe we can, at some point in time, pass it on. Let me ask Mr. Dana—many in the environmental community are strongly opposed to the deployment of advanced lean-burn technologies. In fact, they seem to be opposed to all diesel engines. What assurances can you give them that these new technologies can reduce the levels and types of emissions to acceptable levels? And then, Mr. Doniger, would you comment on that, as well?        Mr.  DANA.  Well, unfortunately, I think what the view of the public in this country is they still see a lot of very old diesel busses running around the country which have a lot of black smoke coming out of the tailpipe. In Europe, manufacturers are now making what we call common-rail diesel technology—very clean, very advanced diesels that don't have a lot of noise associated with them, have much lower emissions associated with them, and no black smoke.        With the inclusion of cleaner diesel fuel in this country, which EPA has promulgated rules for 2006, we hope to be able to bring technology like that to this country. And because of the lower sulfur use after treatment technology to further reduce emissions, so that we can actually have lean burn or diesel engines in this country with very low emissions, very good fuel efficiency, and very little bit of noise or black soot emissions.     Page 119         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC      Mr.  DONIGER.  Diesel engines are coming a distance from their extremely, obviously, dirty past, but they are not yet as clean as gasoline engine technology can be. And we are concerned not to see the health standards compromised—the emission standards compromised in a way that would damage health. So if the standards are set at—on the basis, frankly, of what gasoline can do, and the diesel engines can meet that, then I think that we are there. But we need some test procedures that focus on the very, very small particles and on the toxic constituents in them. And if we have those test procedures set and the diesel technology continues to improve to meet those, then that is the objective.    New Materials for Lighter, Safer Vehicles        Mr.  LAMPSON.  So I think you are saying just treat both the same, gasoline and diesel. Let me turn to a different subject real quickly, and anyone make your comments on it. In addition to fuels, we can reduce the weight of vehicles, but, at the same time, find ways to keep them just as strong. And one of the—one advance that I am familiar with is through nanotechnology and the creation of carbon-60, or buckyballs. The work that is being done by others in that area of creation of materials—can any of you comment on that? And it is going to play not only a role in decreasing the weight of the vehicles and helping us with fuel efficiency, but also it is going to create better means of us to create stronger, longer-lasting batteries, I think. Comments, please. And all of that needs to be put into context of policy with us—what we need to be doing. And I have run out of time, but would you at least answer?        Mr.  GARMAN.  The quick answer is that we view materials as a very, very important component of the technology portfolio. It is an easy thing to make a vehicle lighter. It is not so easy to make a vehicle lighter and crash-worthy. And that is the trick. Using advanced—we do a lot of work at Oak Ridge National Laboratory directed specifically at carbon-related materials and crash-worthiness and use of those materials in a car.     Page 120         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC      Mr.  LAMPSON.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.        Chairman  BARTLETT.  I am sorry. Let me turn now to Dr. Ehlers.    Alternative Fuels Issues        Mr.  EHLERS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Very seldom do I throw my scientific credentials around the Congress. They really don't make that much of an impression. But I think it is worth pointing out that there are two scientists on this panel, the Chairman and myself. We both probably feel more strongly about the importance of the energy issues we are discussing today than any other two Members of Congress do. And I think that is worth noting because—and I think the factor is, first of all, we understand the laws of thermodynamics, which, I would say, the American public doesn't understand.        And it is very important to understand those if you are going to deal with this, because, first of all, you realize from the laws of thermodynamics that energy is our most basic natural resource because we can't use any other resources if we don't have energy to produce those resources. And, number two, energy is our only non-recyclable resource. It is the only resource we have that we only get to use once and then it is gone, period. No chance of recycling it in any way.        So it is incumbent upon us, I believe, to recognize those two facts. And I am afraid that most of the economic theories about energy use don't take account of that. And that once we use the energy, it is gone, period. And so we ought to be worrying about our kids and our grandkids. Economic theories don't take that into account. What we really have to be doing is using our current fossil fuels to help us develop an entire energy economy which does not depend on fossil fuels. And that is what we are not doing, at least not doing it very effectively.     Page 121         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC      I appreciate the comments that have been made here. And I—Mr. Woolsey, your comments about ethanol, I think, are well—are right on. And we have known for years that we can produce fuels out of biomass—we just don't do it. The ideal, in order to save refining costs and particularly refining energy, would be to have farmers refining biomass on their own property using solar energy, which would be a good way to boost farm income and make use—you don't have the transportation costs of the waste products. You don't have the energy costs going into the refining process. And it makes it much more economically competitive.        I think ethanol, as a fuel, is a good idea for a number of reasons, but I am very reluctant to see food—in other words, grains, used for that. The only basis on which I think that is a good idea is that it is better to put alcohol in the tank instead of in the driver. But other than that, it is an expensive way and there are a lot of starving people in this world who could make better use of that food.        I really think that what we are going to need is dramatic new approaches. Obviously, we have to use electric vehicles to the greatest extent possible for no other reason than they are highly efficient. There is nothing that matches the efficiency of electric vehicles. And the question is, how can we generate that electricity, whether it is in plants, which is not all that efficient, or fuel cells, which is very efficient, but, at this point, difficult and demands huge new infrastructures in terms of delivering hydrogen because that is really the best way to do it, especially if you want to reduce CO.        So we are going to need dramatic new approaches, dramatic new technologies, immense new infrastructures, in the case of hydrogen. And so my question, after all that introduction, Mr. Garman, what are you going to do about it? How—that is a very ambitious program. Is DOE really thinking seriously about this? Do you have—are you given enough responsibility and enough resources to tackle these problems? Is the DOE aware, for example, of the incredible infrastructure that is going to have to take place in this Nation if we are going to a hydrogen economy? Is DOE involved in helping the automobile companies—the PNGV program, for example, is not in the Department of Energy. What do you have to say about this?     Page 122         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC      Mr.  GARMAN.  Well, the PNGV program is our program.        Mr.  EHLERS.  Yeah. I am sorry. I misspoke myself.        Mr.  GARMAN.  And we are working with our technology partners. And, frankly, they have issued that same challenge to us. They have told us, frankly and candidly, we would like to work with you on the hydrogen vehicles, but we need some assurances from you all that the technology, the infrastructure, will be there.        As you have pointed out, that is a daunting challenge. Hydrogen, as you know, embrittles pipelines. It is a difficult material. It has got energy density issues. We have storage issues with hydrogen. How can you carry enough hydrogen on the vehicle to give it the range that people will want? And we are working with technologies that range from carbon nanotubes to other kinds of technologies to try to store that carbon—I am sorry—to try to store that hydrogen and make it available in vehicles.        I don't—I think you are absolutely right in raising those questions. The Secretary has directed us to be bold, and this is a bold vision and a daunting challenge. But we think that the payoff and the reward is so great that we need to start down that pathway. And I would add that money and resources alone is not the issue. We have to do some work to reorient some of our thinking, to reorient some of our programmatic shortcomings and pull it together. It is a complicated situation that not only involves vehicles, but infrastructure. How do you make the hydrogen? How do you convert it from a specialty chemical, that it is today, to a commodity chemical that is affordable and available to consumers? You are absolutely right.     Page 123         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC      Mr.  EHLERS.  My—let me just clarify something. And I apologize for forgetting where the program was. I am on too many committees that deal with energy issues. But the real reason for government involvement and those—and that infrastructure question, is because there is not going to be time or money to let the marketplace play its normal role. We developed the gasoline stations' distribution program over many years. You know, that gradually emerged as the best fuel to use for internal combustion and so forth. We are talking about trying to get to the hydrogen economy in a decade or shortly more.        There has to be a lot of research done on all of these questions. What is the best means of transporting it? What is the best means of holding it in vehicles? Is it pressurized cylinders? Is it metal hydride? Is it some other way? Can it be done safely? What is the best way of doing all this? Immense research questions, and I just don't see the research effort being done at DOE to resolve these questions so that the private sector can pick up the ball and decide this is the way we are going to have to go. This is the infrastructure we have to build.        Mr.  GARMAN.  I don't want to mislead you, and I don't want to mislead anybody into thinking that this is a dramatic change that we are going to see in the next decade, because it is not going to come that quickly. But there are some interim technologies and things that we can think about that help us get in that direction.        Now, natural gas used in vehicles and deployment through our Clean Cities programs is one way that we can address both the biofuels issue and some of the interim gaseous technology issues that stand between us and that hydrogen vision. We have a partnership with 83 cities around the country to try to build some of the infrastructure that we need so that folks who buy the flexible fuel vehicle will have some E–85 to put into it. That is not the case everywhere today. In some cases, it is impossible to find E–85 to put in your flexible fuel vehicle.     Page 124         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC      One of the things that we are doing there is to work with partnerships, work with cities, to encourage it is a chicken-and-egg problem. Bring the infrastructure along with the fleet. In terms of natural gas, which we also do in the context of the Clean Cities Program, it is—gas has different characteristics than hydrogen, but getting consumers used to a gaseous fuel that they can put in their car is a step that we need to address, as well, as we start to think about and move toward hydrogen.        Mr.  EHLERS.  Mr. Chairman, if I may have just one moment for another comment on this. It seems to me that what we are going to see in the next decade, this decade we are in right now, is the rapid growth of hybrid vehicles, which will greatly reduce fuel consumption and CO production. But I see, starting about 2010, the beginning of the hydrogen economy. And the infrastructure research has to be done before that point, because that is when industry has to make huge decisions about investments for the hydrogen economy.        For fuel—if you are going to use fuel cells, which I think will start about 2010, you need—it makes sense to use hydrogen, rather than pre-fueling of other fuel. If you are going to use fuel cells you can get essentially zero CO out if you use hydrogen. If you don't, you are still going to have the CO problem. So why not go to the hydrogen economy? But that is going to take a lot of forethought by government in order to establish the ground rules under which industry will feel free and safe in making those investments.        And I totally agree with Mr. Woolsey's comment about the timing of the price of oil dramatically increasing at roughly 2015. And by then, if we don't have these things in place, the public is just going to go bonkers, because the price of gas is going to rise precipitously. Thank you.     Page 125         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC      Chairman  BARTLETT.  Thank you very much. As Chairman, I ordinarily stand last in the queue for asking questions. And I would like to do that today also, but I do have some time constraints. And if the next—we have only two additional members who need to ask their questions. If they can reasonably limit their question period to our 5-minute clock, then I can recognize them now. And I will do that. Ms. Jackson Lee.    Energy and Homeland Security        Ms.  JACKSON LEE.  Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, for this hearing, and I thank the Ranking Member for her leadership on these important issues and microphone that insists on not working. Let me thank the witnesses for their testimony and apologize for being in a markup at the same time of this hearing. And let me focus my questions directed toward the climate that we are in post-September 11.        I serve on the Homeland Security Task Force and even today we will be meeting. And so these issues are very front and center. They are almost—they are certainly quite different from the passage of the energy legislation out of the House that we passed this summer. It is a totally different climate.        Mr. Woolsey, what part do you believe this hearing and the focus of this hearing plays in homeland security, and what do we need to—I know that you have certainly spoken to the issue of ethanol, but let me use your expanded experience with your former affiliation to talk about briefly what we need to move to quickly as a component of homeland security dealing with our energy needs?     Page 126         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC      And I will have a subsequent question for Mr. Garman. And let me allow you to continue to be thinking about it. And I am very interested in fuel cell research. And I may have had this question before, but my interest is the amount of investment that has gone on. You might also share with me whether Houston is one of those 83 cities, but I am very interested in that. And then with the Department of Energy, I want to know what your role has been in the homeland security effort for the Administration, what you have done—that is Mr.—excuse me, that was Mr. Garman. And then what role the Department of Energy has played in homeland security? And what role have you been playing in dealing with 18-wheelers on the issue of energy efficiency? Mr. Dana, I want to deal with you on fuel cell research, etcetera. But, Mr. Woolsey, if you would, would you speak to me about where we need to head and how quickly we must get there?        Mr.  WOOLSEY.  Yes. Congresswoman, thank you. I touched on this in my opening statement. Let me explain it a little bit. We are a Nation of networks of all kinds and two of them have now been turned against us and used by terrorists—the air transport and the mail distribution network.        Virtually all of our networks are—have ignored, in being put together, the possibility that terrorists or people with evil intent can use them for damage. They are resilient against accidental failure. They are resilient against things like earthquakes and hurricanes, but they are not resilient against people figuring out how to read the way in which we deal with aircraft hijackings and turn that into a way to turn aircraft into giant cruise missiles to crash into buildings.        Our energy distribution network, I think, all of them, are disasters awaiting to happen. The centralized nature of power generation, the centralized nature of the control system for oil and gas pipelines, the dependence on foreign oil at entry at a few large facilities—all of that needs, over time, to get corrected. We need to think in terms of decentralization and resilience. We need to think in electricity generation in terms of small generate—a lot of small generators.     Page 127         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC      For example, if waste from a plant can be turned partly into natural gas or fuel gas to produce electricity and also some of it into fertilizer and oil products—and there are processes that will do that—to the degree that plants are producing their own electricity, the system is more resilient. To the degree that, whether it is ethanol or some other type of biofuel, is being produced at a lot of different places in the country, rather than at a relatively few places, we have a greater degree of resilience.        There is a whole range of changes that need to made, and they will be evolutionary. These won't happen overnight. And I think they will only be made if the companies, and those who manage the infrastructure—the oil and gas companies, the refinery companies, the electricity producers, and the rest—work somehow in cooperation with the government and here's where this Committee's role and the Congress's role comes in—incentives are given. Because if you try to do this through central planning, we will mess it up.        What has to happen is that somehow the Congress and the Executive Branch have to get together with incentives that push toward renewable fuels, decentralization, and resilience, so that as these infrastructures and networks are modified over the months and years to come, they are modified in those direction. That seems to me to be the key.        Ms.  JACKSON LEE.  Thank you. I am adhering to the Chairman's admonition. I am wondering if Mr. Garman and Mr. Dana could give a one-sentence answer out of respect for the Chairman. But I really would like to hear it. Thank you very much, Mr. Woolsey. That is—energy should be dispersed—our energy needs, and I have got it. Mr. Garman, and, Dana, are you able to give me a response on those issues that I have concern with?     Page 128         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC      Mr.  GARMAN.  With respect to critical infrastructure, the Department of Energy is working in that. We have an aggressive distributed energy portfolio to try to distribute our resources of generation and our diversity of fuels. With respect to Houston, I had the pleasure to be in Houston a couple of weeks ago to launch a Rebuilding America Program and I have the expectation we are working with our Houston Clean Cities partners. And I will be in Houston again in a few months to—and we will contact you and your office about that to——        Ms.  JACKSON LEE.  I appreciate it. And are you involved in the homeland security effort? Is the Department of Energy part of that effort?        Mr.  GARMAN.  The Department of Energy is part of that effort. My office is not directly involved beyond that effort to work on distributed energy generation——        Ms.  JACKSON LEE.  Thank you.        Mr.  GARMAN  [continuing]. Which we think makes our network more robust.        Ms.  JACKSON LEE.  But I would like to get back with you on whoever is responsible in that department and get a briefing on their efforts. And, Dr. Dana, please.       Page 129         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC     Mr.  DANA.  Yes. Fuel cells—right now there is an organization called the California Fuel Cell Partnership that has automakers, energy companies, the Air Resources Board in California, the Federal DOT, a lot of entities interested in transportation and changes to it, working very hard on looking both at the infrastructure of hydrogen and looking at developing the vehicles and getting them to a place where they can be afforded by the average consumer. And that is an ongoing effort today.        Ms.  JACKSON LEE.  Let me thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think there is some cross-pollination here and I didn't get to mention it, but I think energy and transportation need to get together and we all need to be funding light rail wherever we can fund it, or rail in a very efficient manner. But we have to begin to look at different modes of transportation. Thank you.        Chairman  BARTLETT.  Thank you. Mr. Gutknecht.    Issues in Setting Energy Policy        Mr.  GUTKNECHT.  I will attempt to be very brief, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Garman, I—listening to this testimony, I was both elevated and frustrated because there is, even among the panelists, and they are all distinguished esteemed members of the scientific community, but there is misunderstanding even among them. And it is frustrating, and, I guess, as I listen to this, I am not surprised that our colleagues over on the other side of the Congress are taking no action on an energy bill.        Because what we really have is collections of experts who say, well, we want an energy policy as long as it does ''X.'' We want energy policy as long as it doesn't do ''Y.'' For example, I mean, we heard the comment by one of the experts today that, well, it didn't make any sense to make ethanol out of corn. Well, maybe it doesn't. And, in fact, another person said, well, it doesn't make any sense to develop the Arctic National Wildlife oil because it represents only a 6-month supply. But taken by themselves, every one of the technologies we have talked about today, represents a very, very small part of the solution.     Page 130         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC      And, as long as we have various groups saying, well, I support an energy policy as long as you don't do this, I support an energy policy as long as you don't do that, I mean, how is the American—how are the American people to look at this and come up with a conclusion? Because at the end of the day, what the American people say, well, if we can get oil that costs $1 a barrel to produce in Saudi Arabia, why do we want to invest any money in new technologies when not even the experts will agree?        I guess my point I really want to get to—and let me just add to this to the whole story about renewable fuels—and I believe in renewable fuels and I believe in more efficient engines. I believe in fuel cell technology. I think all of these will play a role.        But I just want to make a point about renewable fuels. Currently, they represent only 7/10 of one percent of all the energy we consume, at least in the form of a liquid petroleum-type product. Now, that takes six percent of all the corn we produce. If we converted all of the corn in the United States to ethanol, it would still only represent about 12 percent. Now, some people would say, well, that is not enough to even fool with. Maybe we shouldn't mess with it. I think it is an important part of the long-term solution.        I also believe that biodiesel represents an important part of our long-term energy solution. Let me give you an example. Right now—last year—the last year we have numbers available for—and you can be helpful in this—the United States military bought approximately 248 million gallons of diesel. Now, I suspect that number is going to be considerably higher this year. But if we could get just a 20 percent blend in the fuel that the military buys, that would be 50 million barrels of biodiesel, which would consume 379 million pounds of soybean oil. And it would also, I think, keep the environment much cleaner, because the studies we have seen demonstrate that it is a very clean burning fuel.     Page 131         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC      I guess the real question I have for you, Mr. Garman, is we have a bill that I am co-sponsoring in the House. It is H.R. 2423. The companion is Senate Bill 1006, which is sponsored by Senators Hagel and Johnson. We would like to see the Administration support that legislation. And all it really calls for is setting goals for renewable fuels, moving from about a one percent target in 2008 to a three percent target in 2011, and a five percent target in 2016. Now, with what is happening over in the other body right now, it may be the only bill that is going to come out of this Congress this year.        So I just wanted to at least get an editorial plug in for that bill. I think it is the right direction to go. And I also want to encourage a lot of the experts to start talking to each other, listening to each other, and not being quite so parochial, saying, well, we would support an energy policy as long as it doesn't include ANWR. We include—you know, we would support energy policy as long as it doesn't include corn-based ethanol. I mean, that is the kind of thinking that is going to create the situation like was referred to in the engineer's manual of the Union Pacific Railroad Engineer's Manual a number of years ago. And that is—and I quote, ''If two trains should approach each other on the same track, neither shall advance until the other is passed.'' And so they are sitting there looking at each other and we have no real energy policy. And you have got a tough job. I don't want to make it worse. But we would appreciate your support on 2423. Thank you.        Mr.  GARMAN.  I could very briefly respond. I don't want to take the Chairman's time. But very briefly, thank you for those astute observations. You are right. We think we have 500 million gallons a year of potential for biodiesel. And we do have DoD included in our heavy-truck program because we think that there are certain synergies—anything that will work for over-the-road highway trucks can work for DOD as well. And they are the largest fuel user in the country, the largest single fuel user, and it is very important that they are a part of the program as well. And thus far, they have been superb.     Page 132         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC  Biomass Ethanol vs. Grain Ethanol        Mr.  WOOLSEY.  Could I just add one point? Congressman, I am not all opposed to corn-based ethanol. I—but the numbers you cited illustrate a point, which is that if all of the corn in the country can be used to replace 12 percent of our transportation fuel, the numbers from Professor Lee Lynd of Dartmouth, who has worked—gave us some of the data for Senator Lugar's and my article that you have, indicated that nearly 10 percent of the transportation fuel in the country could be replaced by processing a very small share of the country's agricultural wastes.        So as long as we are using starch, which is well under one percent of what grows to produce transportation fuel, we are going to need an awful lot of the starch in order to produce a little bit of transportation fuel. If we can not only give credits for corn-based ethanol, but enhanced credits for biomass-based ethanol, we will be able to use waste instead of what we could feed to animals or eat ourselves. And to me, that is the evolution that we want to see the ethanol companies, as well as the oil companies, move toward.    Oil Resources and Depletion        Chairman  BARTLETT.  Thank you. I want to thank the witnesses very much. First, let me just make a very brief statement, expand very briefly on what I said earlier about my position on drilling. We have only two percent of the known reserves of oil in the world. I just don't think, from the national security perspective, it makes any sense to go out and find that and pump it as quickly as possible. If we could find and pump that oil tomorrow, what would we do the day after tomorrow?     Page 133         PREV PAGE         TOP OF DOC      Now, if we could, I would like to go out and drill every place that we possibly could drill in this country to find oil. Then I would like to pump none of it, relatively, and buy Arab oil as long as they will sell it to us. I am sure there will be a much rainier day than we have today when those oil reserves would be much more useful to

Anniversaries are often a time of reflection.  In this spirit, the Energy Information Administration presents here 30 major energy trends in the United States over this period.  Taken as a whole, these measures provide a picture of how this country has responded to the crisis a quarter century ago.    Through 1972, Americans had become accustomed to expanding energy consumption with minimal concerns about the constancy of supply or sharp price escalations.  In 1973, however, expectations about energy supply changed dramatically.    The turmoil started early in 1973, as customers experienced electricity brown outs and rapidly rising prices for fuels and other necessities.  Price controls and allocation systems not only failed to resolve these problems, they seemed to aggravate them.  Most memorably, October brought an oil embargo by members of the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries, cutting further into the supply of oil and elevating prices to levels previously thought impossible.  Customers experienced lines and sometimes no fuel at gasoline stations.    A year of bad news was punctuated in December, when the President announced that because of the energy crisis the lights on the national Christmas tree would not be turned on.    Throughout the year, energy stayed at the forefront of public attention.  Interruptions in energy supplies were also closely related to other issues of national importance-a weakening of the economy and a reassessment of America's strategic position in the world.    The purpose of this presentation is not to assess the causes of the 1973 energy crisis or the measures that were adopted to resolve it.  Our intent is to present some data on which such analyses can be based.  Those interested in a fuller set of statistics are urged to consult our recently published Annual Energy Review (Web Site address: http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/aer/contents.html ).    Many of the trends presented here fall into two distinct periods.  From 1973 to the mid-1980's, prices continued at very high levels, in part because of a second oil shock in 1979-80.  During this period, rapid progress was made in raising American oil production, reducing dependence on oil imports, and improving end-use efficiency.  After the oil price collapse of the mid-1980's, however, prices retreated to more moderate levels, the pace of efficiency gains slowed, American oil production fell, and the share of imports rose.    We hope that the marking of this anniversary will stimulate a lively dialogue on energy issues and that the data presented here will contribute to that discussion.     Jay E.

Overall, the Clear Skies Act would ensure that power plants reduce these         three air pollutants by 70 percent from current levels, without having         to endure years of court battles.         Total Reductions Under the Clear Skies Act :                                Cuts sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions by 73 percent, from current                  emissions of 11 million tons to a cap of 4.5 million tons in 2010,                  and 3 million tons in 2018.                                   Cuts emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) by 67 percent, from                    current emissions of 5 million tons to a cap of 2.1 million                    tons in 2008, and to 1.7 million tons in 2018.                                 Cuts mercury emissions by 69 percent – the first-ever                    national cap on mercury emissions. Emissions would be cut from                    current emissions of 48 tons to a cap of 26 tons in 2010, and                    15 tons in 2018.                      Reductions Over the Next Decade would Be Greater Than Possible Under         the Current Clean Air Act:         As shown on the charts for  SO2 ,  NOx ,         and  mercury , Clear Skies would achieve substantially         greater reductions in air pollution from power plants, more quickly, and         with more certainty. The President's initiative would:                            Reduce 25 million tons more SO2 over the next decade than the Clean           Air Act.                            Reduce 10 million tons more NOx over the next decade than the Clean           Air Act.                            Reduce 20 tons more mercury over the next 6 years than the Clean Air           Act.                         As discussed below, it is not possible to accurately project how the         current Clean Air Act would reduce power plant emissions beyond 2012, due         to the many uncertainties involved, but the Clear Skies Act is likely         to equal or exceed any reductions under the future implementation of the         current Clean Air Act. To ensure that this is the case, and to provide         greater certainty in progress towards cleaner air, the Clear Skies Act         requires the EPA Administrator to review, before 2010, new scientific,         technology, and cost information, and to adjust the Phase II (2018) caps         if necessary to meet clean air standards.         Faster and Greater : The Clear Skies Act would achieve greater         reductions than the current CAA. Like the reductions that occurred under         the 1990 Clean Air Act's cap-and-trade acid rain program, the President's         Clear Skies Act would achieve early emissions reductions by allowing         sources to ""bank"" credits. It would accomplish greater reductions         than current law by (1) setting caps below the levels that current law         would accomplish, and (2) creating incentives for ""overcompliance""         – power plants choosing to reduce pollution more than required, earlier         than required, so they can generate and sell credits.         Less Cost:  By relying on market-based mechanisms, the Clear Skies         Act provides sources with the flexibility to plan the most cost-effective         compliance strategies. The 1990 Clean Air Act's acid rain program has accomplished         dramatic reductions in SO2 emissions at only one-third the cost that a         command-and-control approach would have.         Guaranteed Results:  Under the Clear Skies Act the emissions         levels and deadlines would be established through legislation, eliminating         the strong likelihood of delays due to cumbersome regulatory processes         and litigation. Extensive litigation in recent years over the ozone and         particulate matter rules, the NOx SIP calls, Section 126 petitions, and         numerous NSR lawsuits highlight the likelihood that future litigation would         delay the implementation of future rules, and cast their ultimate outcomes         in doubt. The caps set under the Clear Skies Act ensure that the         required reductions in SO2, NOx and mercury are achieved and maintained         over time, even as new power plants are built. All plants would be required         to conduct continuous emissions monitoring which would ensure accurate and         complete measurement of total emissions. Clean air goals are accomplished         on a certain timeline, regardless of levels of economic growth or changes         in energy generation.         The Clean Air Act Cannot Achieve Comparable Reductions in Pollution         The charts for  SO2 ,  NOx ,         and  mercury  outline the emission levels that the current         Clean Air Act (CAA) would lead to over the next decade.          Beyond this time frame, the CAA would require EPA and States to issue         a series of regulations that would – separately and in an uncoordinated         manner – control SO2, NOx, and mercury from power plants and other         sources. The regulatory development debate is usually very controversial,         and compliance deadlines are often delayed – and the actual level         of reductions altered – as a result. Finally, because there is no         incentive to reduce emissions early – and there is significant uncertainty         in the outcome of the litigation – companies typically don't act to         reduce their emissions until the last minute.         Sulfur Dioxide (SO2):  The only provision of the current CAA that         would significantly reduce emissions of SO2 from power generation through         2012 is Phase Two of the acid rain program, which would bring emissions         to approximately 9 million tons. In contrast, the President's Clear Skies         Act would set a Phase One cap of 4.5 million tons in 2010. The President's         approach brings greater reductions, with greater certainty, on a faster         timeline.         Beyond 2012, further SO2 reductions would likely be achieved by the following         four regulatory programs of the current Clean Air Act. Emissions reductions         could only be achieved by some or all of the following multiple regulatory         programs, each of which would produce uncertain results along an uncertain         timeline, depending on the outcome of extensive litigation. These programs         include:                            A regional haze rule that would require states to submit a State Implementation           Plan (SIP) to address long-term visibility goals including regulations           on best available retrofit technology (BART).                             A new SIP call to help meet a new fine particulate matter standard           that is currently being litigated.                             Potential petitions by states under CAA Section 126 to compel regulations           requiring reductions of fine particulate matter from power plants in           other states.                            Anticipated individual state implementation actions.                        Nitrogen Oxides (NOx):  The only provision of the current CAA that         would significantly reduce NOx emissions from power generation through 2012         is the NOx SIP call (along with a redundant Section 126 rule). These rules         are still under litigation. When effective, they would reduce NOx to approximately         4.25 million tons by 2012. In comparison, the President's Clear Skies Act would reduce NOx emissions to meet a 2.1 million ton cap in 2008, and a         1.7 million tons cap in 2018. The President's approach brings greater reductions,         with greater certainty, on a faster timeline.                  Beyond 2012, the current CAA provides opportunities to reduce NOx from         power plants below the projected 4.25 million ton level, but these reductions         could only be achieved by some or all of the following multiple regulatory         programs, each of which would produce uncertain results along an uncertain         timeline, depending on the outcome of extensive litigation. These programs         include:                  The regional haze rule requires states to submit a SIP to address long-term          visibility goals including best available retrofit technology (or BART)          regulations.          Continuation of current NOx SIP call for Eastern states          A new SIP call to address the new federal standard for ozone that is          still being litigated          A new SIP call to address the new federal standard for fine particulate          matter that is still being litigated           New state regulations to reduce power plant emissions within their          own states          Potential petitions by states under CAA Section 126 to compel regulations          requiring reductions of NOx from power plants in other states          Modest reductions from New Source Review                 Mercury:  For mercury, the only reductions that would be achieved         by the current CAA through 2008 are collateral reductions to approximately         43 tons resulting from implementation of the rules for SO2 and NOx. Another         program, which requires case-by-case mercury control determinations by         states for new power plants, would limit growth in mercury emissions. In         2008 at the earliest, depending on litigation, power plants would be required         to comply with a new technology standard that has not yet been proposed,         but which would likely achieve significant further reductions.          In contrast, the President's initiative would lead to immediate and ongoing         reductions in mercury emissions to reach a cap of 26 tons per year in 2010,         and 15 tons in 2018. The President's approach brings greater reductions,         with greater certainty, on a faster timeline.         Less Significant, and Less Certain Reductions in Air Pollution:          With each of these separate regulatory steps projected to occur under the         existing Clean Air Act, there is considerable uncertainty about what level         of actual reductions in air pollution would be accomplished, and precisely         when the reductions would occur due to the near-certainty of extensive litigation         on each individual rulemaking process. The President's initiative would         bring guaranteed results, beginning immediately after enactment.                   Slower Reductions in Air Pollution:  History has shown that regulatory         debate, a cumbersome regulatory process, and extensive related litigation         can delay implementation of the current CAA at both the State and federal         level. This in turn slows reductions from taking effect as originally intended.                   More Expensive Approach to Clean Air:  Under the current CAA, much         of the emissions reductions would be achieved through command and control         regimes, which are less efficient and more costly than market-based programs.         Misinformation About What the Existing Clean Air Act would Accomplish                 Some organizations are circulating materials that contain misleading         information about what current Clean Air Act programs would accomplish in         the next decade. These materials purport to show that these Clean Air Act         programs would produce greater reductions than the President's Clear Skies         Act. As described above, this is simply not the case.         The organizations circulating these materials did not provide any analysis         to support their assertions. Instead they base their analysis solely on         one slide from a presentation. This slide did not reflect an EPA analysis         of actual emissions reduction scenarios that would occur under the Clean         Air Act. However, it did contain hypothetical scenarios on a timeline that         understandably might have been confusing to some.                EPA developed the scenarios for analytical purposes to illustrate the                benefits of a multi-pollutant approach (under which industry knows                ahead of time the reductions it would need to achieve in all three                pollutants) compared to a traditional ""business-as-usual""                regulatory approach (under which requirements for different pollutants                are issued one at a time over a multiyear period). The slide was                used for illustrative purposes, and does not show an actual scenario                that is likely to be achieved under the Clean Air Act.          As outlined above, the Clear Skies Act would achieve substantially         greater emissions reduction than the current Clean Air Act would achieve         over the next decade, with far greater certainty.                                                                                                                  About          Portable Document Format (PDF) files                                                                                                                   EPA Home  |  Privacy      and Security Notice  |                   Contact Us"

For the most part, the glossary provides fuller definitions              than those given in the summary itself. When a word or group of words              is printed in italics within a definition, that tells you that you'll              find a definition of the word or group of words elsewhere in the glossary.                 Acid rain  -- Air  pollution  produced when                acid chemicals are incorporated into rain, snow, fog or mist. The                ""acid"" in acid rain comes from sulfur oxides and  nitrogen                 oxides, products of burning coal and other fuels and from certain                industrial processes. The sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides are                related to two strong acids: sulfuric acid and nitric acid. When                sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides are released from power plants                and other  sources , winds blow them far from their source.                If the acid chemicals in the air are blown into areas where the                weather is wet, the acids can fall to Earth in the rain, snow, fog                or mist. In areas where the weather is dry, the acid chemicals may                become incorporated into dusts or smokes. Acid rain can damage the                environment. human health and property.                Alternative fuels  -- Fuels that can replace ordinary                gasoline. Alternative fuels may have particularly desirable energy                efficiency and  pollution  reduction features. Alternative                fuels include compressed natural gas, alcohols, liquefied petroleum                gas (LPG), and electricity. The 1990  Clean Air Act  encourages                development and sale of alternative fuels.                Attainment area  -- A geographic area in which levels                of a criteria air pollutant meet the health-based primary standard                (national ambient air quality standard, or NAAQS) for the pollutant.                An area may have on acceptable level for one criteria air pollutant,                but may have unacceptable levels for others. Thus, an area could                be both attainment and nonattainment at the same time. Attainment                areas are defined using federal pollutant limits set by EPA.                Carbon monoxide (CO)  -- A colorless, odorless, poisonous                gas, produced by incomplete burning of carbon-based fuels. including                gasoline, oil and wood. Carbon monoxide is also produced from incomplete                 combustion  of many natural and synthetic products. For instance,                cigarette smoke contains carbon monoxide. When carbon monoxide gets                into the body, the carbon monoxide combines with chemicals in the                blood and prevents the blood from bringing oxygen to cells, tissues                and organs. The body's parts need oxygen for energy, so high-level                exposures to carbon monoxide can cause serious health effects, with                death possible from massive exposures. Symptoms of exposure to carbon                monoxide can include vision problems, reduced alertness, and general                reduction in mental and physical functions. Carbon monoxide exposures                are especially harmful to people with heart, lung and circulatory                system diseases.                CFCs (chlorofluorocarbons)  -- These chemicals and                some related chemicals have been used in great quantities in industry,                for refrigeration and air conditioning, and in consumer products.                CFCs and their relatives, when released into the air, rise into                the  stratosphere , a layer of the atmosphere high above the                Earth. In the stratosphere, CFCs and their relatives take part in                chemical reactions which result in reduction of the stratospheric                 ozone  layer, which protects the Earth's surface from harmful                effects of radiation from the sun. The 1990  Clean Air Act                 includes provisions for reducing releases (emissions) and eliminating                production and use of these ozone-destroying chemicals.                Clean Air Act  -- The original Clean Air Act was                passed in 1963, but our national air pollution control program is                actually based on the 1970 version of the law. The 1990 Clean Air                Act Amendments are the most far-reaching revisions of the 1970 law.                In this summary, we refer to the 1990 amendments as the 1990 Clean                Air Act.                Clean fuels  -- Low-pollution fuels that can replace                ordinary gasoline. These are  alternative  fuels, including                gasohol (gasoline-alcohol mixtures), natural gas and LPG (liquefied                petroleum gas).                Combustion  -- burning. Many important pollutants,                such as  sulfur dioxide ,  nitrogen oxides , and  particulates                 (PM-10) are combustion products, often products of the burning of                fuels such as coal, oil, gas and wood.                Continuous emission monitoring systems  (CEMS)  --                machines which measure, on a continuous basis,  pollutants                 released by a  source . The 1990  Clean Air Act  requires                continuous emission monitoring systems for certain large sources.                Control technology; control measures  -- equipment,                processes or actions used to reduce air pollution. The extent of                pollution reduction varies among technologies and measures. In general,                control technologies and measures that do the best job of reducing                pollution will be required in the areas with the worst pollution.                For example, the  best available control technology/best available                control measures  (BACT,BACM) will be required in serious  nonattainment                areas  for  particulates , a  criteria air pollutant .                A similar high level of pollution reduction will be achieved with                 maximum achievable control technology  (MACT) which will be                required for sources releasing hazardous air pollutants.                Criteria air pollutants  -- a group of very common                air  pollutants  regulated by EPA on the basis of criteria                (information on health and/or environmental effects of pollution).                Criteria air pollutants are widely distributed all over the country.                Curtailment programs  -- restrictions on operation                of fireplaces and woodstoves in areas where these home heat sources                make major contributions to  pollution .                Emission  -- release of  pollutants  into the                air from a  source . We say sources  emit  pollutants.                 Continuous emission monitoring systems  (CEMS) are machines                which some large sources are required to install, to make continuous                measurements of pollutant release.                Enforcement  -- the legal methods used to make polluters                obey the  Clean Air Act . Enforcement methods include citations                of polluters for violations of the law (citations are much like                traffic tickets), fines and even jail terms. EPA and the state and                local governments are responsible for enforcement of the  Clean                Air Act , but if they don't enforce the law, members of the public                can sue EPA or the states to get action. Citizens can also sue violating                 sources , apart from any action EPA or state or local governments                have taken. Before the 1990  Clean Air Act , all enforcement                actions had to be handled through the courts. The 1990  Clean                Air Act  gave EPA authority so that, in some cases, EPA can fine                violators without going to court first. The purpose of this new                authority is to speed up violating sources' compliance with the                law and reduce court time and cost.                Hazardous air pollutants  (HAPs)  -- chemicals that                cause serious health and environmental effects. Health effects include                cancer, birth defects, nervous system problems and death due to                massive accidental releases such as occurred at the pesticide plant                in Bhopal, India. Hazardous air pollutants are released by  sources                 such as chemical plants, dry cleaners, printing plants, and motor                vehicles (cars, trucks, buses, etc.)                Inspection and maintenance program  (I/M program)                 -- Auto inspection programs are required for some polluted areas.                These periodic inspections, usually done once a year or once every                two years, check whether a car is being maintained to keep  pollution                 down and whether emission control systems are working properly.                Vehicles which do not pass inspection must be repaired. As of 1992,                111 urban areas in 35 states already had I/M programs. Under the                1990  Clean Air Act , some especially polluted areas will have                to have  enhanced inspection and maintenance programs , using                special machines that can check for such things as how much pollution                a car produces during actual driving conditions.                International air pollution  -- Canada and Mexico,                the United States' neighbors, share the air at our borders.  Pollution                 moves across the national borders; this international pollution                can be serious. The 1990  Clean Air Act  includes provisions                for cooperative efforts to reduce pollution that originates in one                country and affects another.                Interstate air pollution  -- In many areas, two or                more states share the same air. We say these states are in the same                air basin defined by geography and wind patterns. Often, air  pollution                 moves out of the state in which it is produced into another state.                Some pollutants, such as the power plant  combustion  products                that cause  acid rain , may travel over several states before                affecting health, the environment and property. The 1990  Clean                Air Act  includes many provisions, such as interstate compacts,                to help states work together to protect the air they share. Reducing                interstate air pollution is very important since many Americans                live and work in areas where more than one state is part of a single                metropolitan area.                Material safety data sheets  (MSDS)  -- product safety                information sheets prepared by manufacturers and marketers of products                containing toxic chemicals. These sheets can be obtained by requesting                them from the manufacturer or marketer. Some stores, such as hardware                stores, may have material safety data sheets on hand for products                they sell.                Mobile sources  -- moving objects that release  pollution ;                mobile sources include cars, trucks, buses, planes, trains, motorcycles                and gasoline-powered lawn mowers. Mobile sources are divided into                two groups: road vehicles, which includes cars, trucks and buses,                and non-road vehicles, which includes trains, planes and lawn mowers.                Monitoring  (monitor)  Measurement of air  pollution                 is referred to as monitoring. EPA, state and local agencies measure                the types and amounts of pollutants in community air. The 1990  Clean                Air Act  requires certain large polluters to perform enhanced                monitoring to provide an accurate picture of their pollutant releases.                Enhanced monitoring programs may include keeping records on materials                used by the  source , periodic inspections, and installation                of  continuous emission monitoring systems  (CEMS). Continuous                emission monitoring systems will measure, on a continuous basis,                how much pollution is being released into the air. The 1990  Clean                Air Act  requires states to monitor community air in polluted                areas to check on whether the areas are being cleaned up according                to schedules set out in the law.                Nitrogen oxides  (NOx)  -- a  criteria air pollutant .                Nitrogen oxides are produced from burning fuels, including gasoline                and coal. Nitrogen oxides are smogformers, which react with volatile                organic compounds to form smog. Nitrogen oxides are also major components                of acid rain.                Nonattainment area  -- a geographic area in which                the level of a  criteria air pollutant  is higher than the                level allowed by the federal standards. A single geographic area                may have acceptable levels of one criteria air pollutant but unacceptable                levels of one or more other criteria air pollutants; thus, an area                can be both attainment and nonattainment at the same time. It has                been estimated that 60% of Americans live in nonattainment areas.                Offset  -- a method used in the 1990  Clean Air                Act  to give companies which own or operate large (major)  sources                 in  nonattainment areas  flexibility in meeting overall pollution                reduction requirements when changing production processes. If the                owner or operator of the source wishes to increase release of a                 criteria air pollutant , an  offset  (reduction of a                somewhat greater amount of the same pollutant) must be obtained                either at the same plant or by purchasing offsets from another company.                Oxygenated fuel  (oxyfuel)  -- special type of gasoline,                which burns more completely than regular gasoline in cold start                conditions; more complete burning results in reduced production                of  carbon monoxide , a  criteria air pollutant . In some                parts of the country, carbon monoxide release from cars starting                up in cold weather makes a major contribution to pollution. In these                areas, gasoline refiners must market oxygenated fuels, which contain                a higher oxygen content than regular gasoline. Some gasoline companies                started selling oxyfuels in cities with carbon monoxide problems                before the 1990  Clean Air Act  was passed.                Ozone  -- a gas which is a variety of oxygen. The                oxygen gas found in the air consists of two oxygen atoms stuck together;                this is molecular oxygen. Ozone consists of three oxygen atoms stuck                together into an ozone molecule. Ozone occurs in nature; it produces                the sharp smell you notice near a lightning strike. High concentrations                of ozone gas are found in a layer of the atmosphere -- the  stratosphere                 -- high above the Earth. Stratospheric ozone shields the Earth against                harmful rays from the sun, particularly  ultraviolet B .  Smog 's                main component is ozone; this ground-level ozone is a product of                reactions among chemicals produced by burning coal, gasoline and                other fuels, and chemicals found in products including solvents,                paints, hairsprays, etc.                Ozone hole  -- thin place in the ozone layer located                in the  stratosphere  high above the Earth. Stratospheric ozone                thinning has been linked to destruction of stratospheric ozone by                CFCs and related chemicals. The 1990  Clean Air Act  has provisions                to reduce and eliminate ozonedestroying chemicals' production and                use. Ozone holes have been found above Antarctica and above Canada                and northern parts of the United States, as well as above northern                Europe.                Particulates particulate matter  (PM-10)  -- a  criteria                air pollutant . Particulate matter includes dust, soot and other                tiny bits of solid materials that are released into and move around                in the air. Particulates are produced by many sources, including                burning of diesel fuels by trucks and buses, incineration of garbage,                mixing and application of fertilizers and pesticides, road construction,                industrial processes such as steel making, mining operations, agricultural                burning (field and slash burning), and operation of fireplaces and                woodstoves. Particulate pollution can cause eye, nose and throat                irritation and other health problems.                Permit  -- a document that resembles a license, required                by the  Clean Air Act  for big (major) sources of air pollution,                such as power plants, chemical factories and, in some cases, smaller                polluters. Usually permits will be given out by states, but if EPA                has disapproved part or all of a state permit program, EPA will                give out the permits in that state. The 1990 Clean Air Act includes                requirements for permit applications, including provisions for members                of the public to participate in state and EPA reviews of permit                applications. Permits will have, in one place, information on all                the regulated pollutants at a source. Permits include information                on which pollutants are being released, how much the source is allowed                to release, and the program that will be used to meet pollutant                release requirements. Permits are required both for the operation                of plants (operating permits) and for the construction of new plants.                The 1990 Clean Air Act introduced a nationwide permit system for                air pollution control.                Permit fees  -- fees paid by businesses required                to have a  permit . Permit fees are like the fees drivers pay                to register their cars. The money from permit fees will help pay                for state air pollution control activities.                Pollutants  (pollution)  -- unwanted chemicals or                other materials found in the air. Pollutants can harm health, the                environment and property. Many air pollutants occur as gases or                vapors, but some are very tiny solid particles: dust, smoke or soot.                Primary standard  -- a  pollution  limit based                on health effects. Primary standards are set for  criteria air                pollutants .                Reformulated gasoline  -- specially refined gasoline                with low levels of smog-forming  volatile organic compounds                 (VOCs) and low levels of  hazardous air pollutants . The 1990                 Clean Air Act  requires sale of reformulated gasoline in the                nine smoggiest areas. Reformulated gasolines were sold in several                smoggy areas even before the 1990 Clean Air Act was passed.                Secondary standard  -- a  pollution  limit based                on environmental effects such as damage to property, plants, visibility,                etc. Secondary standards are set for  criteria air pollutants .                Smog  -- a mixture of  pollutants , principally                ground-level  ozone , produced by chemical reactions in the                air involving smog-forming chemicals. A major portion of smog-formers                come from burning of petroleum-based fuels such as gasoline. Other                smog-formers,  volatile organic compounds , are found in products                such as paints and solvents. Smog can harm health, damage the environment                and cause poor visibility. Major smog occurrences are often linked                to heavy motor vehicle traffic, sunshine, high temperatures and                calm winds or  temperature inversion  (weather condition in                which warm air is trapped close to the ground instead of rising).                Smog is often worse away from the source of the smog-forming chemicals,                since the chemical reactions that result in smog occur in the sky                while the reacting chemicals are being blown away from their sources                by winds.                Source  -- any place or object from which  pollutants                 are released. A source can be a power plant, factory, dry cleaning                business, gas station or farm. Cars, trucks and other motor vehicles                are sources, and consumer products and machines used ir industry                can be sources too. Sources that stay in one place are referred                to as  stationary sources ; sources that move around, such                as cars or planes, are called mobile sources.                State implementation plan  (SIP)  -- a detailed description                of the programs a state will use to carry out its responsibilities                under the  Clean Air Act . State implementation plans are collections                of the regulations used by a state to reduce air  pollution .                The Clean Air Act requires that EPA approve each state implementation                plan. Members of the public are given opportunities to participate                in review and approval of state implementation plans.                Stationary source  -- a place or object from which                 pollutants  are released and which does not move around. Stationary                sources include power plants, gas stations, incinerators, houses                etc.                Stratosphere  -- part of the atmosphere, the gases                that encircle the Earth. The stratosphere is a layer of the atmosphere                9-31 miles above the Earth.  Ozone  in the stratosphere filters                out harmful sun rays, including a type of sunlight called  ultraviolet                B , which has been linked to health and environmental damage.                Sulfur dioxide  -- a  criteria air pollutant .                Sulfur dioxide is a gas produced by burning coal, most notably in                power plants. Some industrial processes, such as production of paper                and smelting of metals, produce sulfur dioxide. Sulfur dioxide is                closely related to sulfuric acid, a strong acid. Sulfur dioxide                plays an important role in the production of  acid rain .                Temperature inversion  -- one of the weather conditions                that are often associated with serious  smog  episodes in some                portions of the country . In a temperature inversion, air doesn't                rise because it is trapped near the ground by a layer of warmer                air above it.  Pollutants , especially smog and smog-forming                chemicals, including  volatile organic compounds , are trapped                close to the ground. As people continue driving, and sources other                than motor vehicles continue to release smog-forming pollutants                into the air, the smog level keeps getting worse.                Ultraviolet B  (UVB)  -- a type of sunlight. The  ozone                 in the  stratosphere , high above the Earth, filters out ultraviolet                B rays and keeps them from reaching the Earth. Ultraviolet B exposure                has been associated with skin cancer, eye cataracts and damage to                the environment. Thinning of the ozone layer in the stratosphere                results in increased amounts of ultraviolet B reaching the Earth.                Vapor recovery nozzles  -- special gas pump nozzles                that will reduce release of gasoline vapor into the air when people                put gas in their cars. There are several types of vapor recovery                nozzles, so nozzles may look different at different gas stations.                The 1990  Clean Air Act  requires installation of vapor recovery                nozzles at gas stations in smoggy areas.                Volatile organic compounds  (VOCs)  -- Organic chemicals                all contain the element carbon (C); organic chemicals are the basic                chemicals found in living things and in products derived from living                things, such as coal, petroleum and refined petroleum products.                Many of the organic chemicals we use do not occur in Nature, but                were synthesized by chemists in laboratories.  Volatile  chemicals                produce  vapors  readily; at room temperature and normal atmospheric                pressure, vapors escape easily from volatile liquid chemicals. Volatile                organic chemicals include gasoline, industrial chemicals such as                benzene, solvents such as toluene and xylene, and tetrachloroethylene                (perchloroethylene, the principal dry cleaning solvent). Many volatile                organic chemicals are also  hazardous air pollutants ; for                example, benzene causes cancer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Publications           |  Organization  |  Technical          Information                                                                                                               EPA Home  |  Privacy          and Security Notice  |                               Contact Us"
GX122-97-0350375	"Photo History of Ohio's Oil and Gas Industry    HEINRICH, CARL, Consultant, Reno, OH    The Ohio Oil and Gas Association is working on a project to produce a book containing historic photos of Ohio's oil and gas industry covering the period from its beginnings in the 1860's to the present day. Toward this end, a committee has been gathering photographs and researching the history of those photos. This presentation will be a sampling of a number of the photos, and related chronicles, that will appear in the book. Ohio's storied oil and gas industry history includes the development of the giant Lima-Indiana trend in the late 1800's and early 1900's, the Morrow County boom of the 1960's, widespread development of the ""Clinton"" sands, and the recent exploration for Knox reservoirs.

GX000-43-8149041	For more information  about MMS contact:   Nicolette Humphries    Pagemasters:      Alice Drew      Marcia Oliver    L ast  Updated:     October 08, 2003     10:54 AM                                 OCS          Lands Act History          Overview                     The  Outer Continental Lands Shelf Act  ( ,        272Kb), created on August 7, 1953,          defines the OCS as all submerged lands lying seaward of state coastal          waters (3 miles offshore) which are under U.S. jurisdiction. Under the          OCSLA, the Secretary of the Interior is responsible for the          administration of mineral exploration and development of the OCS. The          Act empowers the Secretary to grant leases to the highest qualified          responsible bidder on the basis of sealed competitive bids and to          formulate regulations as necessary to carry out the provisions of the          Act. The Act, as amended, provides guidelines for implementing an OCS          oil and gas exploration and development program.           Origin                     In the late 1800's, the citizens of Summerland,          California, began producing numerous springs of crude oil and natural          gas. After drilling a large quantity of wells on these springs, early          oil drillers discovered that wells nearest the ocean were the best producers.          This eventually led to wells drilled on the beach.  As          oil and natural gas became increasingly profitable, control over these          resources became a major issue.  The tidelands controversy between the          United States and Texas precipitated the OCSLA.  It involved a dispute          over the title to  2.5 million acres of submerged land in the Gulf of          Mexico between low tide and the state’s Gulfward boundary, almost 10          miles from shore.  Texas first acquired this land when it entered the          Union in 1845, with ownership recognized by federal officials for more          than 100 years.            By 1910, America had quickly turned to oil as its          primary natural resource, and several innovations resulted: the internal          combustion engine, steel cable tool drilling and the first diamond drill          (1919).  Technology advanced quickly, and for a decade new valves,          controls, and drilling control instrumentation were developed.  In 1926          modern seismology was created. In the mid-1940s, major changes in the oil          industry occurred  as America was making its transition from a wartime-          to postwar-economy. There was an enormous public demand for oil and gas,          and offshore exploration encountered enormous challenges, such as          underwater exploration, drilling location determination and offshore          communications.  By 1949, 11 fields and 44 exploratory wells were          operating in the  Gulf of Mexico .                       As          the          industry continued to evolve through the 1950s, oil  production became          the second-largest revenue generator for the country, after income          taxes. The U.S. government passed the  U.S. Submerged Lands Act  ( ,          176Kb), in 1953,          which set the federal government's title and ownership of submerged          lands at three miles from a state’s coastline. The OCSLA was also passed          which provided for federal jurisdiction over submerged lands of the OCS          and authorized the  Secretary of the Interior  to lease those lands for          mineral development.  After the Santa Barbara Oil Spill in 1967,          Congress passed several acts which spurred the development of oil spill          regulation and research. They included the National Environmental Policy          Act, which mandates a detailed environmental review before any major or          controversial federal action, the Clean Air Act, which regulates the          emission of air pollutants from industrial activities, and the          Coastal          Zone Management Act , which requires state review of federal action that          would affect land and water use of the coastal zone. In 1977, the Clean          Water Act passed.  The Act regulates the discharge of pollutants into          surface waters.              Creation of MMS           I n 1982, Congress passed the           Federal Oil & Gas          Royalty Management Act  ( ,          72Kb) which mandates protection of the environment and          conservation of federal   lands   in the course of building oil and gas          facilities. The Secretary of the Interior designated the MMS as the          administrative agency responsible for the mineral leasing of submerged          OCS lands and for the supervision of offshore operations after lease          issuance.                       Today           Under the OCSLA, MMS implements an OCS oil and gas exploration and          development program that provides the nation with 34.5 percent of its          natural gas and 32 percent of its oil.  The OCSLA was amended six times between 1978 and          1998.  These amendments included, for example, the establishment of an          oil spill liability fund and the distribution of a portion of the          receipts from the leasing of mineral resources of the OCS to coastal          States. Revenues from this mineral production totaled more than $6          billion in 2002 and nearly $127 billion since MMS was created in 1982.

For example, in the past 30 years, production footprints have shrunk dramatically.  The size of drilling pads has been reduced by up to 80 percent.  If Alaska's Prudhoe Bay oil field was opened with today's technology, its footprint would be almost a third of its size today.         Today, producers can drill a single well from the surface, then turn the well underground to reach an oil or gas production zone miles away from the drill site.  They can drill lateral wells extending like a spoke of a wheel from a single wellbore to reach different oil and gas production zones and avoid disturbing surface ecosystems.  This technology is being applied in Energy Department projects to drill safely under urban sites and to reach oil under surface mining or other restricted access sites.         New seismic and remote sensing technologies, including satellite and aerial surveying, now boost the likelihood that an oil or gas well will be successful and there will be fewer dry holes to disturb the environment.  More environmentally-friendly drilling fluids have been developed, and new techniques for cleaning the contaminants in water produced during oil/gas operations are now being adopted.  For example, reverse osmosis and new filtration systems funded by the Department of Energy significantly improve water quality for surface use or injection.           Because of technological advances, today it takes 22,000 fewer wells annually to develop the same amount of oil and gas reserves as it did in 1985.  And where oil and gas operations are underway, new technologies have dramatically cut emissions of air pollutants and greenhouse gases, practically eliminated spills from offshore platforms, reduced the risks of blowouts, and provided better protection of groundwater resources.               The New Environmental Challenges         Even with the environmental progress of the last 20 to 30 years, the costs of environmental compliance have risen steadily in recent years and are likely to continue to rise in the future as state and federal requirements become more stringent.  Today's U.S. petroleum industry spends as much on protecting the environment as it does on searching for new supplies of oil and gas - nearly $11 billion a year - and these costs could grow in the future.         Higher costs could cause valuable oil and gas resources, including many beneath federal lands, to become uneconomical to produce.  The result would be further increases in oil imports and the nation's trade deficit, potential constraints on the availability of clean-burning natural gas, and a dampening impact on the nation's economic growth.         Working with state and federal regulators and the oil and gas industry, the Department of Energy's Office of Fossil Energy is helping to ensure that approaches to environmental protection make technical, environmental, and economic sense.  The program pursues improvements in the regulatory process, supports development of new technologies, and exercises key responsibilities for energy policies that encourage more efficient and environmentally responsible oil and gas production.

GX003-16-10782694	"Restructuring Energy Industries:  Lessons from Natural Gas    Margaret Jess    The entire report is also available in  Adobe PDF  format.    For most of this century, firms in some industries, especially public utility industries such as energy, transportation, and communications, have been publicly owned or economically regulated 1  to alleviate public fears that such firms would use market power to raise prices artificially. Many of these industries exhibited some type of scale economies, meaning that over a range of output, the per unit cost of their outputs declined as output increased. This characteristic means that a single firm would have the lowest cost of production and could monopolize the industry. Hence, these industries are treated as natural monopolies and regulated to control entry, prices, and profits.    Over time, however, economic growth and technological improvements have reduced the importance of scale economies, lowered the cost of raising large amounts of capital, and changed perceptions about the potential for economic efficiency. In many cases, these historic changes have led to new products, new delivery systems, or new providers that compete with firms in regulated industries. These economic and technical developments have raised questions about maintaining traditional industry structure and regulation. As a consequence, many industries have restructured  2  to rely more on competition. 3  And, in the course of this restructuring, regulation evolved to accommodate changing economic realities. During the past 25 years, restructuring has occurred in such regulated industries as telecommunications, railroads, airlines, trucking, natural gas, banking, and finance. Most recently, the electric power industry has come under structural pressure.    For the past 20 years, the natural gas industry has been undergoing a restructuring similar to the transition now confronting the electric power industry. This article presents a summary of some of these gas industry experiences to provide a basis for some insights into energy industry restructuring. The article first discusses some similarities and differences between the natural gas and the electric power industries. Then, with these industry features as background, the discussion turns to issues in restructuring, drawing on experiences in the natural gas industry and suggesting potential parallels in the electric power industry. In conclusion, observations of developments in the natural gas industry are used to suggest some of the difficulties of restructuring, especially when new competitive markets must develop to further the process.    Background    Only a few years ago, doing away with electric power monopoly franchises would have been unthinkable. But large shifts in relative energy prices, starting in the early 1970's with the Arab oil embargo, set off searches for ways to improve energy and economic efficiency. These experiments have produced new perspectives on energy processes and economic organizations. Many of these experiments led to national legislation or policy programs. As time passed, not all these innovations proved successful. Nevertheless, changing government programs often interacted with economic forces to increase the momentum of industry restructuring.                General Observations on Restructuring       In describing regulated industry restructuring, so much emphasis is placed on legal and     regulatory events that it would be easy to imply that restructuring is, at its heart, a     regulatory phenomena. In most cases, however, this is an illusion. Restructuring usually     is not set in motion by changes in regulation. Rather, economic and technological forces     that drive industries to change also, by necessity, cause regulation to adapt. This is     because under the traditional command-and-control regulation, public utility industries     are molded and shaped to fit a regulatory process. When a regulated industry comes under     sufficient pressure from economic growth and technological improvement, it tends to become     very inefficient. Growing inefficiencies build forces for change in the industry, but the     required changes frequently conflict with the existing regulation. This conflict forces     regulation to adapt. Changes in regulated industries are driven by the same basic forces     that cause change in the economy as a whole. Because regulation is the platform that     shapes these industries, however, changes in regulation are effectively driven by the same     forces that pressure the industry itself. In tightly controlled industries, it may not     even be possible to assess the true character of the underlying developments until after     the regulatory evolution begins to unfold.       Restructuring is often a lengthy process. Indeed, one of the first lessons to be     learned from studying other industries in the process of restructuring is just how     extended the process is likely to be. For example, the disparity between interstate and     intrastate gas prices that signaled the beginning of the need for restructuring in the     natural gas industry was first observed more than 25 years ago. But, only now are the     outcomes of that restructuring process being translated into direct measures of action for     smaller consumers in retail markets. Other restructurings in telecommunications, airlines,     and railroads show similar lengthy periods of dynamic readjustment. It is unlikely that     the electric power industry will achieve a new integrated structure more quickly than was     the case in other industries.        In general, restructurings improve economic efficiency because they grow directly out     of opportunities to lower costs. In addition, restructurings that substitute market     discipline, when competition is viable, for command-and-control regulation can usually     result in improved incentives for efficient behavior that will bring additional pressures     to lower prices. Therefore, restructurings generally hold the promise of overall benefits     for the economy. Even if the benefits of restructurings are not distributed in the ways     that society might prefer, the net gains can then be rearranged without giving up the     newly gained efficiency improvements.          The 1970's energy policy initiatives focused on improving the efficiency of production and consumption.  4  Many of these programs built on the old command-and-control regulatory system. 5  New programs included initiatives that discouraged the use of natural gas for electric generation and industrial heat (to conserve on a high-value exhaustible resource), initiatives that tried to rationalize production of natural gas by setting wellhead price-ceiling schedules that were directed toward its eventual price deregulation (to encourage more high-value production), programs to improve highway vehicle mileage (to reduce the need for imported oil), and programs that mandated electric utilities to purchase electricity produced by some nonutility generators (to enhance efficient energy use).    During the 1980's, Congress and other policy makers periodically reassessed these experiments. A number of programs were modified or dropped. For example, the restrictions on industrial and electric utility gas uses were greatly reduced. In addition, the natural gas pipeline companies and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) devised ways to open gas pipelines to multiple users; and, in 1989, Congress passed legislation to decontrol natural gas wellhead prices completely as of January 1, 1993. This period of energy policy reassessment culminated in 1992 when Congress passed the Energy Policy Act (EPACT). EPACT is very comprehensive legislation addressing nearly every aspect of energy production and consumption in the national economy. Almost incidentally among its many sections are requirements that provide for open electric generation ownership and transmission access. This legislation effectively made possible the restructuring of the electric power industry by permitting outside entry into the supply of electricity for the first time in many years.    FERC has followed through on EPACT by requiring transmitting electric utilities to provide open transmission services. Order 888, the electricity open-access rule, is similar to Order 636, which encouraged gas pipeline companies to become open providers of gas transportation services.  (Table FE1)  As it did in the gas industry, FERC will require transmission-owning utilities to separate power sales functionally from the provision of transmission services.    The experiences of the natural gas industry during restructuring provide useful parallels for examining potential change within the electric power industry. In examining the parallels, it is important to understand the differences in traditional organization and functions of the two industries.    Similarities and Differences    The gas and electric power industries, although very different in size and structure, share some important characteristics. However, even shared characteristics diverge at some point in the comparison. The similarities and differences between the two can be best viewed as a continuum. If the gas industry's experience in restructuring is to provide useful insights into the forthcoming restructuring of the electricity industry, it is important to understand where the parallels between the two industries may be predictive and where they may indicate limits.    Size    Based on aggregate company statistics, the electric power industry, with revenues from final sales of more than $200 billion, is about four times as large as the regulated natural gas industry, which has final sales of about $50 billion. However, this revenue comparison may understate the size of the natural gas industry, because as much as 36.5 percent of its final sales are made offsystem by firms that are not included in current statistical measures. 6  However, if the offsystem gas deliveries to final consumers were valued at an approximation of their value, the estimated final revenues of the natural gas industry would still amount to only one-third of electric power sales to final consumers. 7  As recently as 10 years ago, before a large numbers of gas customers had access to offsystem suppliers, final revenues from natural gas sales to final consumers were about one-half of electric power company revenues. However, as the natural gas industry has progressed through restructuring, prices to final consumers have fallen, which has reduced revenues. In real terms (adjusted for inflation), onsystem sales of natural gas show a price decline of 13 percent between 1990 and 1995. Over this same period, average real electric prices to final consumers have fallen by nearly 9 percent. Residential natural gas and electricity prices adjusted for inflation fell between 1990 and 1995 in each Census Division except New England  (Figures FE1 and FE2).    Products    A significant difference between the two industries lies in the nature of the products. Simply put, because gas is not perishable and can be compressed, it can be stored economicallyCat the production site, in storage facilities along the way to market, and in high-volume pipelines while in transit. This feature of gas means that it can be produced at the most desirable rate in the field, stored if necessary, and delivered later to consumers according to their needs.    In contrast, under current technology, there are few economical ways to store electric power; consequently, electricity must be produced when it is demanded. This means that reliable electric service depends on the production and transmission of power when it is needed. Moreover, because many electric appliances cannot function if the voltage varies from the level for which these devices were designed, electricity must be delivered to consumers at constant voltage levels. 8  Electric transmission systems cannot be used to compensate for differences in supply and demand. Basically, electricity has to be produced at the desired strength when it is demanded. This feature of electricity, combined with the interactive network structure of the electric transmission grid, requires that the production, transmission, and consumption of electricity stay balanced within quite narrow tolerances.    In addition, the nature of basic activities of the natural gas and electric power industries are very different. Natural gas is extracted from large underground deposits. The location of gas production depends on regional geology and economics. Capital investments in gas production are tied to the locations of gas reservoirs and transportation facilities to move gas to markets.    By way of contrast, electricity is produced by a manufacturing process that can be located at a convenient site based on the economics of fuel supply, environmental conditions, and customers. Although both industries are capital intensive, a large share of the total value of the gas industry is tied up in holding and developing natural gas reserves. The electric power industry asset values tend to be concentrated in generating facilities, but these can be located to optimize value.    Ownership    The natural gas industry is generally characterized by separate ownership of the individual stages of the industry. Reserves and gas production usually are owned by large mineral extraction companies, such as the major oil companies, or by independent gas producers. Traditionally there have been numerous gas producers. Interstate gas pipeline companies and natural gas marketers are usually owned as individual corporations and gas distribution companies tend to be publicly owned either as stand-alone companies or in combination with electric utility companies.     But the electric utility industry is dominated by comprehensive vertical ownership of the stages of production. A single firm owns generation, transmission, and distribution. In the electric power industry, although there are many generators, about 75 percent belong to utilities that are vertically integrated into transmission and distribution functions. And, it is not uncommon for electric utilities to extend this vertical ownership further back to fuel production and transportation.    The organization of ownership was influenced by the way each industry developed and by ownership restrictions imposed on public utilities by the Public Utility Holding Company Act. The implications of these differences for restructuring are significant because the distribution of regulatory oversight is determined by the differences in ownership organization and because the firms in natural gas production generally lacked significant market power before restructuring began. Moreover, the largely unaffiliated ownership of gas production, transportation, and distribution creates a natural competitive tension among industry participants that is lacking in the electric power industry.    Before restructuring, interstate gas pipeline companies bought gas from producers, transported it, and then resold it to distribution companies at a price that included the cost of the commodity, transportation, storage, handling, and delivery. Gas distribution companies, in turn, bought gas as needed at the city gate (the point where gas enters the distributor's system) and delivered it to final consumers on its distribution system under a similar Aall inclusive@ bundled price.    The electric industry also defines its products as inclusive bundles covered by a single price. The only differences between the two industries on this point are the result of the differences in ownership structure. The arrangements between gas producers and pipeline companies and between pipelines and gas distribution companies are, for the most part, established along standard commercial lines for transactions between unrelated companies. In the electric power industry, although there are commercial relationships among unrelated entities, a majority of the production, transportation and distribution relationships are arranged under an umbrella of affiliated entities.    Regulation    Perhaps the greatest parallel between the two industries is in the area of regulation. The regulatory histories of the two industries are closely intertwined. Federal regulation of both was established when the Federal Power Act and the Natural Gas Act were incorporated in the Public Utility Holding Company Act in 1935. The acts were passed in response to regulatory problems and financial irregularities that had developed as the industries grew beyond State boundaries and matured. This set of laws authorized Federal oversight of both the financial and structural organization of interstate electric power and gas companies. The legislation charged the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) with the financial and organizational oversight of interstate public utility holding companies. The then Federal Power Commission (now the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)) was charged with oversight of interstate transportation and sales of natural gas and electric power.    The differing ownership structure of the two industries is largely a consequence of the restrictions placed on the organization of public utility companies in the Public Utility Holding Company Act (PUHCA) and the timing of the development of each industry. PUHCA subjects multi-State utility holding companies to intense financial review, restricts their operations to physically integrated electric systems, and severely limits their ability to diversify into any other business. Much of the national expansion of the natural gas industry occurred after the passage of PUHCA, while electric power was already nationwide at the time the act was passed. The SEC reshaped the electric power industry to bring it into compliance with PUHCA in the 15 years following the act's passage.    In addition to the statutory parallels, both industries usually are regulated by the same board or commission at both Federal and State levels; hence, there is a tendency for regulatory bodies to apply the same approaches to both industries. In part because of the statutory parallels, the courts also generally have treated the industries as though they were parallel. In general, both State and Federal economic regulation used cost-of-service ratemaking that constrains a firm's profitability. Profits are limited to fair returns that are no higher than needed to compensate invested capital. Moreover, prices may not be unduly discriminatory. Therefore, it was very much in keeping with this historical precedent for FERC to refer to the history of restructuring of the gas industry as it initiated new Federal rules for the electric industry. 9  FERC has relied on this regulatory parallelism to form the foundation for electric industry restructuring.    Jurisdiction    Differences in ownership result in differences in the extent of Federal authority over the two industries despite the parallels in their regulatory histories. Because of these ownership differences, FERC's regulation of interstate natural gas pipeline companies is for all practical purposes exclusive, 10  while its authority over investor-owned firms in the electric power industry is limited to their interstate wholesale sales and transmission functions. 11  Because transmission functions are integrated by an interconnected transmission network, Federal authority over the price for electric transmission services overrides State authority in all States except Alaska, Hawaii, and Texas. 12  Thus, FERC has jurisdiction over prices on most of the transmission system.    These differences in law and industry structure give FERC comprehensive regulatory oversight of interstate pipeline companies' assets and activities, but leave it little ability to influence directly the production and distribution firms in the industry. FERC's authority in the electric power industry is restricted to wholesale sales and interstate transportation, but because firms in the industry are vertically integrated, most of them fall under FERC's jurisdiction for some regulated activities. In terms of economic impacts, FERC currently regulates all revenues of interstate gas pipeline companies but only about 10 to 15 percent of the revenues of public utility electric power companies.    In addition, FERC has the direct authority to certify pipeline construction and provide eminent domain for pipeline routes, but it does not have the authority to review gas pipeline mergers. In the electric power industry, FERC has authority to approve mergers of electric utilities for the public interest, but it generally does not have approval authority over construction of facilities. Electric utility construction decisions fall under State authority. There is no FERC authority for eminent domain for electric transmission corridors. 13    Transportation    Both gas and electric power are transported via a unique means limited to transporting the product for which it is designed. 14  Neither gas nor electric energy can be transported economically by any means other than a dedicated pipe or transmission line. These specialized transportation facilities have other characteristics in commonCboth are capital intensive, embody large-scale economies, and require special right-of-ways. As a result, most regulators presume that these transportation systems are susceptible to monopoly control and will continue to require some form of economic regulation for the foreseeable future.    In some other respects, however, the two transportation systems are very different. Natural gas pipelines are independently operated, easily directed, relatively slow-moving flow systems; while the high-voltage, interconnected electric transmission grids are rapidly responding networks distinguished by high degrees of physical interdependence. As a result, gas pipelines can allow for much larger tolerances in operating conditions. Pipelines continue to function robustly under a wide variety of operating conditions.    Electricity transmission networks must be operated under very narrow tolerances and, because of their interdependence, require high degrees of coordination and information sharing to be reliable. One of the implications of these physical differences between gas pipelines and electric transmission systems is that the restructured industry's rules for physical access are likely to be more exacting for electric power than for gas. Consequently, to ensure continued reliable service, the standards for access to electricity transmission networks are likely to be more closely monitored than similar functions for natural gas pipelines.    Environment    Both the natural gas and electric power industries face problems related to the potential impacts of growing environmental concerns. Although both industries are required to mitigate environmental damages, the environmental compliance implications of the electric power industry restructuring appear to be far more extensive than the gas industry's.    The potential impacts of environmental compliance are greatest in natural gas production and electric power generation. Natural gas producers, however, face a rather comprehensive set of regulatory and legislative provisions that specify acceptable activities and allowable tolerances for environmental impacts. Within this framework, natural gas producers conduct operations in the most economically advantageous way while complying with environmental standards. Individual electric generators have not been subjected to a uniform set of performance requirements. At the generating level, units must collectively conform to an area's specified range of emission level limits. Restructuring has raised concerns that generator-use decisions will be made on the basis of lowest costs only, and it is feared that this will result in increased use of units that have lower costs but higher environmental impact.    Other    There are other similarities and differences between the two industries. For example, the distribution systems of both industries are also closely parallel. This parallel is demonstrated by the large number of utility companies that combined gas and electric distribution. Both types of operations traditionally relied on franchised monopoly delivery systems to deliver bundled services to final consumers.    These distribution functions both normally bundle auxiliary services along with products. This bundling of delivery functions with other associated qualities may make it difficult to extend competition to small scale consumers. In addition, distribution systems convey valuable right-of-ways that would be uneconomic to replicate for multiple suppliers. Efficient means of sharing rights or separating retail transportation from supply and auxiliary services remain to be devised in both industries.    Lastly, the characteristics of the demand for natural gas and electricity are quite different. Electricity is almost universally distributed and it has many different applications. Neither of these characteristics are features of gas demand. Compared with electricity, gas distribution is limited in geographic scope and its applications are limited mostly to heat processes. 15  In many applications, a number of fuels can be substituted directly for gas. Although some of these substitutions take substantial time and investment, there are many that do not. Consequently, in recent years natural gas demand has been considerably affected by prices of competing fuels.    On the other hand, there are no substitutes for electricity in many uses. Although the price elasticity of demand for electricity is still largely a matter of speculation, it is likely to be more inelastic than that of natural gas in both the short and long run. The differences in the demand characteristics of the two products may influence the final outcome of the industries' restructuring.    Issues in Restructuring    During restructuring, most industries tend to encounter similar issues. Since the natural gas industry has made significant progress toward a complete restructuring, opportunities for anticipating events in the electric power industry can be identified by understanding how progress in the gas industry has occurred.    Issue: Identifying the Forces of Change    Industry restructurings usually are grounded in inefficient practices that resist change and innovation. In regulated industries, such as natural gas and electric power, an initiating event sometimes appears to be a change in the regulatory framework, but the underlying cause is usually the result of major economic stress in the industry. Gas industry restructuring started as a response to pinned up supplies and inflexible contract practices. Electric industry restructuring was initiated by technological improvements.    In the natural gas industry, the initial stress can be traced back to price differences between interstate and intrastate markets. 16  Starting in the early 1970's, expanding gas demand caused gas prices in interstate markets to rise to the levels of Federal price ceilings, where they were constrained. Once the price ceilings were binding, supply shortages began to appear sporadically. 17  Prices in intrastate markets, by contrast, were free to reach levels that would allow demand to be fully satisfied. Additional inflexibility in interstate markets grew out of their tendency to use fixed-price, long-term supply contracts (some up to 30 years long). 18  Since the intrastate markets were more flexible and price responsive, they tended to attract incremental gas supplies, thus worsening the supply situation in the interstate markets. Rising price pressures and fear of curtailments in interstate markets initially were met with increased regulation and legislation to set price-ceiling escalation schedules. 19  In subsequent years, when mandated wellhead price-ceiling increases and demand conservation policies led to growing gas surpluses, it became generally recognized that wellhead gas-price regulation had not worked. 20    Some large consumers and distribution companies quickly tried to find ways to avoid buying high-priced pipeline gas. They turned to spot markets where production surpluses led to prices much below the weighted average price of pipeline companies' contracted supplies. These customers sought arrangements that would permit them to purchase gas and transportation services separately. These arrangements could produce substantial savings over the pipeline companies' bundled products that included high-cost contract gas. Efforts by these large customers to reduce their own cost of delivered gas service set the stage for further restructuring of the gas industry. 21    In the electric power industry, the opportunity to reduce significantly the average price and locational price differences of electric power grew out of experiences with generators exempted from wholesale price regulation under the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act (PURPA). The coincidence of technological progress in gas turbine design along with the PURPA conservation experiments encouraged the building of nonutility generators at costs that, in some cases, were significantly below electric utilities' average costs. More than half of the generation capacity built under this program used gas-fired technology.    Unlike the situation in the gas industry, the vast majority of U.S. generating capacity is still owned and operated by integrated public electric utility companies. And, most of the newly built PURPA generating facilities are under long-term contracts to sell their output at wholesale to those same integrated utilities. Even after the passage of the EPACT provisions, 22  the electric power industry lacks the pre-existing competitive supply conditions that characterized the natural gas production industry. Moreover, the electric industry has proportionately fewer unaffiliated distribution companies eager to find arms-length supplier arrangements. In addition, it remains more difficult for large customers to gain access to new electricity suppliers because of the shared Federal/State jurisdiction and limits at the Federal level that do not allow requiring electric retail customer access was done in the natural gas industry.    Issue: Surviving the Transition    Transition issues fall into two classes. One type stems from the need to dispose of leftovers from the old structure that are impeding needed changes. The second type encompasses issues associated with developing new institutions and conventions to promote efficient operation in a restructured industry. Some would argue that the leftover issues have to be resolved before the industry is able to concentrate on devising new institutions and conventions. Others believe that both types of transition issues can be worked on at the same time. Transition issues are important because they open opportunities for individual losses or gains. For this same reason, it may be hard to get the industry to agree to consensus solutions.    Dealing with the Old    One of the most contentious of the leftover issues is stranded costsCcosts that cannot be recovered in a competitive market because the current book value of some assets, contracts, or other long-lived commitments exceeds their market value. Restructuring threatens to turn these excess book values into losses. The natural gas industry's stranded costs were mainly the result of pipeline company take-or-pay liabilities to gas producers under high-cost, long-term gas supply contracts. 23  These contracts guaranteed payments to gas producers whether or not the gas was taken on the contract schedule. When the demand for natural gas fell (because of rising prices and conservation), pipeline companies reduced gas takes from producers and incurred liabilities for gas they did not take.    Over time, this gas supply situation developed into a dilemma. Faced with falling demand and growing take-or-pay liabilities, the pipeline companies could try to limit the growth of liabilities by taking delivery of more expensive gas first. But this raised consumers' prices, further decreasing consumption and raising a chorus of complaints about price gouging. Alternatively, the pipeline companies could concentrate on holding down their gas costs and thereby try to retain their markets. But this strategy resulted in ever larger accumulations of take-or-pay liabilities that threatened to drive the pipeline companies into bankruptcy.    In the physical market, gas production capacity exceeded gas demand, and producers, rich on paper, experienced declining cash flows. 24  In order to generate more cash, producers turned to selling increasing amounts of gas on the spot market. Spot market prices, which are highly sensitive to the differences between gas supply and demand, fell. Producers tried to maintain cash flow to compensate for falling prices by pumping more gas and sending it to the market. This exacerbated the over-supply of gas and put more downward pressure on wellhead gas prices. Falling spot prices induced increasing numbers of gas traders and consumers to seek opportunities to buy gas in the spot market and undercut the pipeline companies.    In intrastate markets, traditionally many customers had bought gas supplies and transportation services separately. Now, the interstate pipeline companies came under pressure to provide separate transportation services. In the face of declining revenues, some pipeline companies, realizing that transportation sales could provide relief for their revenue problems, began to offer some customers limited transportation services. Over time these efforts caused traditional gas pipeline industry practices to unravel.    The gas industry's accumulated total take-or-pay liabilities are estimated to have amounted to about $50 billion. 25  This amount is more than 60 percent of the 1985 value of final gas sales to final consumers (in 1995 dollars). 26  The stranded costs of the electric industry are, as yet, unknown, 27  but many experts have estimated a value of about $135 billion with other estimates ranging from $50 billion to $300 billion. In 1995 as a percent of the value of final electric industry sales ($208 billion), these amounts would be equivalent to 65, 24, or 144 percent, respectively. Thus, the upper end of the estimated range of electric industry stranded costs would be proportionately much larger than was the case in the gas industry. However, at the low point, relative impacts could actually be less than half those experienced in the gas industry. Using the widely used estimate for the electric industry stranded costs of $135 billion, the proportionate impact would be about the same as that experienced by the gas industry measured against 1985 revenues.     The story of how take-or-pay liabilities were resolved is in some ways instructive. Basically, these liabilities were shared among the producers, pipeline companies, distribution companies, and gas consumers. 28  Rate filings at FERC show that the interstate pipeline companies have filed to recover about $10.4 billion in take-or-pay related costs. 29  Approximately $3.6 billion of these take-or-pay costs will be absorbed by the pipeline companies and their shareholders. 30  The bulk of the debt was negotiated away in settlements between the pipeline companies and the producers over a period of years. In some cases, pipeline companies were credited with releasing gas that the producers then sold to other buyers; in other cases, producers credited gas sales to third parties against pipeline company take obligations. 31  But in many cases, the gas producers, or the parties who held the gas contracts as collateral, had to adjust their wealth by accepting lower values for the contracts they held. Some of this reduction in value may have been partially shifted to general taxpayers. This transfer would occur if losses are used as adjustments or credits for the purpose of calculating income taxes.    Although consumers eventually paid a share of the cost of the take-or-pay settlements along with higher gas bills for the high-cost gas that was delivered to them, they paid far less than if the high-cost contracts had run to maturity. Had the gas industry not been deeply divided and under intense financial pressure, negotiations to share the take-or-pay costs might not have worked out in the same proportions. Moreover, no one will ever know if gas industry restructuring would have moved quicker (and its benefits been realized faster) if the take-or-pay problem had been settled in the same fashion that FERC has chosen to use for stranded wholesale costs in the electric industry. 32  FERC has ruled that electric utilities should recover 100 percent of their legitimate and verifiable stranded wholesale costs. 33  It certainly is true that arms-length negotiations among diverse interests that were instrumental in arriving at take-or-pay settlements in the gas industry are not possible among most generation, transmission and distribution entities in the electric industry because they are vertically integrated.    Dealing with the New     The second type of transition issues-developing new institutions and practices-involves a wide expanse of functions, at least some of which are dictated by the previous structure and operational characteristics of individual industries. The natural gas industry has been quite successful in developing new institutions and practices to enhance restructured industry performance without raising a barrier of prohibitive transaction costs. These innovations range from improvements in the physical efficiency of the industry based on better pipeline utilization and expansions of the market center concept to the development of a whole new set of financial instruments that have revolutionized trading in natural gas.    In the physical gas market, improvements have centered on expanding pipeline capacity and developing rapid cycling gas storage facilities. Growth in unbundled short-term and spot markets appeared as though it might threaten reliability because production often is located great distances from consumption markets. Especially during the winter heating season, gas markets sometimes need to be able to move products quickly. But traditional gas markets that had been organized to move dedicated, bundled products to preassigned locations lacked the flexibility needed to respond to short-term changes in the quantity of product needed when markets changed. As the value of greater flexibility became more apparent, pipeline junctures began to expand to offer new exchange services and expanded storage capacity. The increasing value of storage coincided with the development of new, rapid turnaround salt cavern storage-matching enhanced capability with new value.    As time passed, pipeline pooling points, exchange locations, and enhanced storage facilities expanded to include additional services at some locations. These services included aggregating and compensating for imbalances, parking, lending, and paper as well as physical exchanges. 34  An interesting observation about the growth of market centers in the gas business is the variety of centers that has developed. 35  One reasonably might have expected that all surviving market centers would offer nearly the same set of services. But this has not been the case, as instead a variety of market centers have developed. This evolution in the functions of market centers demonstrates the flexibility of the restructured gas industry.    Along with the greater capability of the gas industry to handle and direct gas flows has come the development of new gas marketing companies, which has contributed to the expansion of the gas industry under restructuring. Aggressive gas marketers sought opportunities to add new clients and in the process changed relationships in the gas industry. It was the determination of the gas marketers who pursued profits, breaking up old pipeline customer networks and demanding open access conditions, that really made the industry change. According to a directory compiled by Benjamin Schlesinger & Associates, the number of gas marketer firms rose from 51 in 1986 to 353 in 1994 before falling off to 264 in 1996. 36  The decline in numbers in recent years represents some shaking out in gas marketing as consolidation has occurred and profits have been squeezed.    One immediate and direct spillover for the electric power industry that stems from the success of gas marketers has been the rapid entry of gas marketers into the electric power industry. More than 100 marketers have registered with FERC to trade in electric power. To date, however, most of the trade in electric power continues to be among the established participants in the industry. It appears that the integrated ownership structure of the electric power industry may inhibit the development of spot and short-term power markets. Many observers have pointed to the emergence of dual- product marketer firms along with the accelerating pace of gas-electric mergers and acquisitions to demonstrate the evolution of an integrated energy market that could displace the historically separate markets in natural gas and electric power.    In fact, it is the growth from collection points at pipeline junctures to market centers that underlies one of the biggest successes of the new gas industry-the gas financial instruments industry. The development of a futures contract to provide risk management depended on having sufficiently large, flexible product markets to handle deliveries for contracts should a contract holder wish to accept delivery of the gas. The volume of open contracts on futures markets last year averaged 150,000 daily, while the volume during November and December, the busiest times of the year, was considerably higher. Similarly options trading has expanded to large numbers during the past few years. These financial instruments enhance the liquidity of gas markets and, at the same time, offer means of risk management that make the commodity market an acceptable way to trade gas in energy markets.    One noticeable event in gas markets has been the development of considerable price volatility in both product and financial markets. Price volatility is not limited to energy markets, but the amount of price swing in natural gas markets has caused concern, especially among the many small consumers who continue to be captive customers of local distribution companies. These customers expect average-cost retail prices that vary little during the year. But as restructuring has progressed in the gas industry, high seasonal price volatility appears to have become a regular feature of the market. Some observers attribute the increased price volatility in commodity markets to industry efforts to reduce the cost of holding inventories by adopting just-in-time management systems. Most individual consumers can do little to avoid these price problems. Perhaps the periodicity of price volatility will present an opportunity for arbitrage that will encourage traders to correct undue volatility.    Thus far, electric power commodity and financial markets have been slow to develop. Attempts to introduce futures contracts in two West Coast markets have had only limited responses. More recent efforts to open trading on the East Coast are just beginning, but until active, liquid commodity markets develop, there will be little demand for liquidity and risk management financial instruments. Hence, the development of forward, options, futures, and other financial instruments will probably continue to lag in electricity markets.    It can be argued that the gas industry had some advantages in developing new practices that are lacking in the electric industry. Intrastate gas markets provided an early model for some broader market-based activities in the gas industry. These intrastate markets included active spot markets for gas and experience in externalizing supply and transportation arrangements through contracts. 37  The collapse of the market in long-term gas supply contracts encouraged development of larger spot and short-term commodity markets for gas and created an opportunity for the rapid growth in these markets. It also created opportunities for new entrants to the market-gas brokers and marketers. These developments, in turn, gave rise to the development of financial instruments, such as forward, futures, and options markets, that provide improved liquidity and risk management instruments for commodity markets. 38    Success in gas market development has not been limited to product markets; there has also been significant growth in secondary markets for pipeline capacity since FERC issued Order 636. However, gas transportation markets have expanded less rapidly than the commodity markets. 39  Tradable pipeline capacity rights have not developed sufficiently to allow an assessment of the potential for converting physical to financial rights in transportation. Furthermore, uncertainties about future transportation rate structures and developments in unbundling in retail markets are creating capacity turnback problems for the pipelines. Pipeline companies are finding that their traditional customers, the distribution companies, are reducing the amount of firm pipeline capacity they are willing to reserve as retail monopolies disappear. When transportation contracts come up for renewal, many distribution companies may ""turn back"" (decline to renew) large percentages of the capacity they once reserved. Under the current pricing formula for firm transportation services by interstate pipelines, reservation or demand fees are designed to recover pipeline companies' fixed costs. 40  Turnbacks may erode a pipeline company's income and threaten the company's financial health.    Difficulties in establishing successful new practices and conventions for gas pipeline transportation probably indicate that the electric power industry also will find it difficult to design satisfactory new ways to address these issues. One approach that is being tried in the electric power industry, Regional Transmission Associations (RTAs) and Independent System Operators (ISOs), has not been tried in the gas industry. These agents would create regional governing bodies or empower third-party transmission operators to control transmission. This type of central governing body was not needed to oversee the operations of gas pipelines and therefore, has no parallel in the gas industry.    One area where the electric power industry may have had a head start on the gas industry is in establishing electronic trading, information, and monitoring systems. This is one restructuring requirement that the gas industry has been slow to develop. 41  The electric power industry, with the benefit of observing the gas industry's problems in achieving standardization, has turned to the North American Electric Reliability Council (NERC) and the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) to develop industry-wide standards and systems. This move appears to have speeded up development of electronic communication services in the electric power industry and been an improvement over the individual company systems that the gas industry tried to develop. Developing electronic information and trading systems for products and transportation rights may be one instance where it was an advantage to be second and to learn from others' mistakes.    Issue: Defining New Boundaries    While restructuring may modify regulation, it does not necessarily do away with it. One basic concept of restructuring in both the natural gas and electric power industries is that regulation will still have a major role, at least, in the transportation and local distribution areas. Thus, both industries are engaged in seeking new ways to interface regulated and unregulated activities.    After some experimentation in the gas industry, FERC concluded (Order 636) that pipeline companies needed to separate their gas sales operations from their transportation activities, create open trading and transportation information systems, and agree to adhere to a new industry-wide standard of conduct. At the Federal level, FERC has invited innovations in transportation rate design, incentive regulation, negotiation, and arbitration. But the gas industry does not appear to have been eager to take up these challenges, perhaps fearing costly legal battles. Some State utility commissions are also studying ways to change distribution company regulations. 42    The Federal initiatives in the electric power industry appear to be modeled, as far as possible, on lessons learned in experimenting with the gas industry. One example of how this learning process has worked is shown by the detailed instructions provided by FERC for the new open access same-time information system (OASIS) mandated for trading in electric transmission capacity. 43  Unlike the gas bulletin boards, the electric power system will be standardized from the beginning. This appears to have speeded the first stage of the information system process for the electric power industry.    Because of the difference in industry ownership structure and the jurisdiction of regulators, the gas industry may provide only limited insight into problems of regulatory interface for retail unbundling. The gas industry has proceeded slowly in addressing the problems of universal retail competition. 44  In general, unbundling in the gas industry has been limited to wholesale traders and large customers. Some recent progress has been made in extending market choices to moderately sized industrial and commercial customers; but competitive choices for most retail customers, especially residential consumers, are at best only in the experimental stage in most States. This lack of progress in designing and implementing retail unbundling may be contributing to the Congressional debate over legislating retail access in electric power. 45    Concluding Observations    The gas and electric power industries share features that caused them to be regulated as monopolies in the past. However, their sizes, production techniques, and operating constraints indicated that restructuring of the electric industry may not exactly parallel the gas industry. Furthermore, the fundamental differences in the nature of the two products, natural gas and electricity, have important implications for the comparison of industry restructuring. Common issues in industry restructuring-such as identifying the changes, laying to rest the leftovers of old regulatory systems, substituting new institutions for old, and finding ways to achieve promised efficiency improvement and flexibility-require much effort. This brief review of restructuring developments in the natural gas industry has pointed out both successes and potential pitfalls in the process.     Restructuring is not just about realigning an industry and adjusting regulations; it also requires that firms, regulators, and consumers undergo cultural change. These changes are not easily or quickly accomplished. For example, regulated firms have spent years trying to please regulators. Even Wall Street compiled indexes to measure how friendly or unfriendly public utility commissions were in an effort to predict what the best investments would be. But in the restructured industries, regulators' good will may no longer be a good index of profitability and new indicators will have to be developed.    Experience in the gas industry also suggests that regulators seeking to direct restructuring so as to get the best outcome for the public need to act judiciously. Traditional cost-of-service regulation may be incompatible with regulation of firms with competitive activities. At the very least, regulators probably should not create new classes of regulated, cost-of-service businesses for regulated firms as part of the restructuring. For example, by including expenditures for new information systems in cost-of-service activities, regulators lessened the incentives for gas pipeline companies to seek the most efficient methods of creating electronic bulletin boards and trading centers.     Profit-motivated firms seek market advantages. This quest is a natural drive and the basis of competitive market discipline. There is no reason to believe that firms in transition from sanctioned, regulated monopolies to competitive markets will bypass opportunities to seek market power. In fact, one could argue that seeking market power is, in some sense, a competitive firm's obligation. But, when firms are moving from comprehensive regulation to mixed competitive/regulated environments, regulation may need to become more sensitive. For example, in both the natural gas and electric power industries, transportation involves many complicated parameters in addition to price. Designing a regime of equitable, open transportation access under these circumstances is difficult. Any ill-defined area invites efforts to find ways to exercise market power. In the gas industry, the so- called ""grey markets"" wherein transportation and product are rebundled outside the public trading systems are examples of how ambiguity in transition regulations can create suggestions of opportunistic behavior. Open, comparable, fair rules are needed to address these issues.    Gas industry restructuring, even if incomplete, has delivered very large benefits for the economy. Prices of gas to final consumers measured in nominal as well as constant dollars are significantly lower than they would have been under the old regime. The cost of transporting and handling gas has also fallen. All these restructuring improvements can be attributed to a variety of sources. Applied changes in technology, greater industry flexibility, better matches between products and customers' needs and competitively driven reductions in economic rents are among the improvements that have contributed to these gains.    These improvements have worked to the advantage of all gas customers. Direct and indirect benefits from these gains are felt throughout the economy. But, the direct benefits from gas industry restructuring have not been shared equally among all final consumers of gas. Big users-industrial and electricity generating facilities-have experienced much larger price reductions than have other consumers. While it is true that the buying habits and usage patterns of large customers are different from those of smaller customers, there can be no question that part of the large customers' successes in achieving low gas costs can be attributed to the opportunities they have to choose among competitive suppliers.    There is no good way to model a comparison between the results under current restructuring and the outcome that might have been obtained had competitive gas supply choices been available to a larger number and variety of consumers. But, in many quarters, there is a suspicion that the benefits of restructuring might have been larger if more consumers had been allowed to participate sooner. This suggests that restructuring will be more beneficial when the maximum number of customers has the ability to switch away from unsatisfactory suppliers without paying large price premiums.

The Energy Information Administration chronicled the impact of these programs over time in a series of publications.

In 1985, approximately 12 percent of sales to final customers were offsystem sales to industrial users.

While the nuclear energy program can look back to the Manhattan Project of World War II for its origins, the Federal Government's involvement in fossil fuel resources began several decades earlier, in the early 1900s.         Oil Dominates Early Energy Concerns         Much as today, petroleum was a major concern for the Federal Government at the start of the 20th century.  Barely 50 years after the birth of the nation's oil industry the Nation's leaders were already worried about an impending oil shortage.  By 1909, a half century after Edwin Drake drilled the U.S.'s first oil well, the Navy had converted from sails and coal to ""black oil,"" powering their ships with unrefined crude oil.  But the long-term future of oil supplies in the United States was by no means certain.  Many of the nation's largest oil fields - in Texas and Oklahoma, for example - had not yet been discovered.                             MORE INFO...                                                    Naval Petroleum and Oil Shale Reserves - 90 Years of Ensuring the Nation's Security                                                 To ensure sufficient fuel for the fleet, the Government began withdrawing probable oil-bearing lands from the public domain.  Between 1909 and 1924, tracts in California, Utah, and Wyoming were set aside that became the Naval Petroleum and Oil Shale Reserves - the oldest component of today's Fossil Energy organization.          Drake drilled his first well in 1859 near Titusville, Pennsylvania, but by 1916 the center of the nation's oil activity had shifted westward.  The U.S. Bureau of Mines - established in 1910 in the Department of the Interior - recognized the need to learn more about the extraction of oil and began looking for a place to locate a petroleum experiment station.

Origins of the Nation's 1st Federal Petroleum Research Laboratories                                               In 1916, the Bureau selected Bartlesville, Oklahoma.  A year later large oil discoveries in the Osage Indian Nation just west of Bartlesville confirmed that the hub of the nation's oil industry was now indeed firmly implanted in the Midwest.  When the Bartlesville experiment station opened in 1918, the Federal Government's petroleum research program had begun.          Oil again was on the nation's mind during World War II.   Prospects of huge oil finds in Indonesia had been one motivation for Japan's attempted conquest of Southeast Asia.  Similarly, lack of indigenous oil supplies had led Germany's war machine to develop synthetic substitutes for petroleum.  German scientists developed ways to change the country's abundant coal supplies into liquid fuels, typically using high-pressure 'brute-force' processes.

The Early Days of Coal Research                                               When German scientists and technical documents were captured in the latter stages of the War, U.S. interest in these coal-to-oil methods was sparked.  Because the United States also possessed massive quantities of coal, the Federal Government began investigating possible coal-based synthetic alternatives should America's natural oil supplies begin to decline.  Passage of the Synthetic Liquid Fuels Act of 1944 began the first concentrated effort to study future ways to use the Nation's abundant coal supplies.           Coal's potential was also on the mind of West Virginia Senator Robert Byrd in 1961 when he successfully urged Congress to establish the Office of Coal Research in the U.S. Department of the Interior.  With a modest first year budget of $1 million, the Office started small but over time began to study a wide range of coal technologies, including the conversion of coal to gas and liquid fuels and new ways to combust coal more cleanly.                  Oil Cutoff Brings Energy to Forefront         The oil embargo of 1973 again brought energy and the security of oil to the forefront of the nation's attention.  When several Persian Gulf nations of the Organization for Petroleum Exporting Countries temporarily ceased oil shipments to the United States and sent world oil prices skyrocketing, U.S. policymakers recognized that energy was no longer something American citizens could take for granted.           The Energy Reorganization Act of 1974 created two new agencies: the Energy Research and Development Administration (ERDA) to carry out a more aggressive energy development program, as well as oversee the Nation's nuclear weapons and naval reactor programs; and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to regulate the nuclear power industry.         The Office of Coal Research, shifted from the Interior Department to the newly-created ERDA, would become the core organization for the Fossil Energy program.  Along with coal research, the new Fossil Energy office also became the home for the Government's petroleum research program and a small synthetic fuels research program transferred from the Bureau of Mines.         The oil embargo of 1973 not only led to a reorganization of federal energy functions, it also called attention to the need for an emergency stockpile of crude oil.  Unlike the federal oil tracts set aside in the early part of the century, the Government needed a reserve that could pump emergency oil into the market much faster than any oil field.  Such a stockpile of crude oil had been discussed in the Eisenhower Administration but never implemented.  On December 22, 1975, however, with the economy reeling from the first shock of oil shortages, President Ford signed the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, extending oil price controls, mandating automobile fuel economy standards, and authorizing creation of an emergency oil reserve. The final major piece of today's Fossil Energy organization, the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve, began forming.         The Energy Department is Created         America would experience more energy shocks, however, in the next several years.  In 1977, with the Nation facing its most severe winter in decades, natural gas shortages caused thousands of factory and school closings and threatened cutoffs to residential customers.  More unrest was also taking place in the Middle East, now the world's dominant supplier of crude oil.  Islamic fundamentalism was on the rise in Iran and elsewhere, and within two years, the Shah of Iran, one of the world's most prolific exporters of crude oil, would be overthrown.                                                                  President Carter signs the Department of Energy Organization Act.                                           The rapidly escalating global energy issues convinced the U.S. Government that a sharper focus should be applied to federal energy programs.  On August 4, 1977, President Carter signed the Department of Energy Organization Act, consolidating more than 30 separate energy functions carried out by various government agencies, including ERDA.  On October 1, 1977, the U.S. Department of Energy activated.          In the original Energy Department organization, Fossil Energy programs were managed as a division under the Assistant Secretary for Energy Technology.  On October 1, 1979, many of the Department's energy research functions were recognized, and the Fossil Energy program was elevated to its current Assistant Secretary-level status.

GX004-12-14235328	"STATEMENT OF    MARY J. HUTZLER    DIRECTOR, OFFICE OF INTEGRATED ANALYSIS AND FORECASTING         ENERGY INFORMATION ADMINISTRATION    DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY    BEFORE THE    COMMITTEE ON ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES    U.S. SENATE    JULY 26, 2000         Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee:    I appreciate the opportunity to appear before you today to discuss the views of the Energy Information Administration (EIA) on prospects for natural gas supply.      EIA is an independent statistical and analytical agency within the Department of Energy. We are charged with providing objective, timely, and relevant data, analysis, and projections for the use of the Energy Department, other agencies, the Congress, and the public. We do not take positions on policy issues, but we do produce data and analysis reports that are meant to help policy makers decide energy policy. Because we have an element of statutory independence with respect to the analyses that we publish, the views are strictly those of EIA. We do not speak for the Department, nor for any particular point of view with respect to energy policy, and our views should not be construed as representing those of the Department or the Administration.      Today's analysis is based on EIA's Annual Energy Outlook, which provides projections and analysis of domestic energy consumption, supply, prices, and carbon emissions through 2020. These projections are not meant to be exact predictions of the future but represent a likely future, assuming known trends in demographics and technology improvements, and also assuming no change in current law, regulation, and policy. EIA does not propose, advocate, or speculate on changes in laws and regulations. So, one of our key assumptions is that all current laws and regulations remain as they are at the time the projections are made. This means, for example, that none of the provisions of F.E.R.C.'s  Order 637 (to improve efficiency in the gas transportation marketplace and protect captive customers from abuses of market power) are assumed in these projections, because, although some elements of the Order were proposed, it did not become an official ruling until February, 2000.  Similarly, while state-level electric utility restructuring will probably occur throughout most of the country, we only represent it for States that have actually put restructuring plans in place because implementation plans vary.      History of Natural Gas Supply    The highest recorded U.S. annual consumption of natural gas--22.1 trillion cubic feet (tcf)--occurred a generation ago in 1972 (Figure 1).  As close as the Nation came in 1996 and 1997 (within 0.5 percent), the record has yet to be broken. The 1972  peak was followed by a decline to a low of 16.2 tcf in 1986, when the downward trend reversed.       What caused natural gas consumption to fall off as sharply as it did between the early 1970's and the mid 1980's, and subsequently almost return to its previous high?  The primary reason was heavy regulation of virtually every aspect of the market. Producers were constrained by price controls and end-users were constrained by moratoria placed on the construction of new gas-burning units.  The market was unable to send clear signals about the consumers' interest in purchasing and the suppliers' willingness to sell.    Regulations on the price of interstate gas sales were set by the Federal Power Commission (FPC) in the mid 1950's, creating a two-tier market in which interstate gas was regulated and intrastate gas was not.  The price ceilings for interstate gas that were set kept prices artificially low, and by the late 1960's prices for intrastate gas began to exceed prices for gas destined for the interstate market.  The low prices led to increased demand, but discouraged production, with the exception of what could be sold in the unregulated intrastate market.  Shortages of gas that resulted led to industrial sector curtailments in the early 1970's, and, during the extremely cold winter of 1976 to 1977, to curtailments for both the industrial and utility sectors.  Many were convinced that the shortages would increase, focusing attention on the issue of supply reliability which was to plague the industry for more than a decade.  To help remedy the situation, Congress in 1978 passed the Natural Gas Policy Act (NGPA), the objective of which was to provide a phased decontrol of natural gas wellhead prices.  The NGPA placed wellhead price caps on several categories of natural gas, which had escalation factors developed to allow them to rise to a level competitive with other fuels.  Rather than remedying the situation, the complexities of the NGPA  increased the problem.  The escalation clauses were developed under the assumption that oil prices would continue to rise steeply.  Price caps for the categories of gas subject to these escalators  grew to be priced considerably above, rather than below, the market.  These high prices spurred exploration and development.  This resulted in high reserve additions, while at the same time the high prices were having a dampening effect on demand.  By the early 1980's, the shortage of natural gas had been replaced with a surplus, often referred to as the ""gas bubble.""  A spot market for gas developed, with spot gas priced below contract gas. Because pipelines were allowed to pass gas costs through to consumers, they had little incentive to try to get access to this lower-priced gas, so average prices to consumers remained above spot prices.       At this point, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), successor to the FPC,  intervened with a series of Orders that removed gas costs from minimum bills (Order 380, in 1984), required that pipelines provide open access to transportation services (Order 436, in 1985), and eventually , with Order 636 in 1992, allowed for a major restructuring of interstate pipeline operations.  This led to open competition in the industry and a much healthier market that is controlled  by supply and demand rather than through heavy regulation.   The market has grown steadily since 1986.  While there was once speculation as to whether the market would eventually reach 30 tcf, it's now generally viewed as a question of when and how--not if--a 30 tcf market will be achieved.      Growing Natural Gas Supply    In 1999, U.S. natural gas consumption was more than 21 tcf and accounted for 23 percent of domestic energy consumption.  Gas consumption is expected to grow 1.8 percent annually from 1998 to 2020--faster than any other major fuel source, mainly because of the growth in gas-fired electricity generation. Demand  is projected to reach almost 30 tcf in 2015 and continue to rise to almost 32 tcf in 2020.  Gas consumption by electricity generators is expected to  increase more  than two and one half  times (compared to current levels), while modest growth is projected in all of the other sectors. As demand increases, pressure on natural gas supply will grow. These demand-side pressures will begin to raise questions like: ""Is there enough gas to meet demand at affordable prices?"" and ""Can we produce the gas fast enough to keep up with demand?""        Even with this projected production increase,  technically-recoverable natural gas resources in North America are believed to be adequate to sustain growing production volumes throughout the forecast period without dramatic price increases.  (Advances in technology   are included in the forecast and current high prices are expected to decline, as discussed below.)  Domestic gas production is expected to increase a bit more slowly than consumption over the forecast, rising from 18.7 tcf in 1998 to 25 tcf in 2015, with the difference made up by increased imports.  Growing production reflects generally rising wellhead prices, relatively abundant natural gas resources, and improvements in technologies, particularly for producing offshore and unconventional gas.    Net imports are expected to rise to make up the difference between domestic production and consumption, and they are generally expected to be priced competitively relative to domestic sources (Figure 2). Net imports are expected to climb from 3.1 tcf in 1998 to 4.9 tcf in 2015-somewhat faster than the growth in overall consumption, accounting for 16 percent of total consumption in 2015.           Most of the increase is attributable to imports from Canada, primarily from western Canada, although some new gas is also expected from Sable Island in the offshore Atlantic (Figure 3).  Canadian resources are adequate to sustain production for many years.  The Canadian Gas Potential Committee indicates that there is an estimated 184 tcf of marketable discovered and undiscovered natural gas in the Western Canada Sedementary Basin.  (1)            In addition, interest in developing the MacKenzie Delta/Beaufort Sea region of the Northwest Territories has recently begun to increase. The Canadian National Energy Board estimates the undiscovered marketable potential for natural gas in the region at 55 tcf. With most Canadian oil- and gas-producing regions less mature than those in the United States, the potential for additional low-cost production is strong, and imports from Canada are projected to remain competitive with U.S. domestic supplies in the forecast.       Mexico also has a considerable natural gas resource base, but gas trade with Mexico is expected to consist primarily of exports.  Conversion of power plants from heavy fuel oil to natural gas, in compliance with Mexico's environmental regulations, is expected to gain momentum and it is unlikely that indigenous natural gas production can be increased enough to satisfy rising demand.       LNG provides another source of gas imports; however, given the projected relatively low natural gas prices in the lower-48 markets, LNG is expected to supply just 0.33 tcf, or 1 percent of U.S. gas consumption in 2015.  LNG imports in the future could rise above the forecast given the opening of the currently mothballed facilities at Cove Point, Maryland and/or Elba Island, Georgia.  Total available import capacity including these facilities is 0.84 tcf, so LNG is not expected to become a major source of supply in the forecast period.        Growing Domestic Production    To satisfy a 30 tcf market in 2015, annual domestic natural gas production will need to increase by 6.2 tcf (Figure 4). Thus, over the next 17 years production increases must average about 360 billion cubic feet (bcf) per year.  From 1955 to 1972, the industry increased production at twice this rate.  Of course, conditions are different from what they were in those earlier years.  Undiscovered field sizes in mature producing areas are smaller, and larger prospects are located in more remote areas.  On the other hand, the average real price of natural gas in 1999 was more than three times higher than it was in 1955,  real exploration and production costs are lower, technology is significantly more advanced, and the regulatory environment is much more favorable to gas production.        Current estimates of technically-recoverable natural gas resources  (2)  indicate that the resource base is expected to be adequate to sustain growing production volumes for many years, based primarily on the assessments done by the U.S. Geological Survey for onshore regions and by the Minerals Management Service for offshore areas.  As of January 1, 1998, technically recoverable resources were 1,259 tcf  (Figure 5).  Resources include not only proved reserves, which were 167 tcf, but inferred reserves from known fields, undiscovered conventional resources from new fields, and undeveloped resources of unconventional gas.   Inferred reserves, representing the expected growth from previously discovered fields, totaled 223 tcf, most of that located in onshore areas.  Conventionally recoverable resources in lower-48 undiscovered fields not associated with oil deposits accounted for 356 tcf of the total.  Undeveloped resources of unconventional gas from tight sands formations, coalbeds, and shales total 378 tcf.  Gas associated with oil makes up most of the balance of the total technically recoverable resource base.       Reserves are anticipated to be more than adequate throughout most of the forecast period.  Although falling prices in 1998 caused production to exceed reserve additions, rising prices in the forecast after 2003 are projected to cause reserve additions generally to exceed production until close to the end of the forecast period, even with the expected increases in demand.   This leads to a growth in end-of-year reserves throughout much of the forecast period (Figure 6).  Relatively high levels of annual reserve additions through 2015 reflect increased exploratory and developmental drilling as a result of higher prices, as well as productivity gains from technology improvements.       Uncertainty with regard to estimates of the Nation's natural gas resources has always been an issue in projecting production, and could affect production and prices. The uncertainty surrounding recoverable gas resource estimates is reflected in the differing views on the subject. For example, an April 1998 study by the Gas Research Institute (GRI), contending that the industry has ""significantly underestimated"" the growth potential of existing fields in the Midcontinent, onshore Gulf Coast, East Texas, and San Juan Basin areas, proposes higher resource estimates for those areas.    Over the forecast period, increased U.S. natural gas production comes primarily from lower-48 onshore conventional nonassociated sources (Figure 7).   Conventional onshore production accounted for 35 percent of total U.S. domestic production in 1998 and is expected to increase to 40 percent in 2015.  Offshore production, mainly from wells in the Gulf of Mexico, also rises.  Innovative, cost-saving technology and large oil and gas finds, particularly in the deep waters of the Gulf, have encouraged interest in this area.  Much of the gas production in deep waters is expected to be associated with oil wells.  Lower-48 offshore Gulf Coast production was 5.6 tcf in 1998--a little lower than the previous year, because of lower prices.  Rocky Mountain (primarily unconventional sources) and onshore Gulf of Mexico regions account for just over half of the incremental production needed between 1998 to 2015, as improvements in technologies continue.  Increased production from the offshore Gulf Coast and onshore Southwest regions account for almost a third of the total increase in the same period.  Although offshore Gulf Coast production grows  in the projections, picking up after 2001 as a result of further deepwater exploration and development, production from the offshore Gulf of Mexico is constrained by depletion effects.       Pipeline and Transportation Issues    With the significant increase in annual production projected for the Rocky Mountain and Gulf Coast onshore production regions between 1998 and 2015--1.57 and 1.64 tcf, respectively--- considerable pipeline expansion will be required (Figure 8).  For the Rocky Mountain region, an area that has long experienced bottlenecks in pipeline capacity that have prevented full use of its production capacity, the additional projected production represents a 54 percent increase from 1998 levels.       Much of the forecasted expansion is either already in progress or scheduled to be completed within the next two years.  Several pipeline projects recently completed will provide producers in the Rocky Mountain region with new access to customers in the Midwest. KN Interstate's new Pony Express project and the Trailblazer system expansion provide access from the Wyoming and Montana production regions, and  Transwestern Pipeline and El Paso Natural Gas expansions have increased the capacity to move supplies out of New Mexico's San Juan Basin. Transwestern also expanded its Gallup, New Mexico compressor station which further increased its capacity.  The completion last year of a large scale gathering system in the Powder River Basin significantly increased access to supplies, as did the Frontrunner intrastate expansion. To utilize the new gathering system, both Wyoming Interstate and Colorado Interstate pipelines increased their capacity. Along with increases in capacity, significant increases in flows from the region to markets on the east and west coasts are expected between 1998 and 2015.    There has been considerable pipeline expansion in the Gulf Coast offshore region area, but much of it is for gathering systems and short-haul pipelines to move supplies onshore, rather than major interstate pipeline expansions.  The greatest recent increase in pipeline capacity has been to increase import capacity between the United States and Western Canada.  Capacity almost doubled between 1990 and 1998, with the major expansion being the Northern Border expansion through Montana into the Midwest.  Other major expansions are the Alliance Pipeline, also providing access to Western Canada, and the Maritime and Northeast system to transport Sable Island supplies to markets in New England.      Natural Gas Drilling Activity    One of the key activities in producing natural gas is drilling.  With prices providing an economic incentive and generally declining drilling costs, successful lower-48 natural gas well completions are expected to reach 16,200 in 2015.  This level of drilling is below the level reached in 1981 of more than 20,000 successful gas wells, but represents approximately a 54 percent increase over 1998 levels.      Although the number of available drilling rigs has been generally declining since 1982, price increases are a powerful incentive for increased drilling and the purchase of new drilling equipment. The number of available drilling rigs increased by almost 16 percent annually between 1974 and 1982--from 1,767 to 5,644--as natural gas prices more than quadrupled in real terms and oil prices more than doubled. The rigs needed over the forecast period are assumed to be constructed, with the total rig count projected to increase from 1,705 in 1998 to 2,053 in 2015.  The increase in rigs is tempered by the fact that technological improvements make it possible to drill faster and thus individual rigs can be more productive than in the past. Given the historical response to prices, even prices below current levels are likely to provide sufficient incentive for the needed drilling rigs available.       The U.S. natural gas rig count on June 30 was a record high of 718 rigs, and exploration and production budgets for many natural gas producers are reportedly expected to increase in the latter part of 2000 and into 2001, spurred by the incentive of higher prices. Although the effects of increased drilling for gas will   probably not   appear in the form of increased   production until after the next heating season, overall, the natural gas industry is thought to be in a position to meet the supply requirements for a market of 30 tcf, with adequate supplies available from numerous sources at the prices projected in the AEO2000 reference case. As long as the industry can be assured that the demand will be there, the economic incentive of a competitive market will assure that the necessary investments in infrastructure, rigs, drilling, and manpower will be made over time.     Natural Gas Prices    According to EIA's Short-Term Energy Outlook, the average wellhead price for natural gas is expected to average $3.03 per thousand cubic feet in 2000 (in 1998 dollars).  In nominal terms, this represents the highest annual wellhead price on record; in real (inflation-adjusted) terms, this projected price would be the highest annual average price since 1985.  Over the past 2 months,  natural gas prices in the spot market have averaged over $4.00 per thousand cubic feet, though over the past week they have fallen below this figure to the $3.70 to $3.80 per thousand cubic feet range.   Although EIA believes these higher prices will not remain in the long-term, a break from higher natural gas wellhead prices  may not develop until next spring.    Several years of relatively low prices have slowed down exploration and drilling for new sources of supply. Recent higher prices have caused drilling to rebound, but new domestic supplies are not likely to augment production until after the next heating season. Given the assumption that the current price regime will generate greater success by Canadian suppliers in filling new export capacity on the Alliance pipeline, we expect higher net imports to help alleviate the tight supply situation.  Hot summer weather in portions of the country that consume large amounts of gas-generated electricity has contributed to a low storage injection rate. Natural gas that would normally be injected into storage has, to some extent, been used (indirectly through electric generators) to run air conditioners.  EIA anticipates that prices will be high through the summer and into the winter, as gas demand growth for electric generation is projected to remain high through 2000.     Further adding to the situation, several new gas-fired power plants are expected to come on line this summer, and many plants that were previously used for peaking only are now serving as baseload generators, causing an  increase in overall natural gas demand. Underground storage levels are currently 19 percent below year-ago levels, putting upward pressure on the price as we enter the time of year in which injections into storage usually occur.  However, average daily net injections in the first two weeks of July were 24 percent above the 5-year (1995-1999) average for the month and 59 percent ahead of last year's rate.  If injections continue at historically average rates through the remainder of the refill season, gas inventories would be 2,856 billion cubic feet on November 1, which is 4 percent below the 5-year (1995-1999) average of 2,985 billion cubic feet.    Concerns regarding possible high summer demand in conjunction with the relatively low level of storage  had been putting upward pressure on price. Until recently, high prices appear to have been discouraging a higher rate of storage injections.  For the remainder of this year at least, it is clear that the overall domestic supply situation remains tight and prices will be above what were previously expected.  Producers are expected to increase production to meet the demand increases, but this cannot be done overnight.  Thus, while prices are expected to remain higher than last year for the short-term, over the longer term we anticipate that they will move downward before beginning to rise again reaching $2.81 per thousand cubic feet (1998 dollars) in 2020 in the AEO reference case.    Technological Development    Technology improvements have both reduced effective exploration and development costs, and increased the recoverability of in-place resources.  Major advances in data acquisition, data processing, and the use of technology to display and integrate seismic data with other geologic data--combined with lower cost computer power and experience gained using new techniques--have exerted downward pressure on costs.  One significant cost-saving technology, adopted in the later part of the 1980s, was horizontal drilling.  Drilling a horizontal, as opposed to a conventional vertical well, enables more of the reservoir to be exposed to the wellbore since most reservoirs are wider than they are deep.  Another substantial boost to successful exploration and development has come from the increased use of three dimensional seismology to more effectively delineate prospective areas of a formation.  Additionally, the introduction of subsea well technologies, tension leg platforms, and production spars have opened up vast new and promising areas for exploration in the deepwater areas of the offshore that had been inaccessible.  The AEO reference case assumes that improvements in technology will continue at historical rates. To assess the potential effects of faster and slower rates of improvement, rapid and slow technology cases are also examined, with the same resource base as in the reference case.  Rapid technology improvements could yield benefits in the form of both lower prices and increased production to meet higher consumption requirements.        Production from unconventional gas resources (tight sands, shales, and coalbeds), an increasingly important source of supply, is responsive to changes in the assumed levels of technological progress. Whereas the reference case projects total U.S. natural gas production in 2015 at 25.0 tcf, the rapid technology case projects 26.3 tcf of production in 2015, with the increase coming primarily from offshore and unconventional sources (Figure 9).  More significantly, this higher production is available at  lower prices, reflecting the lower costs and higher efficiencies that result from increased technological gains.  In the slow technology case, prices are higher than in the reference case, and production in 2015 only reaches 23.6 tcf.          Offshore gas production in the Gulf of Mexico is expected to grow from 5.5 tcf in 1998 to a peak of 6.7 tcf in 2015 in the reference case and 5.9 tcf in the slow technology case. In the rapid technology case, however, offshore Gulf of Mexico production exceeds this peak, growing to 7.5 tcf in 2015, and cumulative offshore production between 1998 and 2015 is 109.9 tcf, compared with 104.5 tcf in the reference case and 98.9 tcf in the slow technology case. The rapid technology assumption has a similar, but less dramatic, effect on unconventional gas recovery (UGR). Cumulative UGR production between 1998 and 2015 is 96.3 tcf in the rapid technology case, compared with 93.7 tcf in the reference case and 90.6 tcf in the slow technology case. Virtually all of the increase in cumulative total production in the high technology case over the reference case comes from UGR and offshore production.  In the slow technology case, the drop in production from UGR and offshore sources exceeds the drop in total cumulative production by slightly over 6 tcf.  Changes in production in the alternative technology cases reflect the benefits of lower costs and higher finding rates for conventionally recoverable gas, as well as an array of technological enhancements for unconventional gas recovery.      The natural gas price projections are highly sensitive to changes in assumptions about technological progress. Reference case wellhead prices for natural gas in the lower-48 States are projected to increase on average by 1.7 percent a year from 1998 to 2020 reaching $2.81 per thousand cubic feet in 1998 dollars (Figure 10).  The increase reflects rising demand for natural gas and the impact of the progression of discoveries from larger and more profitable fields to smaller, less economical ones. Lower-48 wellhead prices increase at an average annual rate of 3.0 percent in the slow technology case, compared with 0.6 percent in the rapid technology case, over the projection period. In the rapid technology case, average natural gas wellhead prices are  projected to reach $2.23 in 2015, which is $0.48 less than the reference case price. These relatively large differences in price among cases arise because substantial shifts in supply result from the variance in technological progress, under conditions of moderate demand responsiveness.         Summary    Overall, the natural gas industry is expected to be in a position to meet the supply requirements for a  30 tcf market, with adequate supplies available from numerous sources at competitive prices. While recent high natural gas prices resulting from the tight supply situation  will most likely continue for the short-term, over the longer term EIA anticipates that they will move downward before beginning a rise along the lines forecast in the AEO Reference case. Technology improvements that have occurred since the 1970's have both reduced effective exploration and development costs and increased the recoverability of in-place resources. Improvements are expected to continue, which will make it possible to produce more of the resource base.    Much of the pipeline expansion needed to meet a 30 tcf market is either already completed or scheduled to be completed within the next two years.  Several new expansions provide producers in the Rocky Mountain region with access to customers in the Midwest, and recent Gulf Coast area projects have provided gathering systems and short-haul pipelines to access new supplies.  These are the two areas of the country from which most of the incremental production is forecast to come.  Expansion of capacity between the United States and Canada has significantly increased, providing greater access to Western Canadian supplies and new access to Sable Island supplies.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  Background      The General Provisions to the NSPS in 40 CFR part 60 and the NESHAP  in 40 CFR part 61 provide that a source owner or operator may request a  determination of whether certain intended actions constitute the  commencement of construction, reconstruction, or modification. EPA's  written responses to these inquiries are broadly termed applicability  determinations. See 40 CFR 60.5 and 61.06. Although the part 63 NESHAP  and Clean Air Act section 111(d) regulations contain no specific  regulatory provision that sources may request applicability  determinations, EPA does respond to written inquiries regarding  applicability for the part 63 and section 111(d) programs. The NSPS and  NESHAP also allow sources to seek permission to use monitoring or  recordkeeping which is different from the promulgated requirements. See  40 CFR 60.13(i), 61.14(g), 63.8(b)(1), 63.8(f), and 63.10(f). EPA's  written responses to these inquiries are broadly termed alternative  monitoring decisions. Furthermore, EPA responds to written inquiries  about the broad range of NSPS and NESHAP regulatory requirements as  they pertain to a whole source category. These inquiries may pertain,  for example, to the type of sources to which the regulation applies, or  to the testing, monitoring, recordkeeping or reporting requirements  contained in the regulation. EPA's written responses to these inquiries  are broadly termed regulatory interpretations.     EPA currently compiles EPA-issued NSPS and NESHAP applicability  determinations, alternative monitoring decisions, and regulatory  interpretations, and posts them on the Applicability Determination  Index (ADI) on a quarterly basis. In addition, the ADI contains EPA- issued responses to requests pursuant to the stratospheric ozone  regulations, contained in 40 CFR part 82. The ADI is an electronic  index on the Internet with over one thousand EPA letters and memoranda  pertaining to the applicability, monitoring, recordkeeping, and  reporting requirements of the NSPS and NESHAP. The letters and  memoranda may be searched by date, office of issuance, subpart,  citation, control number or by string word searches.     Today's notice comprises a summary of 55 such documents added to  the ADI between May 2002 and July 2002. The subject, author, recipient,  date and header of each letter and memorandum are listed in this  notice, as well as a brief abstract of the letter or memorandum.

A1: No. Because the company did not address several of the  submittal requirements in 40 CFR 63.1510(w), an alternative monitoring  approach cannot be approved at this time.     Q2: Can the initial performance test required for the rotary  furnaces be waived?     A2: Although the authority to approve performance test waivers  under 40 CFR part 63 has been delegated to the Florida Department of  Environmental Protection, Region 4 recommends that the request be  denied since low opacity alone will not ensure compliance with the  applicable particulate mass emission standard. Abstract for [M020004]     Q: May a Portland Cement facility use an alternative initial  performance testing and monitoring for inaccessible, totally enclosed,  and partially enclosed conveyor system transfer points (CSTPs) and  storage bins under NESHAP subpart LLL? This request includes  alternative initial performance testing and monitoring for sources  inside buildings.     A: A Portland Cement facility may use alternative initial  performance testing and monitoring for inaccessible, totally enclosed,  and partially enclosed CSTPs  [[Page 58030]]  and storage bins. However, for alternative initial performance testing  inside buildings, the EPA Regional Office has not been delegated the  authority to approve the request. Abstract for [0200001]     Q1: Will EPA approve a request for an alternative monitoring plan  to be used during bypasses of the sulfur recovery units to unmonitored  stacks?     A1: No. EPA will not approve this request because the alternative  monitoring plan would not make representative measurements of the  sulfur dioxide emissions during bypasses of the sulfur recovery units  to unmonitored stacks.     Q2: Will EPA approve a request for an alternative monitoring plan  to be used during bypasses of the tail gas treating units to  unmonitored stacks?     A2: No. EPA will not approve this request because the alternative  monitoring plan would not make representative measurements of the  sulfur dioxide emissions during bypasses of the tail gas treating units  on sulfur recovery units to unmonitored stacks. Abstract for [0200002]     Q: Will EPA grant a waiver from the operating temperature of 55.0  degrees Celsius in 40 CFR 60.753(c)?     A: EPA will grant a waiver to 65.6 degrees Celsius for certain  wells that show high methane production, low oxygen, carbon monoxide  levels below 100 ppm, and no charred debris in the gas collection  system. Abstract for [0200003]     Q: Is a duct burner (along with the associated heat recovery steam  generator) that is too small to be covered under NSPS subpart Da  covered by NSPS subpart Db?     A: Yes, if it meets the definition of an affected facility under  NSPS subpart Db. NSPS subpart Db was intentionally written to be very  broad in nature as to what constitutes an affected facility. Abstract for [0200004]     Q1: What is the definition of excess emissions for reporting and  compliance purposes under NSPS subpart G?     A1: Excess emissions under NSPS Subpart G are defined as any three- hour period during which the average nitrogen oxides emission rate  exceeds the 1.5 kilograms per metric ton (3.0 pounds per ton) emission  limit in 40 CFR 60.72(a)(1).     Q2: Do excess emissions constitute a violation of the standard in  NSPS subpart G?     A2: Under the ``any credible evidence'' provisions in 40 CFR  60.11(g), the continuous emission monitoring (CEMS) data used for  excess emission reporting can be used to cite violations for any three- hour period(s) during which the CEMS data indicate that emissions would  have been in excess of the applicable standard had a performance test  been conducted.     Q3: If excess emissions do constitute a violation of the standard  in NSPS Subpart G, how are the averaging time and the duration of the  violation determined?     A3: Since the emission limit has an averaging time of three hours,  CEMS data must be averaged over a three-hour period in order to  determine whether the nitrogen oxides emission rate has exceeded the  applicable limit. A single three-hour period during which the average  emission rate exceeds the limit would be reported as three hours of  excess emissions. If there are consecutive, overlapping three hour  periods during which the average nitrogen oxides emission rate exceeds  the applicable limit, the duration of the excess emission period should  be determined based upon the number of hours between the beginning and  the end of the exceedance period.     Q4: Does 40 CFR 60.8(c) allow violations during nitric acid plant  startups, and, if so, are facilities exempt from enforcement for  violations of the standard during startup?     A4: Since NSPS subpart G does not include language specifically  indicating that the nitrogen oxides limit applies at all times,  facilities would be exempt from the limit during startup under the  provisions in 40 CFR 60.8(a). Although facilities are exempt from the  emission limit during startup, facility owners and operators could be  cited for a violation of 40 CFR 60.11(d) if steps to minimize emissions  are not taken during startup, shutdown, and malfunction.     Q5: If 40 CFR 60.8(c) does provide an exemption from enforcement  during startups, is there any time limit associated with the exemption?     A5: Although NSPS subpart G does not specify a limit on the amount  of time that a facility is exempt from the nitrogen oxides emission  limit during startup, enforcement under the provisions in 40 CFR  60.11(d) can be pursued if steps are not taken to minimize emissions  during startup regardless of the duration of the excess emission  period. Abstract for [0200005]     Q1: Are proposals to reduce the frequency for fuel usage  recordkeeping at National Linen Services and the University of West  Florida acceptable?     A1: Yes. The proposed alternative recordkeeping and reporting  frequencies are consistent with those that EPA has previously approved  for other facilities. If the University of West Florida does not have a  separate gas meter for its NSPS subpart Dc boiler, it will be necessary  to obtain approval for a way of apportioning the University's total gas  usage in order to determine the amount of fuel burned in the NSPS  subpart Dc unit.     Q2: Can future proposals for alternative fuel usage recordkeeping  frequencies be approved by the Florida Department of Environmental  Protection without being submitted to EPA Region 4 for case-by-case  reviews?     A2: Yes. Based upon the history of previous EPA approvals, there is  no environmental benefit associated with submitting future proposals to  EPA for case-by-case reviews if records will be kept on at least  monthly basis, reports will be submitted on at least an annual basis,  and an appropriate apportionment approach will be used when the total  amount of fuel burned in multiple gas-fired units is measured with a  common gas meter. Abstract for [0200006]     Q: Is the ASTM Test Method D5504-98 method an acceptable  alternative method for determining the sulfur content of the natural  gas burned in stationary gas turbines at four compressor stations  located in Florida?     A: Yes. The proposed alternative method is acceptable. Also, the  results of sampling conducted at one compressor station can be used for  turbines at multiple compressor stations provided that no new gas  enters the pipeline between the stations in question. Abstract for [0200007]     Q: Is ASTM Test Method D5504-98 method an acceptable alternative  method for determining the sulfur content of the natural gas burned in  stationary gas turbines at four compressor stations located in Florida?     A: Yes. The proposed alternative method is acceptable. Also, the  results of sampling conducted at a compressor station in Florida can be  used for the turbines at a compressor station in Mount Vernon, Alabama,  provided that no new gas enters the system between these stations. Abstract for [0200008]     Q: Is an alternative monitoring approach proposed by General  Electric Plastics (GEP) for a phosgene monitoring system on a  distillation operation at its plant in Burkville,  [[Page 58031]]  Alabama acceptable under NSPS subpart NNN?     A: Yes. GEP must obtain approval for an alternative monitoring  approach because NSPS subpart NNN does not specify monitoring  procedures for the type of control system used by the company. Issues  addressed in the approval letter include the measurement range of the  phosgene monitoring system, the basis for waiving the requirement to  correct analyzer results to three percent oxygen, acceptable procedures  for calculating three-hour average emission rates, and the analyzer  calibration frequency. Abstract for [0200009]     Q1: Is the Georgia Pacific Corporation (GPC) proposal to monitor  scrubber liquid flow rate more acceptable than monitoring the pressure  drop for the scrubber installed on a lime kiln at a kraft pulp mill in  New Augusta, Mississippi to comply with NSPS Subpart BB?     A1: Yes. Based upon the design of the scrubber installed on the  lime kiln, the proposed alternative monitoring parameter will be a  better indicator of control device performance than pressure drop will  be.     Q2: Will EPA waive the requirement to monitor the combustion  temperature of the power boiler used to destroy the total reduced  sulfur compounds contained in non-condensable gas streams at a kraft  pulp mill?     A2: Yes. Because the non-condensable gas streams generated at the  mill are burned in a power boiler, rather than an incinerator,  combustion temperature monitoring is not required under NSPS subpart  BB. Abstract for [0200010]     Q1: Will EPA grant an initial performance testing extension  requested by the Gainesville Regional Utilities for Combined Cycle Unit  No. 1 at the J.R. Kelly Generating Station to comply with NSPS subparts  A and GG?     A1: Yes. Unit No. 1 will not be capable of operating until the  reinstallation of parts that were returned to the manufacturer for  repairs. Therefore, the deadline for completing an initial performance  can be extended for up to 720 operating hours following the restart of  the unit.     Q2: Can certification testing for the continuous emission  monitoring systems installed on Unit No. 1 be delayed for up to 30 days  beyond the completion date of the initial performance test on the unit?     A2: Yes. The proposed schedule for monitor certification is  consistent with the provisions in 40 CFR 60.13(c).     Q3: Can the requirement to provide notification at least 30 days  prior to conducting the initial performance test be waived?     A3: Conditional. Providing less than 30 days prior notification is  acceptable provided that it does not prevent the Florida Department of  Environmental Protection from observing the testing. Abstract for [0200011]     Q: Will EPA grant an initial performance testing extension  requested by Gainesville Regional Utilities (GRU) for Combined Cycle  Unit No. 1 at the J.R. Kelly Generating Station to comply with NSPS  subparts A and GG?     A: No. Because 40 CFR part 60 does not contain provisions for  extending the initial performance testing deadlines in 40 CFR 60.8(a),  GRU is technically in violation of the requirement to complete an  initial performance test within 60 days after reaching the maximum  firing rate on Unit No. 1. Because the turbine operating problems that  have delayed the performance testing are largely out of GRU's control,  it is recommended that a decision regarding whether to pursue  enforcement for missing the testing deadline be deferred until after  the testing is actually completed. Abstract for [0200012]     Q: Must NSPS Subpart OOO sources in Kentucky submit notifications  and reports to U.S. EPA Region 4?     A: No. Because NSPS subpart OOO has been delegated to the Kentucky  Department for Environmental Protection and to the Air Pollution  Control District of Jefferson County, submitting notifications and  reports to these agencies will be sufficient. Abstract for [0200013]     Q: Is an alternative sulfur dioxide monitoring proposal for Units 1  and 2 at the Jacksonville Electric Authority (JEA) Northside Generating  Station acceptable to comply with NSPS subpart Da?     A: No. In order for the alternative monitoring approach to be  approved, it must contain a provision for initiating daily as-fired  coal sampling in the event that the 30-day average sulfur dioxide  removal efficiency calculated ever drops below 80 percent. In addition,  it will be necessary for JEA to measure the pre-control sulfur dioxide  emission rate for at least 30 consecutive boiling operating days in  order to collect the data needed to satisfy the requirements for an  initial performance test. Abstract for [0200014]     Q: Is an initial performance testing extension requested by the  Jacksonville Electric Authority (JEA) for a combustion turbine at its  Brandy Branch installation acceptable to comply with NSPS subparts A  and GG?     A: No. Because 40 CFR part 60 does not contain provisions for  extending the initial performance testing deadlines in 40 CFR 60.8(a),  JEA is technically in violation of the requirement to complete an  initial performance test within 60 days after reaching the maximum  firing rate on Unit 1. Because the turbine operating problems that have  delayed the performance testing are largely out of JEA's control, a  decision regarding whether to pursue enforcement for missing the  testing deadline should be deferred until after the testing is actually  completed. Abstract for [0200015]     Q: Is an initial performance testing extension requested by the  City of Tallahassee for Unit No. 8 at its Purdom Generating Station  acceptable to comply with NSPS subparts A and GG?     A: Yes. Unit Number 8 will not be capable of sustained operation  until the cause of vibrations during oil firing is identified and  corrected. Therefore, the deadline for completing an initial  performance can be extended for up to 720 operating hours following the  restart of the unit on oil. Abstract for [0200016]     Q: Does a gas vent flare, which is sometimes referred to as a  ``candle flare'' because it has a constant sparking device at the flare  tip, meet the requirements of 40 CFR 60.18(f)(2)?     A: No. EPA does not consider open (or candle) flares with constant  sparking devices to be equivalent to the thermocouple, ultraviolet beam  sensor requirements for flares found at 40 CFR 60.18(f)(2). Abstract for [0200017]     Q: Is a process printing machine subject to the NSPS subpart RR  regulations for pressure sensitive tape and label materials coating?     A: Yes. The printing machine meets the definition of ``precoat''  under 40 CFR 60.441(a). Abstract for [0200018]     Q: Will EPA approve ASTM Test Method D5762-01 to monitor nitrogen  content for turbines?     A: Yes. This test method has the necessary reproducibility and  repeatability and accuracy to be used in lieu of ASTM Test Method D3228  for the monitoring requirement under NSPS subpart GG.  [[Page 58032]]  Abstract for [0200019]     Q: Will EPA grant a waiver from the initial performance test  required in NSPS subpart WWW, for landfill gas used in a large process  heater (more than 44 megawatts)? The landfill gas is to be compressed,  filtered, and refrigerated before being sent to the process heater.     A: Yes. EPA considers compressing, filtering, and refrigerating  landfill gas for use in an energy recovery project to be ``treatment''  under NSPS subpart WWW. Therefore, no initial performance test is  required. Abstract for [0200020]     Q: Will EPA approve a 7-day drift test at less than 50% capacity  boiler operation to comply with NSPS subpart A?     A: If the normal operation of the boilers is to operate at less  than 50% capacity, EPA can approve a lower boiler operation in  accordance with statements made in the Agency's Emission Measurement  Center Guideline Document covering Appendix B, Performance  Specification 2, under the definition of ``normal'' load. Abstract for [0200021]     Q1: Will EPA allow a company with combined-cycle natural gas-fired  turbines to sample fuel sulfur content on a quarterly basis during the  next 12 months of operation with semiannual monitoring for all  subsequent years to comply with NSPS subpart GG?     A1: Yes, but only if pipeline natural gas, as defined in 40 CFR  72.2, is the only fuel being burned. The company must substantiate its  request with sulfur monitoring data below the sulfur standard, with  little variability. This data must be collected with a test method  approved under 40 CFR 60.335(d). The custom fuel monitoring schedule is  based on the schedule provided in a 1987 policy memorandum from the  Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards (OAQPS).     Q2: Will EPA waive the nitrogen fuel monitoring requirement for a  facility with combined-cycle natural gas-fired turbines proposes?     A2: Yes. EPA will not require monitoring of fuel nitrogen content  while pipeline natural gas, as defined in 40 CFR 72.2, is the only fuel  fired in the gas turbine. This is based on a 1987 policy memorandum  from OAQPS. Abstract for [0200022]     Q1: Will EPA allow a company with combined-cycle natural gas-fired  turbines to waive the water-to-fuel monitoring requirement in 40 CFR  60.334(a)?     A1: No. EPA will not waive the water-to-fuel monitoring requirement  in 40 CFR 60.334(a). However, EPA will allow the facility to use  certified CEMs to monitor NO X  emissions as an alternative to  monitoring the water-to-fuel ratio to demonstrate compliance with  60.334(a).     Q2: Is it acceptable for a company with combined-cycle natural gas- fired turbines to use ASTM Test Method D 5504-94 to measure the fuel  sulfur content?     A2: No. The ASTM test methods that are accepted in 40 CFR 60.335(d)  have experimental results for repeatability or reproducibility which  ASTM Test Method D 5504-94 and ASTM Test Method D 5504-98 do not.     Q3: Is it acceptable for a company with combined-cycle natural gas- fired turbines to use a custom fuel monitoring schedule?     A3: Yes, but only if pipeline natural gas, as defined in 40 CFR  72.2, is the only fuel being burned. The company must substantiate its  request with sulfur monitoring data below the sulfur standard and  showing little variability. This data must be collected with a test  method approved under 40 CFR 60.335(d). The custom fuel monitoring  schedule is based on the schedule provided in a 1987 policy memorandum  from the Office of Air Quality and Planning Standards. Abstract for [0200023]     Q: May the GPA Test Method 2377-86 be used in lieu of approved ASTM  test methods for analyzing the sulfur content of natural gas?     A: Yes. The GPA test method entitled ``Test for Hydrogen Sulfide  and Carbon Dioxide in Natural Gas Using Length of Stain Tubes'' (GPA  Standard 2377-86) is an alternative method that EPA has approved for  other facilities that combust pipeline quality natural gas. Abstract for [0200024]     Q1: May the quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) requirements  of part 75 be used to satisfy NSPS QA/QC requirements for CEMs at a  boiler unit that operates as a peaker?     A1: Yes. NSPS subpart A requires Relative Accuracy Test Audits  (RATA) once every four consecutive calendar quarters for CEMs at a  continuously operated boiler unit. For an infrequently operated unit,  EPA's Acid Rain Program rules at part 75 may be used in lieu of NSPS  requirements, subject to certain conditions.     Q2: May low emission rate criteria adopted under part 75 rules be  used during the RATA?     A2: No. In this case, a problem with past RATA testing had been  addressed, so it is no longer necessary to rely on the low emission  rate provisions.     Q3: May we use diluent capping procedures of part 75?     A3: No. It is better to provide regulatory agencies with the actual  data, even when the F-factor used creates an inaccuracy in the emission  calculations. Moreover, during periods of startup, shutdown, and  malfunction, the source is not subject to the nitrogen oxide emissions  standards as set forth at Sec.  60.46a(c). The regulatory agencies will  review the data to determine whether the numbers, in fact, represent  excess emissions. Abstract for [0200025]     Q: How is a landfill that is a Superfund site affected by the  Federal Plan for landfills, when it would otherwise be considered  subject to the Plan?     A: The site is governed by a Federal consent decree. Through the  incorporation of the Record of Decision (ROD), the consent decree  establishes the applicable or relevant and appropriate requirements  (ARARs) for the landfill in accordance with the Comprehensive  Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA). The  ROD remedy included the installation of a landfill gas collection and  control system at the JDF. During future 5-year reviews of the remedy,  it may be appropriate to consider some aspect of Federal Plan  requirements to ensure that the selected remedy remains protective of  human health and the environment. Abstract for [0200026]     Q1: Is it acceptable for a company with simple-cycle natural gas- fired turbines to use an on-site sulfur gas chromatograph that uses  ASTM Test Method D 5504-94 to measure the fuel sulfur content?     A1: No. The ASTM test methods that are accepted in 60.335(d) have  experimental results for repeatability or reproducibility which ASTM D  5504-94 and ASTM D 5504-98 do not.     Q2: Is it acceptable for a company to use the Gas Processors  Association (GPA) test method entitled ``Test for Hydrogen Sulfide and  Carbon Dioxide in Natural Gas Using Length of Stain Tubes'' (GPA  Standard Test Method 2377-86) as a backup to using the on-site sulfur  gas chromatograph and ASTM Test Method D 5504-94 to demonstrate  compliance with 40 CFR 60.333(b)?     A2: No. Based on the answer to the first question, EPA will not  allow the facility to use GPA Standard Test  [[Page 58033]]  Method 2377-86 as a backup test method. Abstract for [0200027]     Q: How late will EPA accept the Tier 2 and Tier 3 testing options  contained in NSPS subpart WWW for municipal solid waste (MSW)  landfills?     A: EPA cannot consider Tier 2 or Tier 3 testing after the NSPS  final compliance deadline. Abstract for [0200028]     Q: Are landfill gases treated by the Krysol gas treatment process  subject to the NSPS subpart WWW for municipal solid waste landfills?     A: No. Gases that have been treated by the Krysol gas treatment  process, which includes compression, drying, and removal of CO2 and  other contaminants, are not subject. Nevertheless, any waste gases that  would be vented from the treatment process to the atmosphere, whether  vented to the on-site internal combustion engine, the thermal oxidizer,  or the open flare, must meet the appropriate control requirements. Abstract for [0200029]     Q: Is the proposal to shorten the sampling time for dioxin testing  on the medical waste incinerators at the Children's Hospital and at  American 3CI from fours hours to one hour acceptable to comply with  NSPS subpart Ce?     A: Conditionally acceptable. Based upon the magnitude of the  applicable dioxin standard for the facilities in question, the  detection limit for a one-hour sample should be low enough for  verifying compliance. In order to reduce the possibility that a retest  will be needed, however, the testing contractor should verify this  using the actual detection limit for the laboratory that will be  analyzing the samples from these facilities. Abstract for [0200030]     Q1: Do an existing and a new brown stock washer operating in  parallel constitute a single affected facility or two separate affected  facilities under NSPS subpart BB?     A1: Based upon the definitions in NSPS subpart BB, the parallel  brown stock washers constitute a single affected facility.     Q2: If the parallel brown stock washers constitute a single  facility, how would modification and reconstruction issues be addressed  when the new brown stock washer is installed?     A2: For reconstruction, if the existing brown stock washer is  permanently taken out of service, the cost of the new brown stock  washer must be considered when determining whether reconstruction has  occurred. For modification, an increase in the brown stock washer  system throughput or the total reduced sulfur emission rate following  the installation of the new brown stock washer would constitute a  modification which would trigger the applicability of NSPS subpart BB. Abstract for [0200031]     Q: The Berkshire Power, LLC's Agawam, Massachusetts facility is  subject to NSPS subpart GG and to the federal Acid Rain requirements in  part 75. How should the Massachusetts Department of Environmental  Protection (MDP) resolve some 40 CFR part 60 and 40 CFR part 75 CEM  requirement inconsistencies?     A: EPA Region 1 recognizes that for facilities with very low  NO X  emission limits in their New Source Performance (NSR) / Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) permits, some of the  relative accuracy limits and ranges in parts 60 and 75 may not be  appropriate. After consultation with OAQPS, EPA Region 1 has tried to  provide reasonable alternatives in this letter. Abstract for [0200032]     Q: Will EPA approve a custom fuel monitoring schedule under NSPS  Subpart GG for a facility?     A: Yes. EPA will approve the custom fuel monitoring schedule  according to an August 14, 1987, national policy which allows the EPA  Regional Offices to approve NSPS subpart GG custom fuel monitoring  schedules on a case-by-case basis. In this case, approval is based on  the understanding that there is no fuel-bound nitrogen and that the  available free nitrogen does not appreciably contribute to  NO X  emissions. Abstract for [0200033]     Q: Will EPA allow the use of an alternate performance test method  for stationary gas turbines subject to NSPS Subpart GG?     A: Yes, but only if the probe is designed and conforms to the tests  specified in EPA Guideline Document GD-031. Abstract for [0200034]     Q: Will EPA allow the use of an alternate performance test method  for stationary gas turbines subject to NSPS subpart GG?     A: Yes, but only if the probe is designed and conforms to the tests  specified in EPA Guideline Document GD-031. Abstract for [0200035]     Q1: Will EPA allow the use of an alternate performance test method  for stationary gas turbines subject to NSPS Subpart GG?     A1: Yes. However, EPA must approve modifications to test methods  prior to their use. In this case, EPA approves the modification because  it believes that this is a minor modification that will generate  acceptably accurate data. Abstract for [0200036]     Q: Will EPA allow an alternative fuel analysis method for testing  nitrogen content in distillate fuel to comply with NSPS subpart GG?     A: Yes. EPA will allow an alternative fuel analysis method, but  only if the method can be shown to determine the nitrogen content with  an accuracy of within 5 percent. In this case, information the facility  submitted to EPA from its laboratory failed to demonstrate that the  alternative method could meet the precision criteria. Abstract for [C020003]     Q1: At what point in the final disposal process is a final disposal  facility violating 40 CFR 82.156(f) if a charged small appliance is  found by an EPA inspector during a compliance inspection?     A1: EPA believes that a violation of 40 CFR 82.156(f) occurs if a  charged appliance is found after the last reasonable inspection point  in the disposal process. EPA also believes that the ``final step'' in  the disposal process may occur even though the disposal facility has  not staged an appliance for destruction or placed an appliance in a  staging area for destruction.     Q2: Under what circumstance is a statement of evacuation the only  verification required under 40 CFR 82.156(f) by a final disposal  facility before the final step in the disposal process can occur  without violating 40 CFR 82.156(f)? According to the final rule  preamble (58 FR 28704) a certification accepted ``in good faith''  relieves the disposal facility of its liability. If however, the entity  ``knows or should know that refrigerant remains in the appliance,'' it  will still be held liable.     A2: The Agency believes that verification statements of evacuation  accepted in good faith by a disposal facility satisfies the  requirements of 40 CFR 82.156(f)(2).     Q3: Is a verification statement required for each and every  appliance accepted by the final disposal facility if the facility has a  contract with a supplier stipulating that all refrigerant will be  removed from appliances prior to delivery? Is a long term (more than 1  shipment) contract all that is required  [[Page 58034]]  under 40 CFR 82.156(f) as verification of refrigerant evacuation?     A3: If the final disposal facility chooses not to recover remaining  refrigerant from appliances, verification must include a signed  statement of evacuation from the person from whom the appliance is  received. Final disposal facilities may also accept statements of  evacuation for shipments of appliances. Regular suppliers to a final  disposal facility, with whom long-standing business relationships are  maintained, may sign a contract that stipulates that one party has the  responsibility to remove refrigerant from equipment before delivery to  the facility.     Q4: Is a statement of evacuation accepted under 40 CFR  82.156(f)(2), which is missing any information listed as required in 40  CFR 82.156(f), a violation of 40 CFR 82.156(f)(2)? Does a violation of  40 CFR 82.156(f) occur if a company has or may have the missing  information in other company records?     A4: The Safe Disposal Program regulations require that certain  specific information must be included as part of any statement of  evacuation. 40 CFR 82.156(f)(2) is very clear concerning the  information that must be part of any statement of evacuation. Any  information required by the regulation that is missing from a statement  of evacuation is a violation of 40 CFR 82.156(f)(2).     Q5: Are there any circumstances under which a final disposal  facility would be violating the reporting and recordkeeping  requirements of 40 CFR 82.156(f) if an empty small appliance is found  by an EPA inspector in a staging area during a compliance inspection?     A5: For empty appliances, as for all appliances, the disposal  facility must recover the refrigerant or obtain a signed statement  which meets the requirements of 40 CFR 82.156(f)(2) from the person  delivering the appliance. This statement must be obtained prior to  placing the appliance in the final staging area for disposal. Abstract for [M020005]     Q: Would EPA classify the John Zink Gasoline Vapor Combustion Unit  as a thermal oxidization system or a flare?     A: In previous applicability determinations for similar units, EPA  has determined that these types of units should be classified as  thermal oxidation systems. Therefore, these units are subject to the  temperature monitoring requirements of 40 CFR 63.427(a)(3). EPA had  only intended for the flare monitoring requirements of 40 CFR  63.427(a)(4) to apply to open flame flares. Abstract for [M020006]     Q: If a facility purchases fibers (wood pulp, cotton, fiber glass,  burlap, and hemp) and additives to produce a variety of paper products,  but the paper mill neither produces virgin pulp nor operates a bleach  system, is it subject to NESHAP subpart S?     A. No. If the paper mill does not contain a pulping or bleaching  system as defined 40 CFR 63.441, then the mill does not contain an  affected source as defined under NESHAP subpart S, and the facility is  not subject to NESHAP subpart S. Abstract for [M020007]     Q: Does NESHAP subpart RRR apply to stand-alone aluminum shredding  devices where no further processing or charging is done on-site or at  another facility?     A: No. The stand-alone aluminum shredding device would not meet the  definition of ``aluminum scrap shredder'' at 40 CFR 63.1503 and would  not be subject to NESHAP subpart RRR. Abstract for [Z020001]     Q: Are tar pitch traps in metallurgical coke plants subject to 40  CFR part 61, subparts L and V?     A: Based on the information submitted in this case, the tar  decanter pitch traps are not subject to either NESHAP subpart L or  NESHAP subpart V as the amount of benzene in the stream is not high  enough to qualify as ``in benzene service'' under NESHAP subpart V and  the equipment is not a tar decanter, tar intercepting sump or tar  storage tank as understood by NESHAP subpart L. Abstract for [0200038]     Q: Will EPA approve alternative monitoring procedures under subpart  GG for stationary gas turbines used for peaking purposes?     A: Yes. EPA will approve alternative monitoring procedures  consistent with its 1987 Policy on custom fuel monitoring plans.  Approval in this case is contingent on the fact that only clean fuels  will be combusted (as specified in State permits) and that a certified  Continuous Emission Monitoring system will be used. Abstract for [0200039]     Q: Will EPA allow QVC, Inc. to do monthly rather than daily fuel  usage monitoring under NSPS subpart Dc?     A: Yes. Under circumstances such as those in this case, EPA has  allowed the use of monthly rather than daily fuel usage monitoring for  very small boilers combusting natural gas as the primary fuel. Abstract for [0200040]     Q: Does EPA consider an air curtain incinerator located at a  residential construction site a commercial or industrial facility under  NSPS subpart CCCC?     A: No. EPA has determined that an air curtain incinerator located  at a residential construction site is not considered an industrial or  commercial ``facility'' since the incinerator is not permanently  located at the site. Neither is the residential construction site  itself a permanent industrial or commercial ``facility''. Therefore,  NSPS subpart CCCC, the commercial and industrial solid waste  incineration regulations, do not apply to the air curtain incinerator  at the residential construction site. Abstract for [0200041]     Q: Will EPA allow a source to conduct the initial NO X   performance testing at base load only instead of at all four loads  under NSPS subpart GG?     A: Yes. EPA will allow the testing to be conducted at base load  only under the following conditions: the turbine burns pipeline natural  gas, the NO X  CEM system provides a continuous record of  emissions, and the base load is the peak load. Abstract for [0200042]     Q1: Will EPA allow a source to conduct the initial NO X   performance testing at base load only instead of at all four loads  under NSPS subpart GG?     A1: Yes. EPA will allow the testing to be conducted at base load  only under the following conditions: the turbine burns pipeline natural  gas, the NO X  CEM system provides a continuous record of  emissions, and the base load is the peak load.     Q2: Will EPA approve the use of a CEM to monitor NO X   emissions on a source which uses water injection to control  NO X  and be required to continuously correct the data to ISO  standard ambient conditions?     A2: Yes. EPA approves the use of a CEM, and the source does not  have to correct the CEM data to ISO standards because it has  demonstrated that the emissions are well below the standard.     Q3: Will EPA allow semiannual monitoring frequency for sulfur  content under a custom fuel monitoring plan?     A3: Yes. If the source has demonstrated low data variability and  sulfur content results which are below the standard and follows a  schedule. Abstract for [0200043]     Q: Is a sulfuric acid plant that is installed as a control device  for sulfur dioxide emissions from a molybdenum  [[Page 58035]]  ore roasting operation subject to NSPS subpart H?     A: No. The definition for ``sulfuric acid production unit'' in NSPS  subpart H does not include facilities where a sulfuric acid plant is  used ``primarily'' to control sulfur dioxide emissions. However, this  determination is subject to reevaluation if a significant change occurs  at the facility in question. In addition, EPA Region 7 clarifies and  corrects a previous determination for this facility made with input  from the Office of Enforcement and Compliance (OECA). In a letter to  Iowa Department of Natural Resources (IDNR) dated June 3, 1996, EPA  stated that the exemption in the definition of ``sulfuric acid  production unit'' in NSPS subpart H applied to acid plants used only as  an emission control device and that the introduction of any elemental  sulfur would change the acid plant from an emission control device to a  sulfuric acid production process. The guidance provided by OECA at that  time was derived from a narrow application of the regulation, without  any research into the background documents or the process chemistry  involved in acid production plants, both for production and process  control. Therefore, this interpretation supercedes and corrects the  previous one. Abstract for [0200044]     Q1. Does a change in liquid service of a storage vessel at a  facility from a low vapor pressure material (stormwater or diesel fuel)  to a high vapor pressure material (crude oil or gasoline) constitute a  modification under 40 CFR 60.14?     A1. In recent determinations, EPA found the activity of a petroleum  vessel storage facility changing the type of petroleum product stored  (i.e., diesel fuel to gasoline) was equivalent to the use of an  alternative fuel and exempted from the definition of modification as  provided in 40 CFR 60.14(e)(4). These determinations were based on the  assumption that petroleum products were essentially equivalent and,  therefore, any petroleum storage vessel could reasonably accommodate an  alternative petroleum product. Please note that EPA's determinations  only pertained to petroleum storage vessels. A storage vessel  converting from water or other non-petroleum liquid storage over to  petroleum storage would not be exempted from the NSPS modification  definition. With regard to the example, EPA would find the activity of  a vessel changing from diesel fuel storage to gasoline storage was not  a modification as defined in 40 CFR 60.14 and, therefore, the vessel  would not be subject to the NSPS subpart Kb.     Q2. What are the specific criteria for determining whether a vessel  was designed to accommodate an alternative use? If the original  construction specifications are not available, how is such a  determination made?     A2. EPA did not develop any specific criteria for determining if a  fuel storage vessel could accommodate an alternative petroleum material  in these determinations. As described previously, EPA's determinations  centered on assuming that petroleum products are similar and that a  petroleum storage vessel could reasonably accommodate different types  of petroleum products. However, if EPA did receive a request for a  determination on a specific storage vessel significantly altering its  design to accommodate an alternative petroleum product, EPA may adjust  its determination considering the specific facts of the case. Abstract for [0200045]     Q. Is the electrode process line of a facility that produces  medical EKG electrodes subject to the requirements of the NSPS subpart  RR?     A. Yes. Upon review, EPA finds that the electrode process line  would be subject to the requirements of NSPS subpart RR. The subpart's  applicability provision states the provisions of this subpart apply to  an affected facility whose coating line is used in the manufacture of  pressure sensitive tape and label materials. Pressure sensitive tape  includes ``any'' adhesive that coats a web substrate including adhesive  gels with pressure sensitive properties. Our understanding is that the  medical EKG electrode uses an adhesive gel and is applied to the skin  through pressure. Consequently, the Region has determined that NSPS  subpart RR is applicable to the process line producing these  electrodes. Abstract for [0200046]     Q. A facility has modified two 13.9 MMBtu/hr wood-fired boilers.  Would the boiler modifications constitute a modification as defined in  NSPS subpart A, and thereby, make the facility subject to NSPS subpart  Dc?     A. No. The physical changes do not constitute a modification as  specified in 40 CFR 60.14. Thus, the boilers at issue are not subject  to the requirements of NSPS subpart Dc. The physical modifications of  the boilers increased their heat input capacity and likewise their  potential to emit for all pollutants; however, pollution prevention  controls were simultaneously instituted that in fact caused a reduction  of particulate matter emission rate. Sulfur dioxide emission rates were  increased by increasing the heat input capacity of the wood-fired  boilers; however, sulfur dioxide emissions from wood-fired boilers are  relatively small (.02 lb/MMBtu) and in fact are not covered by the  sulfur dioxide standard of NSPS subpart Dc that pertains only to units  using coal or oil fuel. Thus, the sulfur dioxide emission rates are not  applicable to these wood-fired boilers and the physical changes do not  constitute a modification. Abstract for [0200047]     Q. A facility submitted an amendment application to its air  emissions license for the replacement of the existing tangential  overfire air system in Power Boiler No. 1 with an ``Opposed Wall''  system. Does this replacement constitute an NSPS modification as  defined in 40 CFR 60.14?     A. No. This project is not considered a modification and is exempt  from additional NSPS requirements. This system does not affect any of  the emission limits nor does it increase emissions nor increase the  production capacity of the boiler. Replacements such as this are not  considered modifications and are exempt from NSPS requirements. Abstract for [0200048]     Q1. Do internal costs of engineering and installation constitute  ``fixed capital costs'' even though a company would typically not  capitalize them, or are only external contractor and consultant fees  counted as fixed capital costs under 40 CFR part 60, subpart A?     A1. In a May 11, 1998 applicability determination pertaining to  reconstruction costs, EPA stated that the engineering, purchase and  installation costs, and contractor fees should be included in the  affected facility reconstruction costs (i.e., fixed capital cost) to  the extent that they are associated with reconstruction of affected  process equipment.     Q2. Do the repair and ultimate replacement of a rear boiler wall  constitute ``fixed capital costs'' even though these costs were  expensed?     A2. The failed repair attempts should not be included in fixed  capital costs; however, the costs of actual replacement of the rear  boiler wall should be included in the fixed capital costs.     Q3. What is meant by ``comparable entirely new facility'' in the  definition of reconstruction under NSPS subpart A? When evaluating the  costs associated with a comparable entirely new facility to replace the  boiler, should the cost of  [[Page 58036]]  installing a low NO X  burner be included?     A3. The term ``comparable entirely new facility'' would consist of  a new boiler with identical components to the repaired boiler.  Reconstruction calculations do not include air pollution control  equipment; therefore, the source would not include the cost of  installing low NO X  burners on the new facility unless they  are being added to the existing facility. Abstract for [0200049]     Q. Is a Synthetic Organic Chemicals Manufacturing Industry (SOCMI)  facility that produces heavy liquid chemicals only from heavy liquid  feed or raw material subject to the NSPS subpart VV?     A. Yes. The SOCMI facility is subject to NSPS subpart VV. However,  the facility only needs to comply with the recordkeeping and reporting  provisions of NSPS subpart VV since it meets the exemption definition  under 40 CFR 60.480(d)(3). In addition, the facility is exempt from the  SOCMI facility standard in 40 CFR 60.482 since it produces heavy liquid  chemicals only from heavy liquid feed or raw material as defined in 40  CFR 60.480(d)(3).      Dated: August 30, 2002. Michael M. Stahl, Director, Office of Compliance.

The Agency also announced a separate final rule for electric utility power plants to help reduce acid rain.  ""This is the most far-reaching effort ever taken to reduce air toxics, and a giant step forward in protecting the health of our citizens,"" said EPA Administrator Carol M. Browner.  ""Today's rule signifies that the gridlock of the past on clean air controls has now been broken.""  Browner also emphasized the pollution prevention and environmental justice aspects of the chemical industry rule, noting that more than 10 percent of all emission reductions under the regulation will result from pollution prevention techniques, such as using covers to prevent evaporation from storage tanks.  In the chemical industry, evaporation prevention translates into significant product savings.  The rule also requires that all new and existing chemical plants meet the same strict standards, helping to improve health protection for all Americans living near or working in such facilities.  ""This is important to our concerns regarding environmental justice, since many communities near these industrial corridors tend to be poor or minority,"" Browner added.  The final rule affects about 370 chemical plants in 38 states, the majority in Texas, Louisiana and New Jersey.  The 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act list 189 air toxics that EPA must regulate from a variety of industries by the turn of the century.  Today's rule reduces emissions of 112 of these toxics by 506,000 tons annually, an 88 percent reduction from current levels at chemical plants.  Although the rule is aimed at controlling air toxics, as a beneficial byproduct it will also significantly decrease levels of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), the prime ingredient in the formation of ground-level ozone (smog)--the nation's most pervasive air pollutant.  VOC levels will drop by one million tons a year, an 81 percent reduction.  These VOC cuts are equivalent to removing38 million cars from the road--about one-fourth of all U.S. cars.  Under today's rulemaking, chemical industry sources must achieve emission limits reflecting application of maximum achievable control technology, as defined by the Clean Air Act.  For new sources, this means the standards must be as stringent as the emission control achieved in practice by the best controlled similar source anywhere in the country.  For existing sources, the standards must be as stringent as the average emission control achieved by the best performing 12 percent of existing plants.  The rule contains an innovative compliance alternative called ""emissions averaging,"" which chemical manufacturers can use only if approved by the state in which the plant operates.  This option lets companies avoid excessive costs as long as public health is protected.  Emissions averaging means that if a facility does not wish to control a particular pollution source, emissions from that source can be offset by emission reductions--greater than required by law--at other sources in the same plant.  However, to insure environmental protection and enforceability, EPA has added strict requirements for the use of emissions averaging that didn't exist when the rule was proposed in the previous Administration.  For instance, application of emissions averaging can only be used now by a small number of emission sources in a facility; also, any emissions averaging must result in an extra ten percent reduction in toxic emissions over what would have occurred if this option had not been used.  In addition, emission averaging can only be utilized within one facility, not between different plants in different locations.  An example of emissions averaging in practice would be a chemical plant that already has substantial pollution control technology in place, but because of today's rule would need new control technology.  The emission averaging option may allow this plant to avoid ripping out existing controls if it can provide equivalent toxic reductions--plus an extra 10 percent--from elsewhere within the facility.  EPA estimates that the total nationwide capital costs of the rule to the chemical industry will be $450 million and total annual costs will be $230 million.  These costs will result in a ""worst-case"" estimated chemical price increase to customers of less than three percent.  EPA predicts no plant closures as a result of this rule.  Existing chemical industry sources must comply with today's rule within three years; new sources must comply immediately or on startup of operations, whichever occurs later.  Besides the chemical industry toxic rule, Browner also announced a final acid rain rule that will cut annual emissions of nitrogen oxide (Nox) by 1.8 million tons annually from 700 coal-fired electric utility power plants by the year 2000.  Nox and sulfur dioxide (SO2) are the prime ingredients in the formation of acid rain, and today's rule complements the Agency's final acid rain rule for SO2 issued in January 1993.  Today's rule addresses dry bottom, wall-fired and tangentially-fired boilers.  Beginning in 1995, 170 of these type boilers must meet EPA emission limits.  Beginning in the year 2000, other types of boilers (numbering over 300) must also reduce their emissions.  The Agency will establish the standards for other types of boilers in late 1996.  Under today's rule, a utility may either meet the EPA limit for each individual boiler, or join an ""averaging pool"" in which an overall emission average must be met.  A utility can choose the type of technology to install under either of these options.  If the utility cannot meet the emission standard with ""low Nox burner technology,"" it may apply for a less stringent emission standard.  The rule also has a provision whereby boilers that don't have to meet EPA emission limits till 2000 can comply earlier if they wish.  In return, they don't have to comply with the possibly more stringent standards until the year 2008.  ""This rule promotes technology development, early emission reductions, and the lowest cost to the economy for the expected benefits,"" said Browner.  ""It will help make sure that acid rain no longer poisons our lakes and streams.""  EPA today also announced four other air toxic rules to help protect public health.  One final rule establishes generic general provisions for all future air toxic standards under the Clean Air Act.  The general provision rule will eliminate redundancy in general information that would have to be repeated each time a new standard is issued and it will maintain the consistency of future air toxic regulations.  It will be the primary vehicle for informing industry of its basic compliance responsibilities under the Clean Air Act.  Another proposed rule provides the required guidance for implementing a provision of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments requiring maximum achievable control technology (MACT) for new, reconstructed and modified major sources of air toxics.  New sources require stringent controls, while modified sources face less stringent limits.  Another proposed rule would reduce 4.6 million pounds of toxic air pollutants yearly from the magnetic tape manufacturing industry (makes audio cassettes, etc.).  Most toxic sources in this industry would face air toxic reductions of 95 percent from uncontrolled levels.  An air toxic called ethylene oxide would be cut 2.2 million pounds annually under another proposed EPA rule controlling commercial sterilization operations such as those for medical equipment.  The rule wold reduce this toxic at major sources by 99 percent from uncontrolled levels.  Under the Clean Air Act, states have the authority to toughen the federal EPA regulations announced today, but they cannot weaken them.                                                                                                                                          EPA Home       |  Privacy      and Security Notice  |                   Contact Us"

Today's action is consistent with the Clinton Administration's Reinventing Environmental Regulation, announced by the President last week.  The Clinton Administration believes that the expansion of open-market trading for air and water pollution gives companies the broadest flexibility to find the lowest cost approaches to pollution reduction.  ""This rule is a good example of common sense regulatory reform,"" said EPA Administrator Carol M. Browner.  ""Pollution credit trading provides industry the flexibility to produce the very best environmental results for the least cost.""  Emissions trading already saves industry, and consumers, $2 billion per year.  The final rule announced today would allow combustion sources to voluntarily enter the pollution credit trading program.  Their participation would expand this program beyond electric power plants to include more facilities that emit sulfur dioxide (SO2), the prime ingredient in the formation of acid rain.  The move is part of a broader Administration effort to reinvent environmental regulation, including efforts to make pollution prevention an attractive investment.  The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 require that 1980 SO2 emission levels from electric power plants be cut in half by the year 2010 -- a 10 million ton yearly reduction.  To achieve this reduction, EPA offers electric utilities the option of using an innovative, market-based ""allowance"" trading system.  An allowance gives a utility unit the right to emit one ton of SO2 a year.  EPA grants allowances to utilities based on their past fuel usage.  The allowance program gives a utility an economic incentive to reduce acid rain pollution: If a plant reduces its SO2 emissions below its level of allowances, it will have left-over emission credits it can sell to other utilities or anyone that wants to buy them.  Today's final rule set up an ""opt-in"" program, allowing combustion sources other than utilities, such as industrial steam boilers, to voluntarily participate in allowance trading.  Just like utilities, opt-in sources will get their own allocation of allowances from EPA and will also have an economic incentive to reduce pollution.  EPA believes the overall cost of SO2 control will be lowered as opt-in facilities sell their unused allowances to electric utility units.  Utilities can use these allowances to comply with the acid rain rules at less cost than for traditional pollution control equipment.  Opt-in sources must comply with monitoring, enforcement and other Clean Air Act requirements similar to those applicable to utilities.  Regardless of the number of allowances held, no opt-in source can exceed standards protecting public health and the environment.                                                                                                                                          EPA Home       |  Privacy      and Security Notice  |                   Contact Us"

ACTION: Final rule.     SUMMARY: Under title IV of the Clean Air Act, Congress authorized the  U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to establish the Acid Rain  Program. The principal goal of the program is to achieve significant  environmental benefits through reductions in sulfur dioxide (SO<INF>2)  and nitrogen oxide (NO<INF>X) emissions, the primary components of acid  rain. Acid rain causes surface water acidification, damages trees at  high elevations and accelerates the decay of building materials. In  addition, air concentrations of SO<INF>2 and NO<INF>X degrade  visibility in large parts of the country and acidic aerosols derived  from these emissions may pose a risk to public health.     The Acid Rain Program departs from traditional regulatory methods  by introducing an SO<INF>2 allowance trading system that lowers the  cost of reducing emissions by allowing electric utilities as a group to  seek out the least costly methods of control. Utility units affected  under title IV are allocated allowances based on their historic  emissions and these units may trade allowances, provided that at the  end of each year, each unit holds enough allowances to cover its annual  SO<INF>2 emissions.      Today's action establishes an additional component to the Acid Rain  Program called the Opt-in Program. The Opt-in Program allows sources  not required to participate in the Acid Rain Program the opportunity to  participate on a voluntary basis. Such sources, known as combustion  sources, would include small utility units and industrial boilers.  These rules detail how combustion sources participate in the allowance  market by ``opting in'' to the Acid Rain Program, as provided under  section 410 of the Act. Congress envisioned the Opt-in Program as a  means of generating additional allowances and through which the  compliance costs of acid rain control in the utility sector could be  reduced, while still meeting overall emissions reductions goals.    EFFECTIVE DATE: These rules become effective on May 4, 1995.    ADDRESSES: Docket.

Background and Summary      Background       Acid deposition occurs when emissions of sulfur dioxide and oxides  of nitrogen are chemically transformed in the atmosphere into sulfuric  and nitric acids and return to earth as wet deposition such as rain,  fog, or snow, or dry deposition such as fine particles or gases. Acid  deposition damages lakes and harms forests and buildings. SO<INF>2  emissions damage ecosystems and materials, contribute to reduced  visibility and, at current levels, are suspected of posing a threat to  human health.      Title IV of the Clean Air Act, as amended by the Clean Air Act  Amendments of 1990, directs EPA to establish the Acid Rain Program to  reduce the adverse effects of acidic deposition. Title IV targets the  electric utility industry, which accounts for over two-thirds of  SO<INF>2 emissions and over one-third of NO<INF>X emissions in the  United States. Specifically, the Act mandates a national cap of 8.95  million tons per year on electric utility SO<INF>2 emissions by the  year 2010 (just over half of the 1980 electric utility SO<INF>2  emissions), to be achieved in two phases. Phase I will begin in 1995  and mainly affects large, high-emitting utility plants; these plants  are specifically listed in the statute. Phase II will begin in 2000 and  affects virtually all existing utility units with output capacity  greater than 25 megawatts and most new utility units.     The centerpiece of the Acid Rain Program is a unique trading system  in which allowances are bought and sold at prices determined in the  marketplace. Each allowance authorizes the emission of up to one ton of  SO<INF>2 during or after a designated year. The majority of utility  units--both existing and some new units--are allocated allowances based  on their historic fuel use and the emissions limitations specified in  the Act. Utility units are required to limit SO<INF>2 emissions to the  number of allowances they hold, but since allowances are fully  transferrable, utilities may meet their emissions control requirements  in the most cost-effective manner possible. For instance, a utility may  decide to (1) switch to a lower sulfur fuel, (2) install flue gas  desulfurization equipment (scrubbers) and bank unused allowances or  sell them to other utilities/individuals, (3) forego emissions  reductions and buy additional allowances (if necessary), or (4)  implement energy efficiency measures. Other options and combinations of  options are possible, providing an unusually high degree of  [[Page 17101]] flexibility for affected units to comply with the law.  The procedures for transferring and tracking allowances are codified in  40 CFR part 73.      Each affected unit must have a permit in which the affected unit  certifies that it will possess a sufficient number of allowances to  cover its SO<INF>2 emissions and specifies the source's compliance  options. The permit regulation is codified in 40 CFR part 72.     To ensure that nationally mandated reductions in SO<INF>2 and  NO<INF>X emissions are achieved, each affected unit must install a  continuous emissions monitoring system and collect, record, and report  emissions data. The continuous emissions monitoring rule is codified in  40 CFR part 75.      If an affected unit violates the Act by emitting more emissions  than the allowances it holds, the Act requires that the affected unit  pay penalties and submit a plan detailing how and when the excess  SO<INF>2 emissions will be offset. These requirements act as a strong  incentive for compliance with the mandated emissions reductions of the  Acid Rain Program. Excess emissions penalty requirements are codified  in 40 CFR part 77.      Finally, 40 CFR part 78 contains administrative appeals procedures  for resolving disputes over decisions by the Administrator regarding  any aspect of the Acid Rain Program.    2. The Opt-in Program        Although the Acid Rain Program is mandated only for utility  sources, section 410 provides opportunities for SO<INF>2-emitting  sources not otherwise affected by title IV requirements (e.g.,  industrial sources) to participate in the Acid Rain Program by ``opting  in.''      The Opt-in Program is a voluntary economic incentive provision.  Congress developed the Opt-in Program to reduce further the cost of  complying with the Acid Rain Program. Combustion or process sources not  otherwise required to reduce SO<INF>2 emissions can opt in and make  incremental, lower-cost reductions. Congress envisioned section 410 as  a means of generating additional allowances to reduce compliance costs  for affected utilities and to encourage combustion or process sources  to consider cost-effective emission reduction opportunities:        (Section 410) adds flexibility and can enlarge the universe of  sources for which there are cost-effective reductions in emissions  of SO<INF>2* * *. This section provides a useful additional source  of reductions that can be made voluntarily by sources choosing to be  affected by the provisions of this title. (Senate Committee Report,  Report No. 101-228, December 20, 1989, p. 335.)        The reductions--in the form of acid rain allowances--can be  transferred to meet mandatory reduction requirements in the utility  sector and, thus, lower the overall cost of the Acid Rain Program.  However, Congress also intended that this shifting of SO<INF>2  emissions between opt-in sources and affected utility units not  compromise the overall title IV SO<INF>2 emissions reduction goals.  Section 410 ``is intended to further the objective of achieving true  net reductions of SO<INF>2* * *.'' (Id. at 336.) The Opt-in Program has  been designed to take advantage of lower cost reduction opportunities  at non-affected sources consistent with the statutory requirements of  section 410 of the Act and emissions reductions goals (i.e., the  required 10 million ton reduction of SO<INF>2) of title IV.    3. Summary of Final Rule        The final opt-in regulation for combustion sources details the  process through which combustion sources can enter the Opt-in Program  and the requirements they face while participating. The rule allows any  stationary fossil fuel fired combustion device, i.e., any combustion  source, to become an affected unit and receive allowances. This rule  focuses on combustion sources. The treatment of process sources and  specifically the application and monitoring requirements for process  sources will be addressed in a subsequent rulemaking. The permitting  process finalized in today's rule does pertain to both combustion and  process sources.      Allowance allocations for opt-in sources, as for utility units, are  based on operations during 1985, 1986, and 1987. Like utilities in the  mandatory program, once a combustion source opts in, it must hold  allowances to cover its emissions. Presumably, the opt-in source will  reduce its emissions from its baseline level to generate excess  allowances to sell to other affected units. Because opting in is  voluntary, only combustion sources that would profit by selling excess  allowances are expected to participate in the program. In addition,  since all affected sources must also comply with the other applicable  requirements of the Act, revenue generated by selling excess allowances  could help opt-in sources to offset costs of compliance with other  programs.      Although EPA has attempted to treat opt-in sources comparably to  utility units in the mandatory Acid Rain Program, there are some  situations where restrictions on opt-in sources are needed to protect  the emission goals of the Act. In section 410(f), Congress expressly  prohibits opt-in sources from transferring allowances that result when  they reduce utilization or shut down. Without this prohibition, an  individual opt-in source could increase overall emissions by shifting  some or all of its production from the opt-in source to new or existing  non-affected sources, accumulating the opt-in source's unused  allowances, and then selling them to other affected sources.     In order to ensure the surrender of allowances in cases of reduced  utilization and shutdown, EPA reserves the right to cancel allowances  produced by reduced utilization or shutdown by removing them from any  Allowance Tracking System (ATS) accounts into which they had been  transferred. To facilitate this prospect of cancellation and to protect  buyers of opt-in allowances, EPA is restricting the transfer of future  year allowances. In the final rule, EPA continues to allocate  allowances, in perpetuity, upon application, but is prohibiting the  transfer of future year allowances from opt-in unit accounts in the  ATS; only current year or earlier allowances can be transferred. This  policy will eliminate the need to cancel future year allowances in  cases where a unit shuts down and sells all its future year allowances.  Trades involving future year allowances can still be made; however,  delivery of future year allowances to the buyer must wait until the  year for which those allowances are to be used for compliance.     Title IV contains one exception to the overall restriction on optin  allowances generated by reduced utilization and shutdown. When a  ``replacement unit'' replaces thermal energy formerly supplied by an  opt-in source, then the opt-in source may transfer allowances to the  replacement unit to the extent of that replacement, despite the  reduction of utilization at the opt-in source. For purposes of this  thermal energy exception, EPA defines thermal energy to be steam used  in an industrial process, as distinct from steam used to generate  electricity, and bases the calculation of transferable allowances on  the fuel associated with the thermal energy and the allowable emissions  rate at the replacement unit.      Eligible combustion sources may submit applications to EPA, as the  permitting authority in the near term, and to a State or local  permitting authority, once that permitting authority has an Opt-in  Program in place under part 70. Upon receipt of the application, its  evaluation proceeds on two parallel paths will commence: (1) The  procedure for processing an opt-in permit; and (2) the procedure for  evaluating the opt-in [[Page 17102]] source's monitoring plan and  certifying its monitoring systems. After both of these procedures have  been successfully completed, the combustion source may enter the Opt-in  Program.    B. Major Changes Made to the Proposed Rule        Although considerable changes have been made to the language and  structure of the proposed opt-in regulation for combustion sources, the  essential elements of the program remain unchanged and the final rule  is consistent with the regulatory goals discussed in the proposed rule,  which the Agency here reaffirms. The bulk of this preamble details the  major changes that have been made:      Acceptable Data Sources       EPA continues to believe that there is no single reliable data base  that would provide the Agency with quality information on operations  and emissions of potential opt-in sources. Therefore, the Agency must  rely on information supplied by the combustion source in an application  process. In Sec. 74.20(a)(2) of the proposed rule, EPA established a  screen for ensuring that reliable data is submitted to the Agency, by  requiring all data to have been previously submitted to a government  agency.      Today's rule does not require the previous submission of data to a  government agency as a precondition for combustion sources to apply to  enter the Opt-in Program. Instead, EPA will conduct its own evaluation  of the data submitted for the Opt-in Program using its best judgment,  although the burden of proof regarding the data's accuracy will remain  with the applying combustion source. Regardless of whether a state  permitting program is in place and whether the State or EPA is the  permitting authority, EPA will retain this data review authority  consistent with its responsibility for all allowance-related  activities, as discussed in the preamble to the proposed rule.     EPA will lead an evaluation process that brings in the expertise of  state officials as well as other technical data experts. EPA will  retain the authority, consistent with Sec. 72.4 of part 72, to request  any additional documentation, in addition to the formal opt-in permit  application, that it believes is necessary to evaluate the combustion  source's data. Previous submittals to government agencies that are in  existence will be expected to accompany the application. In addition,  EPA may request data for years outside the baseline period, both before  and after, to verify that submitted baseline data does not represent an  inexplicable spike in the combustion source's operations. EPA may also  request additional supporting documentation (e.g., fuel purchasing  records, production rates, throughputs, sampling protocols, etc.) that  the Agency believes necessary to verify the information contained in  the combustion source's opt-in permit application. EPA may, in  addition, make inspections and examine records at the combustion source  applying to enter the Opt-in Program.      Opt-in permit applications submitted by combustion sources with  entries in the National Allowance Data Base (NADB) will still face  scrutiny, and the data values within the NADB will not be accepted  automatically. Such scrutiny and potential revisions are consistent  with previous Agency assertions that the NADB version 2.11 was the  final version to be used in the development of allocations for Phase II  units (see 57 FR 30034 and 58 FR 15721). Combustion sources, by  definition, cannot be Phase II units and were not automatically  allocated allowances under section 405 of the Act. Therefore, the NADB  data for these sources have not been reviewed by EPA to the same extent  as Phase II unit data, and such review has not been precluded by  previous regulatory actions.      The evaluation of data by EPA for the purposes of calculating  allowances is not unprecedented. In developing Phase II unit data in  the NADB, EPA compiled information from a number of sources that  included the Energy Information Administration (EIA), the North  American Electric Reliability Council (NERC), the affected sources,  and, to a lesser extent, states. EPA expects the states to play a  larger role in evaluating industrial operating and emissions data,  because the states are often the best repository of such information  and are aware of the detailed operations of such sources.     Both the applying combustion source and third parties will have  access to and be able to assess the information EPA ultimately accepts  in its allowance calculation. Both the combustion source and third  parties will be able to scrutinize the baseline data and the number of  allocated allowances during the public comment period associated with  the draft opt-in permit. Furthermore, the combustion source has the  opportunity to decline to opt in at any time prior to the effective  date of the opt-in permit. The combustion source can also appeal its  allowance allocation consistent with the procedures prescribed in part  78.      While the information for industrial opt-in sources will be less  readily available, EPA sees no other workable alternative than to  assume the responsibility of examining submitted data on a case-by-case  basis. The Agency recognizes that some incentives will remain for the  combustion source to overstate its baseline for the purposes of  increasing its allowance allocation, but believes that such risks will  be offset by Agency review of the data and supporting documents, the  rejection of insufficiently supported data, and the threat of  enforcement actions and penalties for falsely submitted data. Toward  these ends, EPA will enhance the certification statements that  designated representatives sign when submitting an opt-in permit  application to assure that such submittals (1) are believed to be true,  accurate, and complete; (2) are accompanied by all available  documentation that the combustion source and its state regulatory  agencies possess that are relevant to the accuracy of such data; and  (3) are not adjusted in any way.    2. Allocation of Opt-in Allowances and Transfer Prohibition        In the proposed rule, EPA planned to allocate allowances on a onetime,  in perpetuity basis and allowed for the transfer of current and  future-year opt-in allowances from opt-in accounts into other accounts  in the Allowance Tracking System (ATS). This policy was proposed to  promote fungibility of opt-in allowances and provide combustion sources  flexibility in their compliance planning. However, in order to uphold  the requirements of section 410(f) of the Act, EPA also proposed in  Sec. 74.50 of the proposed rule to reserve the right to cancel, under  certain circumstances, any allowances that were initially allocated to  an opt-in source by removing allowances from any ATS accounts into  which they had been transferred.      Under section 410(f), the Act restricts opt-in sources from  transferring or banking allowances produced as a result of reduced  utilization or shutdown, except as discussed in the proposed rule (58  FR 50103) and later in this preamble under the thermal energy  exception. To uphold this restriction, EPA is requiring opt-in sources  to surrender allowances generated by reduced utilization or shutdown.  In the proposed rule, EPA maintained that in the case where an opt-in  source has shut down, reduced its utilization or has excess emissions,  and fails to supply the equivalent number of allowances owed to EPA  (presumably because the opt-in source has sold all of its future-year  allowances), EPA must recover and cancel the opt-in source's allowances  in [[Page 17103]] the required number from other ATS accounts into  which they were transferred. Canceling opt-in allowances held in other  accounts in the ATS was considered the only way to ensure that such  allowances did not result in additional emissions and that the SO<INF>2  emissions reduction goals of the Acid Rain Program were preserved. EPA  maintained in the proposed rule that the allowance market would account  for the risk of cancellation by asking lower prices for opt-in  allowances and writing protective clauses into sales contracts.     In the final rule, EPA is choosing to allocate allowances, in  perpetuity, at the time the combustion source becomes an affected unit,  but, based on the comments received, is prohibiting the transfer of  future-year opt-in allowances from opt-in source accounts in the  Allowance Tracking System (ATS). Transfers of current-year opt-in  allowances will only be recorded by EPA following the completion of the  end-of-year reconciliation process for the previous compliance year, as  set forth in Sec. 73.34(a) of 40 CFR part 73. If an opt-in source is  found to have excess emissions for a given year, that opt-in source  will be prohibited from transferring the following year's allowances  until an offset plan is approved and allowances have been deducted to  offset its excess emissions.      When an opt-in source permanently shuts down, it may no longer  retain allocated allowances and must surrender to EPA all of its opt-in  allowances starting with the year in which the opt-in source shuts  down. In the case of an opt-in source that has shut down, as opposed to  an opt-in source that is still operating, EPA cannot draw upon futureyear  allowances to offset excess emissions because such allowances have  already been surrendered. Therefore, EPA reserves the right to cancel  opt-in allowances (specifically, allowances for the year for which the  opt-in source has excess emissions and the year in which the opt-in  source shuts down) from any ATS account into which such allowances have  been transferred. Previous year opt-in allowances that had subsequently  been transferred to other ATS accounts would not be canceled because  such allowances were in excess of the number of allowances needed for  compliance in previous years.      EPA retains the option of allowance cancellation to ensure that  opt-in sources through their operations cannot increase emissions to  the environment. EPA believes that the Opt-in Program must be selfenforcing  and should not rely on possible future regulation to  implement the 5.6 million ton cap for industrial sources because of the  reasons discussed in the proposed rule: (1) The incomplete coverage of  the Opt-in Program relative to the industrial sector; (2) the  importance of achieving title IV emission reduction goals by  maintaining the emissions neutrality of the Opt-in Program relative to  historic emission levels (rather than future emission inventory  levels); and (3) the aggregate nature of emission inventories and their  lack of specificity to address emissions and allowance allocations of  individual opt-in sources.      Furthermore, EPA agrees with commenters who believe that most  trades of future-year opt-in allowances will take the form of ``option  contracts,'' e.g., the buyer and seller arrange today for the option to  buy allowances at a future time at a quantity, price, and date set  today. Buyers are more likely to enter into options contracts for  future-year opt-in allowances because, if allowances are canceled, the  buyer only loses the option to buy allowances and not the allowances  themselves, as would be the case with other types of contracts. If  these commenters are correct, then EPA's prohibition of the transfer of  future-year opt-in allowances should not significantly alter expected  market behavior and its treatment of opt-in allowances. In fact,  current allowance market behavior in the utility sector suggests that,  in many cases, a portion of the full price is paid now for future-year  allowances, but the actual transfer of such allowances and payment of  the remaining purchase price will not occur until the allowances become  usable for compliance. Buyers are reluctant to pay full price now for  allowances that cannot be used until a future date.     Although EPA is restricting the transfer of future-year opt-in  allowances, it is allowing the transfer of current-year opt-in  allowances as soon as the end-of-year reconciliation process for the  previous year is completed. (EPA will allow, for the first current  year, the transfer of current-year opt-in allowances upon entry into  the Opt-in Program). EPA believes that current-year opt-in allowances  may play a valuable role in assisting with compliance for the utility  sector and must be available for transfer before the end of the current  year. However, in order to uphold the requirements of section 410(f) of  the Act, EPA reserves the right to cancel current-year opt-in  allowances that have been allocated to the opt-in source in the event  that an opt-in source has excess emissions and has shut down, been  reconstructed, or become affected under Sec. 72.6. EPA believes that  restricting opt-in allowance transfers to current-year allowances will  reduce the likelihood of having to cancel purchased opt-in allowances.  Buyers of current-year opt-in allowances have a much better chance of  accurately assessing the integrity, financial health, and future status  of an opt-in source in a short time frame (i.e., within the current  year) than they would in making an accurate assessment over a longer  time frame (i.e., one extending as long as 31 years into the future).  EPA considered not canceling current-year allowances, but instead using  enforcement actions to try to recover excess opt-in allowances. EPA  rejected this approach because of the concern that if enforcement  actions were unsuccessful in the recovery of excess opt-in allowances,  the clear direction of section 410(f) of the Act would be violated, and  the emission reduction goals of title IV would be compromised.    3. Offering Opt-in Allowances on the Acid Rain Auction        In the proposed rule, EPA prohibited the trading of opt-in  allowances in the Acid Rain auction. EPA is allowing, in the final  rule, the offering of opt-in allowances in the spot auction, provided  the compliance use date of the allowances offered is for a prior year.  Prior year allowances are allowances dated a year or more prior to the  spot auction year. Prior year opt-in allowances will have cleared the  end-of-year compliance process including any possible allowance  cancellations for reduced utilization, as discussed above. EPA is still  prohibiting the submission of offers of current-year opt-in allowances  in the Acid Rain auctions because these allowances have a possibility  of being canceled by EPA in the future. Buyers of current-year opt-in  allowances sold in the auctions have no protection against cancellation  as they would if purchasing opt-in allowances through a private  contract. EPA believes that if there is demand for an auction that  includes current-year opt-in allowances, the private sector will  develop such an outlet.    4. Thermal Energy Exception        Section 410(f) limits the transfer of opt-in allowances when opt-in  sources reduce utilization or shutdown except when the reduced  utilization or shutdown results from the replacement of thermal energy.  EPA received numerous comments on implementing this thermal energy  exception. This section discusses the three main issues associated with  the thermal energy exception:      (a) The definition of thermal energy; [[Page 17104]]      (b) The calculation of transferrable allowances; and     (c) The methodology used to calculate the fuel associated with  thermal energy.  a. Definition of Thermal Energy      In Sec. 72.2 of the proposed rule, EPA defined thermal energy as  the thermal output produced by a combustion source used directly as  part of a manufacturing process but not used to produce electricity.  EPA received 29 comments on the definition of thermal energy.     Seventeen commenters disagreed with the proposed definition and  argued that the thermal energy definition should include electrical  output in addition to steam output. Several commenters argued that EPA  has no statutory basis in section 410(f) to define thermal energy to  include only steam output because the statute does not specifically  cite the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act (PURPA) definition of  thermal energy used by the Agency in the proposed rule. Commenters also  maintained that the legislative history does not support a limited  definition. Lastly, commenters pointed out that because section 410(f)  refers to the term ``unit'' that by definition does not distinguish  between facilities that produce steam for generating electrical energy  and those that produce steam for direct sale, the definition of thermal  energy should not make such a distinction.     One commenter argued that thermal energy means ``heat'' and that  the facilities affected by the Act are combustion units that produce  heat, which sometimes is used to drive a turbine to create electricity  and sometimes is used to create steam. Several other commenters noted  that the proposed definition fails to take into account the integrated  nature of many industrial facilities and does not consider how  difficult it may be to determine how the thermal energy is allocated  between steam and electricity.      In addition, a number of commenters believed that in developing the  thermal energy definition, EPA ignored the intent of Congress to allow  small electric generating units the opportunity to opt in, retire their  older units, and transfer allowances to replacement sources.     Four commenters stated that EPA's proposed opt-in rule is  inconsistent with the views stated in the ``Dover Letter,'' sent to  SFT, Inc. on March 7, 1991. The commenters contended that a  representative from EPA's Office of Atmospheric and Indoor Air Programs  stated that the City of Dover would be allowed to opt in its exempt  boilers used to generate electricity under section 410 of title IV and  then transfer the allowances received to a new, replacement boiler. The  commenters argued that EPA should uphold its original views and allow  electric units to opt in. One commenter, however, recognized that this  ``Dover Letter'' was not a legally enforceable, binding statement of  law.      Three commenters supported EPA's definition of thermal energy based  on the argument that if electricity is included in the definition, the  total number of permanent allowances and associated emissions would  increase above what is permitted under title IV. These commenters also  argue that the Act draws a clear distinction between thermal energy and  the energy used for the generation of electric power and thus, small  electricity generators should not be considered beneficiaries of the  thermal replacement energy exemption.      Response: As stated in the preamble to the proposed rule (58 FR  50087), EPA believes defining thermal energy as the steam output used  directly as part of a manufacturing process but not used to produce  electricity is consistent with the Congressional intent and goals of  title IV and section 410. For the reasons set forth in the preamble to  the proposed rule, the final rule retains the definition of thermal  energy as proposed and limits thermal energy to the steam output used  directly in a manufacturing process but not used to produce  electricity.      EPA continues to believe that Congress selected the term thermal  energy precisely to distinguish between electric energy and thermal  energy used in manufacturing processes. If Congress had intended  thermal energy to mean total energy, which includes electricity, then  it would have had no need to use the term ``thermal'' at all.  Furthermore, EPA disagrees with those commenters who claimed that  because Congress did not specifically cite the PURPA definition of  thermal energy in title IV it is inappropriate to use that definition.  With no definition specifically provided in the statute, limited  legislative history, and no evidence that Congress intended otherwise,  EPA believes that using the PURPA definition is appropriate since it  provides a long standing, accepted meaning of the term within the  federal regulatory framework governing industrial steam production and  electrical generation.      Some commenters argued that because section 410(f) uses the term  ``unit'', Congress did not intend to distinguish between sources that  produce steam for generating electricity and those that produce steam  for direct sale. However, EPA believes that the term ``unit'' as used  in section 410(f) provides no basis for defining ``thermal energy'',  but rather the term ``unit'' is used in section 410(f) only to limit  the transfer of allowances under the thermal energy exception to  affected units (i.e., ``any other unit or units subject to the  requirements of this title.'')      EPA stated in the so called ``Dover Letter'' that its response to  the City of Dover was based on preliminary assessments of the language  in title IV and was subject to modification in the final EPA  regulations:        Below are EPA's comments based on the language in Title IV of  the Act. You should be aware, however, that the views expressed in  this letter are based on our preliminary assessments and could be  modified in the final EPA regulations. (March 7, 1991 letter from  Eileen Claussen to Tom Fitzpatrick).        By its own terms, the March 7, 1991 letter did not provide  guidance, much less a statutory interpretation or an applicability  determination for the units in question, that could be relied upon. In  fact, the March 7, 1991 letter indicated that this was a preliminary  views based only on the statutory language itself and did not indicate  that any other material relevant to statutory interpretation (such as  legislative history) had been considered. Several months thereafter,  EPA sent a retraction letter on January 7, 1992 to the City of Dover  reiterating that EPA's response in the March 7, 1991 letter was  preliminary and that the Agency was reconsidering the legal and  analytic basis of the position it had taken in the March 7, 1991  letter.      Lastly, EPA recognizes the integrated nature of some industrial  cogeneration facilities but maintains, as confirmed by historic  industrial reporting, that steam and electrical outputs are observable  and measurable quantities.  b. Emission Rate Used To Calculate Transferable Allowances     To calculate the number of allowances that can be transferred from  the opt-in source to a replacement unit under the thermal energy  exception, EPA proposed, under Sec. 74.47(b)(4), to use the lesser of  the federally enforceable allowable emission rate at the replacement  unit or 1.2 lbs/mmBtu. EPA received eighteen comments on this issue  with no commenters supporting the 1.2 lbs/mmBtu emission rate cap as  proposed, and six commenters supporting the use of the replacement  unit's emission rate. Two commenters contended that the proposed 1.2  lbs/mmBtu emission rate is excessively high given that emission  [[Page 17105]] rates at replacement units are likely to be much lower.     Fifteen commenters objected to EPA's proposal of a 1.2 lbs/mmBtu  emission rate limit as too restrictive. These commenters argued that  the use of the 1.2 lbs/mmBtu emission rate is arbitrary and not  supported by the statute where the replacement unit's emission rate is  higher. They also pointed out that the proposed restriction does not  recognize all possible replacement units (e.g., existing units) and  would unjustifiably restrict allowance transfer during Phase I when the  emission rate could be 2.5 lbs/mmBtu.      Response: After further consideration, EPA is eliminating the 1.2  lbs/mmBtu emission rate restriction used to calculate the number of  allowances that can be transferred to the replacement unit under the  thermal energy exception. Today's rule uses the federally enforceable  emission rate at the replacement unit to calculate the number of  transferable allowances.      The rule was changed because EPA agrees with the comments that the  use of the 1.2 lbs/mmBtu does not recognize the different emission  rates at potential replacement units, some of which may be existing  units. In the preamble to the proposed rule, EPA argued that applying a  1.2 lbs/mmBtu rate is consistent with the requirements for Phase II  units. However, since a replacement unit can be any affected unit, the  universe of replacement units would include Phase I units with 2.5 lbs/ mmBtu rates and other opt-in sources with emission rates that could be  even higher. Given that these potential replacement units could have  higher rates and that the statute does not set a limit for the emission  rate, EPA believes there is no basis for restricting the emission rate  to 1.2 lbs/mmBtu.  c. Methodology Revision for Calculating the Fuel Associated with  Thermal Energy      In Sec. 74.47(b) of the proposed rule, EPA required that  replacement units calculate the fuel associated with thermal energy by  dividing the amount of qualifying thermal energy (that is, the  replacement thermal energy) by the efficiency associated with the  production of thermal energy. EPA received several comments related to  this issue.      One commenter suggested that all units of fuel used should be  attributable to a unit's steam output because it is not practical to  identify a thermal energy fuel increment (used to determine the  allowance transfer) and because there is no established method for  doing so.      Several commenters offered alternative formulas for calculating the  transferable allowances. One suggested that EPA calculate the number of  transferable allowances as the product of the ``useful thermal energy  output'' of the replacement unit, as defined under PURPA, and the  difference between the opt-in source's emission factor and the  replacement unit's emission factor. This commenter contended that this  will encourage more efficient cogeneration applications. Another  suggested that EPA compute the number of transferable allowances by  evaluating the portion of an opt-in source's historic thermal energy  that is replaced by a cogeneration facility, rather than the portion of  the cogeneration facility's energy output that is thermal energy. Other  commenters recommended that EPA include provisions that provide an  incentive to undertake energy efficiency gains at the replacement unit.  The number of transferable allowances should be based on the  replacement unit's emission rate taking into consideration any  efficiency differences in steam production at the opt-in source and at  the replacement unit.      Response: Based on the comments received, EPA is changing the  methodology for calculating the fuel associated with qualifying thermal  energy as discussed under Sec. 74.47. In today's rule, EPA allows optin  sources to use an efficiency constant when calculating fuel input  from thermal output to give them an incentive to make their production  processes more efficient.      EPA has chosen to make the calculation of transferred allowances  based on a constant value rather than having replacement units  calculate fuel utilization each year because relying on actual fuel  utilization would discourage improvements in efficiency. By using a  constant, a replacement unit that increases its efficiency will use  less fuel to produce the same amount of thermal output, but will still  have transferred to it the same number of allowances as before the  efficiency improvement. In contrast, calculating the fuel utilization  each year would reduce the incentives for efficiency improvements. This  will be true for either boilers or cogenerators.     The efficiency constants selected represent the fuel utilization of  the boiler or cogenerator supplying the replacement steam. Fuel  utilization represents the quotient of all energy outputs and the  energy content of total fuel input. The Agency distinguishes between  boilers and cogenerators in establishing these constants to recognize  the greater energy requirements necessary to produce electricity as  opposed to producing steam. It would be unfair to compare the  efficiency of cogenerators producing electricity and/or steam with the  efficiency of boilers producing only steam, because the production of  electricity inherently requires more fuel. In today's rule, the Agency  sets the efficiency constant for boilers to be 0.85 and the efficiency  constant for cogenerators to be 0.80. These constants represent  industry averages for modern equipment (see memorandum in the docket  entitled, ``Evaluation of EPA's Revised Methodology for Calculating the  Transferred Allowances under the Thermal Energy Exception'').     For boilers serving as replacement units, the attribution of fuel  associated with thermal energy is straightforward. However, for  cogenerators, it is very difficult to distinguish between the fuel  going towards steam or electricity, because the production of the two  is tightly linked. Using fuel utilization implies that both the fuel  input and the efficiency losses associated with the production of each  product is proportional to the amount of each product produced.     EPA specifically defines thermal energy to consist of only steam  and this definition does not include electricity (see previous  discussion of thermal energy definition). In calculating allowances  transferred under the thermal energy exception, EPA must distinguish  between the fuel used to produce electricity and the fuel used to  produce thermal output. The former does not count toward the thermal  energy exception, while the latter does. Therefore, EPA does not  believe it is appropriate or consistent with the statutory provisions  in section 410(f) to attribute all fuel input to steam production,  where, in fact, both steam and electricity are being produced.     EPA believes its revised methodology addresses the concerns of  commenters seeking to instill incentives for cogeneration and  specifically relying on the amount of thermal energy replaced. The  alternative suggestion of basing allowance calculations on energy  output is inconsistent with all other allowance calculations found in  the Acid Rain Program. Allowances for utility units in the Acid Rain  Program are generally calculated as a product of a fuel input baseline,  expressed in mmBtu, and an emission rate, expressed in lbs. per mmBtu  of fuel input. An allowance calculation where emission rates,  reflecting energy input, are multiplied by the thermal energy replaced,  reflecting energy output, would be internally inconsistent. The revised  methodology, therefore, remains [[Page 17106]] consistent with  allowance calculations in the core utility program.    C. Other Significant Changes Made to the Proposed Rule      Ineligibility of Non-operating and Retired Units       EPA continues to require that combustion sources seeking to enter  the Opt-in Program be operating at the time of application. Combustion  sources opting in under the thermal energy exception are also required  to be in operation, although they can shut down upon entry into the  program.      EPA seeks to restrict the allocation and use of opt-in allowances  to instances in which real emissions reductions will take place, and  not to award allowances in situations of reduced utilization and shut  down. EPA believes that this requirement to be operating at the time of  application is consistent with this principle. The provision  establishing such a requirement provides a clear criteria for assessing  whether a combustion source has reduced its utilization or shut down  (i.e. is not operating) for the purposes of accepting the combustion  source into the program and allocating allowances.     In the final rule, EPA establishes a definition of operating  strictly for the purposes of the Opt-in Program. Operating is defined  to mean the documented consumption of fuel input for more than 876  hours in the 6 months immediately preceding application. This level of  operating hours was selected because it serves as the upper bound of a  peaking unit, that is, 20 percent capacity factor in any calendar year  as defined in Sec. 72.2. The Agency kept the 20 percent operating  level, but shortened the period of time from one year to six months so  that a combustion source could be idle at most approximately four and  one half months, rather than twice that amount of time and still be  eligible to opt in. EPA expects that combustion sources operating below  the 20 percent level would have little interest in participating in the  Opt-in Program because the number of allowances freed up from emission  reductions would be small and unlikely to cover the costs of opt-in  participation.      Whether or not they were operating at the time of application,  combustion sources that operated in the 1985-1987 time period would  have the necessary data to determine an allocation of opt-in  allowances. However, a combustion source that was not operating at the  time of application would have all or virtually all of its allowances  deducted under the reduced utilization and shutdown provisions. EPA  does not believe it is reasonable or administratively practical to  grant these opt-in sources allowances and then, from the first year on,  take virtually all of them away.      If a combustion source is shut down but plans to restart its  operations, EPA believes that the combustion source should apply to opt  in upon restart, that is where there is proof that the combustion  source is now operating consistent with the above definition.  Furthermore, the allowance allocation for opt-in sources that restart  would be based on any current allowable SO<INF>2 emissions rate in  effect at the time of application.      As discussed under the thermal energy exception, non-operating optin  sources may transfer allowances to replacement units, to the extent  that such units can document the replacement of thermal energy. In  allowing non-operating sources to participate in the thermal energy  exception, but excluding non-operating sources from applying to opt in,  the Agency requires that even combustion sources planning to shut down  upon entry be operating upon application. The Agency believes a valid  distinction exists between replacement arrangements made in response to  the Opt-in Program and those that preceded the application to enter the  program.      The reason why the combustion source is not operating at the time  of application is not relevant to the Agency's determination of whether  a retired or non-operating source should be permitted to opt into the  Acid Rain Program. Allocating allowances to a retired or non-operating  combustion source and allowing the source to trade such allowances  would, in effect, allow another source to emit what the retired or nonoperating  combustion source was emitting before it ceased operations.  These allowances would thus result in more pollution being released  into the environment. As discussed in the preamble to the proposed  rule, Congress expected the SO<INF>2 emissions from non-utility sources  to remain at a constant level and to reflect a dynamic balancing of  emissions caused by fluctuations in economic activity, shutdowns,  facility modernization, fuel switching, and cleanup. By granting  sources not operating at the time of application the ability to opt-in  and receive allowances, EPA would increase emissions above the presumed  constant level of non-utility emissions.    2. Interpretation of Shutdown, Modification and Reconstruction        In the proposed rule, EPA sought to distinguish the modification of  an opt-in source from its outright replacement. EPA recognizes that  opt-in sources may need to make changes to their facilities in order to  reduce emissions. Here, EPA attempts to address the extreme case in  which such changes represent the construction of an essentially ``new''  facility. EPA proposed to consider an opt-in source ``shut down'' in  the circumstance in which the opt-in source had been modified to such a  large extent that the opt-in source no longer existed and a new one had  been put in its place (in the extreme, the construction of a new  facility within the shell of the old one). EPA chose as its test for  replacement the reconstruction standard established in 40 CFR 60.15, as  discussed in the preamble to the proposed rule.     EPA maintains that a new facility constructed in the shell of an  older one should not retain the allowances allocated to the original  opt-in source and should be removed from the Opt-in Program. Such  restrictions are consistent with section 410(f) of the Act in  implementing both the reduced utilization provisions as well as the  thermal energy exception. The Agency believes its use of the regulatory  term ``reconstruction'' and its threshold of 50 percent of what would  be required to construct a new comparable facility is entirely  appropriate in this context, and therefore the Agency applies this  standard for reconstruction from 40 CFR 60.15 to opt-in sources. One  commenter correctly acknowledged that the 50 percent criterion would  apply to improvements to the facility as a whole; however, EPA disputes  the notion that the level of investment would prohibit facility  improvements to reduce emissions or would restrict alternatives to  strictly end-of-pipe options. EPA believes that this level of  expenditure is sufficiently high to allow sources great flexibility in  their choice of control options.      EPA modifies in the final rule the regulatory language that would  exclude reconstructed units from maintaining their status as opt-in  sources. Instead of considering such units as ``shutdown'', the rule  explicitly dismisses such units from the program in cases of  reconstruction. The effect on sources undergoing modifications  qualifying as reconstruction remains the same.     To exclude from consideration the reconstruction of any equipment  with equipment that performs the same or similar function would  circumvent the [[Page 17107]] need to remove allowances from sources  that are no longer in operation. As discussed previously, emissions  from these sources are assumed to disappear, consistent with the  Congressionally assumed constant level of industrial emissions, and  opt-in allowances are assumed to be generated from emission reductions  at the opt-in source. The Opt-in Program should not perpetuate  emissions from old to new sources, or in this case, from old to  reconstructed sources.      The increase in productive capacity at opt-in sources is relevant  only to the extent that such investments would trigger a determination  of reconstruction. Finally, the use of the definition of major  modification to distinguish between reconstructed units and existing  opt-in sources is also not appropriate. If a modification is a major  modification because a source achieves a significant increase in a  regulated pollutant, the source's permitting levels may change, but  such changes would not affect its opt-in permit or its allowance  levels, provided that such modifications do not also exceed the  threshold for reconstruction.      In the context of the Opt-in Program, a reconstructed opt-in source  will not be permitted to enter or remain in the Opt-in Program at its  pre-reconstruction baseline and allowance allocation. Should the  reconstructed and former opt-in source wish to enter the Opt-in  Program, after modifications have been completed, it may do so, once it  establishes a three-year alternative baseline. Other regulatory  programs, including the non-attainment and Prevention of Significant  Deterioration (PSD) programs, may or may not consider the reconstructed  opt-in source as a ``new'' source; nevertheless, units undergoing  reconstruction will have their allowances deducted and their opt-in  permits terminated. Units that do not exceed the level of  reconstruction and remain in the Opt-in Program may or may not be  subject to New Source Review (NSR) or the New Source Performance  Standards (NSPS) but applicability under these programs is independent  from participation in the Opt-in Program.    3. Incorporation of Efficiency Measures        Under Sec. 74.44 of the proposed regulation, the only efficiency  improvements that would be credited toward utilization were  improvements that reduced the demand for electricity or that made  electricity generation more efficient. Improvements in the efficiency  of steam production, measures to reduce steam load (i.e., steam  conservation measures), and sulfur-free generation as defined in  Sec. 72.2 were not included.      The final rule allows for efficiency improvements to be  incorporated in an opt-in source's annual utilization. Efficiency  improvements include any expected reduction in the heat rate at the  opt-in source, any expected improvement in the efficiency of steam  production at the opt-in source, and any kilowatt hour savings or steam  savings from demand side measures.      EPA agrees that improvements in the efficiency of steam generation  should be encouraged. EPA believes that some restrictions are  necessary, however, because cogeneration facilities could shift their  output to steam while decreasing the efficiency of electricity  generation. Such shifts from electricity to steam should not result in  an adjusted increase in utilization and hence in allowances retained.     In order to prevent such shifts from occurring, today's rule  requires that the heat rate at an opt-in source not increase in order  to claim an efficiency improvement in steam production. If the heat  rate increases, that is, if electricity generation becomes less  efficient, no credit for gains in the efficiency of steam production  will be given towards utilization. The methodology for quantifying this  adjustment to utilization from efficiency increases in steam production  will be developed by EPA, working with interested opt-in sources.     EPA also agrees that reductions in steam load created by demand  side measures that improve the efficiency of steam consumption should  be encouraged. EPA is concerned about the identification of such  measures and their verifiable contribution towards using steam more  efficiently. The burden for documenting such measures is on the opt-in  source, which must be able to demonstrate that the reduction in  utilization from a steam conservation measure is different than  reductions in utilization not related to conservation improvements.     Finally, EPA also believes that opt-in sources should be encouraged  to pursue opportunities to increase their use of sulfur-free  technologies at their facilities. However, EPA maintains that such  technologies are already included in the provisions providing credit  for demand-side measures (see Appendix A, Section 1 of part 73 of this  chapter which includes sulfur-free technologies in a list of examples  of demand-side measures).      EPA does not include, however, a separate provision for ``sulfurfree  generation'' in the utilization adjustment, because the term, as  defined in Sec. 72.2 of this chapter and used in Sec. 72.91, includes  all sulfur-free generators in the utility's system. For opt-in sources,  EPA restricts adjustments to utilization for improved efficiency to  measures performed at the opt-in source itself or by the ``customers''  of the opt-in source (i.e., electricity or steam users of the opt-in  source). The Agency does not include ``sulfur-free generation'',  because of concerns of replacing the opt-in source's utilization  without any thermal energy transfer, as required by section 410(f).    4. Expiration of a Non-Effective Opt-in Permit        The proposed rule created an effective date for an opt-in permit to  be the later of the issuance of the opt-in permit by the permitting  authority or the completion of the certification of the combustion  source's monitoring systems. However, no time period was specified  regarding the length of time between the issuance of the opt-in permit  and these certifications. One commenter requested clarification about  this time period and whether or not the opt-in permit would expire  before becoming effective.      Response: EPA establishes, in the final rule, an expiration date  associated with a non-effective opt-in permit. An opt-in permit will  expire 180 days after issuance, if it has not yet become effective. The  length of 180 days was selected because the time period incorporates  the duration of EPA's review of monitoring certification for the  combustion source's CEM systems and two months for the combustion  source to arrange testing, should the combustion source wish to wait to  certify its monitors until the end of the permitting process.     EPA believes that an expiration date is important to prevent  combustion sources from seeking a permit with no immediate intention to  opt into the Acid Rain program. A combustion source might apply early  to enter the Opt-in Program, but wait to make its permit effective in  order to secure an allowance allocation based on its current emissions  rate at the time of application. If the combustion source faced the  possibility of an impending emission limit that would lower its  allowable emissions rate, the combustion source could apply and then  wait to install its monitors and undertake its emission reductions. In  effect, the combustion source would be seeking to capitalize on  emission reductions it would be required to make based on other  regulatory requirements.      EPA sees no reason to allow for an extended period of time during  which a [[Page 17108]] combustion source can secure its allowance  allocation and keep its application pending. EPA wants its applicants  to be serious about entering the Opt-in Program and is concerned about  behavior that would lead combustion sources to seek an opt-in permit  and secure an allowance allocation because of the prospect of future,  more stringent emission limitations. In addition, EPA does not want to  waste administrative resources in reviewing applications and processing  permits for combustion sources that are not ready to participate in the  program and may or may not actually opt in. The Agency believes that  the time period for the entire permit process plus the 180 days added  here, a total of up to 24 months, is sufficiently long for the  combustion source to install and certify its monitors considering that  the combustion source must submit upon application a monitoring plan,  detailing both the monitors' configuration and equipment. EPA may  extend this time period of 180 days, if the applying combustion source  can show that despite good faith effort towards certifying its  monitors, it was unable to complete such certifications within this  time frame.    5. Miscellaneous Issues    a. Opt-in Permitting      As discussed in the preamble to the proposed rule (58 FR 50096),  the permitting procedures for opt-in sources had been designed to  follow the approaches set forth at parts 70 and 72. EPA has found it  necessary, however, to modify the permitting procedures in the proposed  opt-in regulation to handle inconsistencies between the proposal and  parts 70 and 72, some of which were noted by commenters or became  evident in permitting Phase I units and establishing part 70 permitting  programs. These relatively minor changes in the final rule make the  permitting process conform better with the process used to permit  utility units affected under the Acid Rain Program.     Of the changes made to improve the regulatory language implementing  the opt-in permitting process, a few are worthy of further explanation.  First, the roles of the Administrator and the permitting authority have  been clarified. Although the Administrator retains an important role in  developing an opt-in source's allowance allocation for the combustion  source's opt-in permit, the permitting authority has a greater role in  the final rule in developing the opt-in permit than was suggested in  the proposed regulatory language. Secondly, the time frame under which  the State as permitting authority has to process an opt-in permit has  been made consistent with part 70. In the final rule, the State has 18  months from the receipt of a complete opt-in permit application or such  lesser time as approved under part 70. The proposed regulatory language  could have been interpreted to require a permitting decision within 12  months.      There are several other specific changes that relate to opt-in  permitting. One concerns the submission of a compliance plan as  provided under Sec. 72.40. The opt-in compliance plan must include an  explicit commitment on the part of the designated representative to  hold allowances in the opt-in source's compliance subaccount equal to  or greater than the amount of sulfur dioxide emissions emitted during  that year. Another concerns the term of an opt-in permit. Opt-in  permits issued prior to January 1, 2000 will expire on December 31,  1999. Opt-in permits issued after January 1, 2000 will have a term of 5  years. Further, a provision has been added to Sec. 74.40 to facilitate  the opening of opt-in unit accounts. The designated representative of  an opt-in source shall request the opening of such an account in the  Allowance Tracking System once its permit is final and effective. In  addition, the rule language is clarified concerning the deduction of  allowances in the circumstances of withdrawal, shutdown,  reconstruction, or change in source's status as unaffected under the  mandatory portion of the Acid Rain Program.     EPA neglected to explicitly discuss the permit revision and renewal  procedures in the proposed opt-in regulations and includes such  language in the final rule. Permit revision procedures follow  procedures set forth in subpart H of part 72. The opt-in regulation,  part 74, reserves for the permitting authority the preparation of  permit revisions and the implementation of such revisions.     Opt-in sources may renew their opt-in permits through the same  process in which the opt-in permits were initially issued, except that  the permitting authority shall not alter an opt-in source's allowance  allocation when issuing a renewal of an opt-in permit. EPA believes  that assurance of a consistent stream of opt-in allowances is essential  to a viable Opt-in Program. Without a consistent stream of allowances,  opt-in sources are unable to plan for future-year compliance, and  purchasers of opt-in allowances will be hesitant to enter into forward  or futures contracts because of the risk that the allowances may not be  available.      EPA also seeks to clarify the relationship of title V and a  combustion source's ability to enter the Opt-in Program. Specifically,  commenters inquired whether a combustion source must hold a title V  permit to be an opt-in source. Another commenter explored the  possibility for a mobile source, i.e. a locomotive, to be eligible to  opt into the Acid Rain Program.      Consistent with title V of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments and  regulations promulgated in part 70, all affected sources are considered  part 70 sources and therefore are required to meet the permitting  requirements under title V. The statute, under section 502(a), makes  unlawful ``the operation of an affected source (as provided in title  IV) * * * except in compliance with a permit issued by a permitting  authority under (title V).'' Opt-in sources are electing to become  affected units and, therefore, are included as affected sources under  the Acid Rain Program and in title V (see 42 U.S.C. 7651a(1)).  Therefore, all opt-in sources must obtain title V permits.     Particularly in light of the obligation for an affected unit to  hold a title V permit, nonstationary sources are excluded from entering  the Opt-in Program. Title V expressly applies only to stationary  sources (see 42 U.S.C. 7402(a)). Consistent with this statutory  provision, the Acid Rain regulations define ``source'' in a way that  refers only to stationary sources: ``Source means any * * * structure,  installation, plant, building or facility * * *.'' Consequently,  affected units, which must be located at affected sources, also must be  stationary. Locomotives, therefore, will not be accepted as potential  opt-in sources. EPA has modified the definition of the term  ``combustion source'' to include the explicit requirement that  combustion sources be stationary sources. b. Clarification of Eligible Combustion Sources     The EPA will not require an official applicability determination,  as discussed under Sec. 72.6(c), for a combustion source applying to  opt into the Acid Rain Program, but the Agency will affirm as part of  its review of the opt-in permit application that the combustion source  is indeed unaffected and therefore eligible to opt in. Combustion  sources should be aware, as detailed in the recently published  applicability guidance, ``Do the Acid Rain SO<INF>2 Regulations Apply  to You?'' (EPA 430-R-94-002), that units may be required to provide  documentation supporting their unaffected status. Furthermore, that  status may, in fact, change over time as certain unaffected units  become affected under particular [[Page 17109]] operating or  construction conditions. As stated in the final rule under  Sec. 74.50(a)(3), should an opt-in source become an affected unit, the  Administrator will terminate the opt-in source's opt-in permit and  deduct all of the allowances allocated under the Opt-in Program for  current and future years.      It is the duty of the combustion source's owner and operator to  meet the requirements of the Acid Rain Program if the combustion source  becomes affected. For purposes of keeping combustion sources aware of  their regulatory status, EPA will add certification statements both to  the opt-in permit application and to an opt-in source's annual  compliance certification report that will state that the opt-in source  is only considered an affected unit under part 74 and not an affected  utility unit under Sec. 72.6.      Finally, commenters requested clarification on the eligibility of  certain types of sources and sources located outside of the continental  U.S. Although the proposed rule was ambiguous regarding the eligibility  of unaffected municipal waste combustors, the final rule allows such  combustors to be eligible to apply for the Opt-in Program provided that  they qualify as a ``unit'' and burn some amount of fossil fuel.  Combustion and process sources that are located outside the continental  U.S. (e.g., in Alaska or Hawaii) are not eligible to opt in and the  applicability provisions in Sec. 74.2 have been modified to reflect  this prohibition.  c. Modification to Utilization Calculation     As discussed in the proposed rule under Sec. 74.44, EPA selected an  average utilization to compare against the baseline for making  determinations of reduced utilization. This average utilization was  calculated as a rolling average of fuel input over three years.     Four commenters agreed with EPA's proposal to use a three-year  rolling average for determining reduced utilization because such an  approach would smooth out the peaks and valleys that may occur in steam  generation from year to year. Two commenters disagreed with EPA's  proposal. One suggests that EPA use a five- to eight-year averaging  period in order to account for normal economic cycles. The second  commenter believed that an average over multiple years would bias the  determination of reduced utilization, awarding unnecessary allowances  in individual years when emissions could be low or near zero. The  commenter suggested that EPA should use annual data because annual  SO<INF>2 emissions are proportional to annual fuel use.     Response: EPA will keep its calculation of average utilization  overall, but will modify its calculation for the first and second years  in which the opt-in source participates in the program and for the  first and second years in which the opt-in source is governed by a  thermal energy plan. Average utilization for the first year will equal  the fuel input of that year. Average utilization for the second year  will equal the average of the first two years. Thereafter, average  utilization will be as proposed and equal a rolling average of three  years.      EPA believes the purpose of using a three-year rolling average to  determine whether an opt-in source has reduced its utilization remains  the same and remains valid: namely, as the commenters recognize, to  smooth out small fluctuations in the operation of opt-in sources. The  three-year interval is consistent with the baseline period and provides  for a more accurate comparison with the baseline as a measure of  utilization than would longer intervals.     EPA modifies its calculation of average utilization for the first  two years described above to address possible bias. With regard to the  calculation of average utilization outside the context of a thermal  energy plan, the Agency notes that in the proposed rule (58 FR 50124),  the average for the first two years was based on the baseline level of  utilization rather than actual utilization of the opt-in source. With  such a methodology, an opt-in source that consistently operates below  its baseline level could calculate an artificially high average  utilization for its first two years as an opt-in source and thereby  avoid allowance surrender. EPA feels that such a windfall would be  inappropriate and that the methodology could create the potential for  abuse. Therefore, EPA bases average utilization in these first two  years on actual utilization for the opt-in source in the first year and  then the first two years.      With regard to the calculation of average utilization once an optin  source becomes governed by a thermal energy plan, EPA believes that  the use of a continuing three-year average for the first two years  under the plan would distort the number of allowances retained by the  opt-in source. The reasoning for modifying the average utilization  calculation is similar. Rather than reflecting normal fluctuations in  the operation of the opt-in source whose thermal energy has been  replaced, the three-year average utilization calculated for the first  two years under the plan would award allowances based on the opt-in  source's prereplacement levels of utilization and could result in an  allowance windfall. Therefore, EPA bases average utilization for the  two years immediately after the thermal energy plan takes effect on the  actual utilization for the first year and then the average for the  first two years.  d. Efficiency Adjustments for an Opt-in Source Governed by a Thermal  Energy Plan      EPA clarifies an ambiguity in the proposed rule regarding allowance  holdings among an opt-in source and its replacement units if the opt-in  source claims efficiency improvements as part of its annual  utilization. If the opt-in source has estimated efficiency improvements  in its annual utilization and these estimates prove to be incorrect,  EPA could be placed in the position of adjusting not only the allowance  holdings of the opt-in source, but also the holdings of all replacement  units after the reconciliation process has ended (recall that annual  compliance reports are submitted in March, while confirmation of energy  efficiency estimates are not submitted until July). In order to avoid  reassessing the compliance of perhaps multiple replacement units, EPA  will consider the number of allowances transferred to replacement units  fixed after the reconciliation process has ended and rely on the opt-in  source to surrender any additional allowances needed to make the  accounting consistent with the confirmed efficiency estimates. EPA  maintains that it is reasonable for the opt-in source, which made the  initial efficiency estimates, to bear the allowance consequences of  correcting those estimates.  e. Definitions      EPA has found it useful to modify certain definitions and to  explain certain terms applicable to the Opt-in Program to make its  provisions clearer. Consistent with the procedures established in part  72 subpart B and referenced in Sec. 74.4, the owners and operators of a  combustion or process source seeking to opt into the Acid Rain Program  must select a designated representative. This designated representative  is charged with representing the combustion or process source with  regards to all matters under the Acid Rain Program. However, during the  opt-in permit application process, the combustion or process source is  not yet an affected unit nor an affected source, and strictly speaking,  may not have a designated representative under the existing definition  in Sec. 72.2. [[Page 17110]]       The Agency amends the definition of designated representative in  Sec. 72.2 to include a responsible person authorized by the owners and  operators of a combustion or process source as a designated  representative. This individual has the same role and responsibilities  as designated representatives for units affected under the other  provisions of title IV and must complete a Certification of  Representation as specified in Sec. 72.24. The Certification of  Representation should be submitted prior to or concurrent with the optin  permit application. Further, the definitions of owner and owner or  operator have been modified to include the appropriate individuals at  combustion and process sources.      In addition, the definition of affected unit has been clarified to  include units covered under Sec. 72.6 and part 74 of this chapter to be  subject to the Acid Rain emissions reduction requirements or the Acid  Rain emissions limitations. EPA also has clarified the usage of the  terms ``combustion source'' and ``opt-in source'' because of confusion  expressed by individual commenters on the proposed rule. Prior to  entering the Opt-in Program, the entity wishing to opt-in is referred  to, in the final rule, as a combustion source or a process source, as  appropriate. Once in the Opt-in Program, the combustion source becomes  an opt-in source and is referred to as such throughout the remainder of  the rule. An opt-in source is an affected unit under the Acid Rain  Program.      Finally, in the preamble to the proposed rule, Table 2 was in error  regarding the definition of the opt-in source in various circumstances.  The revised Table 2 is as follows:                                                                            Type of configuration                              What is the opt-in    emitting to single                                                       stack.                                                                   boilers sharing single   to the opt-in source.                           stack.                                                                   sharing single stack.                             appropriate duct.*     emitting to multiple                                                     stacks.                                                                  sharing multiple                                  appropriate ducts.*    stacks.                                                                  affected units sharing                            and its appropriate    single/multiple stacks.                           ducts.*                 75.16 in particular of the Acid Rain Program.

ACTION: Notice.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  SUMMARY: EPA today announces the allocation of allowances to small  diesel refineries for desulfurization of fuel during 1998. The  eligibility for and calculation of allowances to small diesel  refineries is in accordance with section 410(h) of the Clean Air Act,  implemented at 40 CFR part 73, subpart G.  FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Kenon Smith, EPA Acid Rain Division  (6204J), 401 M St., SW, Washington DC; telephone (202) 564-9164.  SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:     EPA's Acid Rain Program was established by Title IV of the Clean  Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA) to reduce acid rain in the  continental United States. The Acid Rain Program will achieve a 50  percent reduction in sulfur dioxide (SO<INF>2</INF>) emissions from  utility units. The SO<INF>2</INF> reduction program is a flexible  market-based approach to environmental management. As part of this  approach, EPA allocates ``allowances'' to affected utility units. Each  allowance is a limited authorization to emit up to one ton of  SO<INF>2</INF>. At the end of each calendar year, each unit must hold  allowances in an amount equal to or greater than its SO<INF>2</INF>  emissions for the year. Allowances may be bought, sold, or transferred  between utilities and other interested parties. Those units whose  annual emissions are likely to exceed their allocations may install  control technologies or switch to cleaner fuels to reduce  SO<INF>2</INF> emissions or obtain additional allowances.     Section 410(h) of the Clean Air Act provides allowances for small  diesel refineries that desulfurize diesel fuel from October 1, 1993  through December 31, 1999. Small refineries are not otherwise affected  by the Acid Rain Program and do not need the allowances to comply with  any provision of the Clean Air Act. Thus, the allowances serve as a  financial benefit to small diesel refineries desulfurizing diesel fuel.     The following table lists the allowances allocated to eligible  small diesel refineries for desulfurization in 1998. A total of 25,617  allowances are allocated to 16 refiners. These allowances have a  compliance year of 1999.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------                                       Refinery name or               Refiner                     location          Allocation ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Big West Oil......................

This is the first final rule under the acid rain provisions of the new Clean Air Act, and also marks the first time the Agency has ever allowed the buying and selling of emission rights.  ""This innovative concept of buying and selling emission rights to achieve reductions in acid rain was originally proposed by President Bush in June 1989 and incorporated by Congress in the new Clean Air Act,"" said EPA Administrator William K. Reilly.  ""It reflects this Administration's belief in using the proven power of American free market principles to create a healthy and productive environment for all our citizens.""  ""The auctions and sales will also help guarantee economic growth by providing newer and cleaner electric utilities with the emission rights they need to begin operation,"" added William G. Rosenberg, EPA Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation.  ""We are also requesting proposals from organizations interested in administering the auctions and direct sales without charge to EPA or participants.""  Any private citizen, broker, utility or environmental group may acquire EPA's allowances from auctions and direct sales and as a result, allowances will be bought, sold or banked just like other commodities.  EPA is encouraged by the fact that a number of utilities have already begun discussions among themselves for allowance trades.  In July the Chicago Board of Trade expressed its interest in developing a ""futures"" market in allowances, and has submitted a proposal to the Commodities Futures Trading Commission.  Commenting on the Board of Trade announcement, Reilly said, ""This is a strong, early indication that a sophisticated, self-sustaining private market for acid rain emission allowances is developing.""  The auction and direct sale concept is an outgrowth of the innovative emission allowance program under the acid rain provisions of the new Act.  This program mandates a 10 million ton reduction of SO2 emissions from 1980 levels by the year 2000.  This cut will be accomplished in two phases: Phase I for the biggest plants, beginning in 1995; Phase II for smaller plants beginning in 2000.  The centerpiece of the acid rain program is an innovative market-based trading system of SO2 ""allowances.""  An allowance gives affected sources (mainly existing electric power plants) the right to emit one ton of SO2 per year.  A plant's total annual SO2 emissions cannot exceed its allowances, and only EPA can create an allowance.  Existing SO2 sources (110 plants in Phase I, about 700 more units in Phase II), will receive allowance allocations from EPA based on their emission rates and previous level of coal, oil or other fuel use.  (The new Act also mandates significant nitrogen dioxide reduction to control acid rain, but this program will probably not use allowances.)  Allowances are transferable, allowing market forces to determine their price.  If a source reduces its SO2 emissions more than required, it will have left-over allowances it can sell to another utility or bank for its future use.  By providing for such transactions, total emission reductions will be achieved in the most cost-effective manner, and the utility industry will have the flexibility to choose among various options for reducing emissions.  The final auction and sale rules announced today are distinct from the proposed acid rain trading, permit and monitoring rules announced by EPA Oct. 29, which basically provided allowances to 110 existing electric utilities.  As part of the allowance program, the Act requires EPA to set aside, for EPA-sponsored auctions and direct sales, up to 2.8 percent of the total allowances that would otherwise be available to existing utility sources each year.  Total allowances otherwise available amount to about 5.7 million annually in Phase I and 8.9 million each year in Phase II.  EPA expects these auctions and sales to stimulate the allowance trading market, establishing an initial market price early in the program.  The auctions and sales will also provide allowances to new utilities, which are not automatically entitled to any allowances under the new Act as are existing facilities.  In addition, the program gives new independent power producers priority in the direct sale purchases.  The Agency will begin auctions and sales in 1993 and continue them each year thereafter.  The allowances will be sold on an ""advance"" basis (that is, they can be traded but not used for compliance for seven years) and ""spot"" basis (they can be used for compliance immediately).  For Phase I, 150,000 spot and 100,000 advance allowances will be available annually for auctions and 25,000 advance allowance will be available yearly for direct sales; for Phase II, 100,000 spot and 100,000 advance allowances will be available yearly for direct sales.  The proceeds EPA collects from the auctions and sales of the allowances will be returned to the utilities from which the allowances were drawn.  EPA will hold the auctions each year no later than March 31, beginning in 1993.  Participants will send EPA sealed bids specifying the number of allowances they want to buy and the price they are offering to pay.  EPA will sell the allowances on the basis of bid price, starting with the highest bid and continuing until all allowances are sold.  EPA may not set a minimum price on these allowances.  After EPA's allowances have been auctioned, private holders of allowances may sell their allowances on the basis of bid price.  Utilities may specify a minimum price for allowances they offer for auction.  The direct sale will begin no later than June first of each year and will continue until all available allowances are sold or until the last day on which allowances may be transferred for purposes of compliance with the law.  The direct sale is open to anyone, whether private citizen, utility or speculator.  EPA will sell allowances at a fixed price of $1,500 per allowance (adjusted yearly for inflation), on a first-come, first-served basis until no allowances are left to sell.  Unsold allowances will go into the auction reserve account and be offered for sale at the next auction.  New independent power producers with written guarantees from EPA get the first opportunity to purchase allowances at the direct sale.  In order to obtain these guarantees from EPA, the independent power producers must meet a number of criteria spelled out in the Act and in this rule.  EPA will award guarantees to independent power producers on a first-come, first-served basis.  EPA guarantees will secure the right of independent power producers to purchase a yearly amount of allowances for the life of a new unit.  EPA intends written guarantees to help independent power producers secure financing for new projects by assuring lenders that new independent power projects have access to allowances needed.  Independent power producers tend to be small independent wholesalers of electric power to traditional utilities.  They generally do not provide electricity directly to residential customers.  The final auction and sales rule will appear soon in the Federal Register.  In a separate Federal Register notice appearing the same day, the Agency is also giving notice of its intent to delegate authority to a public or private institution to administer the auctions and sales.  EPA will accept proposals from interested organizations.  Written public comments on the delegation of authority must be received by Feb. 21, 1992.  A public hearing will be held Jan. 13, 1992, at EPA Headquarters in Washington, D.C.                                                                                                                                          EPA Home       |  Privacy      and Security Notice  |                   Contact Us"

ACTION: Direct final rule; response to court remand.     SUMMARY: The EPA is today issuing this final rule in response to a  remand by a U.S. Court of Appeals. The rule reinstates emission  limitations for nitrogen oxides (NO<INF>X) from coal-fired utility  units under section 407 of the Clean Air Act (``the Act''). The  emission limitations for NO<INF>X, along with emission limitations for  sulfur dioxide from utility plants, will reduce acidic deposition and  its serious adverse effects on natural resources, ecosystems,  materials, visibility, and public health.     On March 22, 1994, EPA promulgated a rule establishing NO<INF>X  emission limitations. The rule established emission limits generally  achievable using ``low NO<INF>X burner technology'' and established a  procedure for obtaining an alternative emission limitation (AEL) if a  unit could not achieve the prescribed limit using such technology. On  November 29, 1994, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of  Columbia Circuit ruled that the definition of ``low NO<INF>X burner  technology'' in the March 22, 1994 rule exceeded EPA's statutory  authority. The Court vacated the rule and remanded it to the Agency for  further proceedings. On March 28, 1995, EPA and environmental and  utility-industry parties signed an agreement addressing the March 22,  1994 regulations, including issues raised by the Court's remand.     Based on the Court's decision and a review of the record, the  Agency is now revising the March 22, 1994 regulations. The lowNO <INF>X-burner-technology definition is revised to comply with the  Court's decision. Other provisions concerning the compliance date for  Phase I NO<INF>X emission limitations, AELs, and plans for averaging  NO<INF>X emissions of two or more units are also revised. In general,  the revisions reduce compliance requirements, extend the compliance  date, and increase compliance flexibility. The rule revisions are  issued as a direct final rule because they are consistent with the  Court's decision and no adverse comment is expected. The revisions are  also consistent with the March 28, 1995 agreement.    [[Page 18752]] EFFECTIVE DATE: This direct final rule will be effective  on May 23, 1995 unless significant, adverse comments are received by  May 15, 1995. If significant, adverse comments are timely received on  any portion of the direct final rule, that portion of the direct final  rule will be withdrawn through a notice in the Federal Register.     The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in  the rule is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of May  23, 1995.

Regulatory Flexibility Act      E. Miscellaneous   I. Background    A. Purpose of the Acid Rain NO<INF>X Program        The purpose of the Acid Rain NO<INF>X emission reduction program is  to reduce the adverse effects of acidic deposition on natural  resources, ecosystems, visibility, materials, and public health by  substantially reducing annual emissions of NO<INF>X from coal-fired  electric utilities. 42 U.S.C. 7651(a)(1). NO<INF>X, along with sulfur  dioxide, is a principal precursor of acidic deposition.     Although sulfate deposition is considered to be the major  contributor to long-term aquatic acidification, nitric acidic  deposition plays a dominant role in the ``acid pulses'' associated with  the fish kills observed during the springtime meltdown of the snowpack  in sensitive watersheds. Furthermore, the atmospheric deposition of  NO<INF>X is a substantial source of nutrients that damage estuaries,  such as the Chesapeake Bay, by causing algae blooms and anoxic  conditions. Nitrogen dioxide and particulate nitrate also contribute to  pollutant haze. Moreover, acidic deposition and ozone (formed by the  photochemical reaction of NO<INF>X and volatile organic compounds)  contribute to the premature weathering and corrosion of building  materials such as architectural paints and stones.     Electric utilities are a major contributor to NO<INF>X emissions  nationwide; in 1980, they accounted for 30 percent of total NO<INF>X  emissions and, by 1990, their contribution rose to 38 percent of total  NO<INF>X emissions. Approximately 80 percent of electric utility  NO<INF>X emissions come from coal-fired plants of the type addressed by  section 407 of the Act.    B. Statutory Framework        Section 407(b)(1) of the Act requires the Administrator to  establish NO<INF>X emission limitations for two types of coal-fired  utility boilers (``Group 1'' boilers): (1) Tangentially fired boilers;  and (2) dry bottom wall-fired boilers other than units applying cell  burner technology (``wall-fired boilers''). The Act specifies the  maximum emission limits (often referred to as ``presumptive'' emission  limits or limits) for these Group 1 boilers: 0.45 lb/mmBtu for  tangentially fired boilers; and 0.50 lb/mmBtu for wall-fired boilers.  If the Administrator finds that the presumptive limits cannot be  achieved using ``low NO<INF>X burner technology,'' the Administrator  may set less stringent limitations. 42 U.S.C. 7651f(b)(1). A Phase I  coal-fired utility unit with a Group 1 boiler must comply with the  promulgated annual NO<INF>X emission limitation on the later of January  1, 1995 or the date the unit is required to meet SO<INF>2 emission  reduction requirements under section 404(d) of the Act (id.).     Section 407(d) provides a mechanism by which a utility unit may  receive an AEL less stringent than the applicable limitation  established under section 407(b)(1) for Group 1 boilers. In order to  receive an AEL, the owner or operator of the unit must demonstrate that  it cannot meet the applicable limitation using properly installed ``low  NO<INF>X burner technology'' designed to meet the limitation. 42 U.S.C.  7651f(d). If the owner or operator makes the necessary showings, then  an AEL will be established that does not require ``any additional  control technology beyond low NO<INF>X burners.'' 42 U.S.C. 7651f(d).     Section 407(d) also provides that EPA may grant the owner or  operator of a Phase I coal-fired utility unit subject to section  407(b)(1) a 15-month extension from the January 1, 1995 compliance  deadline. Such an extension may be granted if the technology necessary  to meet the promulgated NO<INF>X emission limitation is not in adequate  supply to enable its installation and operation at the unit, consistent  with system reliability, by January 1, 1995. Section 407(d) specifies  the process the Administrator must use in authorizing the Phase I  extension.      A more detailed discussion of the statutory framework is set forth  at 59 FR 13538-13539 (March 22, 1994).    C. EPA's Rulemaking        As discussed above, the term ``low NO<INF>X burner technology''  plays an important role in section 407 of the Act. There has been  substantial controversy as to whether Congress intended ``low NO<INF>X  burner technology'' to be equivalent to ``low NO<INF>X burners'' and  whether ``low NO<INF>X burner technology'' includes all forms of  combustion air staging or only staging at the burner. On November 25,  1992, EPA published a proposed rule establishing NO<INF>X emission  limitations for coal-fired utility units under section 407(b)(1) of the  Act and other requirements and procedures for all coal-fired units  subject to Phase I and Phase II of the Acid Rain Program (57 FR 55632- 55683). In recognition of the controversy surrounding the definition of  low NO<INF>X burner technology, the proposed rule contained two  regulatory options and an alternative approach for defining that term.  Option 1 defined low NO<INF>X burner technology as low NO<INF>X burners  incorporating overfire air for wall-fired boilers and as low NO<INF>X  burners incorporating separated overfire air (e.g., LNCFS 2 and LNCFS  3) for tangentially fired boilers (57 FR 55642). Option 2 defined low  NO<INF>X burner technology as low NO<INF>X burners incorporating  separated overfire air for tangentially fired boilers, but excluded  overfire air from the definition for wall-fired boilers (id.). In  addition to the two options set forth, EPA solicited comment on a third  [[Page 18753]] approach. This approach was endorsed by the Utility Air  Regulatory Group (UARG) (a group made up of utilities that subsequently  challenged the March 22, 1994 final rule) and the U.S. Department of  Energy (DOE). Under the third approach, low NO<INF>X burner technology  was defined as excluding both overfire air for wall-fired boilers and  separated overfire air for tangentially fired boilers (57 FR 55644- 55645).      On March 22, 1994, EPA published the final NO<INF>X rule (59 FR  13538-13580). In that rule, EPA adopted the Option 1 definition of low  NO<INF>X burner technology after considering the chemical process of  low NO<INF>X combustion, the history and application of low NO<INF>X  combustion technology, Congress' intent in section 407 of the Act, and  the actual application of NO<INF>X control technology.    II. The Court's Decision        Following issuance of the March 22, 1994 rule, numerous utilities  and the National Coal Association petitioned for judicial review of the  rule. The two main issues raised on appeal were: whether EPA's  definition of low NO<INF>X burner technology was lawful; and whether  EPA was obligated to extend the January 1, 1995 compliance date  prescribed in section 407 of the Act because EPA did not issue the  rules by the May 15, 1992 issuance date required by section 407.     On November 29, 1994, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of  Columbia Circuit issued a decision on the petitioners' first issue. The  Court held that ``[t]he statutory text, structure, and history of  section 407 * * * support the `unmistakable conclusion' that Congress  unambiguously intended the term `low NO<INF>X burner technology' to  encompass only low NO<INF>X burners, not overfire air'' (Alabama Power  Co. v. U.S. EPA, No. 94-1170 (D.C. Cir, 1994) slip op. at 12). The  Court explained that under the AEL provision, ``Congress did not intend  to require utilities to consider the `full range of low NO<INF>X  combustion technologies' because it expressly provided that utilities  not be required to install or use any equipment beyond low NO<INF>X  burners in their efforts to comply with NO<INF>X emission limits'' (id.  at 11). After concluding that EPA had exceeded its statutory authority,  the Court vacated the March 22, 1994 rule and determined that the  petitioners' second issue on the compliance deadline was moot.    III. EPA's Response to the Court's Decision    A. Changes to the March 22, 1994 Rule      Definitions      Low NO<INF>X burners and low NO<INF>X burner technology. Because  the Court determined that, in defining low NO<INF>X burner technology  in the March 22, 1994 rule, the Agency exceeded its authority under  section 407 of the Act, the revised rule changes the definition of the  terms, ``low NO<INF>X burners and low NO<INF>X burner technology,'' in  Sec. 76.2. The Court determined that low NO<INF>X burner technology  encompasses ``only low NO<INF>X burners'' (Alabama Power, slip op. at  12). The Agency is removing from the March 22, 1994 definition the  language that is inconsistent with the Court's determination. In  particular, the revised rule eliminates the language stating that low  NO<INF>X burner technology includes ``any combination of coal and air  nozzles ports * * * not restricted to location within the boiler,  including * * * NO<INF>X ports, overfire air ports, or staged  combustion ports'' (59 FR 13565). Other related language (e.g., ``at  points downstream of the initial flame'' (id.)) in the March 22, 1994  definition is also removed.      The removed language is replaced by new language explaining that  the new definition includes the staging of combustion air using air  nozzles or registers located inside any boiler waterwall<SUP>1 hole  that includes a burner. Additional new language explains that the  definition excludes the staging of combustion air using air nozzles or  ports located outside any boiler waterwall hole that includes a burner.  The new language implements, for both wall- and tangentially-fired  boilers, the Court's holding that low NO<INF>X burner technology  includes only low NO<INF>X burners.       \1\Waterwalls are panels of water tubes running along the length  of a boiler. These tubes carry water or steam. Water in these tubes  is converted into steam through the heat transfer between combustion  gas and this water.           For wall-fired boilers, two types of NO<INF>X combustion controls  have been used: (1) Advanced burner retrofits for reducing NO<INF>X  formation (``burner retrofits'');<SUP>2 and (2) combustion air staging  (i.e., ``overfire air'' for wall-fired boilers) (57 FR 55640). Burner  retrofits must be custom-designed for each boiler and the ease of  retrofitting varies from boiler to boiler:        \2\Typical designs of burner retrofits include upgraded air  registers that allow for better control of combustion air and a  redesigned burner tip. Burner retrofits achieve controlled fuel and  air mixing in the flame. This arrangement results in rapid  devolatilization and combustion of nitrogen-containing volatile  matter under conditions of limited availability of oxygen, with the  result that the formation of fuel NO<INF>X is suppressed. The  arrangement also results in combustion of air and coal char with a  cooler flame than the flame of conventional burners, which  suppresses thermal NO<INF>X formation (59 FR 13541).        In some cases (of burner retrofits), burner openings must be  enlarged via remolding the refractory material at the burner exit or  by enlarging the hole (not cutting holes in the boiler tubes). If  enlargement of the hole requires that tubes be cut and bent slightly  to accommodate the burner, however, this procedure does not affect  the boiler water circulation since the tubes have been previously  bent. The circulation design takes bends into account during initial  boiler design. By contrast, cutting holes as required for the  addition of (overfire air) affects the boiler circulation. (Docket  Item VIII-A-2, Reply Brief of Petitioners, August 29, 1994, Exhibit    1.)        Unlike burner retrofits, overfire air for wall-fired boilers  involves diverting some combustion air from waterwall openings that  include a burner and injecting the air above the top burner level. This  generally requires the cutting of entirely new holes in the waterwall  above the highest burners (id.; 57 FR 55640).     The new low-NO<INF>X-burner-technology definition, as applied to  wall-fired boilers, encompasses all burner retrofits that are  essentially within an existing waterwall hole. Such retrofits may  involve minor modifications (e.g., of pressure parts or refractory  material) to the existing waterwall hole as necessary to accommodate  the retrofit essentially within the hole. The new definition excludes  all overfire air as applied to wall-fired boilers. This definition  meets the Court's requirement that only burners be considered; nothing  in the Court's decision excludes retrofit burners requiring minor  waterwall modifications. See, e.g., slip op. at 5 footnote 3  (discussing low NO<INF>X burners).     For tangentially fired boilers, all commercially available systems  for reducing NO<INF>X formation involve a staged combination of coal  and air (57 FR 55641). Three types of control systems for tangentially  fired boilers were discussed in detail in the preamble to proposed part  76: (1) The replacement of the original coal and air nozzle array in  each corner of the boiler with a new low NO<INF>X configuration of coal  and air nozzles and the installation of air nozzles at the upper end of  each waterwall hole that contains the new coal and air nozzle array  (``LNCFS 1'');<SUP>3 [[Page 18754]] (2) the installation of air nozzles  in a new air nozzle assembly above the waterwall hole that contains the  original coal and air nozzle array in each corner (``LNCFS 2''); and  (3) the replacement of the original coal and air nozzle array with a  new low NO<INF>X configuration in each corner and the installation of  both air nozzles at the upper end of each waterwall hole containing the  new array and a new air nozzle assembly above each waterwall hole  (``LNCFS 3'') (id.).        \3\Several other low NO<INF>X burner designs also use combustion  air staging in the waterwall hole where the coal and air nozzle  array is located. Some of these are : Foster Wheeler's T-fired/Split  Flame (TF/SF) burner; and International Combustion Ltd.'s FAN burner  (Docket Item IV-D-111, Comments of the Utility Air Regulatory Group  on EPA's Proposed Rules on Nitrogen Oxides Reduction Program,  February 8, 1993, at 28, 30 and 115). Both of these designs  incorporate air nozzles at the upper end of the waterwall hole that  contains the new coal and air nozzle array in each corner of the  boiler. Neither, however, incorporates any staging that utilizes  injection of air through separate holes (e.g., separated overfire  air ports) in the waterwall and that therefore is external to the  waterwall hole containing the burner (id. at 27).          As is the case with wall-fired retrofit burners, LNCFS 1 is customdesigned  for each boiler and may require modifications to the existing  waterwall hole (59 FR 13546-13547). Retrofit burners and LNCFS 1  respectively involve the injection of air through registers or nozzles  located in a waterwall hole that includes the burner: In the case of  wall-fired boilers, the air registers are in the burner retrofit itself  while in the case of tangentially fired boilers, the air nozzles are in  the hole with the coal and air nozzle array.     In contrast with LNCFS 1, LNCFS 2 and LNCFS 3 involve injecting  combustion air above the coal and air nozzle array in each corner  through a new air nozzle assembly requiring an entirely new waterwall  hole above the array (57 FR 55641). The new low-NO<INF>X-burnertechnology  definition, as applied to tangentially fired boilers,  includes the applications of LNCFS 1 (and other low NO<INF>X burner  designs)<SUP>4 that are essentially within the existing waterwall hole.  The included applications may involve minor modifications (e.g., of  pressure parts or refractory material) to the existing waterwall hole  as necessary to accommodate the NO<INF>X emission controls essentially  within the existing hole. The new definition excludes all applications  of separated overfire air, e.g., LNCFS 2 and LNCFS 3. This is  consistent with the Court's holding in that, as discussed above, LNCFS  1 for tangentially fired boilers is analogous to retrofit burners for  wall-fired boilers and thus falls within the Court's prescription that  ``low NO<INF>X burner technology'' be limited to low NO<INF>X burners  only.        \4\See footnote 3 above.           The Agency notes that its new definition is in essence the same as  the definition set forth in the preamble of the November 25, 1992  proposed rule as an alternative to Options 1 and 2 (57 FR 55644-55645).  The alternative approach, like the new definition adopted today,  excluded overfire air for wall-fired boilers and excluded LNCFS 2 and  LNCFS 3 for tangentially fired boilers. The utilities described the  alternative approach as involving ``the direct replacement of the  original equipment manufacturer's coal burners (with low NO<INF>X  burners) without major new waterwall penetrations or parts'' (Docket  Item IV-D-111 at 74). The utilities also noted that their definition  under the alternative approach--like the definition in the revised  rule--includes ``burners[-]only technologies that have recently begun  to be offered commercially'' for tangentially fired boilers, i.e., the  low NO<INF>X burner designs described in footnote 3 above (id. at 73).  In comments on the November 25, 1992 proposal, the utilities and DOE  supported the alternative approach as being consistent with section 407  of the Act (Docket Items IV-D-2 at 1-2 and IV-D-111 at 73-84).     Other defined terms. In light of the new low-NO<INF>X-burnertechnology  definition adopted today, two other definitions in Sec. 76.2  of the March 22, 1994 rule are now superfluous and are eliminated in  the revised rule.<SUP>5 In particular, the new low-NO<INF>X-burnertechnology  definition itself describes what forms of air staging are  included or not included in the definition, and, as discussed below,  references in other sections of part 76 to ``combustion air staging''  have been removed. Consequently, there is no need for the definition of  ``combustion air staging''. See 59 FR 13564. Further, the definition of  ``low NO<INF>X coal and air nozzles'' is unnecessary because that term  is no longer used in part 76. See 59 FR 13565.        \5\As discussed below, the definition of ``alternative  technology'' is also revised.       2. Date for Compliance with NO<INF>X Emission Limitations     The revised rule changes the date in Sec. 76.5(a) on which a Phase  I unit with a Group 1 boiler begins to be subject to the NO<INF>X  emission limitations. Under the March 22, 1994 rule, such a Phase I  unit must begin compliance with NO<INF>X emission limitations on the  later of January 1, 1995 or the date the unit becomes subject to  SO<INF>2 emission reduction requirements under section 404(d) of the  Act. Under the revised rule, the January 1, 1995 date is changed to  January 1, 1996. Analogous changes in the compliance date are made in  Secs. 76.1(d) and 76.5(d).<SUP>6        \6\The language in Sec. 76.5(d) is also revised to make it  consistent with Sec. 76.5(a) and clarify that a unit under  Sec. 76.5(d) may seek to use a compliance option in Secs. 76.10,  76.11, or 76.12.           The change in the compliance date is necessary because of the delay  in the repromulgation of the NO<INF>X emission limitations. The Court  vacated the March 22, 1994 rule on November 29, 1994, only 32 days  prior to the compliance deadline. The Court added that the reissued  NO<INF>X emission limitations ``will undoubtedly take effect after the  statutory deadline [for compliance] of January 1, 1995.'' Alabama  Power, slip op. at 13. Moreover, the Court noted ``the agency's  representation at oral argument that it would be inclined to exercise  its enforcement discretion in favor of the utilities in order to  account for delay in the rulemaking process'' (id.).     As correctly predicted by the Court, today's revised rule  reinstating NO<INF>X emission limitations takes effect after January 1,  1995, despite the Agency's efforts to expedite the rulemaking process.  Maintaining the January 1, 1995 deadline for compliance with the  NO<INF>X emission limitations would mean that the limitations under the  revised rule would have to be applied prior to their effective date.     Not only would this approach raise questions of retroactivity, but  also the Agency is concerned about the lack of any lead time between  promulgation of NO<INF>X emission limitations and the beginning date  for compliance. Under these circumstances, the Agency must determine  what Congress would have intended had it addressed the problem of  issuance of the NO<INF>X emission limitations after January 1, 1995.  Section 407 required the Agency to issue final NO<INF>X regulations  within 18 months of enactment of title IV (i.e., by May 15, 1992) and  required compliance with such regulations to begin on January 1, 1995.  Although these are independent requirements and, the Agency maintains,  no specific lead time between rule promulgation and compliance was  mandated, it is reasonable to conclude that Congress intended that  there be some lead time. Retaining a January 1, 1995 compliance  deadline would result in no lead time at all.     Further, the Agency recognizes that the promulgation of the March  22, 1994 low-NO<INF>X-burner-technology definition and the Court's  decision vacating the March 22, 1994 rule may have  [[Page 18755]] engendered some uncertainty and confusion on the part of  utilities concerning their regulatory obligations. This further  supports a change in the January 1, 1995 compliance deadline. However,  the Agency notes that Phase I units generally proceeded in good faith  to take the necessary steps to comply with the March 22, 1994 rule.  These steps included obtaining a permit to operate and, where  necessary, installing NO<INF>X control equipment, including low  NO<INF>X burners. Of the 175 Phase I units with Group 1 boilers on  Table A of section 404, all submitted NO<INF>X compliance plans by May  6, 1994 and only 31 requested a compliance date extension.<SUP>7 Since  complying with the revised rule will, in general, require the same or  less effort than the industry has already undertaken, the extension  until January 1, 1996 is judged to be reasonable and appropriate.        \7\Twenty-five units applied for a 2-year Phase I extension for  SO<INF>2 under Sec. 72.42 (which automatically granted them a 2-year  NO<INF>X extension), and 6 units applied for a 15 month Phase I  NO<INF>X compliance extension under Sec. 76.12.          The establishment of January 1, 1996 as the compliance deadline  also reflects the fact that title IV of the Act created an annual  program with regard to both SO<INF>2 and NO<INF>X emissions reductions.  Units must comply with SO<INF>2 emission limitations by emitting no  more SO<INF>2 in a year than is authorized by the number of allowances  ``held for that unit for that year.'' 42 U.S.C. 7651b(g). Similarly,  emission limitations for NO<INF>X are annual: The generic limits  established under section 407(b) are ``annual allowable emission  limitations''; AELs under section 407(d) are emission rates that can be  met ``on an annual basis''; and emissions averaging plans under section  407(e) limit NO<INF>X emissions using both ``alternative  contemporaneous annual emission limitations'' and a ``Btu-weighted  average annual emission rate.'' Adopting January 1, 1996 as the  compliance deadline preserves the annual nature of the Acid Rain  Program.      The revised rule also changes language in the March 22, 1994 rule  concerning the date for compliance with any revised emission  limitations for Group 1 boilers that may be adopted under section  407(b)(2) of the Act. The March 22, 1994 rule states that Group 1,  Phase II units must comply with any revised Group 1 emission  limitations starting on January 1, 2000. Because EPA has not determined  whether to revise the Group 1 emission limitations under section  407(b)(2), it is unnecessary to state, in the rule at this time, the  compliance date for such revised limitations. If and when the  limitations are revised, the rule will be amended to add both the  limitations and the compliance date. Sections 76.5(g) and  76.10(f)(1)(iii) are revised to remove that compliance date. 3. Alternative Emission Limitations      In order to ensure that Sec. 76.10 is consistent with the new  definition of the term ``low NO<INF>X burner technology,'' all phrases  in the section that elaborated on that term are eliminated. In  particular, in Secs. 76.10(a)(1) and (2) of the March 22, 1994 rule,  the term ``low NO<INF>X burner technology'' is followed by phrases such  as: ``including separated overfire air''; ``incorporating both closecoupled  and separated overfire air''; or ``incorporating combustion air  staging above the top burner level'' (59 FR 13567-13568). The revised  rule excludes all of these phrases and is reworded as necessary to  reflect their removal. As a result of these changes, units with Group 1  boilers may apply for AELs if they are unable to meet applicable  emission limitations using low NO<INF>X burner technology under the new  definition in Sec. 72.2.<SUP>8        \8\Since low NO<INF>X burner technology does not include air  nozzles or ports located outside of a waterwall hole that includes a  burner, provisions in Sec. 76.10 concerning the technical  feasibility of installing such air nozzles or ports are irrelevant.  Consequently, the March 22, 1994 provisions in Secs. 76.10(a)(3) and  (d)(4) are entirely eliminated. See 59 FR 13568-13569. The revised  rule also reflects the removal of any reference to these eliminated  provisions and the renumbering that results from their elimination.  See 59 FR 13568-69 and 13574. In addition, the requirement in  Sec. 76.10(g)(1)(ii)(C) that the designated representative revise  the AEL demonstration period plan is changed to apply only when the  owner or operator identifies operating modifications (whether for  the boiler or the NO<INF>X emission control system) that improve  NO<INF>X reductions. Consistent with Sec. 76.10(a)(2)(iii)(B), this  does not require revision of the plan to include operating  modifications that would prevent the boiler or NO<INF>X control  system from being operated in accordance with the bid and design  specifications on which the design of the NO<INF>X control system is  based. Plan revision is no longer required for all possible  equipment modifications or upgrades since they could be outside the  new low-NO<INF>X-burner technology definition. See 59 FR 13570- 13571.           The revised rule also adds that units with tangentially fired  boilers may seek AELs where they cannot meet the applicable emission  limitations using separated overfire air. In order to comply with the  March 22, 1994 low-NO<INF>X-burner-technology definition, which was  then in effect and included close-coupled and separated overfire air,  some units installed only separated overfire air. The record  information to date indicates that separated overfire air alone is at  least as effective in reducing NO<INF>X emissions as low NO<INF>X  burner technology as applied to tangentially fired boilers. See Docket  Item IV-A-10, Background Document for RIA of NO<INF>X Regulations,  appendix A at 21. The Agency therefore maintains that such units should  not be disqualified from seeking an AEL because of their efforts to  comply with the March 22, 1994 rule. Sections 76.10(a)(1) and (2)(i)(A)  are revised to allow such units to seek AELs.     For similar reasons, the definition of ``alternative technology''  set forth in Sec. 76.2 is revised. Under the revised rule,  ``alternative technology'' is NO<INF>X emission control technology  other than low NO<INF>X burner technology but does not include overfire  air for wall-fired boilers and separated overfire air for tangentially  fired boilers. Under Secs. 76.10(a) and (e)(11), a unit using  alternative technology, in addition to or in lieu of low NO<INF>X  burner technology, to reduce NO<INF>X emissions must show an annual  average emissions reduction of greater than 65 percent in order to  qualify for an AEL. The revision of the alternative-technology  definition excludes units with tangentially fired boilers applying  separated overfire air from the 65-percent reduction requirement.<SUP>9  This avoids putting at a disadvantage, for purposes of obtaining AELs,  units that may have installed separated overfire air because of the  March 22, 1994 low-NO<INF>X-burner-technology definition.        \9\In order to avoid repeating in other sections the NO<INF>X  control technology requirements set forth in Sec. 76.10(a)(2) for  qualifying for an AEL (e.g., that a Group 1 boiler install low  NO<INF>X burner technology, alternative technology, or, for a  tangentially fired boiler, separated overfire air), the references  in Secs. 76.10(d)(8) and (e)(2)-(4) and 76.15(c) to specific  technologies are replaced by a general reference to the ``installed  NO<INF>X emission control system'' or ``NO<INF>X emission control  system.'' Such a system must, of course, meet the requirements in  Sec. 76.10(a)(2). In addition, Sec. 76.10(e)(2) is also revised to  make it consistent with Sec. 76.10(d)(8).          Moreover, certain dates in Sec. 76.10(c)(1), concerning the  submission of petitions for an AEL demonstration period, and in  Sec. 76.10(f)(1), concerning approved AEL demonstration periods, are  changed. See 59 FR 13568 and 13570. These revisions reflect the change  in the compliance deadline from January 1, 1995 to January 1, 1996.     Finally, certain provisions, concerning information included in  petitions for AEL demonstration periods and for final AELs, in  Secs. 76.14 and 76.15 of the March 22, 1994 rule refer to combustion  air or air flow through ``overfire air ports'' or ``combustion air  staging ports.'' Since low NO<INF>X burner technology now excludes air  nozzles or ports located outside a waterwall hole that includes a  burner, these references are no longer appropriate. The provisions have  been modified to apply [[Page 18756]] only to tangentially fired  boilers (which may use close-coupled overfire air) and to refer to the  ``distribution of combustion air'' within the ``NO<INF>X emission  control system.'' See 59 FR 13574 (Sec. 76.14(a)(2)(i)) and 13575  (Sec. 76.15(b)(3) and (d)(2)).<SUP>10        \10\Sections 76.15(a), (b), and (d) are also revised to state,  consistent with Secs. 76.10(d)(13) and 76.14(a)(2)(v), that the  owner or operator ``may'' use for tests and procedures set forth in  Sec. 76.15. Further, the language in Sec. 76.15(b)(6) is clarified,  and Sec. 76.15(d)(3) is revised to refer more generally to  optimization of the combustion process and to cite burner balancing  as an example.           As a result of these changes, the revised rule complies with the  Court's decision. The rule provides that, in applying for an AEL, the  designated representative for an affected Group 1 unit must demonstrate  that the unit cannot meet the presumptive emission limit using properly  installed and operated low NO<INF>X burner technology as redefined (or  alternative technology or, for tangentially fired boilers, separated  overfire air) that is designed to meet the presumptive limit. The  designated representative is not required to attempt to meet the  presumptive limit using low NO<INF>X burners plus overfire air for  wall-fired boilers or separated overfire air for tangentially fired  boilers. Rather, in keeping with the Court's decision, the designated  representative may base the petition for an AEL on the use of only low  NO<INF>X burners. Nothing in the Court's decision mandates any further  changes in the AEL provisions.  4. NO<INF>X Averaging Plans      Section 76.11 is revised to change the provisions concerning  compliance on an individual basis and on a group basis with the  emission limitations in NO<INF>X averaging plans and to clarify  language in the formulas implementing the requirements of such plans.     Under Sec. 76.11(d) of the March 22, 1994 rule, units governed by a  NO<INF>X averaging plan must comply with both individual-unit limits  ``and'', where applicable, a group emission requirement. 59 FR 13572  (Sec. 76.11(d)(1)(i)(B)). An averaging plan must state individual-unit  limits for all units in the plan, i.e., an alternative contemporaneous  annual emission limitation and, in most cases, an annual heat input  limit. The formula for setting the individual-unit limits is Equation 1  in Sec. 76.11(a)(6). Each unit's actual annual average emission rate  must not exceed that unit's alternative contemporaneous annual emission  limitation. Further, if the alternative contemporaneous annual emission  limitation is less stringent than the applicable emission limitation,  the unit's actual annual heat input must not exceed the unit's annual  heat input limit. If the alternative contemporaneous annual emission  limitation is more stringent, the unit's heat input must not be less  than the heat input limit.      The March 22, 1994 rule also provides that if one or more of the  units under the plan fail to meet the individual-unit limits, there  must be a showing that the entire group of units under the plan  complies with a group emission requirement. The group emission  requirement is met where the actual Btu-weighted annual average  emission rate for the units in the plan does not exceed the Btuweighted  annual average emission rate for these units if they had  operated in compliance with the applicable emission limitation in  Secs. 76.5, 76.6, or 76.7. The formula for determining group compliance  is Equation 2 in Sec. 76.11(d)(1)(ii)(A).     Section 76.11(d)(2) of the March 22, 1994 rule addresses liability  where units under the NO<INF>X averaging plan fail to meet any of the  requirements of the plan, including the individual-unit limits and the  group emission requirement. Under Sec. 76.11(d)(2)(i), the owners and  operators of each unit under the plan are liable for any violations of  the plan (or of Sec. 76.11) by any unit under the plan. Such liability  expressly includes the excess emissions penalty under 40 CFR part 77  and section 411 of the Act and penalties under section 113 of the Act.  The only exception to the liability provision in Sec. 76.11(d)(2)(i) is  that if the group showing of compliance under Sec. 76.11(d)(1)(ii) is  made, then no unit under the plan is subject to the excess emissions  penalty. Regardless of whether the group showing of compliance (which  is for purposes of excess emissions) is made, the March 22, 1994 rule  does not exempt any unit under the plan from liability under section  113 for violation of the individual-unit limits.     In contrast with the March 22, 1994 rule, the revised rule provides  that if one or more units fail to meet the individual-unit limits but  there is a showing of group compliance for the year, then all units in  the plan will be deemed to be in compliance for the year with the  individual-unit limits. With regard to their NO<INF>X emissions for the  year, all units therefore will be in compliance with the averaging plan  and have no potential liability for violation of the plan or part 76.  Further, none of the units will have excess emissions for the year  under part 77.      The Agency has received public comment to the effect that this  revised approach, which was proposed in the original November 25, 1992  proposed NO<INF>X rule, is more consistent with the purposes of section  407 than the approach adopted in the March 22, 1994 rule. Neither  section 407(e) nor the legislative history specifically address this  matter. However, section 407(e) states that individual units'  alternative contemporaneous annual emission limitations must ``ensure  that the units' actual annual NO<INF>X emission rate'' averaged over  the units in question does not exceed the ``Btu-weighted annual average  emission rate for the same units'' if they had met the applicable  emission limitations under section 407(b). 15 U.S.C 7651f(e). That goal  is satisfied where units fail to meet the individual-unit limits in the  NO<INF>X averaging plan but can show group compliance with the plan.     Further, even though the March 22, 1994 rule relieves units in such  circumstances from liability for excess emissions, the units are still  potentially liable for civil penalties, which may be enforceable  through Agency action or citizen suits under sections 113 and 304 of  the Act. This potential liability is sufficiently significant that a  utility with a NO<INF>X averaging plan may, in effect, be forced to  comply unit-by-unit with the individual-unit limits even if the group  emission requirement could be met without meeting all the individualunit  limits. The individual-unit limits can restrict the utility's  flexibility, for example, in dispatching the units in the plan. In  order to minimize the likelihood of violating individual-unit limits,  some designated representatives have submitted Phase I NO<INF>X  averaging plans that set alternative contemporaneous emission  limitations equal to the presumptive limits in Sec. 76.5 and that  specify no heat input limits. However, under such plans, the  individual-unit limits can still restrict the utility's flexibility to  choose which units in the plan will be retrofitted with NO<INF>X  emission control systems and what types of NO<INF>X emission control  systems will be used. The Agency is concerned that the net result of  such lack of flexibility is that designated representatives will be  encouraged to seek AELs for more units, rather than attempting to  average units with higher NO<INF>X emissions with units with lower  NO<INF>X emissions. Not only is the case-by-case process of setting  AELs administratively burdensome for utilities and the Agency, but also  the Agency is concerned that total NO<INF>X emissions are likely to be  higher the greater the number of units with AELs.     The Agency concludes that removing the requirement to meet  individual-unit limits when there is group compliance  [[Page 18757]] under a NO<INF>X averaging plan is a reasonable  interpretation of section 407(e) and better implements that provision.  Consequently, Sec. 76.11(d)(1)(ii) is revised to state that when the  units in a NO<INF>X averaging plan show compliance with the group  emission requirement in Sec. 76.11(d)(1)(ii)(A) for a given year, the  units will be deemed to comply for that year with their individual  emission limitations and heat input limits. Since units meeting group  compliance are thereby in compliance with both the individual-unit and  group emission requirements of the plan, there is no need to state  separately that group compliance relieves the units of any penalties  for excess emissions. Section 76.11(d)(2)(ii) is therefore  eliminated.<SUP>11        \11\Consistent with these changes, Sec. 76.11(d)(1)(i)(B) is  revised to state that units must meet either the individual-unit  limits ``or'' the group emission requirement.          Sections 76.11(a) (6) and (7) and (d)(1)(ii) (A) and (B) are also  revised to clarify the formulas (Equations 1 and 2) that govern the  selection of individual-unit limits and the showing of group  compliance. The language in these sections explaining what ``applicable  emission limitation'' to use in Equations 1 and 2 is confusing. The  revised rule clarifies that the limitation to be used in Equations 1  and 2 is the applicable emission limitation for each respective unit in  Secs. 76.5, 76.6, or 76.7. Consistent with that approach, a unit with  an AEL must use the applicable emission limitation in Secs. 76.5, 76.6,  or 76.7 rather than the AEL. The only exception is that an early  election unit, which elects to meet NO<INF>X emission limitations in  Phase I but is allowed to participate in a NO<INF>X averaging plan only  in Phase II, must use the most stringent applicable limitation in  Secs. 76.5 or 76.7 (i.e., 0.45 lb/mmBtu or 0.50 lb/mmBtu depending on  whether the unit's boiler is wall-fired or tangentially fired) or, if  the limitation is revised and made more stringent for Phase II under  section 407(b)(2), the revised limitation applicable to the boiler  type.      In order to simplify the language in Secs. 76.11(a)(7) and  (d)(1)(ii)(B) in the March 22, 1994 rule, the references to Phase II  units are removed. To capture the concept in the March 22, 1994  provisions that Phase II units cannot participate in averaging plans  before January 1, 2000, Sec. 76.11(a)(1) is revised to state that a  unit in an averaging plan in Phase I must be a Phase I unit with a  Group 1 boiler.      EPA notes that it has received public comments concerning the use  of a single NO<INF>X averaging plan for units of two or more operating  companies (also referred to as utility systems) that are subsidiaries  of a single holding company. In such a case, the operating companies  would designate the same designated representative (probably someone at  the holding company level) for their units in order to meet the common  designated representative requirement for a NO<INF>X averaging plan.  Each operating company could still designate its own alternate  designated representative. Concern was raised that the designated  representative at the holding company level may not be readily  accessible and that operating companies may need the flexibility of  having two persons at the operating company level with authority to act  for the designated representative. The Agency is currently reviewing  this matter and, in light of the public comments, will propose, in a  future rulemaking, revisions to 40 CFR part 72 that would allow  designation of a second alternate designated representative for units  under certain limited circumstances. Such circumstances could be where:  The unit's utility system is a subsidiary of a holding company with two  or more utility-system subsidiaries in two or more states; and, in  order to use a NO<INF>X averaging plan involving units of two or more  such subsidiaries, all the utility-system subsidiaries of that holding  company have the same designated representative. EPA intends to  consider this revision, and other revisions to streamline part 72, in a  rulemaking to be completed in 1995.  5. Phase I NO<INF>X Compliance Extensions     Section 76.12 is revised in order to reflect the new low-NO<INF>Xburner -technology definition. The March 22, 1994 rule provides for a  Phase I NO<INF>X compliance extension where a tangentially fired boiler  was designed and guaranteed, but failed, to meet the presumptive  emission limit and there is a contract to install close-coupled or  separated overfire air on or before January 1, 1996. The March 22, 1994  rule includes similar language, with regard to wall-fired boilers,  providing a Phase I NO<INF>X compliance extension where there is a  contract to install additional equipment, including overfire air. 59 FR  13572 (Sec. 76.12(a)(1) (ii) and (iii)). The direct final rule  eliminates these provisions and a related provision in  Sec. 76.12(b)(3). No extensions were requested under these provisions.     The March 22, 1994 rule also provides for a Phase I NO<INF>X  compliance extension for units where low NO<INF>X burner technology  designed to meet the presumptive emission limits is not in adequate  supply for installation and operation by January 1, 1995, consistent  with system reliability. Requests for the extensions were due by  October 1, 1994. These provisions are not changed in the revised rule.  Extension requests for 6 units under this provision were submitted, and  the requests either have already been granted or will be acted on  consistent with the revised rule after its effective date.     The Agency is aware that, in very limited circumstances, an  additional extension of the compliance date for Phase I NO<INF>X  emission limitations may be warranted. These circumstances are as  follows: A source has 3 or more units that have extensions under  section 404(d) until January 1, 1997 to comply with Phase I NO<INF>X  emission limits and, due to claimed operational problems associated  with the planned NO<INF>X emission control systems, one unit may need  an additional extension to redesign and install low NO<INF>X burner  technology. Because of its extension under section 404(d), the unit has  not yet installed the NO<INF>X control system that was designed to  comply with the low-NO<INF>X-burner technology definition in the March  22, 1994 rule. With the change adopted today in the definition, the  unit has flexibility to redesign the NO<INF>X control system to meet  the new definition and avoid the claimed operational problems. However,  unless an additional compliance extension is granted, there will be  insufficient time to install redesigned low NO<INF>X burner technology  without causing system reliability problems.     Because the need for an additional extension appears to result from  the change in the low-NO<INF>X-burner-technology definition, the Agency  maintains that an additional extension may be appropriate in these  limited circumstances. In order to provide the designated  representative of the unit an opportunity to demonstrate the need for  such extension, the revised rule (in Sec. 76.12(e)) requires the  submission of a petition for the extension within 15 days of the  publication of the revised rule and establishes procedures for acting  on the petition. The procedures and the provisions in the revised rule  concerning treatment of the unit upon approval of the petition are  essentially the same as the procedures and provisions applicable to  Phase I NO<INF>X compliance extensions. See 59 FR 13572-13573  (Sec. 76.12(c) and (d)).  6. Miscellaneous      The revised rule excludes Sec. 76.9(e) of the March 22, 1994 rule,  which provides that each ton of excess emissions of  [[Page 18758]] NO<INF>X will be a separate violation. In response to  the utilities' challenge of Sec. 76.9(e), EPA moved before the Court  for a voluntary remand of the provision. The Court granted the motion  and therefore EPA is now deleting the provision.     The revised rule also changes provisions concerning the types of  units for which reports of cost data on low NO<INF>X burner technology  installations must be prepared and the date by which the reports must  be submitted under Sec. 76.14(c). Consistent with the new low-NO<INF>Xburner -technology definition, the cost reports are not required for:  wall-fired boilers using only overfire air and not low NO<INF>X  burners; and tangentially fired boilers using only separated overfire  air and not low NO<INF>X burner technology. Because such boilers are  not using low NO<INF>X burner technology, cost data on their NO<INF>X  emissions controls are not relevant to setting of Group 2, Phase II  NO<INF>X emission limitations under section 407(b)(2) of the Act. An  analogous change is made in section 1 of appendix B to part 76.     Also excluded from cost reporting are units that begin installing a  new NO<INF>X emission control system after 120 days from publication of  the instant direct final rule in the Federal Register. In light of the  statutory requirement that Group 2, Phase II emission limitations be  established by January 1, 1997, the Agency maintains that cost  information on those units would be received too late to be useful in  the rulemaking on such emission limitations.     Finally, the date for submission of cost reports is revised in  Sec. 76.14(c)(3) to take account of the vacating of the March 22, 1994  rule by the Court. As in the March 22, 1994 rule, the cost reports must  be submitted within 120 days after completion of the low NO<INF>X  burner technology retrofit project. However, in order to provide time  for resumption and completion of cost data collection that may have  been stopped when the rule was vacated, the revised rule ensures that  all projects will have at least 40 days, from the publication of the  revised rule in the Federal Register, to submit the cost reports. Cost  reports on projects completed more than 80 days before publication of  the direct final rule must be submitted by the 40th day after such  publication.    B. Reissuance of the Emission Limits        Section 407(b)(1) requires the Administrator to adopt by regulation  the presumptive emission limits unless she finds that they cannot be  achieved using low NO<INF>X burner technology. In the March 22, 1994  rule, the Administrator found that the record evidence showed that the  presumptive limits were achievable using low NO<INF>X burners plus  overfire air for wall-fired boilers and separated overfire air for  tangentially fired boilers (59 FR 13546). In light of the revised lowNO <INF>X-burner-technology definition, the Administrator has reviewed  the record concerning the performance of low NO<INF>X burners and  concludes that the presumptive limits are still achievable. The revised  rule therefore reissues the presumptive limits of 0.50 lb/mmBtu for  wall-fired boilers and 0.45 lb/mmBtu for tangentially fired boilers.     The record includes analyses conducted by DOE in which the  presumptive limits were examined in light of the low-NO<INF>X-burnertechnology  definition supported by DOE, i.e., the third approach in the  November 25, 1992 proposal. The revised rule adopts in essence the same  definition as DOE supported. As discussed below, DOE concluded, and the  utilities agreed, that most units could achieve the presumptive limits  using low NO<INF>X burners without overfire air for wall-fired boilers  and without separated overfire air for tangentially fired boilers. See,  e.g., Docket Item IV-D-162, Fourth Supplementary Comments of UARG,  February 2, 1994 at 16-23.      After reviewing a number of sources of information on control  technology efficiency, DOE estimated control technology performance  based primarily on data from ongoing demonstration projects and other  recent installations of NO<INF>X control systems. The analysis of data  from wall-fired and tangentially fired boilers, fitted with low  NO<INF>X burner technology as defined by DOE, indicated that NO<INF>X  reductions of 45 to 50 percent would be achieved at wall-fired boilers  and of 35 to 37 percent would be achieved at tangentially fired boilers  (57 FR 55646-55647). DOE's NO<INF>X control technology performance  estimates were consistent with average NO<INF>X reductions projected by  the utilities. The utilities projected average NO<INF>X reductions of  47 percent with use of burner retrofits for wall-fired boilers and 35  to 37 percent with the use of LNCFS 1 for tangentially fired boilers  (Docket Item IV-D-111 at 59-61).<SUP>12 Further, the utilities  supported DOE's performance estimates in their brief to the Court in  Alabama Power (Docket Item VIII-A-1, Brief of Petitioners, July 1,  1994, at 18-19).        \12\Since the completion of DOE's analysis, other types of low  NO<INF>X burner technology have been developed for tangentially  fired boilers. See footnote 3 above. Although EPA currently lacks  data on the long-term performance of these NO<INF>X controls, the  outlook for their performance is promising.          DOE's analysis also showed that, assuming 45 percent control  efficiency for wall-fired boilers and 35 percent for tangentially fired  boilers, less than 10 percent of the Group 1 units would fail to meet  the presumptive limits (57 FR 55648). Further, the utilities similarly  concluded that ``review of the uncontrolled emissions at wall-fired and  tangentially fired boilers, and of the capabilities of low NO<INF>X  burner technology, show that (the presumptive) limits are aggressive  but generally achievable by most Group 1 units with the use of (low  NO<INF>X burners) alone'' (Docket Item IV-D-111 at 138). The utilities  reiterated this conclusion before the Court in Alabama Power. The  utilities stated that ``all of the tangentially fired boiler groupings  analyzed by EPA's contractor would comply with the final presumptive  emission limitation using low NO<INF>X burners alone for tangentially  fired boilers (i.e., LNCFS 1), without the use of separated overfire  air'' (Docket Item VIII-A-1, Brief of Petitioners at 40).     In the March 22, 1994 preamble, EPA did not adopt DOE's analysis  and instead presented its own analysis of control technology  performance data available after promulgation of the November 25, 1992  proposal. The EPA found that the majority of wall-fired boilers would  be expected to achieve NO<INF>X reductions of 40 to 50 percent using  low NO<INF>X burners only and no overfire air (59 FR 13546). The EPA  also found that tangentially fired boilers using LNCFS 1 would achieve  reduction of 20 to 25 percent. While EPA's finding on wall-fired  boilers is consistent with DOE's finding, the two analyses differ  concerning tangentially fired boilers. However, upon reconsideration,  the Agency finds that the 20 to 25 percent estimate of reductions  achievable using LNCFS 1 erroneously excluded the reductions using a  form of LNCFS 1 referred to in the March 22, 1994 preamble as ``LNCFS  1+.'' 59 FR 13546-13547. Because ``LNCFS 1+'' (i.e., Lansing Smith Unit  2)<SUP>13 employs the [[Page 18759]] same hardware (i.e., air nozzles  in the hole with the burner) as LNCFS 1 applications, there is no basis  of distinguishing ``LNCFS 1+''. The differences between EPA's and DOE's  data are eliminated by treating ``LNCFS 1+'' as included in LNCFS 1 and  considering the performance results of ``LNCFS 1+'' as included in  results for LNCFS 1.        \13\DOE's analysis included Fiddler's Ferry Unit 1 as a unit  with LNCFS 1. Since installation of LNCFS 1 in that unit involved  major modifications of the existing waterwall holes (i.e., cutting  out a waterwall section having a height of 3 feet above each  existing waterwall hole and a width equal to the width of the hole),  the unit's NO<INF>X control system does not fall within the new lowNO <INF>X-burner technology definition, which includes minor  modifications of the existing hole. See Docket Item II-E-11, Record  of Telephone Conversations, October 12, 1992. However, eliminating  the emission reduction results of that unit does not change the  conclusion that LNCFS 1 (e.g., at Lansing Smith Unit 2) can achieve  35 to 37 percent reductions.           Upon reconsideration, EPA concurs with the aforementioned DOE and  utilities' analyses. EPA, therefore, retains in the revised rule the  presumptive limits for Group 1 boilers.    C. Permit Status        Pursuant to the March 22, 1994 rule, the designated representatives  of Phase I units with wall-fired or tangentially-fired boilers  submitted NO<INF>X compliance plans. (See 59 FR 13567 (Sec. 76.9 (a)  through (c))). For units lacking Acid Rain permits, the NO<INF>X  compliance plans were submitted along with applications for such  permits. For units that already had Acid Rain permits covering SO<INF>2  emission limitations, the NO<INF>X compliance plans were submitted as  permit revisions. Most of the plans required NO<INF>X compliance  commencing on January 1, 1995. Twenty-five units had previously been  granted 2-year extensions for NO<INF>X compliance under Sec. 72.42, and  designated representatives for 6 more units requested 15-month  extensions under Sec. 76.12 of the March 22, 1994 rule.     The Agency followed the applicable permit issuance and revision  procedures under part 72 of the Acid Rain permits rule. These  procedures required notice of a proposed permit or proposed permit  revision and opportunity for public comment prior to issuance of a  final permit or final revised permit. Most of the submitted NO<INF>X  compliance plans were already approved and included in final permits or  final revised permits before the November 29, 1994 Alabama Power  decision vacating the March 22, 1994 rule. Because of the vacating of  the rule, the Agency has deferred action on those plans and extension  requests that were not yet approved when the Court issued its decision.     Under the March 22, 1994 rule, NO<INF>X compliance plans had to  identify which one of several possible compliance options was proposed  for each Phase I unit with a Group 1 boiler. Id. (Sec. 76.9(c)(4)). In  the NO<INF>X compliance plans already submitted to the Agency, units  sought to comply either with the presumptive limits or through NO<INF>X  emissions averaging plans. The units that requested NO<INF>X compliance  extensions sought to comply either with the presumptive limits or  through NO<INF>X emissions averaging plans after the extensions expire.     If, as anticipated, the revised rule becomes final and thereby  reinstates the NO<INF>X emission reduction program, the Agency sees no  need for utilities to resubmit and for EPA to reissue, through notice  and comment procedures, the NO<INF>X compliance plans that have already  been approved and issued in final form in permits or permit revisions.  The final permits and permit revisions set forth the applicable  NO<INF>X emission limitations and do not state any definition for low  NO<INF>X burner technology. The revised rule changes the low-NO<INF>Xburner -technology definition but does not change the presumptive limits  or the formulas for setting individual-unit limits or showing group  compliance in averaging plans. The revised rule preserves without  change the provisions governing the Phase I extensions that were  requested and either were approved or that would have been approved  under the March 22, 1994 rule. The revised rule also does not change  the application requirements in Sec. 76.9 or the permit issuance or  permit revision procedures in parts 72 and 76 applicable to NO<INF>X  compliance plans.      The only changes that the revised rule makes in the submitted  NO<INF>X compliance plans are in the general compliance date and in the  effect of group compliance on individual-unit limits in NO<INF>X  averaging plans. The general deadline for compliance by a Group 1,  Phase I unit with NO<INF>X emission limitations is now the later of  January 1, 1996 (rather than 1995) or the date on which a unit is  subject to SO<INF>2 emission reduction requirements under section  404(d) of the Act. The revised rule also mandates, for all NO<INF>X  averaging plans, that where the units in an averaging plan show they  meet the group compliance requirement, the units are deemed to meet  their individual-unit limits. All NO<INF>X compliance plans must  conform to the revised rule.      As discussed above, the Agency has issued, elsewhere in this  Federal Register, a notice of proposal requesting comments on the  provisions of the revised rule. Any comments concerning the compliance  deadline and the group compliance provisions should be made in response  to that notice and would not be appropriate in the context of permit  issuance. All other aspects of the submitted NO<INF>X compliance plans  have already been subject to notice and comment and are unchanged by  the revised rule.      The Agency concludes that, once the revised rule becomes final as  anticipated, conforming changes in the compliance date and group  compliance provisions in otherwise unchanged NO<INF>X compliance plans  are properly considered administrative amendments under Sec. 72.83 of  the Acid Rain permits rule because there is no basis for requiring  notice and comment on the changes. All existing permits that include  NO<INF>X compliance plans will be amended under Sec. 72.83 to the  extent necessary to make them consistent with the new compliance date  and group compliance requirements. The administrative amendments will  reinstate the NO<INF>X compliance plans as amended and the approved  Phase I NO<INF>X compliance extensions under Secs. 72.42 and 76.12 that  are referenced in the plans.      With regard to NO<INF>X compliance plans in permits or permit  revisions issued in draft form for public comment but not yet issued in  final form, the Agency will complete the issuance procedure in  accordance with the revised rule once the rule becomes final. Since,  except for the compliance date and group compliance provisions, neither  the substance of such plans nor the issuance procedures were changed by  the revised rule, there is no need to reopen the public comment period  on the plans.      Any plans that have not yet been issued in draft form will also be  processed by the Agency in accordance with the revised rule and part  72. Similarly, any Phase I NO<INF>X compliance extensions requested  under Sec. 76.12 and not acted on before November 29, 1994 will be  acted on consistent with the revised rule. It should be noted that, if  significant, adverse comment is timely received on relevant portions of  the instant direct final rule, the NO<INF>X compliance plans could be  subject to further change depending on the outcome of the rulemaking  initiated by the notice of proposed rule issued elsewhere in this  Federal Register.    IV. Administrative Requirements    A. Executive Order 12866        Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735 (October 4, 1993)), the  Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is ``significant''  and therefore subject to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) review  and the requirements of the Executive Order. The Order defines  ``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a  rule that may:      (1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or  adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the  economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the  [[Page 18760]] environment, public health or safety, or State, local,  or tribal governments or communities;      (2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an  action taken or planned by another agency;     (3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants,  user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients  thereof; or      (4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal  mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in  the Executive Order.      Pursuant to the terms of Executive Order 12866, it has been  determined that this rule is a ``significant regulatory action''  because it will have an annual effect on the economy of approximately  $276 million starting in 2000. As such, this action was submitted to  OMB for review. Any written comments from OMB to EPA and any written  EPA response to those comments are included in the docket. The docket  is available for public inspection at the EPA's Air Docket Section,  which is listed in the ADDRESSES section of this preamble.     EPA does not believe a revised Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) is  needed for the direct final rule, which, in large part, reinstates the  March 22, 1994 rule and which imposes no new costs beyond what costs  were estimated in the RIA to the March 22, 1994 rule. The EPA does not  anticipate major increases in prices, costs, or other significant  adverse effects on competition, investment, productivity, or innovation  or on the ability of U.S. enterprises to compete with foreign  enterprises in domestic or foreign markets due to the final rule.     In assessing the impacts of a regulation, it is important to  examine: (1) The costs to the regulated community, (2) the costs that  are passed on to customers of the regulated community, and (3) the  impact of these cost increases on the financial health and  competitiveness of both the regulated community and their customers.  The costs of this rule to electric utilities are generally very small  relative to their annual revenues. (However, the relative amount of the  costs will definitely vary in individual cases.) Moreover, EPA expects  that most or all utility expenses from meeting NO<INF>X requirements  will be passed along to ratepayers. When NO<INF>X requirements are  fully implemented in the year 2000, consumer electric utility rates are  expected to rise by 0.12 percent on average due to this rulemaking.  Consequently, the rule is not likely to have an impact on utility  profits or competitiveness.    B. Unfunded Mandates Act        Section 202 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (``Unfunded  Mandates Act'') (signed into law on March 22, 1995) requires that the  Agency prepare a budgetary impact statement before promulgating a rule  that includes a Federal mandate that may result in expenditure by  State, local, and tribal governments, in the aggregate, or by the  private sector, of $100 million or more in any one year. The budgetary  impact statement must include: (i) Identification of the Federal law  under which the rule is promulgated; (ii) a qualitative and  quantitative assessment of anticipated costs and benefits of the  Federal mandate and an analysis of the extent to which such costs to  State, local, and tribal governments may be paid with Federal financial  assistance; (iii) if feasible, estimates of the future compliance costs  and any disproportionate budgetary effects of the mandate; (iv) if  feasible, estimates of the effect on the national economy; and (v) a  description of the Agency's prior consultation with elected  representatives of State, local, and tribal governments and a summary  and evaluation of the comments and concerns presented. Section 203  provides that if any small governments may be significantly or uniquely  impacted by the rule, the Agency must establish a plan for obtaining  input from and informing, educating, and advising any such potentially  affected small governments.      Under section 205 of the Unfunded Mandates Act, the Agency must  identify and consider a reasonable number of regulatory alternatives  before promulating a rule for which a budgetary impact statement must  be prepared. The Agency must select from those alternatives the least  costly, most cost-effective, or least burdensome alternative, for  State, local, and tribal governments and the private sector, that  achieves the objectives of the rule, unless the Agency explains why  this alternative is not selected or unless the selection of this  alternative is inconsistent with law.      Because this direct final rule is estimated to result in the  expenditure by State, local, and tribal governments, in aggregate, or  the private sector of over $100 million per year starting in 2000, EPA  has prepared a supplement to the Regulatory Impact Statement in  compliance with the Unfunded Mandates Act. EPA summarizes that  supplement as follows.      The direct final rule is promulgated under section 407 of the Clean  Air Act. The rule is issued in response to a remand by the U.S. Court  of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and, in large part,  reinstates the remanded March 22, 1994 rule. Thus, the analysis in the  RIA developed in preparation of the March 22, 1994 rule was  appropriately considered in response to the requirements of the  Unfunded Mandates Act.      Total expenditures resulting from the direct final rule are  estimated at: $69 million (of which less than $1 million is by State,  local, and tribal governments) per year in 1995-1999; and $276 million  (of which $21 million is by State, local, and tribal governments) per  year starting in 2000. There are no federal funds available to assist  State, local, and tribal governments in meeting these costs. There are  important benefits from NO<INF>X emission reductions because  atmospheric emissions of NO<INF>X have significant, adverse impacts on  human health and welfare and on the environment.     The rule does not have any disproportionate budgetary effects on  any particular region of the nation, any State, local, or tribal  government, or urban or rural or other type of community. On the  contrary, the rule will result in only a minimal increase in average  electricity rates. Moreover, the rule will not have a material effect  on the national economy.      Prior to issuing the March 22, 1994 rule, EPA provided numerous  opportunities, e.g., through the Acid Rain Advisory Committee  proceedings, the public comment period, and public hearings, for  consultation with interested parties, including State, local, and  tribal governments. In general, State and local environmental agencies  advocated that EPA adopt more stringent environmental controls while  municipally-owned utilities advocated less stringent controls and more  compliance flexibility. EPA evaluated the comments and concerns  expressed, and the direct final rule reflects, to the extent consistent  with section 407 of the Clean Air Act, those comments and concerns.  While small governments are not significantly or uniquely affected by  the rule, these procedures, as well as additional public conferences  and meetings, gave small governments an opportunity to give meaningful  and timely input and obtain information, education, and advice on  compliance.      The Agency considered several regulatory options in developing the  rule. The option selected in the direct final rule is the least costly  and least burdensome alternative currently available for achieving the  objectives of [[Page 18761]] section 407. The Agency rejected another  alternative that was the most cost-effective alternative because the  U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit held that the latter  alternative was beyond the Agency's statutory authority.    C. Paperwork Reduction Act        The OMB has approved the information collection requirements  contained in this rule under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction  Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501, et seq., and has assigned OMB control  number 2060-0258.      Public reporting burden for this collection of information is  estimated at 27,510 hours for all respondents through May 15, 1995.  This estimate includes time for reviewing instructions, searching  existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and  completing and reviewing the collection of information.     The Agency notes that this burden estimate was originally developed  based on the March 22, 1994 rule. Today's direct final rule includes  revisions to cost reporting requirements in the March 22, 1994 rule  that result in a small reduction in overall burden. In order to account  for this small reduction, the Agency will submit an adjustment to the  current Information Collection Report.      Send comments regarding this change in the information collection  requirements or any other aspect of this collection of information,  including suggestions for reducing the burden, to Chief, Information  Policy Branch (PM-223Y), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M  Street SW., Washington, DC 20460; and to the Paperwork Reduction  Project, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of  Management and Budget, 726 Jackson Place NW., Washington, DC 20503,  marked ``Attention: Desk Officer for EPA.''    D. Regulatory Flexibility Act        The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601, et seq.) requires EPA  to consider potential impacts of proposed regulations on small business  ``entities.'' If a preliminary analysis indicates that a proposed  regulation would have a significant economic impact on 20 percent or  more of small entities, then a regulatory flexibility analysis must be  prepared.      Current Regulatory Flexibility Act guidelines indicate that an  economic impact should be considered significant if it meets one of the  following criteria: (1) Compliance increases annual production costs by  more than 5 percent, assuming costs are passed onto consumers; (2)  compliance costs as a percentage of sales for small entities are at  least 10 percent more than compliance costs as a percentage of sales  for large entities; (3) capital costs of compliance represent a  ``significant'' portion of capital available to small entities,  considering internal cash flow plus external financial capabilities; or  (4) regulatory requirements are likely to result in closures of small  entities.      Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, a small business is any  ``small business concern'' as identified by the Small Business  Administration under section 3 of the Small Business Act. As of January  1, 1991, the Small Business Administration had established the size  threshold for small electric services companies at 4 million megawatt  hours per year. Because all of the utilities affected by Phase I of the  Acid Rain regulations have generating capacities greater than 4 million  megawatt hours, EPA believes that no small businesses are affected by  today's revised rule. The EPA's initial estimates are that the burden  on small utilities under Phase II is minimal.     Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify  that this rule, if promulgated, will not have a significant adverse  impact on a substantial number of small entities.    E. Miscellaneous        In accordance with section 117 of the Act, publication of this rule  was preceded by consultation with appropriate advisory committees,  independent experts, and federal departments and agencies.    List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 76        Acid rain program, Air pollution control, Nitrogen oxide,  Incorporation by reference, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.        Dated: March 31, 1995.  Carol M. Browner,  Administrator.      Title 40, chapter I, of the Code of Federal Regulations is amended  as follows:      Part 76 is revised to read as follows:   PART 76--ACID RAIN NITROGEN OXIDES EMISSION REDUCTION PROGRAM    Sec.  76.1  Applicability.  76.2  Definitions.  76.3  General Acid Rain Program provisions. 76.4  Incorporation by reference.  76.5  NO<INF>X emission limitations for Group 1 boilers. 76.6  NO<INF>X emission limitations for Group 2 boilers.

Appendix A to Part 76--Phase I Affected Coal-Fired Utility Units with  Group 1 or Cell Burner Boilers    Appendix B to Part 76--Procedures And Methods For Estimating Costs Of  Nitrogen Oxides Controls Applied To Group 1, Phase I Boilers        Authority: 42 U.S.C. 7601 and 7651 et seq.     Sec. 76.1  Applicability.        (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this  section, the provisions apply to each coal-fired utility unit that is  subject to an Acid Rain emissions limitation or reduction requirement  for SO<INF>2 under Phase I or Phase II pursuant to sections 404, 405,  or 409 of the Act.      (b) The emission limitations for NO<INF>X under this part apply to  each affected coal-fired utility unit subject to section 404(d) or  409(b) of the Act on the date the unit is required to meet the Acid  Rain emissions reduction requirement for SO<INF>2.     (c) The provisions of this part apply to each coal-fired  substitution unit or compensating unit, designated and approved as a  Phase I unit pursuant to Secs. 72.41 or 72.43 of this chapter as  follows:      (1) A coal-fired substitution unit that is designated in a  substitution plan that is approved and active as of January 1, 1995  shall be treated as a Phase I coal-fired utility unit for purposes of  this part. In the event the designation of such unit as a substitution  unit is terminated after December 31, 1995, pursuant to Sec. 72.41 of  this chapter and the unit is no longer required to meet Phase I  SO<INF>2 emissions limitations, the provisions of this part (including  those applicable in Phase I) will continue to apply.     (2) A coal-fired substitution unit that is designated in a  substitution plan that is not approved or not active as of January 1,  1995, or a coal-fired compensating unit, shall be treated as a Phase II  coal-fired utility unit for purposes of this part.     (d) The provisions of this part for Phase I units apply to each  coal-fired transfer unit governed by a Phase I extension plan, approved  pursuant to [[Page 18762]] Sec. 72.42 of this chapter, on January 1,  1997. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, a coal-fired transfer  unit shall be subject to the Acid Rain emissions limitations for  nitrogen oxides beginning on January 1, 1996 if, for that year, a  transfer unit is allocated fewer Phase I extension reserve allowances  than the maximum amount that the designated representative could have  requested in accordance with Sec. 72.42(c)(5) of this chapter (as  adjusted under Sec. 72.42(d) of this chapter) unless the transfer unit  is the last unit allocated Phase I extension reserve allowances under  the plan.     Sec. 76.2  Definitions.        All terms used in this part shall have the meaning set forth in the  Act, in Sec. 72.2 of this chapter, and in this section as follows:     Alternative contemporaneous annual emission limitation means the  maximum allowable NO<INF>X emission rate (on a lb/mmBtu, annual average  basis) assigned to an individual unit in a NO<INF>X emissions averaging  plan pursuant to Sec. 76.10.      Alternative technology means a control technology for reducing  NO<INF>X emissions that is outside the scope of the definition of low  NO<INF>X burner technology. Alternative technology does not include  overfire air as applied to wall-fired boilers or separated overfire air  as applied to tangentially fired boilers.     Approved clean coal technology demonstration project means a  project using funds appropriated under the Department of Energy's  ``Clean Coal Technology Demonstration Program,'' up to a total amount  of $2,500,000,000 for commercial demonstration of clean coal  technology, or similar projects funded through appropriations for the  Environmental Protection Agency. The Federal contribution for a  qualifying project shall be at least 20 percent of the total cost of  the demonstration project.      Cell burner boiler means a wall-fired boiler that utilizes two or  three circular burners combined into a single vertically oriented  assembly that results in a compact, intense flame. Any low NO<INF>X  retrofit of a cell burner boiler that reuses the existing cell burner,  close-coupled wall opening configuration would not change the  designation of the unit as a cell burner boiler.     Coal-fired utility unit means a utility unit in which the  combustion of coal (or any coal-derived fuel) on a Btu basis exceeds  50.0 percent of its annual heat input, for Phase I units in calendar  year 1990 and, for Phase II units in the calendar year 1995. For the  purposes of this part, this definition shall apply notwithstanding the  definition at Sec. 72.2 of this chapter.     Cyclone boiler means a boiler with one or more water-cooled  horizontal cylindrical chambers in which coal combustion takes place.  The horizontal cylindrical chamber(s) is (are) attached to the bottom  of the furnace. One or more cylindrical chambers are arranged either on  one furnace wall or on two opposed furnace walls. Gaseous combustion  products exiting from the chamber(s) turn 90 degrees to go up through  the boiler while coal ash exits the bottom of the boiler as a molten  slag.      Demonstration period means a period of time not less than 15  months, approved under Sec. 76.10, for demonstrating that the affected  unit cannot meet the applicable emission limitation under Secs. 76.5,  76.6, or 76.7 and establishing the minimum NO<INF>X emission rate that  the unit can achieve during long-term load dispatch operation.     Dry bottom means the boiler has a furnace bottom temperature below  the ash melting point and the bottom ash is removed as a solid.     Economizer means the lowest temperature heat exchange section of a  utility boiler where boiler feed water is heated by the flue gas.     Flue gas means the combustion products arising from the combustion  of fossil fuel in a utility boiler.      Group 1 boiler means a tangentially fired boiler or a dry bottom  wall-fired boiler (other than a unit applying cell burner technology).     Group 2 boiler means a wet bottom wall-fired boiler, a cyclone  boiler, a boiler applying cell burner technology, a vertically fired  boiler, an arch-fired boiler, or any other type of utility boiler (such  as a fluidized bed or stoker boiler) that is not a Group 1 boiler.     Low NO<INF>X burners and low NO<INF>X burner technology means  commercially available combustion modification NO<INF>X controls that  minimize NO<INF>X formation by introducing coal and its associated  combustion air into a boiler such that initial combustion occurs in a  manner that promotes rapid coal devolatilization in a fuel-rich (i.e.,  oxygen deficient) environment and introduces additional air to achieve  a final fuel-lean (i.e., oxygen rich) environment to complete the  combustion process. This definition shall include the staging of any  portion of the combustion air using air nozzles or registers located  inside any waterwall hole that includes a burner. This definition shall  exclude the staging of any portion of the combustion air using air  nozzles or ports located outside any waterwall hole that includes a  burner (commonly referred to as NO<INF>X ports or separated overfire  air ports).      Operating period means a period of time of not less than three  consecutive months and that occurs not more than one month prior to  applying for an alternative emission limitation demonstration period  under Sec. 76.10, during which the owner or operator of an affected  unit that cannot meet the applicable emission limitation:     (1) Operates the installed NO<INF>X emission controls in accordance  with primary vendor specifications and procedures, with the unit  operating under normal conditions; and      (2) records and reports quality-assured continuous emission  monitoring (CEM) and unit operating data according to the methods and  procedures in part 75 of this chapter.      Primary vendor means the vendor of the NO<INF>X emission control  system who has primary responsibility for providing the equipment,  service, and technical expertise necessary for detailed design,  installation, and operation of the controls, including process data,  mechanical drawings, operating manuals, or any combination thereof.     Reburning means reducing the coal and combustion air to the main  burners and injecting a reburn fuel (such as gas or oil) to create a  fuel-rich secondary combustion zone above the main burner zone and  final combustion air to create a fuel-lean burnout zone. The formation  of NO<INF>X is inhibited in the main burner zone due to the reduced  combustion intensity, and NO<INF>X is destroyed in the fuel-rich  secondary combustion zone by conversion to molecular nitrogen.     Selective catalytic reduction means a noncombustion control  technology that destroys NO<INF>X by injecting a reducing agent (e.g.,  ammonia) into the flue gas that, in the presence of a catalyst (e.g.,  vanadium, titanium, or zeolite), converts NO<INF>X into molecular  nitrogen and water.      Selective noncatalytic reduction means a noncombustion control  technology that destroys NO<INF>X by injecting a reducing agent (e.g.,  ammonia, urea, or cyanuric acid) into the flue gas, downstream of the  combustion zone that converts NO<INF>X to molecular nitrogen, water,  and when urea or cyanuric acid are used, to carbon dioxide (CO<INF>2).     Stoker boiler means a boiler that burns solid fuel in a bed, on a  stationary or moving grate, that is located at the bottom of the  furnace.      Tangentially fired boiler means a boiler that has coal and air  nozzles mounted in each corner of the furnace where the vertical  furnace walls meet. Both pulverized coal and air are  [[Page 18763]] directed from the furnace corners along a line  tangential to a circle lying in a horizontal plane of the furnace.     Turbo-fired boiler means a pulverized coal, wall-fired boiler with  burners arranged on walls so that the individual flames extend down  toward the furnace bottom and then turn back up through the center of  the furnace.      Wall-fired boiler means a boiler that has pulverized coal burners  arranged on the walls of the furnace. The burners have discrete,  individual flames that extend perpendicularly into the furnace area.     Wet bottom means the boiler has a furnace bottom temperature above  the ash melting point and the bottom ash is removed as a liquid.     Sec. 76.3  General Acid Rain Program provisions.        The following provisions of part 72 of this chapter shall apply to  this part:      (a) Sec. 72.2  (Definitions);      (b) Sec. 72.3  (Measurements, abbreviations, and acronyms);     (c) Sec. 72.4  (Federal authority);     (d) Sec. 72.5  (State authority);      (e) Sec. 72.6  (Applicability);      (f) Sec. 72.7  (New unit exemption);     (g) Sec. 72.8  (Retired units exemption);     (h) Sec. 72.9  (Standard requirements);     (i) Sec. 72.10  (Availability of information); and     (j) Sec. 72.11  (Computation of time).

(a) The owner or operator may use the following tests as a basis  for the report required by Sec. 76.10(e)(7):     (1) Conduct an ultimate analysis of coal using ASTM D 3176-89  (incorporated by reference as specified in Sec. 76.4);     (2) Conduct a proximate analysis of coal using ASTM D 3172-89  (incorporated by reference as specified in Sec. 76.4); and     (3) Measure the coal mass flow rate to each individual burner using  ASME Power Test Code 4.2 (1991), ``Test Code for Coal Pulverizers'' or  ISO 9931 (1991), ``Coal--Sampling of Pulverized Coal Conveyed by Gases  in Direct Fired Coal Systems'' (incorporated by reference as specified  in Sec. 76.4).      (b) The owner or operator may measure and record the actual  NO<INF>X emission rate in accordance with the requirements of this part  while varying the following parameters where possible to determine  their effects on the emissions of NO<INF>X from the affected boiler:     (1) Excess air levels;      (2) Settings of burners or coal and air nozzles, including tilt and  yaw, or swirl;      (3) For tangentially fired boilers, distribution of combustion air  within the NO<INF>X emission control system;     (4) Coal mass flow rates to each individual burner;     (5) Coal-to-primary air ratio (based on pound per hour) for each  burner, the average coal-to-primary air ratio for all burners, and the  deviations of individual burners' coal-to-primary air ratios from the  average value; and      (6) If the boiler uses varying types of coal, the type of coal.  Provide the results of proximate and ultimate analyses of each type of  as-fired coal.      (c) In performing the tests specified in paragraph (a) of this  section, the owner or operator shall begin the tests using the  equipment settings for which the NO<INF>X emission control system was  designed to meet the NO<INF>X emission rate guaranteed by the primary  NO<INF>X emission control system vendor. These results constitute the  ``baseline controlled'' condition.      (d) After establishing the baseline controlled condition under  paragraph (c) of this section, the owner or operator may:     (1) Change excess air levels <plus-minus> 5 percent from the  baseline controlled condition to determine the effects on emissions of  NO<INF>X, by providing a minimum of three readings (e.g., with a  baseline reading of 20 percent excess air, excess air levels will be  changed to 19 percent and 21 percent);      (2) For tangentially fired boilers, change the distribution of  combustion air within the NO<INF>X emission control system to determine  the effects on NO<INF>X emissions by providing a minimum of three  readings, one with the minimum, one with the baseline, and one with the  maximum amounts of staged combustion air; and     (3) Show that the combustion process within the boiler is optimized  (e.g., that the burners are balanced).

GX063-51-3279382	Media Fact Sheets                Fact Sheet:  Acid Rain        What is acid rain?        Acid rain, also known as acid deposition, is a broad term used to describe several ways that acids fall from the atmosphere and adversely impact the environment.   Sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions are the pollutants that contribute to the formation of acid rain. Power plants are major sources of both SO 2  and NOx, while industry and automobiles have been shown to be major emitters of NOx.    The U.S. EPA estimates that about two-thirds of all SO 2  and one-third of all NOx emissions come from electric power generation that relies on burning fossil fuels like coal.       How does acid rain occur?      Acid rain occurs when gases react in the atmosphere with water, oxygen and other chemicals to form various acidic compounds. Sunlight increases the rate of most of these reactions.   Acid rain comes in two forms: wet and dry deposition.   Wet deposition refers to acidic rain, fog and snow. As this acidic water flows over and through the ground, it affects soils, waterways and a variety of plants and animals.   Dry deposition refers to the acidic gases and particles in the atmosphere that fall back to earth. According to the U.S. EPA, about half the acidity in the atmosphere falls in the form of dry deposition. The wind blows these acidic particles and gases onto buildings, cars, homes and trees.      Why is acid rain a concern?      Acid rain causes a variety of effects that harm or kill individual fish, reduce fish population numbers, completely eliminate fish species from a waterbody and decrease bio-diversity.   Acid rain has been shown to slow plant growth and cause harm to forests.   Acid rain weakens trees by damaging their leaves, limiting the nutrients available to them, or exposing them to toxic substances slowly released from the soil.   Automotive coatings may be damaged by acid rain, especially when dry acidic deposition is mixed with dew or rain.    Acid rain contributes to the corrosion of metals, such as bronze, and the deterioration of paint and stone, such as marble and limestone. These effects damage buildings, bridges and cultural objects, such as statues, monuments, and tombstones.    What is being done to reduce acid rain?        In 1978 the U.S. EPA instituted the Acid Deposition Control Program, which requires reductions of SO 2  and NOx emissions by 2010. Under this program, the U.S. EPA established criteria for power plants to reduce emissions by 10 million tons from 1980 levels. NOx emissions are to be reduced by two million tons each year compared to levels before 1990.    According to the U.S. EPA, Indiana has reduced SO 2  emissions from utilities by 50 percent from 1990 levels.   Power plants are required to follow permit guidelines set by local, state and federal environmental agencies to reduce SO2 and NOx emissions. Examples of techniques these facilities are using include the installation of scrubbers and selective catalytic reduction systems and switching to coal that has a lower sulfur content.   Automobiles, which are a major source of NOx, are required to have catalytic convertors to reduce emissions.   Recent studies have shown a measurable decrease of acidity levels in rainfall throughout northeastern states, indicating a strong correlation between SO 2  emission decreases from utilities and an improvement in rainfall acidity.     What can I do to help reduce acid rain?          The following steps help reduce demand on power plants and in return, reduce the amount of pollution that can contribute to acid deposition:      Turn off lights, computers and other appliances when you’re not using them.   Use energy efficient appliances: lighting, air conditioners, heaters, refrigerators, washing machines, etc.   Only use electric appliances when you need them.   Keep your thermostat at 68 degrees F in the winter and 72 degrees F in the summer.   Insulate your home as best as you can.   Carpool, use public transportation, walk or ride your bicycle whenever possible.   Maintain automobiles and ensure they are operating properly.    Where can I get more information?

GX230-52-15402873	"May 03  The Next California Economy: Hybrid Technologies  Dr. Woodrow Clark Senior Policy Advisor to the Director Governor's Office of Planning and Research State of California Sacramento, CA 95814 And Governor's Office 300 Spring Street 16th Floor Los Angeles, CA 90013 Direct Line + (310) 620-6013 Email woody.clark@opr.ca.gov   Introduction The California energy crisis, which was a challenge and even an opportunity (Clark, 2001) had been attributed to a number of issues. The economic experiences labeled it a ""flawed' or even ""dysfunctional"" market due to not being structured properly (Economist, July and August 2001). Economic experts even wrote an Energy Manifesto in early 2001 that called for California to let market forces do their work and all would be well (NL, 2001). Prestigious institutions for energy research proclaimed California's energy market problems were the result of politicians and decision makers interfering with ""market forces"" (Borenstein et. al., 2001). But the criticism did not stop there. International groups claimed that the market was never created in California to ""properly allow "" energy supply and demand"" to take place. The Congressional Budget Office declared that California was an anomaly (CBO, 2001). The market was simply done wrong. President Bush and his appointees to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission sounded the same theme. Until as Skelton (2002) wrote in the Spring of 2002, the ""smoking gun"" was found. California was subject to energy shortages that were aggregated by market manipulation. Evidence gathered since by the California Attorney General's Office and the California Public Utility Commission appear to substantiate the allegations. When comparisons are made with other countries and states (Bachrach, 2001), it is clear that variations exist in each energy sector according to governmental policies. The common denominator over the last decade, however, has been de-regulation or as they call it in Europe ""privatization"" and ""liberalization."" Herein is the fundamental flaw -energy is a public good and delegated to the public sector to oversee for every citizen, much like water, waste, and the environment. While California is pursuing legal remedies and to secure its energy supply, the energy challenge has meant that the State must create a new energy sector. Indeed, As California Governor Davis said, the state needs to achieve ""energy independence"" (Davis, 2001) so that such market manipulation does not occur again. More importantly, the State needs to diversify its energy supply and expand into clean renewable energy sources. These public good initiatives take resources that promote intermittent resources and provide cost competitive energy.  From California Energy Crisis to Challenges and New Opportunities In 2000 research began in which Lund and Clark (2001) published the first of several articles on renewable energy papers in the context of nation-state power systems labeled ""Civic Markets"" (2002), Lund (2001) and Clark (2003). Civic markets are the combination of public oversight with private sector companies providing goods and services under contracts, procurement and bond financing mechanisms. In some cases, these companies might form new firms that include government appointed officials on their boards (Clark and Jensen, 2001).   The key is that government needs to be involved in the creation and decision-making of companies that impact public sectors like energy (Clark and Morris, 2002). Energy, like water, waste and the environment (including atmosphere) is a public good. As such, public oversight must be applied to these sectors. California has the evidence to demonstrate why ""public monopolies can not give way to private ones"". Instead, any government must exist to protect and promote the public good. This perspective is very different from prior California republican administrations as noted by past CPUC President and current Commissioner Loretta Lynch in late 2002: In December 1982, Gov.-elect George Deukmejian inherited the finest energy policy and regulatory agencies in the nation. By December 1998, Gov.- elect Gray Davis was left with a California that had dismantled its energy policy and hobbled its regulators in reckless pursuit of deregulation. The Wilson administration had stripped California of its ability to supply its citizens' energy needs and protect its economy from energy predators. In so doing, deregulation ideologues gave energy marketeers a golden opportunity to loot our economy -- and that's exactly what they did. (Lynch, 2002) Governor Davis said in his State of the State address in January 2001 that, ""a dysfunctional energy market, driven by out-of-state energy companies and brokers, is threatening to disrupt people's lives and damage our economy."" Since then the facts, documents and court records concur with the Governor's analysis. Energy is a ""common good"" or public trust that can not be left to the devices of ""market forces."" The Governor has stated, and growing choruses of citizens concur that ""skyrocketing prices, pricegouging and an unreliable supply of electricity"" must be part of the responsibility of government. Subsequently, emergency sessions and measures in the California from 2000 through 2002 yielded many bills that included formation of the California Power Authority charged with the mission of providing reliable ""clean"" energy to the State (CPA, 2002) along with conservation/efficiency programs (Consumer Agency, 2001) and emergency services (Consumer Agency, 2001). By the summer of 2002, California Governor Davis signed a ""greenhouse gas"" bill and soon thereafter a Renewable Portfolio Standard"" of 20% by the year 2017 (OPR, 2002). Even perhaps more significant, based on the Commission for the 21st Century (Commission, 20010, the State enacted a law for an Environmental Goals Policy Report (EGPR) which would for the first time in over 25 years require the State to work with local communities in planning for the future (OPR, 2002). By the end of 2002, the ""five-member California Public Utilities Commission unanimously voted to cancel an order from April 20, 1994, that set the state on a course advocates said would bring cheaper electricity through free-market competition, letting homeowners and businesses choose their power provider. Instead, prices soared, supplies tightened and blackouts resulted during 2000 and 2001."" (Rose, 2003). Commissioner Lynch put it more bluntly, since the State could not also get federal support ""the CPUC has relentlessly pressed the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to order the powergougers to pay back what they plundered. We provided the FERC with clear evidence of the power-sellers' wrongdoing, and the key players now admit to it. Yet the FERC   stonewalls California's claims that California was swindled and that the state is entitled to a $9 billion refund from the manipulators. (Lynch, 2002) Rose quoted CPUC Commissioner Carl Wood as saying that ""The commission should close this deregulation proceeding, not just because there is no continuing need for it, but also because it was a disaster for ratepayers, utilities and their employees,"" Commissioner Wood called deregulation ""the most expensive public policy mistake in the history of California."" The disaster was caused, he said, by the former utility commission's ""almost religious belief in market forces rather than regulation."" (Rose, 2003) Crafting a new energy market in California is a daunting task. For example, Clark and Bradshaw (2003) put forward the concept of ""Agile Energy Systems"" as necessary in any nation or country to protect and advance the public good. Quarterly financial returns or ""short-termism"" for private companies will not achieve societal goals (Demirag, 1998). Energy systems must be far more dispersed, distributed and regional (Isherwood, 2000) especially if energy is to be both ""clean"" and primarily renewable and reliable or guaranteed to all citizens. California had always assumed the latter role and with the energy challenge in 2000-2002, took upon itself to advance and set renewable energy goals.  De-regulation -- lessons learned From a September 23, 1996 Press Release, then Governor Pete Wilson called energy deregulation ""landmark legislation"" and said it was ""A major step in our efforts to guarantee lower rates, provide customer choice and offer reliable service, so no one is literally left in the dark"" (Wilson, 1996). As noted above none of that happened. Instead California, like many other states saw a few companies control energy supply and generation. Hence, market manipulation could be done by simply controlling the electrons flowing into the state. The ""market power"" that most academics, politicians and some businesses expected to gain from deregulation turned into market monopoly for the generators that were selling electricity to California. Benson reports in late 2002 that utilities -- central grid operators -- see local communities and cities ""unplugging"" from the energy system. Deregulation has been rolled back with increasing numbers of communities now passing ballot measures for funds to underwrite their own independent energy systems (Benson, 2002). As economic commentator Robert Kuttner labels de-regulation in a BusinessWeek article, ""Enron (is) a powerful blow to market fundamentalists"". In other words, says Kuttner, for decades academics have taught what is referred to as ""neo-classical"" economics to ""gullible undergraduates and journalists, (saying) that there is no such thing as the public interest."" The Enron collapse proved to Californians, and now the nation, how wrong and how dangerous such an economic ideology was. Kuttner adds that, while the de-regulated energy sector had just taken root in California, the ""de-regulated"" transportation industry had been acting in its own best interests and against the public interests for over a decade by reducing costs, cutting corners, services   and security. He makes a compelling argument that certain sectors (energy, environment, waste, transportation among them) are in the public good and need to be public and private partnerships under what can called ""civic markets. Clark and Morris (2002) note how this process worked in California when the State government sought to lead a collaboration between industry and the California Independent System Operators (CAISO) for scheduling intermittent resources into the grid. Upon reflection of the events from 911, some experts wonder if part of the problem with the transportation (e.g. airline industry) was the same thing: de-regulation of that industry meant lower costs to be competitive and hence savings drawn from inexpensive security measures. Today, of course, air transportation is now once again ""regulated"" with the presence of newly trained workers and more sophisticated equipment. Many reasonable observers now argue that while energy de-regulation was a failure in California the sector should not be re-regulated either. Nor should the energy sector be subjected again to the so-called ""market forces"" or business ""power"" advocated by most free market economists. The past few years in California saw enormous financial advantage taken by out-of -state energy suppliers, Enron among them. The issue of energy generators reaping exorbitant profits from the public can not be tolerated again under any political administration. Closer scrutiny is being taken on the federal level and internationally in Asia and Europe. As Commissioner Lynch noted (Lynch, 2002): FERC ignores it all, and continues to push its deregulation agenda at the expense of the American public. With a fervor that flouts reality, the agency whose duty is to protect the energy-buying public instead shields the wrongdoers in order to ""let deregulation work."" This bitter lesson for California can only be remedied by Congress' curbing both the energy-sellers' market power and the FERC's actions of covering its back by refusing to enforce the law. The harsh lessons of deregulation make it clear that we must act to protect our own interests. The Legislature and Gov. Davis have scaled back and even suspended some of the more pernicious aspects of the 1996 deregulation law. Now is the time for California to complete that job and eliminate all vestiges of its now infamous deregulation experiment. Since the turn of the century, when the electricity industry was in its infancy and unregulated energy-sellers first held the nation hostage, the nation understood the value of regulating the energy industry. As the Federal Power Act made clear then, California must reiterate now, the power industry overseers and the powersellers are accountable to the public. Enormous advances were made in public policy in California as it sought to regain control over its energy. However, the system still remains transitional and in need of transformation. Lowest costs for energy can not, for example, be the only variable for energy supply. Simple neo-classical economic models do not work with public sector goods and services (Clark and Fast, 2003). Historically, lowest costs for energy or   environmentally sound technologies, like many other public goods has been due to large sums of federal and government research and development investment (Science, 1997). However, with private companies, the concern for making profits does not lend itself well for new research and development (Clark, 1997). Energy in particular suffers from the stigma of being perceived as ""stogy industries"" of smoke stacks and antiquated technologies. Hence, companies and employees are not provided with funds and resources for innovation and creation of new technologies. This was not the case when the companies were public or regulated. Under de-regulation, research and development suffered. Despite California's attempt to mitigate this problem through Public Interest Research Funds, for example, the effort tends to be too little and take too long. Advances in fuel cells (CFCC, 2002) are slow. Energy storage devices in general (Cooper et al., 1995) while clearly needed for providing energy reliability for intermittent energy such as wind and solar, are not receiving the funding for the development of such systems (Cooper and Clark, 1999). Energy storage devices or ""hybrid systems"" for example need to be supported (Isherwood et al. 2000; see Appendix A). Public policy needs to advance and finance these clean energy generation systems. Hybrid systems - or a combination of two or more technologies (that is wind with pumped storage or solar with fuel cells -- here both renewables are linked with storage devices) can be seen as the future for solving the issue of intermittent resources both as firm energy source and qualifying the energy produced as ""base load."" (NPS, 2002) Northern Power Systems has implemented such systems with good numbers in terms of costs and results (see Appendix B). A number of companies are beginning to explore the possible links and hence hybrid technology systems for their operations. Hybrid systems offer substantial benefits for both ""green grid power"" and renewable-only systems, which are often not the most reliable or economic approaches. Some benefits of hybrid systems from Northern Power System (2002) may include: Cost savings:     Reduced fuel costs, including storage, handling, and maintenance Reduced utility power consumption, especially during expensive peak hours Buy-downs, tax credits, other incentives reduce installation cost and shorten payback period Reduced impact of utility rate hikes  Environmental benefits:  Reduced greenhouse gas emissions             Improved efficiency Reduced fuel consumption Less potential for leakage and spills Uninterrupted power supply Reduced risk of financial losses due to power outages Reduced downtime Lower vulnerability to power outages Own your own power supply Incorporate multiple energy sources  High reliability:  Energy independence:  Some examples:  Oak Creek Energy Systems plans to combine wind turbines with storage systems such as pumped storage or electronic storage to create a wind-driven system that can provide firm energy with some dispatchability. Sharp Solar Systems Division of Sharp Electronics is researching the combination of photovoltaics with electrolyzers and fuel cells and developing a control system to optimize its operation. SunLine Transit Agency in Thousand Palms, California has a number of experimental fuel cell buses, and they are making hydrogen fuel for the buses in electrolyzers powered by photovoltaic arrays.      What is obvious is that the energy cost numbers begin to ""add"" correctly and the power supplied is cost competitive. These systems were under development in Japan with strong government support for many years (Clark and Chung, 2000). Today they show that with systems over 1-3 MW the costs are extremely competitive. In fact, Sharp corporation has even demonstrated (late 2002) that it can provide and guarantee solar power for $.035 /kW which is competitive with natural gas costs today (Wiser, et. al., 2001).  Long-term Strategies for Diversified Energy Portfolio Two basic ways to achieve agile energy systems: one is for on-site power generation (CPUC, 2002 and CEC, 2002); and the other is for regional systems (CPUC, 1999, CEC, 2002, and Bollman, 2002) that are fundamentally more like the internet (Rifkin, 2002) than the present central grid configuration. By the late fall of 2002 and looking toward the future, California has begun to rebuild its infrastructures. Governor Davis (2003) has   called for a ""Building California"" program that focuses on its infrastructures as well as developing its workforce and advanced technologies. With a large budget deficit in large part created by the energy de-regulation, the State now needs to look to its historical creative and entrepreneurial spirit for rebuilding. The tools, including financial resources and workforce development are local -- regional. The voters have passed over $40 billion in bond measures while the university system continues to lead the world in research and development. Jobs are created and business developed from a variety of emerging technologies, including the energy and environmental sectors. For example, there is now a shift in the roles in the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) and the California Energy Commission (CEC) as seen in recent governmental appointees to these Commissions. Now there will not only be an oversight function for the Commissions, but a specific economic development role. In other words, California has provided large contracts and projects for energy programs in the State. Now it wants the companies to be both located and grown in the State. In other words, California may be the first nation to define and practice ""sustainable development"" -- in both the scientific and economic context. There are enormous amounts of money at state. Consider that ""Overall, FERC is reviewing contracts valued at about $40 billion with more than a dozen companies. California has asked for termination of the contracts or for costs to be cut in half. In a related matter in San Francisco yesterday, California's disastrous experiment with energy deregulation ended quietly in a brief order issued by state utility regulators. (Rose, 2003) The second area is on-site power generation. Here typical accounting ""cost benefit analysis"" are the norm but fail to focus on real costs of energy (e.g. fuel source, historical technological development, health costs, and future needs of society). Thus while it may be cheaper and ""cleaner"" (then goal or oil) to have natural gas for as a fuel source, the financial analyses fail to consider the original costs for exploration, discovery, and distilling the fuel as well as the particulates health impact. What is particularly interesting are the lack of data on historical costs for any fuel infrastructure, such as natural gas. Aside from its dramatic increased use in energy fuel supply, natural gas is being increasing used for vehicles and fleets. However, what were the original research and development costs for natural gas -- and more importantly who paid for them? Much of the research and development was subsidized in the USA by the federal government; and in other countries by various government entities. Critical to the costs of natural gas or other energy supplies are the transmission or pipe lines. Again, consider the costs for these systems when they were originally proposed? And what might the costs today for new systems that use renewable energy? The comparison is even more compelling when the costs for transmission are seen as being underwritten or financially supported by national governments. The future of agile energy systems might be advanced far more aggressively, if, as in with historical energy power systems (generation and transmission) that government   support and financing played a key role. When governments on the local and regional level are involved, as is increasingly occurring today in California, the solutions to bringing on-line more clean intermittent energy is more than just probable. It becomes, with strong state support, financiable and eminent. That is why California can see a Hydrogen Economy future -- sooner than later (Rambach, 1999). Related to both gird and on-site energy generation is distributed energy generation (DG) or as they refer to it in Europe, combined heat and power generation (Mnster, 2001) or CHP. The concern for distributed energy systems is not new. In Europe and especially the northern most countries, DG or CHP has been fundamental to basic energy needs for decades. Most of the systems, however, are very dependent upon fossil energy of some sort. Natural gas within the last decade has been the most pronounced (Lund, 2001) due to its availability, reliability and low costs. However, wind and biomass are both strong competitors and increasing in use (Lund, 2001;and Bolinger and Wiser, 2002a and b). In the USA a growing concern for DG can be seen to follow the European pathway with natural gas dominated systems leading the way. Public entities in California (CPUC, 1999; CPA, 2002 and CEC, 2002) all argue for the need for DG but few integrate intermittent resources, as they are considered too costly and unreliable. New analyses and programs (Morris, 2003) are needed to direct this important concern for regional energy systems that incorporate renewable energy technologies (Clark, 2003) and focus on the future energy infrastructure needs such as hydrogen (Rifkin, 2002).  Clean Energy Plans: economics and competitive costs of intermittent resources California has already begun comprehensive planning for California's future energy needs. We will need to build new plants, but we need not be at the mercy of private contractors who deign to build for us only at exorbitant prices. Instead, the PUC is working on supply plans that integrate our need for modern, environmentally sound power plants with our vision for using more solar, wind, geothermal and biomass energy sources. And California's energy plan must incorporate energy efficiency and conservation into our daily lives. CPUC Commissioner Lynch notes that ""Policymakers can provide a framework for sound investing without speculation. If the state Public Employees Retirement System (CalPERS) could invest in partnerships with Enron, it can more wisely invest in regulated California power plants and renewable energy sources, where the PUC can guarantee returns and at the same time can protect the public interest. The road ahead is difficult. We must protect ourselves against new deregulation schemes. California's goals of environmentally sound energy, provided at just and reasonable prices, lie still ahead. We can only reach these goals if we stay the course of fiscal discipline and energy regulation in the public interest. (Lynch, 2002)   A number of government mechanisms are also available. Procurement is critical especially for state and public buildings. As the California Consumer Affairs Agency noted in its ""Blue Print for Sustainable State Buildings"" (CAA, 2001), the driving force for clean energy and lower costs should be the state buildings. Along with cost accounting based on life cycle analyses (IGAWG, 2002), the competitive costs for renewable on-site energy technologies can be competitive. However, ""competitive aggregation"" can be another government-initiated tool for the purchase of goods and services. The California Power Authority along with the California Stationary Fuel Cell Collaborative did just that for fuel cell in the fall of 2001 (CFCC, 2002) and also for solar PV systems. While the Request for Bids list still exists, the actual funds for purchasing were not available. The competitive bid list may become a significant item with the newly passed $40 + Billion Bond funds passed in 2002. A good example exists now for on-site generation with the Los Angeles Community College District. In 2001, the community passed a bond measure for $1.3 billion to renovate and rebuild the 30+ year old campus. Half of the funds were to be used for renewable technologies. In the Spring of 2002, the Board of Directors approved the contractors and building for ""Silver Level LEEDS"" standards at some for the campus buildings. Voters in the fall of 2002 then approved another $2+ Billion in bonds for the entire ""greening"" of the 9-campuses within the System. Similar measures passed 17 or the 19 Community College Districts in 2002, leaving the System with the potential to competitively aggregate goods and services bidders. Hybrid or linked technologies are new approaches for the energy industry to combine various technologies to accomplish the purpose of shaping the flow of power from an intermittent renewable resource into becoming firm or base load energy generation. Such a strategy provides energy generators with far more operational flexibility and diversity of fuel supply (Bernstein, 2001). This approach can increase the value of the product to the end user, and also make it easier for the CAISO to manage by making the powerplant look more like a gas-fired turbine in its operational characteristics, creating reliable clean energy at low competitive prices. Hybrid systems furthermore can improve an energy portfolio by minimizing both financial and energy risk. These systems increase versatility and create a seamless energy supply that mixes clean renewable and conventional fuels with traditional grid power. Integrated resource management need not be modeled on a bell shaped curve that is dependent on conventional fossil fuel resources, but be geared toward what some scholars are calling ""flexible or agile resource management."" (Clark and Bradshaw, 2003) Such hybrid systems exist today and have been documented / evaluated for years now. (Isherwood et. al, 2000)   Conclusions: toward a future for hybrid energy technologies As CPUC Commissioner Lynch put it: ""We cannot cede the protection of our economy to the federal government or 'the market'. Regulation is essential to guard critical services that can be monopolized by a few to the detriment of our families and businesses. The California Constitution recognizes this reality -- it requires energy-market regulation to prevent exploitation."" (Lynch, 2002) Intermittent resources can become firm base load energy when combined with other energy technologies and developed into agile systems. While more research and analysis needs to be done on the economics of these systems, it is clear that they are both regional and public sector supported as well as ""overseen"". The health needs of society, the future of citizens for power, and above all the independence of any nation-state depend on these new systems. California appears to be the first ""nation-state"" to define and implement ""sustainable development"". The Governor, State leaders and citizens are ready and willing to meet the challenge. As the Economist noted about the energy crisis last Spring 2001, the ""world is watching for California to take the lead again"" (Economist, July, 2001). That process began in 2000, when the current energy crisis struck hard at all Californians. It was brought to its potential with policies in 2002 where California lead the world in greenhouse mitigation legislation and set renewable energy standards unmatched in the USA. And now Californians in the middle of a severe economic budget deficit will seek to implement these policies in 2003. True to the spirit and history of California, the public good for all its citizens will prevail.   References Bachrach, Devra.

Northern Power Systems has provided the fo llowing data:   Engines, turbines, and fuel cells can all deliver combined heat and power (CHP) for facilit ies wit h significant heat ing or steam loads. Wind turbines are now delivering power at costs per kilowatt hour (kWh) that rival utilit y pricing, and photovoltaic techno logies are frequently perfect for delivering power during peak air condit ioning demand periods. Systems incorporating multiple or hybrid technologies are often the most cost-effect ive so lut ions based on facilit y needs, local utilit y costs, and State/Federal incent ive programs.

ACTION: Notice of the 1996 EPA SO<INF>2 allowance auctions results.     SUMMARY: Pursuant to Title IV of the Clean Air Act and 40 CFR Part 73,  the EPA is responsible for implementing a program to reduce emissions  of sulfur dioxide (SO<INF>2), a precursor of acid rain. The centerpiece  of the SO<INF>2 control program is the allocation of transferable  allowances, or authorizations to emit SO<INF>2, which are distributed  in limited quantities to existing utility units and which eventually  must be held by virtually all utility units to cover their SO<INF>2  emissions. These allowances may be transferred among polluting sources  and others, so that market forces may govern their ultimate use and  distribution, resulting in the most cost-effective sharing of the  emissions control burden. EPA is directed under Section 416 of the Act  to conduct annual sales and auctions of a small portion of allowances  (2.8) withheld from the total allowances allocated to utilities each  year. Sales and auctions are expected to stimulate and support the  allowance market and to provide a public source of allowances,  particularly to new units for which no allowances are allocated. In the  Fall of 1992, EPA delegated the administration of the EPA allowance  auctions and sales to the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT). Today, the  Acid Rain Division is giving notice of the results of the fourth annual  SO<INF>2 allowance auctions that were conducted by the CBOT on March  25, 1996.      For rules governing the conduct of the auctions and sales see 40  CFR Part 73, Subpart E.  I. Offers  A. Total Allowances Available for Auction      In the spot auction (year 1996 allowances sold), a total of 158,000  allowances were offered for sale: 150,000 that were withheld from the  utilities and an additional 8,000 that were voluntarily contributed  from utilities. In the 6-year advance auction (year 2002 allowances  sold), a total of 32,000 allowances were offered for sale: 25,000 that  were unsold from the 1995 direct sale and an additional 7,000 that were  contributed from utilities. In the 7-year advance auction (year 2003  allowances sold), a total of 107,000 allowances were offered for sale:  100,000 that were withheld from the utilities and an additional 7,000  that were contributed. The minimum prices that utilities would accept  for their contributed allowances are listed in Table 1.

ACTION: Proposed rule; Response to Court remand.     SUMMARY: The EPA is today issuing a proposed rule in response to a  remand by a U.S. Court of Appeals. The rule reinstates emission  limitations for nitrogen oxides (NO<INF>X) from coal-fired utility  units under section 407 of the Clean Air Act (``the Act''). The  emission limitations for NO<INF>X, along with emission limitations for  sulfur dioxide from utility plants, will reduce acidic deposition and  prevent serious adverse effects on natural resources, ecosystems,  materials, visibility, and public health.     On March 22, 1994, EPA promulgated a rule establishing NO<INF>X  emission limitations. The rule established emission limits generally  achievable using ``low NO<INF>X burner technology'' and established a  procedure for obtaining an alternative emission limitation if a unit  could not achieve the prescribed limit using such technology. On  November 29, 1994, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of  Columbia Circuit ruled that the definition of ``low NO<INF>X burner  technology'' in the March 22, 1994 rule exceeded EPA's statutory  authority. The Court vacated the rule and remanded it to the Agency for  further proceedings. On March 28, 1995, EPA and environmental and  utility-industry parties signed an agreement addressing the March 22,  1994 regulations, including issues raised by the Court's remand.     Based on the Court's decision and a review of the record, the  Agency is now revising the March 22, 1994 regulations. The lowNO <INF>X-burner-technology definition is revised to comply with the  Court's decision. Other provisions concerning the compliance date for  Phase I NO<INF>X emission limitations, AELs, and plans for averaging  NO<INF>X emissions of two or more units are also revised. Because the  rule revisions are consistent with the Court's decision and the Agency  does not expect to receive adverse comments, the revisions are  [[Page 18793]] also being issued as a direct final rule in the Final  Rules section of this Federal Register. The revisions are also  consistent with the March 28, 1995 agreement.  DATES: Comments on the regulations proposed by this action must be  received on or before May 15, 1995.  ADDRESSES: Comments. All written comments must be identified with the  appropriate docket number (Docket No. A-92-15) and must be submitted in  duplicate to EPA Air Docket Section (6102), Waterside Mall, Room M1500,  1st Floor, 401 M Street, SW, Washington DC 20460.

In particular,         children, the elderly, and people with respiratory         ailments will be protected from health risks of breathing         polluted air. Reducing air pollution will also protect         the environment, resulting in many benefits, such         as restoring life in damaged ecosystems and reducing         health risks to those whose subsistence depends directly         on those ecosystems.

Air pollution reduces visibility, damages         crops and buildings, and is deposited on the soil         and in water bodies where it affects the chemistry         of the water and resident life forms.         Since 1970, air pollutant emissions have been reduced         and significant improvements in air quality have been         achieved. However, millions of tons of toxic air pollutants         are still released into the air. Also, approximately         46 million people live in areas that do not meet EPA's         health-based air standards for at least one of six         major pollutants.         The problem is nationwide in scope. Air pollution crosses         local and state lines and, in some cases, even crosses         our borders with Canada and Mexico. Federal assistance         and leadership are essential for developing cooperative         state, local, regional, and international programs         to prevent and control air pollution and for ensuring         that national standards are met. Efforts of many other         Federal agencies, such as the Department of Transportation         and the Department of Energy, are critical to the         achievement of the Clean Air goal.         The 1999 President's Budget requests $506,953,300 and         1,762 workyears for the Clean Air goal, an increase         of $17,000,000 and a decrease of 40 workyears over         1998. In support of this goal, the Agency will work         with and support states and tribes in developing and         implementing plans to address air quality problems.         As part of this effort, EPA will support state and         tribal development of a 1,500-site monitoring network         for fine particulates (PM 2.5 ), a pollutant         for which the Agency issued its first specific standards         in 1997. The Agency also will develop and issue other         standards, including national technology-based standards         to reduce the quantity of toxic air pollutants that         are emitted from industrial or manufacturing processes.         The resources requested in this goal will enable the         Agency, in conjunction with its state, local, and         tribal partners, to meet a number of performance goals         in 1999. The most significant of these include:                  Deploy PM 2.5  ambient monitors at 776          sites.          Certify that 8 of the 38 estimated remaining nonattainment          areas have achieved the current NAAQS for ozone.          Certify that 13 of the 58 estimated remaining          nonattainment areas have achieved the NAAQS for          carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, or lead.          Reduce air toxic emissions by 12% in 1999, resulting          in a cumulative reduction of 25% from 1993 levels.          In 1999, maintain 4 million tons of SO 2           emissions reductions from utility sources, and          maintain 300,000 tons of NOx reductions from coal-fired          utility sources.          By 1999, identify and evaluate at least two biological          mechanisms by which PM causes death and disease          in humans.          In 1999, complete health assessments for five          high priority air toxics.                 HIGHLIGHTS:         Attaining National Ambient Air Quality Standards         for Ozone and Particulate Matter         The 1999 President's Budget requests $348,584,700 and         1090 workyears to attain national ambient air quality         standards (NAAQS) for ozone and particulate matter.         Ozone and particulate matter are high risk pollutants,         with high potential for risk reduction. Ozone can         impair normal functioning of the lungs. More people         are exposed to unhealthy levels of ozone than of any         other air pollutant. It is projected that over 114         million people live in areas that will not meet the         new health standard for ozone, which is 40 million         more than under the previous standard.         The health risks estimated from current fine PM exposures         represent tens of thousands of premature deaths each         year, placing fine PM near the top of environmental         health threats. It is estimated that approximately         68 million people live in areas that may not meet         the new PM 2.5  standard. EPA estimates that,         once attained, the new standard will prevent up to         15,000 premature deaths per year.         Under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, EPA must         set NAAQS for pollutants that endanger public health         and the environment. States and tribes then must develop         and carry out strategies and measures to attain the         NAAQS. EPA reviewed NAAQS set for ozone and particulate         matter, as required by the Clean Air Act, and promulgated         new standards in July 1997. Following a directive         the President issued with the standards, the Agency         worked with states, tribes and local governments,         other Federal agencies and regulated sources to develop         an implementation strategy for the standards. The         implementation strategy allows for implementing the         standards in the most flexible, reasonable and least         burdensome manner. In addition, the Agency is participating         in an interagency research program, including a full         scientific and technical review of the new fine particulate         (PM 2.5 ) standard by 2002, and implementation         of a PM monitoring network.         In support of the Agency's implementation strategy         for attaining the new air quality standards, EPA will         invest $65,700,000 to develop a national PM monitoring         network. This monitoring network will provide the         data needed for the identification of PM sources and         potential PM ""hotspots,"" as well as allow the Agency         to designate areas in attainment with the new PM standard         and develop control strategies to address PM on a         regional basis. Attainment designations will not occur         until 2002 when monitoring data will be complete for         these decisions. EPA has committed to provide 100         percent of the costs of setting up the PM 2.5          monitoring network through state and tribal grants         under the authority of Section 103 of the Clean Air         Act. EPA will be conducting chemical speciation analyses         to provide the basis for states and tribes to determine         the chemical constituents of the PM 2.5          and better identify and understand the sources and         characteristics of the pollution and its potential         effects. States and tribes will use this information         to develop control strategies to come into attainment         with the new particulate matter standard by 2012 to         2017. This is consistent with the President's commitment         to review the new standard before state and tribal         plans take effect.         Under the research authorities of the Clean Air Act,         EPA carries out ozone and particulate matter research         to maintain a strong scientific basis for changing         or reaffirming NAAQS, and implementing NAAQS. In the         long term, the information gained through research         helps protect public health, including the health         of children and other sensitive populations, and provides         the scientific and technical information required         for NAAQS review, as well as the NAAQS implementation         by regional, state, tribal and local government air         quality managers. EPA research contributes to developing         scientifically sound risk assessment procedures, cost-effective         risk prevention/management approaches, credible methods,         models and guidance, and environmental leadership         through partnerships.         Reducing Emissions of Air Toxics         The 1999 President's Budget requests $91,924,600 and         390.4 workyears to reduce air toxic emissions by 12%         in 1999, resulting in a cumulative reduction of 25         percent from 1993 levels. This would significantly         reduce the risk to Americans of cancer and other serious         adverse health effects caused by airborne toxics.         Toxic air pollutants pose a significant health risk         because they may cause cancer and other health problems         such as reproductive disorders, birth defects, and         damage to the nervous system.         EPA's air toxics objective focuses primarily on the         statutory requirements of the toxics program in the         Clean Air Act to reduce emissions levels through the         promulgation and implementation of Maximum Achievable         Control Technology (MACT) standards. The program will         invest in improved and innovative monitoring and modeling,         inventories, development and refinement of environmental         indicators, and risk assessment tools to better characterize         the risk from air toxics and establish a baseline         for measuring risk in carrying out the Government         Performance and Results Act (GPRA). EPA will build         on state efforts to create a national toxics monitoring         and inventory program in order to better characterize         exposures to hazardous air pollution.         In 1999, health effects researchers will quantitatively         evaluate cancer and non-cancer health effects from         air toxics exposures. Exposure researchers will develop         methods to identify contributing sources from ambient         air measurements, and improved models to characterize         actual human exposure. Researchers also will develop         and demonstrate new methods to assess risks from urban         toxics.         Attaining NAAQS for CO, SO 2 , NO 2 ,         and Lead         The 1999 President's Budget requests $44,878,200 and         189.9 workyears to improve air quality for Americans         living in areas that do not meet the current NAAQS         for carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ),         nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ), and lead, which         are all high risk pollutants.         EPA and its partners have been relatively successful         in reducing these air pollutants in many urban areas         through mobile source measures. Controls included         in state SIPs also reduce stationary source emissions.         The Agency will continue existing carbon monoxide         work, concentrating primarily on mobile source programs         (such as oxygenated fuel and reformulated gasoline),         and on assisting states to implement attainment and         maintenance programs. EPA will continue to provide         information to the scientific community and stakeholders         on the environmental aspects of the use of oxygenated         fuels and recommendations to improve the program.         In 1998, EPA will promulgate the new source review         (NSR) reform rules which simplify the new source permitting         process. In 1999, EPA will undertake training and         technical support activities to ensure smooth implementation         of this major regulatory reinvention effort.         Acid Rain         The 1999 President's Budget requests $21,565,800 and         92.0 workyears for reducing ambient sulfates and total         sulfur deposition by 20 to 40 percent from 1980 levels         due to reduced SO 2  emissions from utilities         and industrial sources.         The Acid Rain program is authorized under Title IV         of the Clean Air Act and has numerous statutory deadlines.         The U.S. is also committed to reductions in SO 2          and NOx under the 1991 U.S.-Canada Air Quality Agreement.         In addition to administering the SO 2  and         Nox provisions of Title IV, the Acid Rain program         will be developing and operating the emissions and         NOx allowance tracking systems for the 12 states of         the Ozone Transport Region. The first year of compliance         for this program is 1999. Achieving this will assist         the 12 Northeastern states to attain and maintain         the ozone standard. Approximately 400 additional facilities         will require certification of emissions monitors and         will report quarterly emissions beginning in 1998.         The program is responsible for operating the Clean         Air Status and Trends Network (CASTNet) dry deposition         network and providing critical support for operations         of the National Atmospheric Deposition Program (NADP)         wet deposition network and for a number of visibility         monitoring sites. These monitoring efforts will play         a crucial role in the program's ongoing assessment         activities, including reporting program results for         the Government Performance and Results Act and fulfilling         assessment responsibilities under Title IX of the         Clean Air Act and the U.S.-Canada Air Quality Agreement.                         Environmental         Protection Agency         1999 Plan Annual Request to Congress         Clean Air         Objective #1: Attain National Ambient Air Quality         Standards for Ozone and Particulate Matter.         By 2010, improve air quality for Americans living in         areas that exceed the National Ambient Air Quality         Standards (NAAQSs) for ozone and particulate matter.                 Overview         Under the Clean Air Act, EPA must set NAAQSs for five         criteria pollutants that endanger public health and         the environment. States and tribes then must develop         and carry out strategies and measures to attain the         NAAQSs. Ozone and particulate matter are criteria         pollutants that require NAAQSs. For each pollutant,         EPA sets health-based or ""primary"" standards to protect         human health, and welfare-based or ""secondary"" standards         to protect the environment (crops, vegetation, wildlife,         buildings and national monuments, visibility, etc.).         The Clean Air Act also requires states with national         parks and wilderness areas to develop a program to         protect and improve visibility.         Under the research authorities of the Act, EPA carries         out ozone and particulate matter research to provide         a strong scientific basis for (1) changing or reaffirming         NAAQSs, and (2) implementing NAAQSs. Long-range, the         information gained through research helps protect         public health, including the health of children and         other sensitive populations, and provides the scientific         and technical information required for NAAQS review,         as well as NAAQS implementation by Regional, state,         tribal, and local government air quality managers.         EPA research contributes to developing scientifically         sound risk assessment procedures; cost-effective risk         prevention/management approaches; credible methods,         models, and guidance; and environmental leadership         through partnerships.         New NAAQSs.  EPA reviewed NAAQSs set for ozone         and particulate matter, as required by the Clean Air         Act, and promulgated new standards in July 1997. The         President, in a July 16, 1997, letter to the Administrator,         outlined general ground rules and a strategy for implementing         the new standards in a common sense, cost-effective         manner. The President's letter also sets forth an         interagency research program, including a full scientific         and technical review of the new fine particulate (PM 2.5 )         standard by 2002.         Ozone . Ground-level ozone is the most complex,         difficult to control, and pervasive of the six air         pollutants for which EPA has set NAAQSs. Unlike most         other pollutants, ozone is not emitted directly into         the air by specific sources, but is created in the         troposphere by sunlight acting on nitrogen oxides         (NO x ) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs).         There are thousands of sources of these pollutants.         Some common sources include: gasoline vapors, chemical         solvents, combustion products of fuels, and consumer         products. Emissions of NO x  and VOCs from         motor vehicles and stationary sources can be carried         hundreds of miles from their origins, and result in         high ozone concentrations over very large, multi-state         regions.         Ozone can impair normal functioning of the lungs in         healthy people, as well as in those with respiratory         problems. Relatively low amounts of ozone can cause         chest pain, shortness of breath, and coughing. Ozone         may also worsen asthma, bronchitis, and emphysema.         Repeated exposure to ozone over months to years can         damage lung tissue and reduce quality of life. Repeated         exposure to high levels of ozone for several months         may also produce permanent structural damage in the         lungs. Adverse ecosystem effects are known for single         species of vegetation and are likely to extend to         entire ecosystems. Ozone damage to plants is extensive,         with an estimated impact exceeding $34 billion in         lost food stuff crops and timber products each year.         More people are exposed to unhealthful levels of ozone         than any other air pollutant. It is currently projected         that over 114 million people live in areas that will         not meet the new health standard for ozone, 40 million         more than the previous standard. Once attained, the         new ozone standard will protect 13 million more children         from exposure to unhealthful levels of smog than the         previous standard. Additional scientific information         is needed to effectively address these risks: to understand         the human and ecological effects caused by chronic         and acute ozone exposures; to refine estimates of         precursor emissions including their transport and         fate; and to improve the models used to quantify the         interactions of these precursor emissions in the atmosphere.         Particulate   matter . Particulate matter         is the term for solid or liquid particles found in         the air. Some particles are large or dark enough to         be seen as soot or smoke. Others are so small they         can be detected only with a microscope. Because particles         originate from a variety of mobile and stationary         sources (diesel trucks, woodstoves, power plants,         etc.), their chemical and physical compositions vary         widely. Particulate matter can be directly emitted         or can be formed in the atmosphere when gaseous pollutants,         such as sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ) and NO x ,         react to form fine particles.         The health risks estimated from current fine particulate         matter exposures represent tens of thousands of premature         deaths each year, placing fine particulate matter         at or near the top of environmental health threats.         It is currently estimated that approximately 68 million         people live in areas that may not meet the new PM 2.5          standard. EPA estimates that once the new standard         is attained nationwide, it will prevent up to 15,000         premature deaths per year, and protect an additional         12 million children.         Particulate matter research will support Agency efforts         to (1) develop scientifically sound risk assessment         approaches; (2) provide regulatory officials with         technical information on cost-effective risk prevention/management         approaches; (3) provide credible methods, models,         and guidance to quantify precursor emissions and evaluate         alternative control strategies; and (4) promote environmental         leadership through partnerships. This program will:         improve the scientific understanding of particulate         matter health risks and the effectiveness of risk         reduction strategies; provide critical scientific         information to the Agency program offices and Regions;         provide improved tools for environmental assessment         so that information developed by the Agency and others         is more easily used and understood; and promote private         sector involvement in identifying, understanding,         and addressing important air pollution problems. The         information gained from particulate matter research         will: (1) ultimately protect the public health of         our children, sensitive populations, and future generations         as we better understand the risks associated with         and remedies to reduce exposures to particulate matter;         (2) provide a strong scientific basis for establishing         the NAAQSs; and (3) provide scientific and technical         data required for NAAQS implementation by Regional,         state, and local government air quality managers.         Visibility.  Visibility impairment, caused by         the presence of tiny particles in the air, is most         simply described as the haze which obscures the clarity,         color, texture, and form of what we see. The Clean         Air Act gives special protection to natural areas         that we want to preserve for future generations, such         as our national parks and wilderness areas.         Implementation of new NAAQSs and visibility requirements.           Fine particulate matter and ground-level ozone         have many similarities. Both pollutants remain in         the air for days, leading to regional scale transport         that can affect broad areas of the country. Both pollutants         are formed under similar atmospheric conditions by         gases, such as NO x  and VOCs, emitted by         the same types of sources. Moreover, there are similar         health effects associated with exposure to ozone and         particulate matter (e.g., increased respiratory symptoms         and increased hospital admissions and emergency room         visits for respiratory causes).         To obtain recommendations on integrated approaches         for implementing the new ozone and particulate matter         NAAQSs, as well as for a new regional haze program,         EPA established a broad-based committee under the         Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA). This FACA committee         had workgroups focusing on: assessing the current         state of air pollutant emission inventories, air quality         and meteorological models, and air quality monitoring         data; developing broad strategies to address air pollutant         transport issues; examining the existing regulatory         programs; and educating the general public about the         nature and extent of air quality problems as well         as any adverse health and/or welfare effects associated         with these problems. EPA will continue this broad-based         stakeholder process to further develop the implementation         strategy for the new standards.         The strategy for implementing the ozone, particulate         matter, and regional haze standards will be targeted         at maintaining efforts currently underway towards         clean air and building on the agreements and progress         already made by communities and businesses. In carrying         out the implementation strategy, EPA will seek to         reward state, tribal, and local governments and businesses         that take early action to reduce ozone air pollution         levels through cost-effective approaches and address         pollution that travels across jurisdictional lines.         EPA will work with states and tribes to develop control         programs that employ regulatory flexibility to minimize         economic impacts on businesses to the greatest possible         degree consistent with public health protection. EPA         also will attempt to minimize regulatory burdens for         states, tribes, and local governments and businesses,         to ensure that air quality planning and related Federal,         tribal, state, and local planning are coordinated,         and to help urban areas avoid conflicts between economic         growth and environmental programs.

In 1999, deploy PM2.5 ambient monitors at 776          sites.          By 2001, develop tropospheric ozone precursor          measurements, and observational modeling to guide          cost-effective control options.          By 2000, evaluate Models-3/Community Multi-Scale          Air Quality (CMAC) against field data to demonstrate          reliability in ozone NAAQS attainment planning.          By 2001, develop tropospheric ozone precursor          measurements, modeling, source emissions, and          control information to guide cost-effective risk          management options.          By 2000, preliminary evaluation of Models-3/Community          Multi-Scale Air Quality (CMAQ) for PM to demonstrate          reliability in PM NAAQS attainment planning.          By 2001, provide measurements, modeling, source          emissions, and control information for PM by species          and size to guide risk assessment and PM risk          management.          By 2000, describe PM health effects in exposed          humans.          By 1999 and beyond, produce data, models, and          technical information which can be used by Federal,          state and local air pollution officials to refine          the accuracy (size distribution and chemical composition)          of directly emitted fine particulate (particulate          less than 2.5 microns in size) and fine particulate          precursor (compounds such as ammonia which lead          to formation of fine particles in the atmosphere)          emissions and to quantitatively evaluate the viability          (cost and performance) of various fine particulate          control technologies for stationary combustion          sources.          By 1999, identify and evaluate several plausible          biological mechanisms by which PM causes death          and disease in humans.                 Ozone         EPA will continue to work with affected states and         tribes to address the persistent and widespread problem         of ozone transport. Two multi-state groups -- the         Ozone Transport Commission (OTC) and the Ozone Transport         Assessment Group (OTAG) -- collaborated to recommend         regional strategies to control ozone transport in         the Northeast, Southeast, and Midwest. Building on         the model provided by the successful market-based         acid rain program, OTAG proposed a large-scale, market-based         NO x  trading program. This trading program         should result in a cost-effective solution for attaining         and maintaining the new NAAQS. To facilitate trading         programs, EPA will review and approve emissions trading         protocols for nationally significant source categories.         As a follow-on to the successful OTAG experience, EPA         will work on partnerships with states to facilitate         the development of region-wide strategies for ozone,         PM 2.5  and regional haze. These partnerships         are expected to play a significant role in determining         control strategies. As with OTAG, regional areas will         need dedicated technical support (e.g., modeling)         beyond the levels that EPA can provide.         EPA will assist states, tribes, and local governments         in devising stationary source and mobile source strategies         to reduce ozone before implementing the new standards         in state and tribal implementation plans (SIPs and         TIPs). All on-going efforts to meet the previous ozone         and PM 10  standards will help to meet the         new standards as well. As a result, EPA will assist         states and tribes in maintaining existing control         programs.         EPA will continue mobile source programs including:         implementing the second phase of the RFG program in         the 10 worst ozone cities plus opt-in areas; developing         emission factors by shifting emphasis from light-duty         to heavy-duty vehicles and non-road, heavy-duty engines;         building on the NO x /particulate matter         initiative; and developing and implementing non-road         diesel, locomotive, heavy-duty engine and marine standards.         The Small Spark Ignition (SI) Phase II standards rule         and inventory model will be in its final stages in         1999. A Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on large SI         non-road engines will be issued in 1999. The Agency         will complete a mandated study of light-duty vehicle         and light-duty truck emission standards (Tier II study)         and potentially promulgate new emission control standards         that could take effect as early as 2004. Also, EPA         will examine the effects of sulfur levels in gasoline         on new car emission technology and take appropriate         actions. These programs strive to reduce NO x ,         and thus ozone, as well as fine particles.         In the upcoming years, EPA will develop new vehicle         emission control programs, including a court-ordered         requirement for a recreational vehicle rule in 1999.         EPA plans to facilitate integrating OBD systems into         state vehicle inspection and maintenance programs         and provide training and outreach to the service industry.         EPA will re-engineer the vehicle compliance program.         EPA will continue to explore and implement improvements         to emissions testing and monitoring approaches for         VOCs (precursors to ozone and particulate matter)         including better and less expensive continuous monitors         and more reliable techniques for analysis of water-based         coatings, inks, and other solvents.         EPA will focus extensively on public outreach and access         to high quality information for general and technical         audiences to facilitate public understanding and smooth         implementation of the new NAAQSs. Improved information         quality and access will enable citizens and users         to access ""real-time"" air quality information, and         enable EPA to better track environmental indicators         and assess progress. EPA will also assist stakeholders         in urban areas in developing tools and approaches         to help avoid conflicts between economic development         and environmental programs.         EPA will support a joint public/private effort to improve         (1) the scientific basis for both future ozone attainment         strategies and (2) health and ecological effects research.         The emphasis of the program is on the former. EPA         and the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) agreed         that setting an effective national strategy to deal         with this problem will require scientific information         to come from an expanded national research program.         As a result, the NARSTO research program was chartered         at the White House in February 1995 with a lifetime         of ten years, and with a near-term focus on a 1998-99         assessment of the improved state of the science for         use in a mid-course adjustment to the national implementation         policy.         In the NARSTO-related exposure research area, EPA will         continue research on atmospheric chemistry and modeling         to produce, evaluate, and apply a next generation         atmospheric model for ozone, addressing the well-documented         deficiencies (such as inadequate chemistry mechanisms         for biogenic and aromatic VOCs, poor emissions inputs         and source plume treatment, insufficient vertical         and spatial resolution, and the inability to move         from individual episodes to daily and annual representation),         in current urban and regional models used for NAAQS         attainment demonstrations. Correcting such deficiencies         will remove some of the uncertainties that state,         tribal and local air quality managers face in forecasting         the benefits of alternative source controls in relation         to ozone contributions from upwind regions in natural         sources. Another area of focus will be the improvement         of methods to physically observe ambient VOC and NO x          chemistry leading to ozone formation and the testing         of these methods in regional field studies, which         may ultimately lead to successfully managing precursor         emissions to reduce tropospheric ozone. In addition,         some 1999 Science and Technology funds will go toward         the (1) Models-3/Community Multi-Scale Air Quality         (CMAQ) evaluation against field data to demonstrate         reliability in ozone NAAQS attainment planning; and         (2) development of tropospheric ozone precursor measurements         and observational modeling to guide cost-effective         control options. The CMAQ version of Models-3 was         released to EPA's Office of Air and Radiation (OAR)         as a beta-test version in 1997 and will be released         as an Initial Operating Version in 1998. OAR will         be able to gain a working familiarity with the model         while it undergoes scientific peer evaluation against         field data sets, thus leading to its earliest possible         use for implementation strategy development.         In the NARSTO-related risk management research area,         EPA will continue to develop and refine emission models         and methodologies to improve estimates of tropospheric         ozone precursors (VOCs and NO x ) emitted         from mobile and biogenic sources. The mobile emissions         program will include in-house research to improve         emissions estimates from light-duty vehicles. Biogenic         emissions research will continue to refine and upgrade         an emissions model used to estimate nonmethane organic         compounds (NMOC) and NO x  emitted from natural         sources. The outcome of the mobile and biogenic emissions         research will be used as inputs to the next generation         atmospheric model described above and by states and         tribes to produce improved emissions estimates, thereby         supporting development of optimal ozone control strategies.         In the area of health effects, EPA will conduct research         on human health mechanisms and dose-response studies.         Researchers will perform studies on ozone effects         and mechanisms of toxicity in normal and sensitive         humans (e.g., asthmatics) at near-ambient levels,         to define the specific concentration-time relationships         between ozone exposures and initiation of health effects         and progression and the induction of tolerance to         ozone. This health effects research will further support         an improved definition of the primary NAAQS to protect         human health. The health effects research will fill         the current gap in our understanding concerning the         relationship between long-term intermittent exposures         to ozone concentrations and chronic adverse health         effects. Results from epidemiologic and mechanistic         toxicological studies will provide the data needed         to prepare the mandated NAAQS criteria assessment         of the adequacy of the standard in protecting against         chronic effects.         In the ecological effects research area, researchers         will continue to evaluate the effects of ozone and         other stressors on important tree and vegetation species.         Three major uncertainties exist in understanding the         impact of ozone on trees: (1) tree characteristics         (age, size, and species); (2) other stressors (other         pollutants, drought, etc.); and (3) exposure dynamics         (concentration, frequency, etc.). This information         will form the scientific basis of the criteria upon         which the secondary NAAQS is based. The ecological         effects research will focus on the impacts of atmospheric         concentrations of ozone on the health of forests in         the eastern region of the United States. The results         of the research will provide the data and knowledge         needed to describe and quantify adverse economic and         ecological impacts. Assessment of the impacts argue         for a separate secondary standard, or dictate the         need for a particular control strategy, or both.         The risk assessment research program will: (1) develop         new methodologies to characterize ozone hazards to         humans and ecosystems and the corresponding benefits         of reducing these hazards; (2) support improved risk         assessments of ozone; and (3) perform periodic, comprehensive         scientific assessments. Consultation and support in         the area of ozone will permit risk assessments by         state, Regional, and international air pollution control         organizations with less uncertainty. These efforts         will provide OAR with the research results needed         to develop and implement ozone policies based on strong         science.         Particulate Matter         After promulgating the new PM 2.5  standard,         EPA will be working with states and tribes to install         fine particulate monitors and obtain data on fine         particle emissions. EPA has committed to provide 100         percent of the PM 2.5  monitoring network         costs through state and tribal grants under the authority         of Section 103 of the Clean Air Act. EPA, states,         and tribes will continue to monitor PM 10          but at a reduced level. EPA also will promote the         use of continuous particulate matter source monitoring         and improved fine particulate test methods. After         the scientific review is completed in 2002, EPA will         use the monitoring data to designate attainment areas,         characterize emission sources, and conduct a scientific         health review of the standard. States and tribes will         also be using the data to identify particulate matter         sources and ""hotspots"" and will use this information         in developing SIPs and TIPs.         EPA will be conducting chemical speciation analyses         to provide the basis for states and tribes to determine         the chemical constituents of the PM 2.5          and better identify and understand the sources and         characteristics of the pollution and its potential         effects. States and tribes will use this information         to develop control strategies to come into attainment         with the new particulate matter standard.         EPA will assist states, tribes, and local governments         in devising stationary source and mobile source strategies         to reduce particulate matter before implementing the         new standards. All on-going efforts to meet the current         standards will help to meet the new standards as well.         As a result, EPA will assist states and tribes in         maintaining existing control programs in the interim         period between the promulgation of the particulate         matter standard and the approval of SIPs and TIPs.         EPA will develop a series of guidance documents for         the new particulate matter program to provide infrastructure         for implementing the new standards. EPA will continue         public outreach activities, especially to create materials         for the general public on fine particulate matter.         EPA will improve the characterization of mobile, stationary,         and fugitive source particulate matter contribution         to PM 2.5  nonattainment designations. Emission         factors and inventories will be developed along with         air quality models (e.g., MODELS3).         EPA assumes that mobile sources account for one third         of fine particle emissions and a larger portion of         controllable emissions. Diesel engines, until recently         largely unregulated, contribute to the majority of         fine particulate emissions. Consequently, EPA will         improve its understanding of various mobile source         control technologies on particle size, shape, and         composition. In collaborating with industry, states,         and academia, EPA will better understand diesel particle         size under various vehicle, engine, and fuel testing         conditions. Because non-road diesels only recently         began to be controlled for emissions, there appears         to be a great opportunity for large reductions of         particulate matter from these engines. Control of         these sources are projected to lead to reductions         of 800,000 tons per year of NO x  and 300,000         tons of particulate matter. EPA will design and develop         new engineering concepts that would allow petroleum-fueled         four stroke direct injection (4SDI) engines to meet         stringent particulate matter and NO x  emission         levels while maintaining high efficiency. These new         concepts will include the development of the conventional         diesel (4SDI) using petroleum derived diesel fuel         to reduce the high fine particulate matter, high NO x          emissions of these engines.         EPA's particulate matter research efforts will focus         on furthering the understanding of the role particulate         matter plays in human health. Recent epidemiological         studies indicate significant associations between         a variety of measures of ambient particulate matter         and both mortality and morbidity. Of most concern         are indications from these studies of increased mortality         risks, especially among the elderly and those with         pre-existing cardiopulmonary disease. Particulate         matter may be the largest single contributor to adverse         effects caused by ambient air pollution, ranging from         thousands to tens of thousands of premature deaths         each year. EPA's research efforts will focus on further         understanding the role particulate matter plays on         human health.         EPA will evaluate the relationship between health effects         and particulate matter exposures, using epidemiology         and significantly improved characterization of exposures.         Thereby, researchers will characterize and quantify,         through epidemiology, the morbidity and mortality         associated with ""real world"" short- and long-term         exposures, including the development of new methods         and evaluation of existing data.         EPA will continue a substantial effort of toxicological         and clinical research to identify and evaluate several         hypotheses regarding the biological mechanisms that         might lead to respiratory or cardiovascular effects         associated with particulate matter. These hypotheses         are not mutually exclusive, and EPA research may demonstrate         that multiple mechanisms are operative. Research will         focus on the potential role of metals present in particulate         matter in producing effects, the effects of pre-existing         disease on susceptibility and dosimetry, cardiopulmonary         mechanisms, and identifying the characteristics of         particulate matter (size, composition) associated         with effects. Research to identify and evaluate plausible         mechanisms will provide valuable information for future         toxicological assessments and epidemiological studies.         Exposure research will continue to concentrate on measurement,         characterization, and modeling leading to refined         estimates of human exposures to particulate matter.         Resources will be used to characterize the population         exposures to ambient, indoor, and personal particulate         matter by developing and applying improved exposure         methodologies and models, as well as the amount of         particulate matter from various sources. Researchers         will also seek to: (1) understand further the atmospheric         chemistry of particulate matter to support fate and         transport modeling to support regulatory implementation         and (2) develop and evaluate particle measurement         methods to characterize atmospheric particulate matter.         As such, some 1999 Science and Technology funds will         go toward the completion of a preliminary evaluation         of Models-3/CMAQ for particulate matter against the         comprehensive field data sets to demonstrate reliability         in particulate matter attainment planning, which will         be completed in a future fiscal year.         The magnitude of potential risks and the uncertainty         in existing risk assessments indicates research is         needed to support decisions by EPA on the need for         and the form of a revised NAAQS for particulate matter         and to support control program implementation. Therefore,         researchers will continue to perform periodic, comprehensive         scientific assessments to understand: the differences         in health effects between coarse and fine particles;         interactions of particulate matter with other pollutants         and weather; lung function as a predictor of mortality;         and determination of the best exposure metrics to         estimate health outcomes. Consultation and support         will enable state, regional, and international air         pollution control organizations to perform risk assessments         with less uncertainty. These efforts will provide         EPA with research results needed to continue to develop         and implement particulate matter policies based on         strong science.         The health effects research will work to fill the current         gap in our understanding of the observed excess mortality         and morbidity associated with particulate air pollution.         Results from epidemiologic and mechanistic toxicological         studies will provide the data needed to prepare the         mandated NAAQS criteria assessment of the adequacy         of the standard. In addition, research as to whether,         and to what extent, the effects attributed to particulate         matter exposures are confounded by other commonly         occurring pollutants such as sulfur dioxide and ozone,         will improve the interpretation of the epidemiological         studies.         Risk management research will characterize source emissions         to clarify which sources are significant contributors         to ambient fine particles. Studies will be conducted         to develop particle size distribution data for a variety         of sources. The research to characterize particle         emissions from residual fuel oil and pulverized coal         combustion sources will produce both particle size         distribution and chemical composition data. Research         will also be conducted to evaluate and, where necessary,         improve or develop control technologies for a variety         of industrial and commercial sources. Modeling studies         will be conducted to predict the performance of alternative         technologies, which will be augmented by experimental         studies of innovative, low-cost control devices.         The exposure, modeling and risk management research         will provide, by 2001, measurements, modeling, source         emissions, and control information for particulate         matter by species and size to guide risk assessment         and risk management. Particulate matter measurements         are needed since current methods are focused on larger         particle sizes. Measurement information can support         epidemiologic and mechanism studies, and help develop         data for implementation strategies. Because particulate         matter is by nature a mixture, we need to know the         compositions, sizes, physical properties, and sources         that cause health effects. A report on the size, distribution,         and chemistry of urban particulate matter including         spatial and temporal variability at selected sites         is called for by 2001. Understanding regional and         temporal variability in particle characteristics (e.g.,         Western versus Eastern U.S.) and toxicity (e.g., coarse         Western particles versus fine Eastern U.S. particles)         may also lead to more effective risk management. Finally,         in the area of risk management research, more efficient         and economical particulate matter controls and evaluation         of existing and new risk management technologies and         strategies, including market-based approaches, that         can be cost-effectively used to control emissions         will contribute to meeting the objective of making         the air safer to breathe for those people living in         non-attainment areas.         Visibility         EPA proposed a regional haze program in conjunction         with the new standards for ozone and particulate matter.         Because of regional variations in natural conditions         which combine with man-made pollution to produce regional         haze, EPA believes that regional haze should be addressed         through a region-specific program that accounts for         these variations. This most likely would result in         a regional program for Western states that is different,         for example, from one for Northeastern states. In         1999, all states and two territories will develop         plans to improve visibility in their region of the         country.         Since 1987, EPA has supported the long-term visibility         monitoring program known as the IMPROVE network. The         IMPROVE network gathers data that can be used to identify         sources of visibility impairment on an individual         site, regional, and national scale. EPA will work         with Western states to determine the steps that are         needed to preserve clear days and improve visibility         in the 16 national parks and wilderness areas located         in the Colorado Plateau. An Eastern regional haze         program will address visibility impairment in the         Appalachian Mountains.         Regional emissions reductions to attain a fine particle         NAAQS and meet requirements of other programs (such         as the acid rain program) are expected to improve         visibility in certain parks and wilderness areas,         particularly in the East.         1998 Annual Performance Goals                  Revoke the current 1-hour standard for 21 additional          areas classified as nonattainment when they meet          the 1-hour ozone NAAQS.          Propose national guidance for ozone SIP revisions          and attainment demonstration requirements so states          will know how to proceed in developing plans for          attainment.

(-$8,293,400) Resources are reduced from elements          of the ozone program that were associated with          development of SIP revisions that are no longer          required.          (+$54,800,000 STAG/S&T) Fine particles are          highly complex and pervasive pollutants that are          believed to create high health risks for millions          of people. To achieve major reductions in fine          particles and realize the health benefits from          the new NAAQS we need to make a significant investment          of $65,700,000 to provide states and tribes with          the critical tools they need to better measure          and characterize fine particles and understand          how they are emitted, formed, and transported.          This investment is essential for building a strong          foundation for action and will result in more          accurate information for identifying problem areas          and source categories.                 EPA will need to provide states and tribes with the         funding necessary to establish a 1,500-site national         PM 2.5  monitoring network in time to collect         complete and accurate information for identifying         areas with unhealthy air. Funds allocated to build         this network will cover the costs for monitor purchase,         network design and siting, operations and maintenance,         and continuous monitoring and/or meteorological stations         at selected sites.         Funds will also cover costs for chemical speciation         analysis so that states and tribes can determine the         chemical constituents of the PM 2.5  and         better identify and understand the sources and characteristics         of the pollution and its potential effects.                  (+$10,000,000 S&T/EPM) We also need to develop          and provide to states and tribes source characterization          information for use, in conjunction with air quality          information provided by the PM 2.5  network,          in identifying the pollution sources that contribute          to health and environmental risks. Emissions factors          will be developed for point sources, such as utility          boilers, as well as key area sources, such as          new diesel passenger vehicles, off-road heavy          diesel engines, agricultural tilling, construction,          woodstoves, open burning, and roads. We will also          assist states and tribes in developing or revising          data systems to track, report, and analyze emissions          and air quality information.          (+$3,405,000 EPM) Sustainable Development Grants          will increase to encourage community, business          and government to work cooperatively to develop          flexible, locally-oriented approaches, that link          place based environmental management and quality          of life with sustainable development and revitalization.          To secure grant funding, public and private entities          within the community must be willing to contribute          their resources, either in cash or through in-kind          services and supplies.          (+$1,250,000 EPM) The Right-to-Know program will          increase to provide a comprehensive framework          for measuring and reporting environmental information.          This approach incorporates updated technology          for environmental measurement and monitoring;          ensures that the information is useful and timely          for families and communities; facilitates public          access to comprehensive and integrated environmental          data; and, provides effective tools for communicating,          interpreting and applying environmental data.          (+$4,310,300) We will focus increased efforts          on tools and approaches for addressing the conflict          between urban economic development and programs          for ozone, particulate matter, and other environmental          problems.          (+$2,552,900) This increase will be used to test          vehicles and engines to provide data on emissions          under various operating conditions. These data          will be used to improve emission models used by          the states and EPA.          (-$578,800 and -7.2 workyears S&T) The Agency          will reduce tropospheric ozone health research          by redirecting most of these resources to One          Atmosphere research (under the Sound Science,          Improved Understanding of Environmental Risk,          and Greater Innovation to Address Environmental          Problems goal). Under the One Atmosphere research          program, research efforts on epidemiological methods          and on the mechanisms by which pollutants produce          effects and the dose-response of those effects          will be conducted to address both criteria air          pollutants and air toxics rather than individual          toxic compounds. Since tropospheric ozone is a          prominent air pollutant constituent of urban atmospheres,          this redirection provides start-up resources for          research on the combined influence of air pollutants          and human health. The reduction to tropospheric          ozone research will reduce the effort to identify          factors affecting human respiratory response to          ozone as a single air contaminant.          (-$775,300 and -6.1 workyears S&T) The Agency          will reduce tropospheric ozone terrestrial ecology          research. This reduction reflects a reduced effort          to characterize the effects of tropospheric ozone          on the productivity of tree species and a redirection          of effort to the development of global indicators          of terrestrial ecosystem change. The terrestrial          indicators of global change include similar indicators          to those developed under the tropospheric ozone          program; thus, this redirection represents consolidation          and leveraging of the global and tropospheric          ozone ecology research programs.          (-$768,000 and -10.0 workyears S&T) A redirection          of resources from tropospheric ozone risk management          emissions reduction research to One Atmosphere          risk management integrated emissions reduction          research will allow the Agency to focus its resources          on development and evaluation of technologies,          which have the potential to reduce multiple pollutants          rather than focusing solely on technologies to          reduce ozone percursors such as NO x .          Multi-pollutant control or prevention devices          which can reduce NO x , as well as other          air pollutants of concern, are now a higher priority          to the Agency than single pollutant options.          (-$713,000 S&T) The Agency will disinvest          $713,000 from tropospheric ozone methods and observation-based          assessments exposure research. The Agency expects          to successfully complete methods development for          a number of ozone precursors in 1998 in keeping          with NARSTO. The next phase of applying these          methods as part of an in-house testing and observational          approach to assess changes in emissions and their          relation to area ozone formation is anticipated,          due to this disinvestment, to be completed through          a long-term research effort so that no impact          will be incurred.          (-$467,800 and +4.0 total workyears S&T) The          Agency will decrease resources allocated to tropospheric          ozone emissions characterization research, which          will significantly reduce the NARSTO-related risk          management research focused on improving the techniques          used to estimate emissions of ozone precursors          (volatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxides)          from mobile (diesel and light-duty vehicles) sources.          EPA has developed a model which would substantially          improve estimates of mobile source emissions by          taking into account various modes of vehicle operation.          Components of this model are being factored into          the regulatory models which are used by atmospheric          modelers, the Office of Mobile Sources, and state          regulatory authorities to develop estimates of          mobile source emissions. This reduction will eliminate          all NARSTO-funded research on heavy duty diesel          trucks and significantly reduce the information          included in the mobile emissions model. Completion          of a version of the model that can be used by          other researchers and Federal, state and local          policymakers will be delayed substantially.          (+$2,517,400 S&T) Long-term research efforts          will increase for both (1) tropospheric ozone          precursor measurements, modeling source emissions,          and health and ecological effects for NAAQS related          ozone risk assessments ($900,000) and (2) measurements          and modeling for particulate matter, epidemiological          and toxicological research on long-term effects          of particulate matter, and a risk model for short-          and long-term effects based on epidemiological,          toxicological and mechanistic studies ($1,617,400).

Large numbers         of people will enjoy longer and better lives, and         will be able to engage in activities they otherwise         would be precluded from enjoying.         To attain the objective, we will need to reassess the         population and economic growth assumptions as well         as improvements in our scientific understanding of         ozone and particulate matter and their solutions;         this reassessment most likely will occur beyond the         current planning horizon. For example, we know the         new PM 2.5  standard also reduces toxic pollutants         in the atmosphere, but we cannot yet quantify the         reduction. Improvement in our emission inventories,         monitoring, and analysis techniques will provide opportunities         for integrating programs to provide emission reductions         from multiple pollutants. We also expect to be able         to make major progress in the next ten years to reduce         emissions from mobile sources, especially those powered         by diesel engines. These technological improvements         are expected to present opportunities for both reducing         emissions and aspiring to higher standards of environmental         protection.         Research efforts for tropospheric ozone and particulate         matter support the achievement of the objective by         providing health and ecological effects information,         as well as the exposure, source characterization,         and risk management data, to both meet and implement         the NAAQSs.         Key Performance Measures Verification         Data sources:                  EPA National Emission Trends Database;           EPA AIRS Air Quality Subsystem;           EPA Findings and Required Elements Data System          (FREDS);           Interagency Monitoring of Protected Visual Environments          (IMPROVE) database.                 Data from the National Emission Trends Database and         the AIRS Air Quality Subsystem is used to determine         if nonattainment areas have their requisite three         years of clean air data needed for redesignation.         The FREDS system tracks the progress of states and         Regions in reviewing and approving the required elements         of the SIPs also needed for redesignation to attainment.         The IMPROVE database provides data on visibility improvement         from various sites nationally.         QA/QC procedures:         To assure that the ambient air quality data provides         a sound basis for monitoring the progress in air quality,         the following quality assurance steps are taken. There         are quality control methods specified for the collection         of data such as filter handling to ensure the technical         quality of the data at each site. There are also methods         in place such as co-location of monitors to ensure         uniform readings across the monitoring network. Finally,         there are systems audits which regularly review the         overall air quality data collection activity for any         needed changes or corrections.         In the area of environmental science and research,         EPA has several strategies to validate and verify         performance measures in the area of environmental         science and research. The Agency has implemented a         risk-based research planning process to use risk assessment         and risk management as principal priority-setting         criteria. EPA conducts annual research program reviews         to both evaluate the status and accomplishments of         its research and determine planning priorities. To         better draw upon the expertise of the environmental         academic community, EPA created the Science to Achieve         Results (STAR) program of peer-reviewed, mission-driven         extramural grants. The Agency is also working with         various professional societies on research issues.         Chief among the Agency's validation and verification         mechanisms is a rigorous peer review process. In a         July 1997 memorandum, EPA's Deputy Administrator states         that peer review will be expanded, ""to include both         the  major  work products provided in the past         and...all scientific and technical products supporting         Agency decisions..."" This expanded and strengthened         focus on peer review will help ensure that the performance         measures listed here are verified and validated by         external organizations. The Agency utilizes peer review         throughout the research planning and implementation         process, both to ensure that planned research addresses         critical knowledge issues within EPA's mission,  and          to assess the quality of scientific research plans,         products, and proposals. This is accomplished through         the use of independent entities such as the Science         Advisory Board (SAB) and the Board of Scientific Councilors         (BOSC). The BOSC, established under the Federal Advisory         Committee Act, will even examine the way the Agency         uses peer review, as well as the management of its         research and development laboratories.         EPA's external research program undergoes extensive         peer review. Proposals from the external scientific         community are peer-reviewed and projects are then         selected for funding through grants or cooperative         agreements. In addition, Requests for Applications         (RFAs) under the STAR program are often developed         jointly with outside partners such as the National         Science Foundation. In this way, EPA has developed         a mechanism by which to check the quality and relevance         of its research program.         The Office of Research and Development Management Information         System (OMIS) will be another accountability tool         used to verify and validate performance measures.         The recently developed GPRA structure will be incorporated         into OMIS to ensure consistent maintenance and reporting,         resulting in greater accuracy and consistency of information         to users.         Statutory Authority         Clean Air Act                                 Environmental         Protection Agency         1999 Annual Request to Congress         Clean Air           Objective #2: Reduce Emissions of Air Toxics         By 2010, reduce air toxic emissions by 75 percent from         1993 levels to significantly reduce the risk to Americans         of cancer and other serious adverse health effects         caused by airborne toxics.         Overview         Toxic air pollutants pose a significant health risk         because some may cause cancer and others may cause         other health problems such as reproductive disorders,         birth defects, and damage to the nervous system. It         is common for the increased lifetime cancer risks         from the mixture of a subset of urban air toxics to         exceed 1 in 10,000 in U.S. cities. People who live         near major industrial plants may face even higher         cancer risks from air toxics.         Air toxics programs can be categorized into four key         areas: 1) characterization of air toxics from stationary         and mobile sources, 2) working with states and localities         to implement the air toxics program, 3) technology-         and risk-based standards for emissions from stationary         sources and residual risk; and, 4) research to support         the air toxics program. Most sources that emit air         toxics are believed to also emit other air pollutants         (such as ozone precursors and fine particles). EPA         will maximize the possibilities for co-control of         pollutants by focussing on developing Maximum Achievable         Control Technology (MACT) standards and other standards         that will reduce emissions from both air toxics and         other key pollutants.         Titles II and III of the Clean Air Act Amendments of         1990 mandate air toxics regulations. Title II programs         regulate clean fuels; Title III lists 189 hazardous         air pollutants (HAPs) and requires the implementation         of MACT standards for major sources emitting these         HAPs. EPA has promulgated approximately 25 percent         of these standards, with the remaining standards to         be promulgated by the year 2000. Eight years after         MACT standards are developed, EPA must determine residual         risk from HAPs, and revise the standards if there         is not an ample margin of safety to protect the public         health. Title III also mandates a national urban air         toxics strategy along with assessment and control         of the 30 most hazardous air pollutants found in urban         areas. In addition, Title III requires control of         combustion sources with emphasis on mercury and analysis         of emissions from steam powered utility plants. The         affected sources include municipal waste combustors,         medical waste incinerators, industrial and commercial         waste incinerators, and other solid waste incinerators.         Title II of the Clean Air Act requires standards for         air toxics emitted from mobile sources.         EPA's research program is charged with producing technical         reports, papers, models, and other data to improve         the scientific understanding of air toxic health risks         and providing data to be used by regulatory officials         and industry to evaluate the effectiveness of various         emission reduction technologies. The program is designed         to provide the critical scientific information that         Agency program offices and Regions need to develop,         implement, and evaluate risk management options and         to produce improved tools for environmental assessment         so that information developed by the Agency and others         is more easily used and understood.         Research priorities are determined using a risk-based         priority process focusing on effects, exposure, risk         assessment, and risk management. The information gained         from the air toxics research will: 1) protect the         public health of our children and future generations         as we better understand the risks associated with         and remedies to exposure to air toxics and mixtures         of air toxics; 2) provide strong science and readily         available and more effective information to support         Regional, state, and local government risk assessors/managers;         and 3) quantify the impacts of air toxic emissions         from mobile and stationary air toxic sources on air         quality.         The Agency supports this objective through legal counseling         and advocacy. This may include advice, participation         in the development of Agency actions, document review,         and the conduct of defensive litigation.

In 1999, complete oral and inhalation noncancer          health assessments for benzene.          In 1999, complete health assessments for five          air toxics to be indicated as high priority by          the EPA and regional offices.          In 1999, provide models and methods needed to          estimate health risks from 30 highest priority          air toxics.          By 2000, develop a preliminary urban scale Models-3/Toxics          Model for community-based human exposure assessment          for air toxics having known emissions and air          chemistry.                 The air toxics program involves setting standards and         providing the framework and information to fully implement         programs to reduce emissions and risk. To meet the         air toxics objective, EPA will shift its efforts from         setting standards to assisting states and industries         in implementing rules and to monitoring progress in         reducing emissions and risk.         Air Toxics Characterization         Following promulgation of the MACT standards, EPA must         determine if there is any remaining risk from the         regulated compounds. EPA's air toxics objective focuses         primarily on the statutory requirements of the toxics         program in the Clean Air Act to reduce emissions by         issuing technology-based standards. The objective         seeks to reduce emissions through the promulgation         and implementation of MACT standards. Although this         goal is measurable it does not encompass the health         and ecological benefits that the public expects from         the program. Although a health and environmental goal         is more appropriate, EPA lacks the information and         tools to adequately characterize and measure progress         in improving public health and environmental impacts         of air toxics. The program will need to invest in         improved and innovative monitoring and modeling, inventories,         development and refinement of environmental indicators,         and risk assessment tools to better characterize the         risk from air toxics and establish a baseline for         measuring risk in carrying out the Government Performance         and Results Act (GPRA). EPA will build on state efforts         to create a national toxics monitoring and inventory         program in order to better characterize exposures         to hazardous air pollution.         Mobile source programs currently reduce air toxics         with vehicle-based controls and with cleaner burning         fuels. Air toxics reductions result from gas and diesel         powered vehicles and non-road equipment meeting more         stringent ""tailpipe"" standards; improved evaporative         controls on cars and trucks; reduced gasoline volatility;         reformulated gasoline; and enhanced vehicle inspection         and maintenance programs. In addition, EPA will conduct         a study of the need for and the feasibility of controlling         emissions of unregulated toxic air pollutants associated         with motor vehicles and fuels. In addition to reducing         air toxics, vehicle tailpipe controls reduce ozone         and particulate matter. Consequently, we have counted         these programs under the ozone and particulate matter         objective. We are counting only fuels programs under         the resource profile for air toxics.         Phase I reformulated gasoline (RFG) reduces toxics         by 15 percent; Phase II RFG will reduce toxics by         28 percent beginning in 2000. The Fuels and Fuel Additives         Registration Program provides for the review and screening         of potential toxic substances prior to introduction         into motor vehicle fuel supplies. Approximately 10,000         registration requests will be submitted.          Air Toxics Implementation         As EPA develops standards for controlling the emissions         of HAPs, each state must implement these rules with         compliance monitoring. The Agency delegates the implementation         activities to the states and provides the tools and         guidance to ensure smooth and consistent implementation         of the standards. EPA will issue guidance and conduct         outreach activities to help sources comply. EPA will         use emissions testing and, where feasible, continuous         emission monitoring or emission inventories to monitor         compliance with MACT and other air toxics standards.         EPA will continue the fuels and fuel additives registration         system.         EPA will perform studies related to air toxic deposition         into selected bodies of water; the urban air toxics         problem; and municipal waste combustors. Again, OAR         will rely on research from the Office of Research         and Development (ORD) in these areas, and will work         cooperatively with the Office of Water (OW) in the         Great Waters Acid Deposition Study.         Concurrent with the release of the updated Great Waters         report in June 1997, EPA issued a Notice of Availability         announcing and seeking comment on its determination         that section 112 of the Clean Air Act provides adequate         authority to regulate air pollutants to prevent adverse         effects due to deposition in Great Waters. In 1999,         the Agency will continue multi-media modeling and         deposition studies, and will facilitate state and         regional deposition reduction strategies, proposing         necessary, cross-media regulations to allow state         and local governments to implement control programs         to reduce air deposition.         In 1999, EPA will publish the Urban Area Source Report         and Strategy. EPA will focus on an integrated urban         toxics strategy by identifying the 30 hazardous air         pollutants that pose the greatest threat in urban         areas. EPA will identify in the strategy the source         categories that emit these pollutants and assure that         90 percent of these urban areas sources are subject         to regulation.         As part of the work performed under the Clean Air Act,         EPA will reduce the emissions and lower the risk associated         with the persistent, bioaccumulative toxics (PBTs).         The air program will work to achieve these reductions         through regulatory and prevention-based measures.         EPA will be developing tools to evaluate the impact         of PBTs and the impact of reductions in PBTs on human         health and the environment.         Air Toxics Rules and Standards Development         In developing the 10-year MACT standards, EPA will         continue to streamline the air toxics program by building         on experience from earlier standards and by providing         greater flexibility for states that want to achieve         the emission reductions, but in ways that are different         from those proposed by EPA. EPA will continue approaches         such as the Common Sense Initiative, consolidated         rules, partnerships with states in making presumptive         MACT determinations, and the generic MACT approach         where rulemakings for source categories with four         or fewer major facilities would be developed as a         broad-based rule. All of the four-year MACT standards         have been completed. EPA is planning to move three         source categories into the ten-year bin (statutory         deadline November 2000). EPA plans to promulgate all         ten-year standards on schedule.         The second phase of air toxics standards will address         the risks to public health and the environment that         remain after the application of MACT controls. Often         referred to as residual risk standards, these standards         would be established eight years after promulgation         of MACT standards. EPA is developing a strategy for         identifying and dealing with residual risk through         studies related to emissions from electric utilities         and EPA risk assessment procedures and methods.         Section 129 of the Clean Air Act requires the establishment         of performance standards for each category of solid         waste incinerators. These categories include: municipal         waste combustors, medical waste incinerators, industrial         and commercial waste incinerators, and other solid         waste incinerators. EPA will provide guidance for         implementing the rules promulgated for municipal and         medical waste incinerators. The rules for industrial         and commercial and other waste incinerators have been         combined and are part of the Industrial Combustion         Coordinated Rulemaking (ICCR), which has a statutory         deadline of November 2000. The ICCR also includes:         boilers, process heaters, gas turbines, and internal         combustion engines, which are regulated under sections         111 and 112 of the Clean Air Act. These standards         are being developed using the Federal Advisory Committee         Act in a effort to involve all interested stakeholders.         EPA will develop regulatory options for the various         categories and subcategories of incinerators and develop         a proposal package for the ICCR.         Reinvention efforts continue in the form of Common         Sense Initiatives, Project XL, and the Consolidated         Federal Air Rule. The Common Sense Initiative is an         industry-by-industry approach to environmental policy         and rule development. Project XL offers sources alternative         compliance methods for greater environmental benefit,         and the Consolidated Federal Air Rule reduces costs         and regulatory burdens by simplifying and consolidating         reporting and record keeping requirements affecting         an industry.         Air Toxics Research         The air toxics research program: (1) defines the magnitude         of the urban air toxics problem through effects and         exposure research; (2) determines the most cost-effective         ways to manage the risks through development of modeling         tools and evaluation of control options; and (3) characterizes         and measures emissions from vehicles. The data and         methods available to assess and manage non-cancer         health risks of air toxics are very limited. For example,         the Clean Air Act requires substantial assessment         of risks posed by air toxics in urban areas and public         comments on local permits within the decade. Exposures         from these sources may have an impact on most of the         U.S. population. Uncertainties in exposure assessment         and dose-response assessment often prevent adequate         evaluation of risks, and may lead to either unnecessary         controls if assumptions are overly conservative or         inadequate protection of public health if assumptions         are not protective enough. In addition, many of the         sources contributing to pollution in urban areas are         small and guidance/assistance is needed on how to         reduce emissions in a cost-effective manner. The array         of scientific methods, models, and data developed         by the Agency and others are frequently difficult         to use and interpret, particularly for communities         faced with evaluation of their specific situations.         For these reasons, in 1999 EPA will conduct research         and provide assistance that may reduce these uncertainties.         Health effects researchers will quantitatively evaluate         cancer and non-cancer health effects from air toxics         exposures emphasizing: effects of acute and recurrent         acute exposures; impacts on sensitive subpopulations;         and development of methods to assess effects from         chemical classes and common urban air pollutant mixtures.         Researchers will also improve methods for extrapolations         of health data from animals to humans to improve our         understanding of health effects and risk assessment         methods. Resources will be applied to better understand         the impacts on health of exposure to air toxics in         the urban setting, where most risks are anticipated         to occur. Techniques will also be developed from long-term,         multi-disciplinary studies to characterize health         outcomes associated with urban toxics.         Exposure researchers will develop (1) methods to identify         contributing sources from ambient air measurements;         and (2) improved models to characterize actual human         exposure. Scientists will determine the factors to         ascertain whether inner city and other low income         communities are being subjected to exposures to air         toxics at a greater degree than other communities.         Resources will provide limited support to the development         of approaches for assessing cumulative exposures to         air toxics from both area sources and previously controlled         major point sources. These approaches should be useful         in assessing residual risks. Some 1999 Science and         Technology funds will go toward the development of         a preliminary urban scale Models-3/Toxics Model for         Community-Based Human Exposure Assessment for air         toxics having known emissions and air chemistry, but         the preliminary model will not be realized until a         future fiscal year. This model will for the first         time estimate regional urban and source specific air         toxics exposures and allow multi-scale air toxics         exposure projections.         Research will also be conducted to develop and demonstrate         new methods to assess risks from urban toxics. The         goal is to take information developed in a research         context and communicate the information more effectively         to regional and local government risk assessors/managers         through technology transfer centers. These risk assessors/managers         will use the new risk assessment methods for chronic         and acute non-cancer assessments and the new guidance         for cancer risk assessment to determine with greater         certainty the risks associated with the HAPs arising         from area sources. In 1999, resources will: enhance         the development of health effects assessments from         chronic (life-time) and acute (short-term) exposures         and cancer risk determinations for the urban toxics         program; staff the Air Risk Information Support Center         (Air RISC) Hotline to communicate risk assessment         methodologies and respond to air pollution questions         from regional, state, and community air pollution         control offices; and provide consultation to program,         state, regional, and community offices on urban toxics.         These resources will enable EPA to more effectively         manage program coordination and meet program goals         of supporting and transferring information to communities.         Researchers will continue to incorporate more recent         human epidemiological findings and other data, as         appropriate, into the integrated human and environmental         health risk assessment of mercury emissions.         In 1999, using prior year Science and Technology funding         for air toxics emissions reduction research (at $500,000         per year for 1996-1998), EPA will produce data, models,         and technical information that can be used by Federal,         state, and local air pollution regulatory officials         to (1) understand the processes which lead to the         formation of organic and metal compounds in combustion         systems and (2) quantitatively evaluate the viability         (cost and performance) of various technologies to         control or prevent these emissions.         Air pollution from mobile sources has been estimated         to account for over half of the nationwide emissions         of air toxics, ozone precursors (volatile organic         compounds and nitrogen oxides), and carbon monoxide.         Mobile sources research will be in the areas of exposure         and risk assessment. The exposure work will consist         of: (1) chemical characterization of vehicle emissions         and (2) measuring ""real world"" emissions from in-use         vehicles. As such, some 1999 Science and Technology         funds will go toward completing the characterization         of emissions and attendant risks associated with new         fuels and fuel additives, but full characterization         will not be realized until a future fiscal year.         In support of the mobile sources risk assessment efforts,         the Agency will continue to support limited emissions         characterization for exposure assessments. Consultation         on data collection, risk assessments, and health-related         regulatory decisions for fuels and fuel additives         will support the control of HAPs from motor vehicles.         Assessment activities will also result in the completion         of the Health Risk Assessment Document for Diesel         Engine Emissions. In addition, research will focus         on the health effects associated with air toxics (such         as benzene and butadiene) and emerging motor vehicle         technologies and fuels, including the impact of new         engine and emission control technologies, new fuels,         and other fuels.         1998 Annual Performance Goals                  In 1998, reduce air toxic emissions by 13 percent          from 1993 levels.          In 1998, diesel and 1,3-butadiene health assessments          submitted to the Science Advisory Board, and benzene          cancer unit risk completed.          In 1998, complete dose response assessments for          six listed air toxics (beryllium, chromium, bentazon,          cadmium, acetonitrile, and vinyl chloride) and          assessments for mercury report to Congress.                 1999 Change from 1998 Enacted         (Dollars in Thousands)                                                     Dollars            FTE                                 02 Obj.

We have directed resources to develop monitoring          strategies, models, and emissions inventories          that will enable the Agency to begin to better          define the scope of the air toxics problem, identify          the associated health risks, and track progress          in reducing risks. We also have increased resources          for programs to help state, tribal, and local          agencies, as well as the regulated community,          implement national standards to reduce toxic emissions.          Establishing a solid air toxics health baseline          and developing human health indicators are particularly          important to measuring program effectiveness and          communicating to the public meaningful health          and environmental outcomes. Although we know that          air toxics are harmful to human health we have          not been able to adequately characterize exposure          results. In addition, as greater numbers of MACT          and other air toxic rules are finalized by the          Agency, states will be required to implement these          emission standards. The Agency will be providing          tools and guidance as well as conducting outreach          activities to accept delegation of the air toxics          programs.          (+$1,200,000) Provide increased support for a          cross-Agency initiative aimed at addressing persistent          bio-accumulative toxics. The pervasiveness and          complexity of these pollutants and the lessons          learned from actions to date point to the need          for a more significant linkage among the statutory          and programmatic requirements for which EPA is          responsible. Examples of such pollutants include          nitrogen, mercury, and dioxin. In particular,          it is important to assess the disproportionate          effects that these pollutants have on human health;          particularly children's health, ecosystems, and          the economy.          (+$3,200,000) Target increased state grant resources,          through reprogramming, to measuring levels of          airborne air toxics, particularly in urban areas.          This increase is part of a strategic re-direction          for the air grants program, developed jointly          with our state and local partners. Redirection          of grant resources to air toxics would expand          the pollutant and geographic coverage of air toxic          monitoring. State and local agencies also will          expand pollutant characterization and speciation          efforts to better identify the sources of airborne          toxics and develop control strategies to address          them.          (-$1,245,600 extramural and -8.7 total workyears          S&T) Eliminate all of the urban toxics risk          management emissions reduction research. All of          the funding and workyears have been redirected          to the One Atmosphere research program (under          the Sound Science, Improved Understanding of Environmental          Risk, and Greater Innovation to Address Environmental          Problems goal), which will focus on integrated          technologies that can address both criteria pollutants          and air toxics, including pollutants of concern,          such as mercury.          (+$500,000) Increase the amount of funding toward          long-term multi-disciplinary studies associated          with urban toxics.

We will also enjoy the collateral public health benefit         of reducing ozone and fine particles, since many air         toxics are present in these pollutants. Many millions         of people, particularly in cities and in lower-income         areas around factories, will be able to breathe air         that contains less of these dangerous pollutants and         enjoy longer, healthier lives. In addition, we will         increase our overall understanding of the air toxics         problem through advancements in monitoring and modeling         methods, as well as improved science for characterizing         risk. These improvements will enable us to uncover         additional cost-effective opportunities for further         reducing air toxics emissions and decreasing their         risk to public health and the environment.         Key Assumptions and External Factors                  EPA promulgates all MACT standards on time with          no litigation.          Sources are in compliance by required dates.          EPA and states will develop and agree upon sound          environmental and health indicators to measure          emissions reductions and human health improvements.          Resources will be available to develop needed          infrastructures.                 Key Performance Measures Verification         Data sources include:                  EPA's Toxics Release Inventory (TRI);          National Toxic Inventory (NTI);          AIRS          MACTRAX                 The NTI contains emission estimates for major, area,         and mobile source categories. To date, we have collected         emission inventory data to update the NTI from the         externally and internally peer-reviewed Clean Air         Act section 112(c)(6) inventory; MACT emissions data         gathered for 2-, 4-, and 7-year standards; state and         local inventories (five states); and the TRI. We have         also developed emissions data using emission factors         and activity level data to update source categories         for which we do not have MACT, state or local, or         TRI inventory data. We have identified an additional         12 states that have available HAP inventory data.         By the end of the year, we will complete the update         of NTI Version 3.0 for base year 1993, provide peer-reviewed         inventories for 40 hazardous air pollutants to support         Clean Air Act section 112(k), and complete compilation         of MACT baseline emissions data for 2-, 4-, and half         of the 7-year source categories. A 1993 baseline emissions         inventory will allow us to track emission reductions         of HAPs as control programs are implemented. We will         be able to store and retrieve all these data from         the AIRS system.         MACTRAX provides a mechanism to track the air implementation         activities by each state to insure that the emission         reductions expected from the development of MACT standards         can be realized through full implementation of the         standards.         Procedures for quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC)         of emission and ambient air toxics data are not as         institutionalized as those used for the criteria pollutant         program. Air toxics data are not required of states,         but are voluntary. EPA does review the data to assure         data quality and consistency, but no formal procedures         are in place for QA. Regional offices do review all         data before it is placed in MACTRAX. Procedures are         now being finalized to ensure the quality of emissions         data collected from industry that are used for the         development of technology-based emission standards.         In the area of environmental science and research EPA         has several strategies to validate and verify performance         measures. The Agency has implemented a risk-based         research planning process to use risk assessment and         risk management as principal priority-setting criteria.         EPA conducts annual research program reviews to both         evaluate the status and accomplishments of its research         and determine planning priorities. To better draw         upon the expertise of the environmental academic community,         EPA created the Science to Achieve Results (STAR)         program of peer-reviewed, mission-driven extramural         grants; the Agency is also working with various professional         societies on research issues.         Chief among the Agency's validation and verification         mechanisms is a rigorous peer review process. In a         July 1997 memorandum, EPA's Deputy Administrator stated         that peer review will be expanded, ""to include both         the  major  work products provided in the past         and...all scientific and technical products supporting         Agency decisions..."" This expanded and strengthened         focus on peer review will help ensure that the performance         measures listed here are verified and validated by         external organizations. The Agency utilizes peer review         throughout the research planning and implementation         process, both to ensure that planned research addresses         critical knowledge issues within EPA's mission,  and          to assess the quality of scientific research plans,         products, and proposals. This is accomplished through         the use of independent entities such as the Science         Advisory Board (SAB) and the Board of Scientific Councilors         (BOSC). The BOSC, established under the Federal Advisory         Committee Act, will even examine the way the Agency         uses peer review, as well as the management of its         research and development laboratories.         EPA's external research program undergoes extensive         peer review. Proposals from the external scientific         community are peer-reviewed and projects are then         selected for funding through grants or cooperative         agreements. In addition, Requests for Applications         (RFAs) under the STAR program are often developed         jointly with outside partners such as the National         Science Foundation. In this way, EPA has developed         a mechanism by which to check the quality and relevance         of its research program.         The Office of Research and Development Management Information         System (OMIS) will be another accountability tool         used to verify and validate performance measures.         The recently developed GPRA structure will be incorporated         into OMIS to ensure consistent maintenance and reporting,         resulting in greater accuracy and consistency of information         to users.         Statutory Authority         Clean Air Act                         Environmental         Protection Agency         1999 Annual Plan Request to OMB         Clean Air         Objective #3: Attain NAAQS for CO, SO2, NO2, and         Lead         By 2005, improve air quality for Americans living in         areas that do not meet the current National Ambient         Air Quality Standards (NAAQSs) for carbon monoxide         (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ), lead, and nitrogen         dioxide (NO 2 ).         Overview         Under the Clean Air Act, EPA must set NAAQSs for pollutants         that endanger public health and the environment. CO,         SO 2 , lead, and NO 2  are all high-risk         pollutants. EPA has been relatively successful in         reducing these air pollutants in many urban areas         through stationary and mobile source controls. EPA         also includes new source review (NSR) and operating         permit programs for multiple pollutants under this         objective. Each pollutant and the programs that reduce         them are described separately below:         Carbon Monoxide         CO is a colorless, odorless, poisonous gas formed when         carbon in fuels is not burned completely. It is a         byproduct of highway vehicle exhaust, which contributes         about 60 percent of all CO emissions nationwide. In         cities, automobile exhaust can cause as much as 95         percent of all CO emissions. Vehicle Miles Traveled         (VMT) continue to increase each year. These emissions         can result in high concentrations of CO, particularly         in local areas with heavy traffic congestion. Other         sources of CO emissions include industrial processes         and fuel combustion in sources such as boilers and         incinerators.         Carbon monoxide enters the bloodstream and reduces         oxygen delivery to the body's organs and tissues.         The health threat from exposure to CO is most serious         for those who suffer from cardiovascular disease.         Healthy individuals are also affected, but only at         higher levels of exposure. Exposure to elevated CO         levels is associated with visual impairment, reduced         work capacity, reduced manual dexterity, decreased         learning ability, and difficulty in performing complex         tasks.         Despite an overall downward trend in concentrations         and emissions of CO, some metropolitan areas still         experience high levels of CO. Approximately 29 areas         are still classified as non-attainment for the air         quality standard for carbon monoxide.          Sulfur Dioxide         Sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ) belongs to the family         of gases called sulfur oxides (SOx). These gases are         formed when fuel containing sulfur (mainly coal and         oil) is burned, and during metal smelting and other         industrial processes. The major health concerns associated         with exposure to high concentrations of SO 2          include effects on breathing, respiratory illness,         alterations in pulmonary defenses, and aggravation         of existing cardiovascular disease. Children, the         elderly, and people with asthma, cardiovascular disease         or chronic lung disease (such as bronchitis or emphysema),         are most susceptible to adverse health effects associated         with exposure to SO 2 . In the atmosphere         SO 2  can react to form fine particles which         may aggravate respiratory disease and lead to premature         death. SO 2  is also a precursor to sulfates,         which are associated with acidification of lakes and         streams, accelerated corrosion of buildings and monuments         and reduced visibility.         Approximately 40 areas are still classified as non-attainment         areas for the air quality standard for SO 2 .         Lead         Exposure to ambient lead mainly occurs through inhalation         of air and ingestion of lead in food, paint, water,         soil, or dust. Lead accumulates in the body in blood,         bone, and soft tissue. Because it is not readily excreted,         lead can also affect the kidneys, liver, nervous system         and other organs. Excessive exposure to lead may cause         kidney disease, reproductive disorders, and neurological         impairments such as seizures, mental retardation,         and/or behavioral disorders. Fetuses and children         are especially susceptible to low doses of lead, often         suffering central nervous system damage or slowed         growth.         Thanks largely to the elimination of leaded gasoline,         human exposure to lead is currently much less of a         problem. Today, smelters and battery plants are the         major sources of lead in the air. Approximately 10         areas are still classified as non-attainment for the         air quality standard for lead.         Nitrogen Dioxide         Nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ) belongs to a family         of highly reactive gases called nitrogen oxides (NOx).         Nitrogen oxides form when fuel is burned efficiently         at high temperatures. They are derived primarily from         motor vehicle exhaust and stationary sources such         as electric utilities and industrial boilers. By itself,         NOx poses a human health and ecosystem threat, but         it also serves as a precursor to ozone and particulate         matter. NOx reacts with volatile organic compounds         in the presence of sunlight to form urban haze. Nitrogen         dioxide can be converted into fine nitrate aerosols,         a constituent of fine particles (PM 2.5 ).         In addition, it is a strong oxidizing agent and reacts         in the air to form corrosive nitric acid, as well         as toxic organic nitrates.         Nitrogen oxides irritate the lungs and lower resistance         to respiratory infections such as influenza. They         can also have adverse effects on both terrestrial         and aquatic ecosystems, contributing to acid rain         and eutrophication in coastal waters.         Currently, all areas in the U.S., except southern California,         are classified as in attainment for the NO 2          air quality standard.         EPA has made progress toward reducing the emissions         of these pollutants and toward the goal of having         all areas in attainment for all of these pollutants         by 2005. Over the next several years we will continue         to work with areas to achieve attainment and with         those areas in attainment to maintain that status.         We will also review the standards to assure that they         are at a level that protects public health.         Key Milestones                  1999: Start phasing in revised motor vehicle revised          exhaust emission test procedure for an 11% reduction          in CO emissions.          Establish a plan and schedule for the review of          the NAAQS for nitrogen dioxide.          Issue final intervention level policy to give          states guidance on identifying and addressing          peak exceedences of the sulfur dioxide NAAQS that          are only of short durations.          2000: Prepare carbon monoxide NAAQS review staff          paper for CASAC review.

Carbon Monoxide         EPA has set standards for CO and currently assists         states in implementing strategies to reduce CO pollution         and maintain compliance with the standard. CO tends         to be a local pollution problem and is not transported         from one area to another. States submit state implementation         plans for CO, which include many mobile-source related         programs such as reformulated gasoline.         EPA will continue existing CO work, concentrating primarily         on mobile source programs (such as oxygenated fuel         and reformulated gasoline), and on assisting states         to implement attainment and maintenance plans. EPA         will provide information to the scientific community         and stakeholders on the environmental aspects of the         use of oxygenated fuels and will provide recommendations         to improve the program.         In the mobile source program, the control of CO at         the Federal level is carried out as an integral part         of the control programs for ozone and NO x .         The resources associated with these integrated programs         are accounted for under the ozone and PM objectives.         Additional benefits will be derived from programs         (Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles (PNGV))         accounted for under the Climate Change goals and objectives.         Only a relatively small amount of work is performed         directly aimed at CO control, mainly as it relates         to non-attainment areas, and the associated planning         (SIPs, conformity) and control measures (I/M, oxygenated         fuels).         Sulfur Dioxide         EPA will continue to ensure that all areas are in compliance         with the standard and will review the standard, as         the Clean Air Act mandates, to ensure that it adequately         protects human health. The sulfur dioxide program         is not expected to grow in the near future. The most         recent review of the sulfur dioxide standard is complete         and the standard has been reaffirmed. In 1999, EPA         will issue the final intervention level policy which         is intended to give states guidance on identifying         and addressing peak exceedences of the sulfur dioxide         standard that occur for only short durations.         EPA will boost efforts to reduce the more pervasive         sulfur oxides in the acid rain, particulate matter         and regional haze programs. Information on sulfur         dioxide and the programs that reduce it, are described         in the acid rain objective.         Lead         EPA will continue a relatively low level of existing         work, emphasizing primarily the few nonattainment         areas near smelters. Mandating the use of unleaded         gasoline will continue to be the most effective way         to prevent airborne lead. EPA will review the standard,         as the Clean Air Act mandates, to ensure that it adequately         protects human health.         Nitrogen Dioxide         EPA will continue to ensure that all areas are in compliance         with the standard and will review the standard, as         the Clean Air Act mandates, to ensure that it adequately         protects human health. The nitrogen dioxide program         is not expected to grow in the near future.         However, EPA will boost efforts to reduce the more         pervasive nitrogen oxides in the acid rain and mobile         source programs, encouraging market-based, low cost         pollutant trading. These programs will simultaneously         address nitrogen oxides, ozone, and fine particulate         matter. Information on nitrogen oxides and the programs         that reduce it are described in the ozone, particulate         matter and visibility objective.         Permits/NSR         EPA will make revisions to Part 71 Federal operating         permit rules to include state operating permit requirements         and provide technical support to Regions and states         on permit program revisions. In 1998, EPA will promulgate         the NSR reform rules which simplify the new source         permitting process. In 1999, EPA will enter an intensive         period of training and technical support activities         to ensure smooth implementation of this major regulatory         reinvention effort. We will continue to be involved         in and expand as needed our efforts to reform and         streamline our permitting programs.         1998 Annual Performance Goals         Redesignate 22 areas to attainment for carbon monoxide,         sulfur dioxide, lead, and/or nitrogen dioxide.         1999 Change from 1998 Enacted          (Dollars in Thousands)                                         Dollars           FTE                              03 Obj.

Much          of the work directed towards carbon monoxide,          lead, nitrogen dioxide, and sulfur dioxide is          associated with maintenance level activities.          Ambient monitoring for these pollutants is being          reduced as well as resources associated with developing          the SIP revisions required under the Clean Air          Act amendments of 1990 (CAAA).          (+$873,800) Total payroll costs for this objective          will increase to reflect increased workforce costs.

Conclusion         Through achievement of this objective, EPA will significantly         enhance public health and welfare for the 45 million         Americans currently living in non-attainment areas.         These people will enjoy longer and better lives, and         will be able to engage in activities they otherwise         would be precluded from doing. Although the attainment         of the objectives will lead to improvements, it is         also likely that additional work will have to be done         beyond the current planning horizon to account for         growth in both population and economic activity and         improvements in our scientific understanding of the         environmental problems and their solutions. For example,         health risks and exposure assessments have always         been done pollutant-by-pollutant. We do not know the         effects of exposure to low doses of multiple pollutants.         Improvements in risk assessment techniques and multiple         exposure analysis will present us with greater options         for improving the protection to public health.         Key Performance Measures Verification         Data sources:                  EPA National Emission Trends Database;           EPA AIRS Air Quality Subsystem;           EPA Findings and Required Elements Data System;          Area redesignations in the Federal Register.                 Data from the National Emission Trends Database and         the AIRS Air Quality Subsystem is used to determine         if nonattainment areas have the requisite 3 years         of clean air data needed for redesignation. The FREDS         system tracks the progress of states and Regions in         reviewing and approving the required elements of the         state implementation plans also needed for redesignation         to attainment.         QA/QC procedures:         To assure that the ambient air quality data provide         a sound basis for monitoring the progress in air quality,         the following quality assurance steps are taken. There         are quality control methods specified for the collection         of data such as filter handling to ensure the technical         quality of the data at each site. There are also methods         in place such as collocation of monitors to ensure         uniform readings across the monitoring network. Finally,         there are systems audits which regularly review the         overall air quality data collection activity for any         needed changes or corrections.         Plans to Improve Data:         The emissions data are much harder to quality assure         because of the varying methods of determining the         total emissions in a given area. In the future all         state emissions data will be posted in a compiled         data base so that states and other interested parties         can provide a much more complete review of the inventory.         One other method for developing better state emissions         data will result from the Emissions Inventory Improvement         Project which will provide consistent methods of estimating         emissions data.         Statutory Authority         Clean Air Act                                 Environmental         Protection Agency         1999 Annual Request to Congress         Clean Air         Objective #4: Acid Rain         By 2010, reduce ambient sulfates and total sulfur deposition         by 20-40 percent from 1980 levels due to reduced sulfur         dioxide emissions from utilities and industrial sources.         By 2000, ambient nitrates and total nitrogen deposition         will be reduced by 5-10 percent from 1980 levels due         to reduced emissions of nitrogen oxides from utilities         and mobile sources.         Overview         Emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ), primarily         from power plants and other industrial sources, and         nitrogen oxides (NOx), primarily from power plants         and motor vehicles, react in the atmosphere and fall         to earth as acid rain, causing acidification of lakes         and streams and contributing to the damage of trees         at high elevations. NOx emissions are a major precursor         of ground-level ozone, which affects public health         and damages crops, forests, and materials. NOx deposition         also contributes to eutrophication of coastal waters,         such as Chesapeake Bay and Tampa Bay. Additionally,         before falling to earth, SO 2  and NOx gases         form fine particles that affect public health through         premature mortality, chronic bronchitis, and other         respiratory problems, and that contribute to reduced         visibility in national parks and elsewhere. Acid rain         also accelerates the decay of building materials and         paints and contributes to degradation of irreplaceable         cultural objects such as statues and sculptures.         The Acid Rain program is authorized under Title IV         of the Clean Air Act and has numerous statutory deadlines.         In addition, the U.S. is committed to reductions in         SO 2  and NOx under the U.S.-Canada Air Quality         Agreement of 1991. EPA's Acid Rain program uses market-based         approaches to achieve SO 2  and NOx emission         reductions. The program provides affected sources         with flexibility to meet required emission reductions         at least cost (both to industry and government). The         SO 2  program features tradeable units called         allowances (1 allowance = 1 ton of SO 2 ),         accurate and verifiable measurement of emissions,         and a cap on total emissions. The acid rain program         is seen as a model for flexible and effective regulation         both here and abroad.         Major program activities include measurement, quality         assurance, and tracking of SO 2 , NOx and         CO 2  emissions as recorded by continuous         emissions monitors at more than 2000 electric utility         units, conducting field audits and certifying emissions         monitors, operation of an allowance tracking system         to record transfers of emission allowances between         different parties, reconciliation of emissions and         allowances at each electric utility unit to ensure         compliance, processing of permit actions, and assessing         the environmental impacts of emission reductions.                 Phase I of the Program began in 1995 for 450 electric         utility units. In the year 2000, Phase II of the program         begins and approximately 2,000 electric utility units         will be affected. Despite this increase in the number         of affected units, the number of quarterly emission         reports processed (8,000 per year) will remain unchanged         because Phase II electric utility units are already         required to report their emissions. However, there         will be a five-fold increase in the number of electric         utilities units for which an annual reconciliation         of allowances with measured emissions will be conducted.         In addition, there is likely to be a significant increase         in allowance trading activity in Phase II of the program.         (More than 1,000 private allowance transfers per year         are currently processed and this number is expected         to triple in Phase II of the program.) This increased         workload will be handled through improved information         resource management and by improving program operation         and efficiency through rule revisions.         In addition to administering the SO 2  and         NOx provisions of Title IV, the Acid Rain Program         will be developing and operating the Emissions and         NOx allowance tracking systems for the 12 states of         the Ozone Transport Region. The first year of compliance         for this program is 1999. Approximately 400 additional         facilities will require certification of emissions         monitors and will report quarterly emissions beginning         in 1998. NOx allowance trading will begin as soon         as the NOx Allowance Tracking System is operational         in 1998. The Acid Rain Program is also assisting with         the development of the 22 State ozone transport SIP         call and is leading the effort to develop a model         NOx budget trading rule. This effort will help States         to meet their NOx budgets cost effectively.          The program has recently been given the responsibility         to operate the Clean Air Status and Trends Network         (CASTNet) dry deposition network and to provide critical         support for operations of the National Atmospheric         Deposition Program (NADP) wet deposition network and         for a number of visibility monitoring sites. These         monitoring efforts will play a crucial role in the         program's ongoing assessment activities, including         reporting program results for the Government Performance         and Results Act (GPRA) and fulfilling assessment responsibilities         under Title IX of the Clean Air Act and the U.S.-         Canada Air Quality Agreement.         In addition to EPA programmatic activities, states         will carry out activities to implement the SO 2          and NOx portions of the Acid Rain Program, including         certification and recertification of continuous emissions         monitors (CEMs), field audits of CEMs, and permitting         activities. Some states may use acid rain state grant         funds for monitoring programs to help assess the success         of the program in reducing environmental risks.         When fully implemented in 2010, the SO 2          reductions alone under Title IV could provide as much         as $12 - $40 billion in health benefits (mostly from         an estimated reduction in premature mortality of 1,500         to 9,600 cases per year) and $3-4 billion in improved         visibility, largely from an expected 30% improvement         in visibility in the eastern United States. Acid Rain         control will also produce significant benefits in         terms of lowered surface water acidity and less damage         to high elevation forests and materials. Nevertheless,         after full implementation of the program, significant         residual risks will remain to human health, ecological         systems and quality of life.

In 1999, maintain 300,000 tons of NOx reductions          from coal-fired utility sources.          Launch the NOx Emissions and Allowance Tracking          System for the Ozone Transport Region.                 The acid rain program will complete its rule revisions,         thus streamlining implementation of the program for         industry and the Agency, and also process all quarterly         emissions reports and verify annual compliance of         affected sources with SO 2  and NOx limitations.         Achieving these performance goals will lead to the         attainment of our programmatic objectives: in 2000,         the reduction of ambient nitrates and total nitrogen         deposition by up to 10% from 1980 levels, and the         beginning of the Phase II SO 2  reductions         which will culminate in a reduction of ambient sulfates         and total sulfur deposition of up to 40% from 1980         levels by the year 2010.         The program will also begin operation of the NOx Allowance         Tracking System for the Ozone Transport Region. Achieving         this performance goal will assist the 12 Northeastern         states to attain and maintain the ozone standard.                 1998 Annual Performance Goals                  In 1998, maintain 4 million tons of SO 2           emissions reductions from utility sources.

Key           Performance Measures           1998           1999                              SO 2  Emissions           4,000,000 tons of           SO 2  emissions from utility sources           reduced from 1980 baseline.           4,000,000 tons of           SO 2  emissions from utility sources           reduced from 1980 baseline.                              NOx Reductions           300,000 tons of NOx           emissions from coal-fired utility sources           reduced from uncontrolled levels.           300,000 tons of NOx           emissions from coal-fired utility sources           reduced from uncontrolled levels.                          Reductions of SO 2  and NOx emissions and         sulfate and nitrate deposition are indicators of achievement         of program objectives.          Conclusion         Accomplishing the Acid Rain Program objective's target         for a decrease in ambient concentration and deposition         of nitrates assumes that other sources of nitrogen         oxides (e.g., mobile sources) do not grow at a faster         rate than currently projected. Despite this caveat,         progress is already being made in meeting the Acid         Rain Program objectives. In 1995, the first year of         compliance under the program, sulfur dioxide emissions         dropped by about 3.5 million tons, the greatest one         year drop in SO 2  emissions ever recorded.         This has led to a 10 - 25 percent reduction in rainfall         acidity throughout the Northeastern U.S. and has reduced         fine sulfate particulates.          Full implementation of the objective will further reduce         deposition and ambient concentration of sulfates and         nitrates, thereby reducing a variety of risks to human         health, ecosystems, and quality of life. In addition,         full implementation of the sulfur dioxide reductions         under the Acid Rain Program will be a critical component         for nonattainment areas as they work to meet the PM2.5         standard once it is implemented.         Although implementation of this objective will significantly         reduce risks, residual risks will remain. For example,         further reductions in SO 2  and NOx (such         as reductions that would be required under the NAAQS         revisions) would be necessary to reduce the health         impacts of PM 2.5  and ozone. In addition,         further reductions in nitrogen and sulfur deposition         would be necessary to fully protect the most sensitive         ecosystems from acidification.         Key Performance Measures Verification         The Acid Rain program performance data is some of the         most accurate data collected by the EPA because the         data consists of  actual  monitored, instead         of estimated, emissions. The emissions data is collected         through continuous emissions monitors (CEMS) and electronically         transferred directly into EPA's Emissions Tracking         System (ETS). Actual emissions of SO 2  and         NOx are measured for each unit/boiler within a utility         plant. The ETS allows EPA to track actual reductions         for each utility, as well as aggregate emissions by         all power plants. A principal output of the ETS is         the publication of quarterly and annual utility emission         reports based on emissions monitoring data. The ETS         quarterly and annual reports include summary statistics         for SO 2  and NOx emissions.         The Acid Rain program also tracks indicators which         validate the quality of the emissions data, such as         the accuracy of the monitors achieved during certification         testing. There are four validation measures that help         to demonstrate the high quality of the data collected:         the number of CEMS certified; the percentage of CEMS         that meet the 10% relative accuracy standard; the         percentage of CEMS that exceed the 7.5% relative accuracy         target; and, the number of quarterly reports processed.         Finally, the program also tracks trends in wet acidic         deposition data from the National Acid Deposition         Program (NADP) and dry acid deposition from the Clean         Air Status and Trends Network (CASTNet).

GX125-27-1267749	The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 is a federal law that sets limits            on how much pollution is allowed in the air anywhere in the United            States. The goal is to make sure that all Americans have clean, healthy            air to breathe. EPA can fine violators who break the law and put too            much pollution into the air.           Parts of the Clean Air Act Amendments, called “Titles,” established            permit programs to limit the amount of pollutants that sources such            as factories, industries, and vehicles can release. These permits            are issued by states or EPA and include information on which pollutants            are being released, how much may be released, and what steps are being            taken to reduce the pollution. Sources of pollution have to pay for            the permits, and the money from the fees helps support state air pollution            control activities.             In addition, the Clean Air Act Amendments established a specific            program to reduce the pollutants that cause acid rain—sulfur            dioxide and nitrogen oxides. This program—the Acid Rain Program—uses            allowances to control the amount of pollution that a source can produce.            Each source can decide if it wants to buy, sell, or save these allowances.            There are stiff penalties, however, for sources that release more            pollutants than their allowances cover. As of 2001, the Acid Rain            Program had reduced sulfur dioxide emissions by 33 percent and nitrogen            oxide emissions by 27 percent.
