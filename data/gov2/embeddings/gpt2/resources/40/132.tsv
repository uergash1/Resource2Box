The land and real estate boom was already beginning to fade, although many     subdivisions and new communities were still being built. The devastating Great    Miami Hurricane of September, 1926, had already sounded a loud alarm to the new     residents about the vulnerability of their new homes to tropical cyclones. However,    most of the damage from that storm was in Dade and Broward counties. Even so, a    bellwether of what was to come occurred with the Great Miami Hurricane of 1926 as     flood waters from Lake Okeechobee were swept by that storm into Moore Haven, the county     seat of Glades County, killing over 100 people.        The City of Palm Beach, founded only 34 years earlier by    Henry Flagler, was incorporated in 1911 and had become a playground for the    rich and famous, while West Palm Beach grew up on the opposite side of Lake    Worth as a place where the support staff lived. The Atlantic breezes were balmy    and the climate was warm. On the opposite side of the county, a quite different    situation was emerging. The rich, black muck soil near Lake Okeechobee was    already being utilized for its tremendous agricultural productivity. The newly    incorporated town of Belle Glade was growing steadily, fueled by the rapidly    expanding agriculture in fields nearby. A rural, agrarian society, dependent on     migrant labor, was plowing and harvesting along the shores of the lake behind a     hastily built muck levee.         Only two years after the Great Miami Hurricane, what would become the second category 4     ( Saffir-Simpson scale ) hurricane to strike South Florida in as many years formed off the    coast of Africa in early September. It churned across the Atlantic, and    devastated the island of Guadeloupe on September 12, moved through the Virgin    Islands, and struck a direct hit on Puerto Rico on the 13 th , El Día    de San Felipe. More than 300 persons were killed by this storm in Puerto Rico,    and it is known as the San Felipe II Hurricane because of the day on which it    struck. To some extent, the devastation in Puerto Rico provided some warning to    residents of Florida’s east coast. It moved through the Bahama Islands on    September 14-15, and on Sunday evening around 615 PM, September 16, the    hurricane made landfall in the United States in Palm Beach County between    Jupiter and Boca Raton.       Approximate location of the landfall   Of the Great Okeechobee/San Felipe   Hurricane of September, 1928.         Damage in coastal Palm Beach County was severe especially in    the Jupiter area where the eye wall of the hurricane persisted longer than at    any other location because of where the storm crossed the coast. A storm surge    around 10 feet with waves likely as high as 20 feet crashed into the barrier    islands including Palm Beach.

As the category 4     hurricane moved inland, the strong winds piled the water up at the south end of the lake,     ultimately topping the levee and rushing out onto the fertile land. Thousands of people,     mostly non-white migrant farm workers, drowned as water several feet deep spread over an     area approximately 6 miles deep and 75 miles long around the south end of the lake.      Approximate location of the eye of the 1928 hurricane   As it swept water out of Lake Okeechobee and over   the towns of Belle Glade, Chosen, Pahokee, South Bay,   and Bean City. More than 2,500 people drowned.              Click the movie logo above to run or ftp a QuickTime movie loop (mov file) of     computer simulated Lake Okeechobee water swept by the 1928 Okeechobee Hurricane     coming out and over the 4-5 foot levee (at the time).

Lake Okeechobee Region                    A book called  Okeechobee Hurricane  by Lawrence E. Will (who experienced the storm first hand) contains some of the best narrative of what living through the hurricane was like near Lake Okeechobee. The following description is from his book:        The period of the lull here had apparently been between 8:30 and 9:30 that night. The exact time of the breaking of the dike is difficult to determine. There were several breaks and they may have occurred at slightly different times. Although it took an appreciable time for the flood to arrive in Belle Glade, those in the hotel said that when it did arrive, it rose on the steps at the rate of an inch a minute. The highest crest, which was during the maximum velocity of the wind during the second phase of the storm, was, according to my recollection, at 10:20 PM. This crest was a rolling swell of short duration, after which the water fell about a foot and remained nearly constant for twenty minutes.  This mark in Belle Glade was about seven feet above the ground, nearer the lake it  was a great deal higher, for example, in Stein’s house at Chosen, 11 feet 3 inches,  and on Torry (Island) 11 feet, 8 inches, and similar heights in South Bay. As the  flood advanced, it necessarily fanned out, becoming shallower. At the (University of Florida) Experiment Station its maximum depth was three feet, and that, strangely enough, according to foreman Tedder, was after daylight.        Map of Lake Okeechobee (from Gross, 1995)   Showing approximate areas of the flood.        Of course, the effect of the flood was devastating, and the    loss of life, both human and animal, was apocalyptic. Damages    from this hurricane were estimated around 25 million dollars which, normalized    for population, wealth, and inflation, would be around 16 billion dollars today    (Landsea, 2002). The horrible flood in the towns of Pahokee, Canal Point, Chosen,     Belle Glade, and South Bay resulted in the drownings of many people,    probably three quarters or more of whom were non-white field workers. The flood    waters lasted for several weeks, and survivors were found wandering as late as September    22.        Memorial services, one white, one non-white, were held at the same time but at different    locations on Sunday, September 30, 1928, in West Palm Beach. The  Miami Herald  article     (1928) on the memorial services reported nearly 1,000 victims of the hurricane disaster,    674 of whom were non-white. Additional  Miami Daily News  articles stated a death toll of     2,200 (September 24, 1928) and 2,300 (September 25, 1928), along with the observation that     only the death toll in the Galveston hurricane of 1900 was higher. In Will’s book, which seems     to have the best detail on the 1928 hurricane of any source available, the estimated death     toll was at first set at 2,300 but later lowered to 1,770. Will quotes the final Red     Cross report in 1929 as stating that 1,810 people were killed and 1,849 were injured     in the 1928 hurricane. But Will also quoted a news release from the Florida State Board    of Health on December 7, 1928, which estimated the deaths in Palm Beach County    alone at 1,833. From Will’s book:        The exact number of those who perished in the Okeechobee storm can never be  ascertained. Probably three-fourths or more of the casualties were Negroes (sic),  many of whom had come from the Bahama Islands. Accounting for members of this race  was complicated by the migratory habits of their kind and the fact that most of them  were known, even to their friends, only by a nickname. Another reason the number cannot be ascertained was that many were carried by the flood far into the sawgrass wastes.           The NWS has long listed the Okeechobee Hurricane of 1928 death toll as 1,836, making it the    second worst hurricane death toll since 1900. No doubt use of this figure by the NWS dates     to Mitchell (1928), who quoted a Red Cross official casualty estimate dated October 28, 1928.     Dunn and Miller (1960) also quote the Red Cross figure. Pfost (2003) has called for a    revision of the death toll to 2,500 with an asterisk, denoting that the exact    number of people killed will never be known. A new death toll at 2,500 would    make the Okeechobee Hurricane of 1928 the second worst natural disaster in U.S.    history, surpassing the Johnstown Flood of 1889 which killed approximately    2,200.        The hurricane continued northwest across the lake and then turned north through     Highlands and Polk counties, passing near Gainesville and west of Jacksonville before     paralleling the Atlantic coasts of Georgia and the Carolinas. It finally moved inland over    Virginia and became extratropical over Pennsylvania and the Great Lakes.        There is still some tangible evidence of this historical tragedy. In West Palm Beach’s     Woodlawn Cemetery, a  stone marker  stands     today in memory of 69 victims of the storm. At the corner of Tamarind Avenue and 25 th     Street, a new  State of Florida    historical marker  stands in sentinel over the place where 674 victims of    the storm were buried after being transported from the Belle Glade area. At the    Port Mayaca cemetery in Martin County,  another    stone marker  was placed over a mass grave of about 1,600 victims. Near the Belle Glade     Public Library in downtown Belle Glade, a  beautiful    memorial  stands as a remembrance of the deadly storm and its devastation.         While today’s Hoover Dike with a grade elevation approaching 30 feet is reassuring,     it has not yet been tested with a direct hit by a category 4 or 5 hurricane. The only sure     thing is that South Florida will have future encounters with hurricanes, perhaps even a    category 4 or 5, in years to come. It is important that South Florida residents    know our hurricane history in order to better prepare for tomorrow’s hurricane    threats.    REEFERENCES    Dunn, Gordon E., and B. I.

He has been         observing for the National Weather Service for the past 26 years. His         observations include: high and low temperatures, precipitation (rain or         snow), and snow depth measurements. He sends daily observations to us         via a specially equipped phone.           Erdon was born three miles east and one mile south of         Turton, South Dakota. He and his wife Nina farmed there until 1975, when         they retired to Conde. It was lucky for the National Weather Service         that Roland Mannie, a cousin to Erdon, was the Meteorologist In Charge         for the state of South Dakota at the time. Since an observer was needed         in Conde, Roland suggested Erdon for the position. After being offered         the position, Erdon accepted and has taken and maintained weather         records with exceptional quality and accuracy ever since.           Even though Erdon is retired, he continues to be quite         active in the community. He was the mayor of Conde for over 20 years. He         loves the outdoors and is an active hunter and fisherman. During         pheasant season, Erdon welcomes several in state and out of state         hunters.

If you are         interested in helping us collect weather data, please contact Tim Kearns         at (605) 225-0519.               Back to the top       Back to the Aberdeen Homepage          Back to the Sky Scanner Page                                   EMERGENCY MANAGERS - A VITAL LINK                     By George Marshall                   Over the last several issues, we have       highlighted Cooperative Observers and Skywarn Spotters that contribute       greatly to the NWS mission. It is time to look at another group of people       who deal in weather and non-weather related emergencies. They are the       County Emergency Managers, who play a major role in helping us protect the       public.         Emergency Managers are a vital link between the NWS and       our Skywarn Storm Spotters. They arrange Spotter Training classes for       their county, getting the word out so people can attend. They coordinate       the spotters in the county, relaying reports back to the NWS office. This       cuts down on the number of phone calls we have to answer, but still       provides us the information we need to get the warnings out.         After the storms are over, the Emergency Manager is going       to be our main source of information for conducting damage surveys. Being       the experts on their county, they often take us around to view the damage       and arrange interviews with local residents.         Disaster Preparedness is not something that happens       overnight. Emergency Managers and the NWS are partners in protecting the       public. We work closely to prepare the public for dangerous weather       situations.         Of course, weather is only one of the problems Emergency       Managers have to be prepared for. They coordinate all emergency services,       and the county response to local disasters. Its a big job, and our job       would be much harder without their help. We want to thank all the       emergency managers for the part they play in helping us provide life       saving information to the public.               Back to the top       Back to the Aberdeen Homepage          Back to the Sky Scanner Page                                   FLASH FLOODING                     By George Marshall                    Flooding is the number one weather related killer. Each         year, overt 150 people are killed in floods, most of them due to flash         flooding. Flash Flooding occurs in all states, even South Dakota.                     How do flash floods occur?                     Several factors contribute to flash flooding. The two         key elements are rainfall intensity and duration. Intensity is the rate         of rainfall, and duration is how long the rain lasts. Topography, soil         conditions, and ground cover also play an important role.           Most flash flooding is caused by slow-moving         thunderstorms or thunderstorms repeatedly moving over the same area.         Flash floods occur within a few minutes or hours of heavy rainfall, a         dam or levee failure, or a sudden release of water held by an ice jam.         Flash floods can roll boulders, tear out trees, destroy buildings and         bridges, and scour out new channels. Furthermore, flash flood-producing         rains can also trigger catastrophic mud slides. You will not always have         a warning that these deadly, sudden floods are coming.                 How can a foot or two of water cost you your life?                 Water weighs 62.4 lbs. per cubic foot and       typically flows downstream at 6 to 12 miles an hour. When a vehicle stalls       in the water, the water's momentum is transferred to the car. For each       foot the water rises, 500 lbs. of lateral force are applied to the car.       But the biggest factor is buoyancy. For each foot the water rises up the       side of the car, the car displaces 1,500 lbs. of water. In effect, the car       weighs 1,500 lbs. less for each foot the water rises. One foot of water       will carry away most automobiles. Two feet of water will carry away       pickups and large SUVs.                 STAY INFORMED ABOUT THE STORM                 Listen to NOAA Weather Radio, commercial radio, and       television for the latest FLOOD / FLASH FLOOD WATCHES, WARNINGS, and       ADVISORIES.

I would       like to thank our Emergency Managers for their help in scheduling classes       and getting people to attend in their area. I would also like to thank all       the people who attended spotter training classes.         Here are some interesting statistics from spotter training       this year, for the 28 counties we serve. Office staff members traveled       4,934 miles (about 85 hours of driving time) to provide 33 spotter       training classes (about 66 hours) in 26 different counties. We trained 466       spotters , an average of 18 people per county and 14 per class, and about       1/3 of them were new spotters. Codington County had the largest turnout       with 63 people trained in two classes.             Back to the top       Back to the Aberdeen Homepage          Back to the Sky Scanner Page                               Lightning Safety Awareness         Week                     By George Marshall           The week of June 18th to the 22nd was declared LIGHTNING         SAFETY AWARENESS WEEK by the National Weather Service.                     LIGHTNING AND LIGHTNING SAFETY                     In the United States, there are an estimated 25 million         cloud-to-ground lightning flashes each year. While lightning can be         fascinating to watch, it is also extremely dangerous. Each one of those         25 million flashes is a potential killer. During the past 30 years,         lightning has killed an average of 73 people per year in the United         States based on documented cases. This is more than the average of 68         deaths per year caused by tornadoes and more than the average of 16         deaths per year caused by hurricanes. However, because lightning usually         claims only one or two victims at a time, and because lightning does not         cause the mass destruction left in the wake of tornadoes or hurricanes,         lightning generally receives much less attention than the more         destructive storm-related killers. Documented lightning injuries in the         United States average about 300 per year; however, undocumented injuries         caused by lightning are likely much higher.           Education and awareness are keys to reducing the number         of people struck by lightning. The greatest number of lightning deaths         and injuries in the United States occurs during the summer months when         the combination of lightning and outdoor summertime activities reaches a         peak. During the summer, people take advantage of the warm weather to         enjoy a multitude of outdoor recreational activities. Unfortunately,         those outdoor recreational activities put them at greater risk of being         struck by lightning.           While virtually all people take some protective actions         during the most dangerous part of thunderstorms, many leave themselves         vulnerable to being struck by lightning as thunderstorms approach,         depart, or are nearby. Lightning can strike as much as 10 miles or more         away from the rain area of a thunderstorm; that's about the distance         that you can hear the thunder from the storm. In some instances when a         storm is ten miles away, it may even be difficult to tell that a storm         is nearby. However , IF YOU HEAR THUNDER, CHANCES ARE THAT YOU ARE         WITHIN STRIKING DISTANCE OF THAT STORM.                     Finally, in the unfortunate event that a person is         struck by lightning, medical care may be needed immediately to save that         person's life. Cardiac arrest and irregularities, burns, and nerve         damage are common in cases where people are struck by lightning.         However, with proper treatment, including CPR if necessary, most victims         survive a lightning strike, although the long-term effects on their         lives and the lives of family members can be devastating.           What are the chances that a person will be struck by         lightning during his or her lifetime? Answer: Based on documented cases         of lightning deaths and injuries, the nationwide odds of being killed or         injured by lightning are about 1 in 700,000 for each year of your life.         Assuming a life span of 80 years, that's lifetime odds of more than 1 in         9000. These odds are based on documented cases only and would likely be         much higher if all lightning strike cases were documented. Keep in mind,         though, that your behavior around thunderstorms will determine your         individual odds.

As for the James River, flooding       usually occurs as a rite of passage from winter to spring, with spring or       summer flooding occurring annually over the last decade. Flooding along       the James River inundates many acres of farm land each year. Since 1996,       areas of Central and Northeast South Dakota have been hit hard by       flooding. Since flooding is an annual event along the James River, we will       not include the James River in this article. We are not downplaying the       seriousness of flooding along the James River which affects many farmers       and closes area roads, but there is too much information to include in       this article. The following below was taken from the Local Storm Report       and was condensed for this article.                 May 27-30, 1996 -  Four to six inches of rain fell over       the Bad River Basin. The runoff caused the Bad River at Fort Pierre to       crest at 26.25 feet, or about 5 feet above flood stage. The Bad River road       from US Highway 83 near Fort Pierre to US Highway 14 near Midland was       closed.                 February 20-22, 1997  - Warm weather resulted in snow       melt runoff and ice break up on the Bad River. The river crested near 25.0       feet on the 21 st . The trailer court on the southern edge of       Fort Pierre was evacuated.                 March-April, 1997  - Record or near record snow pack       from the winter of 1996/97 led to widespread flooding of homes, basements,       county/township roads, and many acres of farmland across the region. In       Big Stone and Traverse Counties, some bridges were damaged or washed out       due to high water flows or ice chunks. The Little Minnesota River flooded       several homes in west Browns Valley. In Dewey County, the Moreau River set       a record crest of 27.4 feet on March 21 st  at the river gage       site two miles southeast of Whitehorse. The Bad River in Stanley County       crested at 22.1 feet at Fort Pierre on March 22 nd . Meanwhile,       the Grand River one mile south of Little Eagle in Corson County crested at       17.3 feet on March 24. A second crest of 16.2 feet was recorded on March       29 th . Residents of Wakpala in eastern Corson County watched the       Oak Creek rise five feet in 12 hours. In Brown County, the Elm River at       Westport rose to 21.5 feet on March 30 th  with most of the town       flooded. Nearly everyone was evacuated as nearly every home received major       flood damage. This was the worst flooding in Westport since 1969.       Backwater from flooding caused the Mocassin Creek to flood a portion of       the Prairewood housing subdivision north of Aberdeen. Over in Spink       County, Turtle Creek set a record crest of 18.1 feet on March 30 th .       In Codington County, record flooding was reported on the Big Sioux River       while Lake Kampeska flooding homes in Watertown. This was declared       Watertowns greatest disaster to date.                 May 1-2, 1997  - Heavy rains of one to three inches       with isolated amounts up to 4.5 inches just north of Vivian in Lyman       County flooded area creeks, streams, and roads. Flooding occurred at the       KOA campground near Kennebec.                 July 11, 1997 -  Between three to four inches of rain       fell over northeastern Dewey, northwestern Walworth, and southeastern       Corson Counties. Water covered portions of Highway 12 near Mobridge and       Highway 15 north of Mobridge.                 July 24-25, 1997  -   Six inches of rain fell in       Conde in Spink County which flooded Highway 37. In Hamlin County,       Estelline reported nearly six inches of rain while a Lake Poinset observer       recorded nearly seven inches of rain. Hidewood Creek overflowed its banks       while Highway 28 was closed for about an hour.                 May 11, 1998  - Rainfall amounts of two to five inches       fell across Brown, Marshall, Day, Spink, Clark, and Hand Counties as a       cluster of strong thunderstorms moved through the area. The heavy rains       only worsened the flooding on Blue Dog, Waubay, Rush, and Bitter Lakes,       which were already at record levels after many years of above normal       precipitation.                 June 10, 1998  - Two to three inches of rain that fell       in a short period of time, causing flash flooding on the Crow Creek       southwest through south of Gann Valley (Buffalo County). Some dams and       roads were washed out.                 June 17-18, 1998  - Heavy rains of three to four inches       fell across parts of eastern Faulk county near Faulkton, Miranda, Orient,       and Cresbard. Several roads were flooded and closed for a period of time.                 June 26-27, 1998  - Brown, Marshall, and Day Counties       received the brunt of the heavy rainfall. Kidder reported nearly seven       inches of rain, flooding the whole town, while just northwest of Britton       an observer reported over five inches of rain during this period. At this       time, it was estimated that about 22 percent of the total farm and       pastureland acres in these three counties were flooded or too wet to farm.                 July 10, 1998  - Up to seven inches of rain caused       flash flooding from Keldron to ten miles south of Keldron in Corson County       . Willow Creek and several tributaries went out of their banks, resulting       in flooding of county roads and the loss of livestock.                 July 25, 1998  - Five to seven inches of rain fell in       western Jones County, mainly northwest of Okaton. Three miles northwest of       Okaton, a road and bridge were washed out.                 August 26-27, 1998 -  Strong to severe thunderstorms       pounded Campbell, Walworth, and eastern Corson Counties. Rainfall amounts       of 6.35 inches near Glenham, and 5.75 inches just north of Mobridge       created flash flooding in the area. The heavy rain was associated with       damaging winds and large hail that damaged buildings and crops.                 May 9-10, 1999  - Heavy rains of two to five inches       caused flash flooding on Medicine Creek in Lyman County. Portions of the       KOA campground near Kennebec was flooded.                 September 3, 1999  - Nearly stationary thunderstorms       resulted in extensive flash flooding in a 30 to 40 mile wide band from       Fort Pierre in southeast Stanley County northeastward to Hecla in       northeast Brown County. Blunt (Hughes Co.) and Onida (Sully) were the       hardest hit with most of the homes and businesses being flooded in both       communities.                 Spring 2001   See article on page 6 for details on       flooding that hit Central and Northeast South Dakota.         As you can see, flooding or flash flooding occurs       infrequently over the region. However, when flooding does occur, the       consequences to life and property are great.               Back to the top       Back to the Aberdeen Homepage          Back to the Sky Scanner Page                                   FACTS ABOUT FLOODS / FLASH         FLOODS                     By David Hintz           Many people are unaware that Floods and Flash Floods         are the leading weather killer in the United States, taking about 200         lives per year. Since 1900, more than 10,000 lives have been lost due to         floods and flash floods. In fact, one of the countrys worst flooding         disasters took place in South Dakota on June 9,   1972. Five         inches of rain fell in just five hours in the Black Hills above Rapid         City. The resulting flash flood took 238 lives with property damage of         164 million. Out of every 10 Presidential Disaster Declarations, 9 are a         result from natural phenomena in which flooding plays a role.           So why is flooding and flash flooding such a major         weather killer? Nearly 80% of all flood related deaths occur in         automobiles, and most of those are the result of a single, fatal         decision to drive into flood waters. You may ask, ""How can 1 to 2         feet of water be so deadly?"" One cubic foot of water weighs 62.4         pounds, and typically flows downstream at 6 to 12 mph. Also, one foot of         water produces a lateral force of 500 pounds. But, its not the lateral         force that creates the problem, but the buoyancy of the automobile. One         foot of water will displace 1500 pounds. In essence, if you drive         through 2 feet of moving water, your vehicle will feel a force of 1000         pounds pushing it downstream, and will weigh 3000 pounds less. Not many         vehicles will stay on the road with forces like that. Also consider         this, one-third of all flooded roads and bridges are so damaged by the         water that any vehicle trying to cross stands only a 50% chance of         making it to the other side.           If you happen to come across a flooded road or         bridge, do the wise thing and turn around and find another route. Its         the safe thing to do.

A dam         break created a 36 to 40 foot wall of water that swept through parts of         the town. 2,200 people perished in this flood.           Up to 17 inches of rain over South Central Texas         caused widespread river flooding on the Guadalupe, Brazos, Trinity, and         Colorado River Basins during December 1991 and January 1992. The         flooding left 15 people dead and caused 100 million dollars in damage.           In Shadyside, Ohio, four inches of rain in less than         two hours produced a 30 foot wall of water through parts of town. The         flood killed 26 people and property damage was estimated between six and         eight million dollars.           In Cheyenne, Wyoming, six inches of rain in three hours left 12 dead         and caused 61 million dollars in property damage.

Normally, the first         product issued by the National Weather Service in mid and late February         is the  Spring Snowmelt Flood Outlook . This product is of interest         to everyone, especially emergency managers, farmers, and people living         near rivers and streams. With above normal snowfall winters, such as         this past one, this product becomes very important in flood planning and         preparations.           The  Spring Snowmelt Flood Outlook  accounts for         many factors to produce the flood potential outlook. The most important         factor in this outlook is the winter snow-pack and amount of water         contained within it. The outlook also factors in the current river         flows, soil moisture, and the climatological outlook of precipitation         and temperature. It is very important to note that future temperatures         and precipitation can have a significant impact on the flood potential.         Therefore, the Spring Snowmelt Flood Outlook only serves as an initial         guideline for flood planning and preparation purposes. As was stated         earlier, the winter snow-pack has the most overwhelming influence on the         spring flood potential. The Spring Snowmelt Flood Outlook provides         information for each of the major rivers in the Aberdeen County Warning         Area. The flood potential in the outlook is depicted using the following         terminology: major, moderate, minor, or no flooding expected.           If flooding is expected or does occur as a result of         snowmelt and/or above normal precipitation,  Flood Warnings  are         issued for the river or rivers expected to flood. Flood Warnings are         issued when the water level is expected to rise above a certain height         and remain above this height for more than 6 hours up to weeks, and for         the James River, months.  Flood Statements  are issued after the         initial Flood Warning to provide follow up information and river stage         forecasts. Ice jamming is a common problem on the rivers in the spring         and can cause significant fluctuations in river stages.           After the snow melts and the late spring and summer         heats up, the thunderstorm and heavy rain potential increases. If there         is a possibility of significant rainfall, the National Weather Service         may issue a  Flash Flood Watch or a Flood Watch  to alert you on         the expected rainfall amounts and possible flooding or flash flooding.         Flash flooding occurs over a shorter period of time, typically less than         6 hours, and is more dangerous. Flash flooding is dangerous because         creeks and streams are expected to rise quickly and move swiftly. Moving         water, especially deep moving water, can easily float and move a vehicle         off the road. Thus, you should never cross a flooded road and be         especially alert at night for flooding. If the flooding is expected to         be more of an inconvenience then we may issue an  Urban and Small         Stream Flood Advisory.           The National Weather Service issues several products         from late winter into the fall to keep you informed on the potential         and/or expected flooding in your area. These products can help you plan         and prepare, but your actions become the most important in minimizing         property damage along with determining your safety.                   Back to the top       Back to the Aberdeen Homepage          Back to the Sky Scanner Page                                   4TH OF JULY WEATHER                     By Seth Binau                    Now that Spring has come and gone, our thoughts turn to         the warm Summer months. Summer seems to be defined by its holidays, with         the Fourth of July kicking off the peak of the warm months, and Labor         Day finishing it off. Everyone likes to spend the Fourth of July         outdoors, either at a picnic or watching evening fireworks. With such a         large portion of the population outdoors, the weather certainly will         have a tremendous affect on how you plan your Fourth. Looking back over         past Independence Days, you can expect just about everything in South         Dakota on July 4 th , except snow.           For example, you may remember Independence Day in         1967...when strong Canadian high pressure dropped temperatures into the         lower 40s in South Dakota. Aberdeen and Watertown shivered at 40         degrees, while Sisseton dropped to 44, and Pierre watched their         fireworks at 43 degrees. Instead of shorts and tank tops, a heavy jacket         would have been needed in 1967.           There is the contrary to 1967, though, and that would be         the two big drought years in the Northern Plains. 1936 and 1988 brought         record heat all Summer long in South Dakota, and Independence Day was no         exception. In 1936, Pierre sweltered at 107 degrees, and Mobridge at         103. In eastern South Dakota, 1988 was a record Fourth of July for         Aberdeen (105 degrees), Sisseton (101), and Watertown (102).           While heat and cold can be a nuisance on a big outdoors         day such as the Fourth, nothing can ruin it like a typical South Dakota         thunderstorm. Unfortunately, Watertown knows all about this, as 2.69         inches of rain fell on Independence Day in 1963. Aberdeens biggest         rainfall on the Fourth occurred in 1969, when a thunderstorm dropped         1.02 inches of rain. Mobridge is the lucky one on the Fourth, with a         record rainfall of only 0.80 inch in 1932. Both Pierre and Watertown         have seen record rainfalls close to an inch as well on Independence Day.           So, on this Fourth of July, you will be fully prepared         if you wear clothes for temperatures in the 80's, some that can be         removed if it hits the 100's, and an extra jacket in case it drops into         the 40's at night, and bring the trusty umbrella as well!               Back to the top       Back to the Aberdeen Homepage          Back to the Sky Scanner Page                                   SPRING FLOODING ACROSS THE         ABERDEEN HYDROLOGICAL SERVICE AREA                     By Glenn Nielsen           Flooding began early in South Dakota this spring. On         the 14 th  of March, the Bad River in Central South Dakota         began flooding due to ice jams causing minor flooding of a trailer park         in Ft. Pierre. Also on the 14 th , flood warnings were issued         for the Grand and Moreau Rivers in North Central South Dakota, but         little if any damage was reported. On March 28 th , the James         River in Columbia went above flood stage with minor agricultural         flooding. The rest of the James River basin from Columbia south to         Redfield experienced minor to moderate flooding for much of April into         early May. Generally, agricultural land was affected as well as some         township roads. By early May, streams around the Redfield area had all         fallen below flood stage. From Ashton north to Columbia the James River         is expected to remain above flood stage until at least mid July. Further         east, major flooding occurred on the Big Sioux River from Watertown to         Castlewood during April. Spring snowmelt as well as heavy rain caused         the Big Sioux River to go above flood stage from April 7-19 at Watertown         and Castlewood and again in Castlewood from the 23 rd  to the         25 th . Watertown received 6.48 inches of precipitation in         April or 4.3 inches above normal. Especially hard hit along the Big         Sioux was the Lake Kampeska area Northwest of Watertown. A record stage         was recorded on the river gage 8 miles northwest of Watertown with a         reading of 12.2 feet. The previous record was 12.1 feet on April 6,         1997.

We were in         search of volunteers that had an anemometer which displays wind speeds         and direction, and have the capability of storing peak wind speeds.           Last year we honored eight members for being with the         program for five years. We will honor six more members this year. The         members are: Morris Riggin of Milbank Airport in Grant County, Leland         Treichel of Edmunds County, Jane Barber of Bretts Spray Service in         Sully County, Clarence Juelich of Wheaton Airport in Traverse County         Minnesota, Tom Bartholomew of Faulk County, and David Stolpman of Big         Stone County Minnesota. They have received a Certificate of Appreciation         for five years of service. Our hats are tipped to these volunteers and         we are very thankful for all the help.           The National Weather Service in Aberdeen is always         looking for new member to join the program. If you are interested in         joining the Wind Reporting Network System, all you need is an         anemometer! They can be purchased from a variety of private companies,         ranging in price from around $180 to near $800.

Total precipitation for March amounted to 0.10 to 0.45 inches above         normal. Average temperatures were near normal across central South         Dakota, but across northeast sections of the state and into West Central         Minnesota readings were around 5 to 10 degrees below normal. April was         very wet with near normal temperatures. A late April snowstorm dumped         6-13 inches of wet snow from Central through Northeast South Dakota,         except along the South Dakota and Minnesota border only receiving rain.         Total precipitation for Watertown in April totaled 6.48 inches.

Those in the affected area are urged to be                    ready to take action if a flash flood warning is issued or flooding                    is observed. These watches are issued for flooding that is expected                    to occur within 6 hours after the heavy rains have ended.                                          Flash Flood Warning                     - A flood warning issued for life/property threatening flooding                    that will occur within 6 hours. It could be issued for rural                    or urban areas as well as for areas along the major rivers.                    Very heavy rain in a short period of time can lead to flash                    flooding, depending on local terrain, ground cover, degree of                    urbanization, amount of man-made changes to the natural river                    banks, and initial ground or river conditions. Dam breaks or                    ice jams can also create flash flooding.                                          Flash Flood Statement                     - A Flash Flood Statement is issued to inform the public about                    current flash flood conditions. These statements usually contain                    river stage information if major streams or rivers are involved.                                                             Urban/Small Stream Flood Advisory                     - Alerts the public to flooding which is generally only an inconvenience                    (not life-threatening) to those living in the affected area.                    Issued when heavy rain will cause flooding of streets and low-lying                    places in urban areas. Also used if small rural or urban streams                    are expected to reach or exceed bankfull. Some damage to homes                    or roads could occur.

They                    are caused by stationary or slow-moving thunderstorms that produce                    heavy rain over a small area. The Black Hills are especially                    vulnerable to flash floods, where steep terrain and narrow canyons                    can funnel heavy rain into small creeks and dry ravines, turning                    them into raging walls of water. Even on the prairie, normally-dry                    draws and low spots can fill with rushing water during very                    heavy rain.                                                       •                      Flash                    Flood -  Flash                    floods can strike any time and any place with little or no warning.                    In mountainous or flat terrain, distant rain may be channeled                    into gullies and ravines, turning a quiet streamside campsite                    or wash into a rampaging torrent in minutes .                                                                        •                     Flooding                                         - Of all the tricks in mother nature's weather bag, the deadliest                    in the United States today is flooding and flash flooding. Over                    the past 30 years, flood waters have claimed an annual toll                    of nearly 140 lives in this country.                                                                            •                      Natural                     Hazards   -  With Safety Rules                    For Tornadoes, Hurricanes, Floods, Flash Floods, Thunderstorms/Lightning,                    Winter Storms WATCH: Severe weather is possible within the designated                    watch area.                                                      •                      National Weather Service                    Low-Water Crossing Flood Safety Video                     -  The NWS, as a public service, provides                    a video (at nominal cost) to disseminate motorist safety information.

These watches are issued for flooding that is expected                    to occur within 6 hours after the heavy rains have ended.                                          Flash Flood Warning                     - A flood warning issued for life/property threatening flooding                    that will occur within 6 hours.

Flash              floods are the #1 weather-related killer in the United States--2,200              deaths in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, May 31, 1889; 238 fatalities in              Rapid City, South Dakota, June 9, 1972; 140 killed in the Big Thompson              Canyon near Denver July 31, 1976; 26 dead in Shadyside, Ohio, June              14, 1990!

They                    are caused by stationary or slow-moving thunderstorms that produce                    heavy rain over a small area. The Black Hills are especially                    vulnerable to flash floods, where steep terrain and narrow canyons                    can funnel heavy rain into small creeks and dry ravines, turning                    them into raging walls of water. Even on the prairie, normally-dry                    draws and low spots can fill with rushing water during very                    heavy rain.                                                       •                      Flash                    Flood -  Flash                    floods can strike any time and any place with little or no warning.

Now, it's back.                Discovered only 3 months ago, Comet ""Neat""               (designation C/2002 VI) is now visible in the evening sky. Named               for the NASA/U.S. Air Force program that discovered it ( N ear               E arth  A steroid  T racking system), the comet               is approaching its closest point to the Sun in its highly               elliptical orbit. Currently at a magnitude of +5.4, it isn't visible to the               naked eye in most locations, but should be easily found using               binoculars. Take this rare opportunity to view this comet, as               calculations of its orbit indicate that it  returns only once               every 37,000 years .                                                                   In the early evening sky, about an hour or so               after sunset, look to the western sky just below the Great Square of Pegasus. At               about 20 above the horizon, Comet Neat can be observed in               binoculars or a small telescopes as a circular patch of light with               an almost star-like center. The comet should become increasingly               brighter until around mid month, when it will become lost               from sight as it passes around the Sun.                                                                 Neat should make its closest approach to the Sun on February               18th, at a distance of only 9.2 million miles (the nearest               approach to the Sun by Mercury, the innermost planet, is 28.6               million miles). To endure such heat and gravity, the comet must be rather large, as               smaller bodies would be destroyed by such proximity to our star.               Should it survive, it will become visible again after the 18th               and many astronomers are predicting that it will be somewhat               brighter at that time.                                                                                     Position of Comet ""Neat"" in February                                                                  The moon will become increasingly brighter into mid February, and               will be in the western section of the sky after sunset. This may               hamper your viewing of the comet somewhat, but it will be your               only opportunity to ever see this very infrequent visitor.                                                                     February 2003 Moon Phases                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             1                        9                        16                        24                                                                                                                                                     Local Climate, Water & Weather Topics:                                                       Current Hazards ,                                                      Current Conditions ,                                                      Radar ,                                                      Satellite ,                                                      Climate ,                                                      Weather Safety ,                                                      Contact Us                                                                                                                                                                          National Weather                           Service                           Grand Junction Weather Forecast Office                           792 Eagle Drive                           Grand Junction, CO. 81506                            Webmasters:                                                       Jeff Colton                            &                                                       Brian Avery                            Page last modified: July 22,                           2002                                                                              Disclaimer                                                                              Privacy Act"

Introduction . This chapter provides the policy and guidelines for operating and managing the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Weather Radio (NWR) program. This policy has been revised due to the deployment of the NWR Console Replacement System (CRS), henceforth referred to as the NWR system (except in document titles), and its greatly enhanced broadcasting capabilities. A specific description and details on the operation and use of the NWR system and optimization of the automated voice can be found in the ""CRS Site User's Manual,"" the ""CRS Jump Start Kit: The Introductory Guidebook,"" and in the ""DECtalk Software NWS/NOAA Style Guide."" See section 8 for administrative guidelines on NWR quality control. Regional and local instructions provide additional information and detail for day-to-day operations.              1.1  Fundamental Concepts . The NWR system provides automated, real-time, text-to-voice operations, using formatted text input from the Advanced Weather Interactive Processing System (AWIPS) or other approved sources (legacy systems). The NWR system also supports manual broadcast recording and scheduling operations for products not supported by text formatters, also referred to as ""manual operations,"" and for operations for critical events including backup.             NWR is the official voice of the National Weather Service (NWS) . To many listeners, the NWR  is  the NWS. It is therefore critically important that NWR broadcasts adhere to the highest standards of timeliness, completeness, accuracy, and clarity. The use of the automated voice of NWR will improve timeliness of NWR. Any text should have full sentences, correct spelling, and effective punctuation to achieve clear communication.             The new and enhanced scheduling capabilities were created to allow fresh, innovative approaches to NWR programming. Weather Forecast Offices (WFO) are encouraged to broadcast a short core base of sequenced messages (as defined in section 5.2), with more detailed information broadcast on a ""time insert"" basis. One example of this time-based information includes broadcasts of specific customer-focused messages at a prescribed time during the hour, day, week, month, or year.             1.2  Use of NWR Automated Voice . A goal of the NWS is to use automated voicing technology for broadcast of all messages. During the early transition to the automated voicing capability, WFOs may employ manual operations for the broadcast of critical warning information (weather- and non-weather-related, see section 6). For these situations, WFOs should follow reporting procedures as outlined in section 3.3.     1.3  Official Voice of the Government for Providing Warning Information to the Public . In January 1975, the Office of Telecommunications Policy, Executive Office of the President (now the Department of Commerce [DOC]), issued a national policy statement establishing NWR as ""the only federally sponsored radio transmission of warning information to receivers optionally available to the general public."" It also designated NWR as a supplementary attack warning system. The full text of the policy statement is shown in appendix A. Note that since January 13, 1975, the Defense Civil Preparedness Agency and the Office of Preparedness have been reorganized and renamed under the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).         1.4  NWR ""All Hazards"" Approach . NWR broadcasts will continue expanding to include warning and post-event information for all types of hazards--both natural (e.g., weather, floods, earthquakes, and volcanic activity) and technological (e.g., chemical releases, oil spills, or nuclear incidents). In conjunction with other Federal agencies and the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) Emergency Alert System (EAS) (see section 10), NWR can reach the vast majority of the population with this ""all hazards"" information through the Nation's electronic media.     2.  Description . NWR is a broadcast service of the NWS for the public. It provides continuous automated or recorded voice FM-radio broadcasts of current official weather information (warnings, watches, forecasts, observations, etc.). The broadcast system consists of:             a. A description of the NWR system, components, and capabilities. This description can be found in the material listed in section 1.     b. A communication link (dedicated telephone line, ultra high frequency radio, or microwave radio) between the transmitter audio output of the audio switching assembly and the broadcast transmitter. Each transmitter has its own dedicated communication link.             c. A narrow-band very high frequency (VHF) transmitter operating on one of the following Government-assigned frequencies: 162.400, 162.425, 162.450, 162.475, 162.500, 162.525, and 162.550 Megahertz (MHZ).             d. Remote Off-Air Monitoring System (ROAMS) (see section 8.1 for details), emergency power systems, telephone and other utilities, and services required for continuous operation.      e. A 1050 Hertz (Hz) tone and/or NWR Specific Area Message Encoder (NWR-SAME) transmission that either sounds an alarm or switches specially equipped NWR receivers from standby to full-on mode for weather or non-weather-related emergencies (see section 6). This can be done through the NWR system automation or in manual mode when using the backup live function. See ""CRS Site User's Manual"" or other local instructions for operation of NWR-SAME.             3.  Organizational Responsibilities .             3.1  Weather Service Headquarters (WSH) . The NWS Director has the overall national broadcast policy responsibility for the NWR program. The Office of Meteorology (OM) facilitates the establishment and uniform application of the national broadcast policy in coordination with the Office of Hydrology (OH), the Office of Systems Operations (OSO), the NOAA/NWS Office of Public Affairs, and the Regional Headquarters (RH). The OH provides input on hydrological-related broadcast messages. The OSO provides engineering, communications, maintenance, and program management support. The NOAA/NWS Public Affairs is responsible for coordinating a national program for NWR public education and promotion. See section 12 for additional details. See section 3.2 on RH responsibilities.              3.2  Regional Headquarters . Each RH is responsible for the management of the program within its area and should have a designated focal point for the NWR program. In addition, each RH shall have responsibility for the oversight of an NWR Operator Proficiency Program (see section 8 and appendix B) and review and evaluation of NWR broadcasts. The Regional Director shall coordinate, define, and document in regional instructions the basic service areas for all NWR stations in the region. The RH shall send to OM a quarterly report on usage of the automated voicing for critical warning messages by their WFOs, along with any reasons for non-usage.              3.3  Weather Forecast Offices (WFO) . WFO management is responsible for adopting these guidelines and regional directives consistent with local service requirements and staffing. Each WFO should have an NWR program leader (see section 8.2 for details). All operational employees shall be proficient at disseminating warnings, watches, and advisories via NWR operational and any backup broadcast systems in accordance with the NWR Operator Proficiency Program (see appendix B).             3.3.1  Record Keeping . The NWR system will automatically maintain a log to assist in determining the currency of all broadcast material and the operational status of the equipment. In the event of the NWR system failure, the WFO should maintain a manual log, status board, or other equivalent mechanism for this purpose.         4.  Broadcast Programming Goal .             4.1  Broadcast Service Area . The broadcast shall concentrate on providing vital and relevant weather and hydrologic information to the people within the service area of the transmitter. The service area shall be the region for which the warning alarm is authorized for use. As mentioned in section 3.2, the RH shall establish and document the official service area of each NWR station. Any changes must be approved by the RH.             The service area for each transmitter site is normally defined by counties or parts of counties or other defined areas and adjacent coastal or offshore waters where there is a  reliable  free space signal. Under ideal conditions, this would be a uniform ground-level signal of 8 microvolts within a 40-mile radius of the transmitter. The signal level will vary as a result of terrain, urban density, obstructions, and antenna mounting arrangements.             Because a service area depends on signal reception, it may extend beyond the programming office's warning and forecast area of responsibility.  For areas with overlapping coverage by multiple transmitters, routine programming for the overlapped area may be broadcast solely on the transmitter providing the best coverage . Periodic announcements over NWR should mention or define the service area. Distribution of maps showing the service area is encouraged as part of any NWR publicity.             No attempt should be made to extend an NWR service area to accommodate listeners employing sophisticated high gain receiving equipment.             4.2  Broadcast Quality . The following broadcast practices are recommended to improve program quality and usability.             4.2.1  Style of Presentation . The broadcasts should be in complete sentences for both the lead-in and main text. It is useful to use the word ""you"" as appropriate when referring to listeners. This projects interest and concern.             Summarizing : In general, it is useful to summarize tabular data, except in cases where precise listings are necessary or preferred by listeners.             Wording : All messages should use the past or future tense.             Time on Messages : Broadcasts should include time on messages that contain highly perishable material. These would include observations, radar or other position reports, and river stages.             Issue times should not be used for forecasts, watches, warnings, and related statements. The only times that are important in these cases are those for occurrences and expiration of an event.             5.  Broadcast Message Priority . NWR programming consists of four major elements in order of the following broadcast priority:             a. Messages for critical events for the service area. These normally include warnings, short-fuse watches, and other non-weather-related hazard information. See section 6 for specific details.             b. Basic core messages (always included unless     de-emphasized or pre-empted by messages for critical events). These normally include the station I.D., the hourly roundup, the service area forecast and the synopsis, and optionally a regional forecast. The basic core messages may vary according to local customer needs. See appendix C for program guidelines.             c. Special customer messages (desirable). These normally include marine forecasts, lake and river stage reports, recreation/resort forecasts, climatic data, fire weather forecasts, air quality information, weather-related road information, Ultraviolet Index (UVI) forecasts, and non-weather-related announcements. See appendix C for program guidelines.             d. Educational and promotional messages (desirable, but optional). These normally include safety messages and announcements of awareness activities. See section 5.3 for further details.             Although there is special customer programming for groups with similar interests,  NWR broadcasts should not be tailored to the needs of any individual person or individual business entity .     5.1  Guidelines . The NWR system programming is not solely based on the logic of sequencing through products. Offices are encouraged to find innovative uses of programming functionality to best meet the preferences of the listeners. The dynamic use of time-insertion for certain products and frequent cycling of others is a good basic approach. When manually recording products, use a professional, but conversational, news style delivery.             AWIPS will provide text formatters to produce NWR messages with conversational style. Basic format requirements should be followed in manual mode as well.             Concerning operations for critical events, emphasis must be placed on watch/warning repetition, updates, and call to action statements with low (or even no) priority placed on the routine core and special customer broadcasts. See appendix D, the ""CRS Site User's Manual,"" and the ""CRS Jump Start Kit: The Introductory Guidebook"" for basic terms, approaches, and definitions related to the NWR system broadcast scheduling. See sections 5.2 and 6 for detailed guidelines on broadcasting operations for critical events.             5.2  Content . Messages should concentrate on what has recently happened and what is forecast to happen. Messages should not be aired longer than 6 hours after issuance. Stations with designated service areas that cross state lines shall provide balanced information and not favor one state over the other.             State or area weather summaries providing past weather information not related to future conditions either should not      be broadcast or broadcast only for a limited time interval up to a few hours. Messages of national coverage should not be broadcast except to highlight an event of long-term interest, such as a hurricane threatening the United States or a major winter storm.     5.3  Non-Weather-Related Announcements . Only announcements (from NWS or from non-NWS sources) fitting one of the following criteria should be permitted.             o Activities that will assist the NWS to fulfill its primary mission, such as NWR surveys, major public preparedness activities, open houses, dedications, safety information, and educational and promotional information about NWS products and services.             -- Some of these announcements are appropriate for random or occasional broadcast. These messages should be shorter than 60 seconds, preferably between 15 and 20 seconds. No more than two such messages should be used at any one time. Prerecorded messages may be used.             o Civil emergency and other non-weather-related messages authorized in section 6.5.             o Other messages requested through official channels by the DOC/NOAA, such as outlined in the National Marine Fisheries Service Memorandum of Agreement, that are construed to be time critical and related to the NOAA mission.             If doubt exists whether a message meets one of the criteria, it should be coordinated with the RH through the WFO. If further doubt exists within the RH, it shall be coordinated with OM.             Non-NWS sources of information should be identified.             5.4  Unauthorized Material . Care must be taken to ensure that no unauthorized or improper material (or improper language) is broadcast, either directly or indirectly (through background noise when in manual broadcast mode). If the NWR system is in the operational area, it is important to remember to limit or restrict background noise when recording manually.              Specific material that is restricted from NWR broadcasts include:             o aviation weather in any form (i.e., ceilings, altimeter, terminal forecasts, etc.);     o music in any form or style, except as authorized by RH;     o encoded data, except NWR-SAME;     o excessive technical terms;     o foreign languages (except when authorized by RH);     o bulletin board types of announcements, such as meetings and activities for civic clubs, hobby clubs, lodges, professional and fraternal organizations, unions, business clubs, charities, fund raising, etc.; and     o profanity and loud background noise.             6.  Operations for Critical Events . For the designated service area, it is critical to broadcast as soon as possible  all  watches, warnings and related statements for:             o severe weather, floods, flash floods, and tsunamis;     o urgent marine information; and      o any non-weather civil emergency messages (as per agreements with state and local authorities) affecting the designated service area.              These products should seldom be modified for broadcast over NWR other than to:             o form complete sentences (if necessary);     o include appropriate punctuation; and     o eliminate:     -- naming of counties/areas outside the service area;     -- material that is relevant only to areas outside the service area; and     -- generic calls to action if calls to action are included elsewhere in the broadcast program.             6.1  Backup Live Mode . NWR transmitters are designed to shut down if there is no continuous audio feed within a predetermined amount of time, typically 10 to 20 seconds. In the event of catastrophic failure of any of the playback functions of the NWR system during a potentially life-threatening emergency, the senior official on duty at the WFO has the discretion to keep the transmitter on the air and provide a minimum-level warning service in backup live mode.             6.2  Role of NWR in the National Warning System (NAWAS) . The role of NWR in support of national defense is covered in detail in appendix E. The role of NWR as part of the ""all hazards"" emergency broadcast network is detailed in sections 6.3 and 6.4.             6.3  Initial Issuance of Watches, Warnings, and Related Statements . All pertinent watches and warnings valid for the NWR service area shall be broadcast immediately upon issuance. Initial broadcasts of certain watches and warnings for the NWR service area shall be preceded by the NWR-SAME codes and the     1050 Hz warning alarm tones. Other watches, warnings, and certain related follow-up statements may be preceded by the codes and alarms at RH option. See appendix F for details. Numbers and plotting points for convective watches should not be mentioned. The procedures for initial broadcasts of these messages are described below.             Initial Watch/Warning Broadcast Procedures .             a. Transmission of the NWR-SAME codes followed by the 1050 Hz alarm tone.             b. Broadcast the watch/warning information. This information may be abbreviated to suit certain customer needs, but the more detailed information should then follow without the codes and alarms.  When in manual mode , to minimize any lag time between issuance and broadcast of a  short-fuse warning , it is recommended to broadcast the initial warning  live .             c. Repeat highlights (i.e., what, where and when).             d. NWR-SAME end-of-message code.             Certain short-fuse warnings for counties/parishes/areas just outside the NWR service area may be broadcast with the NWR-SAME codes, as per local agreement, but the warning alarm tone shall not be used.             6.4  Programming After Initial Watch/Warning Issuances . Most public watches and warnings should be highlighted or summarized in the service area forecasts or optional regional forecasts as outlined in Exhibit C-64-1. However, separate messages should be used for details of hurricane warnings and short-fuse warnings for tornadoes, severe thunderstorms, and flash floods.             As threatening weather gets closer to the service area or when conditions become more hazardous, temporarily eliminate less essential parts of the broadcast program to allow additional time for watch, warning, or special/severe weather statement information.             If time permits, generic safety rules and call to action statements appropriate to the hazard should be included in the programming as separate messages when watches or warnings are in effect. Prerecorded messages should be kept in the NWR system database.     The remaining subsections provide guidance on how programming should be conducted during specific hazardous events. Within these subsections, the term ""regional area"" means beyond the service area to around 300 miles or so from the NWR station. ""Nearby"" means only locations in the regional area adjoining the official NWR service area. Exhibit C-64-1 provides a tabular summary of the guidelines in the following subsections of 6.4 for handling critical NWR information. Note that ""limited"" program status means to confine the material to information appropriate to the hazard and eliminate some basic or special customer programming.                     6.4.1  Watches for Tornadoes, Severe Thunderstorms, and Flash Floods . After the initial watch message is aired, information on watches for the NWR service area should be highlighted in the service area forecast and/or included in a separate message.             6.4.2  Warnings for Tornadoes, Severe Thunderstorms, and Flash Floods . If any updated severe weather/flash flood statements are issued after initial broadcast of these warnings, they should replace the warning message and briefly  restate  the essential basics of the warning (what, where, when) followed by the new information concerning that event. A summary message containing up-to-date information on all existing watches, warnings, and advisories in the area may be used but requires up-to-the-minute currency of all information.             In the case when multiple warnings are in effect, limit call to action statements to only the most appropriate to avoid repetition.             6.4.3  Winter Storm, High Wind, and Dust Storm Watches and Warnings . Information for these watches and warnings should be highlighted in the service area forecast and/or summarized in the optional regional forecast and/or included in a separate message. If a separate watch or warning message is broadcast, it should be modified to eliminate conflicting or redundant information or information not useful for listeners in the service area.             6.4.4  Hurricane and Tropical Storm Watches and Warnings .      The latest hurricane local statement (edited for brevity, as necessary) should be broadcast along with any additional information from the latest National Hurricane Center (NHC) public advisory not contained in the hurricane local statement. The NHC forecast advisory should not be broadcast due to its lengthy and detailed nature. Cumulative probabilities through      72 hours should be indicated for locations within the service area as authorized in Weather Service Operations Manual (WSOM) Chapter C-41, Tropical Cyclone Program. Watches and warnings should also be highlighted in the service area forecast.             During warnings, the programming should be limited to: separate warning message with the advisory, service area forecast, short term forecast, tracking, and conditions in the weather roundup, safety rules, or any hurricane local statement.             6.4.5  Marine Warnings and Other Marine Events . This section contains instructions for the broadcasts of marine information.             a.  Special Marine Warnings and Follow-up Statements . Information for each event in the service area should be broadcast as a separate message. See section 6.4.2 for suggested updating procedures.             b.  Other Marine Weather Warnings . All other marine warnings, weather-related statements, and advisories that apply to a WFO's marine forecast area should be broadcast (see      appendix C).             c.  Special/Urgent Marine Information . In the interest of marine safety and at the request of the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) or other appropriate authority as designated by RH, NWS offices should broadcast information dealing with an emergency marine situation where: (1) life and/or property is imminently threatened, and (2) such information could help prevent further losses. The USCG should deliver the information ready for broadcast (without editing by the NWS). The USCG has responsibility for selecting messages that are within the appropriate NWR listening range. The effective coverage of the NWR stations shall be furnished to the USCG as requested. This can be done by any WFO that has the information.             No more than 30 to 40 seconds (about 70 words) should be made available for these messages. The broadcast should remain in the programming until the message is updated (normally 2 to 3 hours) or until the message is canceled by the USCG. The maximum time these messages should be broadcast is 12 hours. These messages should not replace any routine weather products broadcast over NWR. The following message format is suggested:             ""The following emergency marine information is transmitted at the request of the U.S. Coast Guard.... An oil tanker and freighter have collided at the entrance to the Puget Sound between Ft. Warden and Ft. Casey. The channel is blocked and oil covers much of the water surface in the area. All mariners are requested to stay clear of the area.""             In the event NWS priorities require temporary suspension of the USCG broadcast or a station emergency prevents the NWS from broadcasting the message, the NWS should notify the requesting USCG office of the situation as soon as possible.             6.4.6  Flood Watches and Warnings . Flood watches, warnings and related statements for the service area should be detailed in a separate message. They may be summarized in the service area forecast or optional regional forecast. This information for nearby areas may also be broadcast if it is important to listeners in the service area.              6.4.7  Tsunami Watches and Warnings . When these bulletins apply to the service area, they should be broadcast as a separate message using only the predictions for the service area. Because of rapidly changing water levels associated with a tsunami,  DO NOT  broadcast local water level observations.              Broadcasting information on evacuation over NWR is only permitted when prior arrangements have been made with local disaster preparedness authorities to receive the information in a timely fashion. If there are no such arrangements, the following statement should be read at the end of a tsunami warning issued by the Pacific or Alaska Tsunami Warning Centers.             ""Due to rapidly changing conditions associated with tsunami wave activity, listeners are urged to tune to local Emergency Alert System media for the latest information issued by local disaster preparedness authorities. They will provide details on evacuation of low-lying areas, if that is necessary, and when it is safe to return after the tsunami threat has passed.""             The source of evacuation information should be given.             6.5  Non-Weather-Related Emergency Messages . This section contains special procedures for non-weather-related emergency information on a national, regional, and local basis. These messages should meet the requirements outlined in section 6.5.a and should be appropriately identified. The NWS has agreed to allow the use of the NWR service by other government agencies, on a highly selective basis, to broadcast potential life-saving messages. This is in keeping with expanding the function of NWR into an ""all hazards"" network. The lead-in to the non-NWS message should be as follows:             ""The following message is being transmitted at the request of  (OTHER GOVERNMENT AGENCY)  (remainder of text).""             Written agreements for non-NWS messages should exist for such broadcasts as indicated in subsection 6.5.b.             When NWR broadcasts contain information originating outside the NWS, the source of information shall be identified.             a.  Criteria for Broadcasting Non-Weather-Related Emergency Messages . These messages to be permitted on NWR should comply with all the following criteria.             o PUBLIC SAFETY IS INVOLVED--Information to be broadcast will aid in reducing the loss of life or the substantial loss of property.             o OFFICIAL INFORMATION--The source of the information should be a government agency, Federal, state, or local, whose information directly supports Federal responsibilities concerning the protection of life and property.             o TIME CRITICAL--Event requires immediate public knowledge to avoid adverse impact.             o Other means of disseminating the information are not adequate to ensure rapid delivery of urgent information of an immediate threat or of significant importance to life and property.             o Information length and format is consistent with other NWR broadcast program material. Inclusion of this information should not compromise the remaining NWR broadcast content.             o Information should be non-routine and infrequent.             o Information contributes to the NWS warning program through increased customer awareness.             o Information tends to increase the NWR listenership.             b.  Local Non-Weather-Related Emergencies Covered by Agreement . As a general rule, there is only one statewide agreement with one agency to cover all the anticipated situations. Copies of these agreements and detailed procedures to carry out the agreements should be kept near the weather radio operations area. Agreements to broadcast non-weather emergency information (including possible use of the warning alarm tones and NWR-SAME codes) shall be approved by the RH.             c.  Local Non-Weather-Related Emergencies Not Covered by Agreement . At times when events occur requiring the use of NWR by outside sources that are not covered by any agreements, the senior official on duty should determine if the event presents a clear and immediate threat to lives and property in the listening area. If the official determines that the threat to life and property is real and the use of NWR could reduce the threat, these broadcasts, as requested by locally recognized public safety officials, should be authorized. The authority is not to be extended to develop or promote any unofficial or nonapproved agreements. If time permits, the RH should be contacted before the broadcast is made. If time does not permit, the RH should be contacted as soon as possible afterward with details of the event. Examples of situations that would fall under this category are (1) a serious chemical spill or leak,      (2) an explosion in a populated area, or (3) a dangerous nuclear release.             d.  National and Regional Non-Weather-Related Emergencies . The NWS, in support of FEMA, should disseminate emergency messages over the NWR, including but not limited to, attack warnings and large-scale non-weather-related events, such as earthquakes and volcanic activity. The dissemination procedures for national and regional non-weather-related emergency messages are described in detail in appendix E.             6.6  Required Weekly Test (RWT) . The public alarm tone and NWR-SAME test code features of NWR shall be activated for test purposes each Wednesday between 10 a.m. and noon local time, except when severe weather is ongoing or threatening. At regional discretion, WFOs may broadcast the required weekly test additionally at certain other times (e.g., evening prime time) to suit stated customer needs and within office capabilities. WFOs should not broadcast the required weekly test using automated scheduling unless there is a specific procedure for ensuring the test does not inadvertently broadcast during threatening weather.             Immediately after transmitting the appropriate NWR-SAME codes and tones, the following message shall be broadcast (it may be shortened, at WFO option, except counties/parishes/areas must be provided).             ""This is the National Weather Service Office in  city  . The preceding signal was a test of the Weather Radio Station  LLL-NN's  public warning system. During potentially dangerous weather situations, specially built receivers can be automatically activated by this signal to warn of the impending hazard. Tests of this signal and receivers' performance are normally conducted by the National Weather Service at  time  each  day of the week  . If there is a threat of severe weather, the test will be postponed to the next available good-weather day. Reception of this broadcast, and especially the warning alarm tone, will vary at any given location. This variability, normally more noticeable at greater distances from the transmitter, can occur even though you are using a good quality receiver in good working order. The warning alarm tone will be activated for hazardous watches and warnings for the following counties  list of counties/parishes/independent cities, or other designated areas  . This concluded the weekly test of Weather Radio Station .""             Where more than one state is involved, the state name shall always precede the names of the counties in that state.             If, for any reason, the test was missed during the scheduled time frame, then the next test should not take place until about      24 hours later on the next available good-weather day.             As part of the weekly test, those transmitters whose broadcast cannot be heard at the WFO and have an operating ROAMS should be checked for audio quality. This is done by placing a telephone call to the ROAMS unit and requesting to monitor the broadcast audio.              6.7  Drills of Broadcast Procedures for Critical Events . Each WFO shall establish procedures for conducting and documenting periodic drills in accordance with the procedures outlined in section 8 and appendix B.             It is suggested that the required weekly tests be conducted live through on-air or recorded emergency override, or through backup live. These types of tests will afford the staff an excellent opportunity to obtain experience in the event they have to use the emergency override or backup live function of the NWR system.             7.  Broadcast Outage and Suspension Procedures . This section covers various aspects of these procedures.     7.1  Notice of NWR Facility Outage . In the event of an NWR facility outage that has been planned at least 24 hours in advance, a brief message should be broadcast periodically during the 24-hour period prior to the outage. Planned outages that are scheduled to occur in less than 24 hours should be immediately broadcast and frequently repeated. For example:             ""NOAA Weather Radio station KEC-75, Des Moines, Iowa, will be off the air for maintenance from 10 a.m., Wednesday, until about 9 a.m., Thursday.""             Include the estimated time of return if it can be determined. Avoid such terms as ""Thursday morning"" or ""Monday night.""             When NWR equipment is taken off the air or unplanned outages occur, a message should be sent over the NOAA Weather Wire Service (NWWS) or the local NWS telephone recording system, if feasible.             When interference with other agencies requires temporary suspension of NWR broadcasts, a brief message should be aired over the NWR just prior to the suspension. A sample message follows:             ""NOAA Weather Radio station KHB-36, Washington, D.C., will be off the air from 7 a.m. until 3 p.m., Thursday, because of technical difficulties. If weather warnings are required during the period, NOAA Weather Radio will resume broadcasts as soon as possible.""             An additional message also should be sent over NWWS and the local telephone recording system. The following is an example of a suggested message that may be used on the NWWS to advise subscribers of the NWR outage.             Example :             WBCPNSWBC     TTAA00 KWBC 161330             PUBLIC INFORMATION STATEMENT     NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE WASHINGTON DC     830 AM EST TUE MAR 16 1999             NOAA WEATHER RADIO KHB-36 WASHINGTON DC WILL BE OFF THE AIR DUE TO TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES FROM 10 AM TODAY...TUESDAY...     UNTIL ABOUT 9 AM WEDNESDAY. IF WEATHER WARNINGS ARE REQUIRED DURING THE PERIOD..NOAA WEATHER RADIO WILL RESUME BROADCASTS AT ONCE.             Regardless whether the outage is planned or unplanned, if it is expected to be for more than 12 hours, notify the RH. If the station goes off in an emergency or potentially threatening situation, notify the RH as quickly as time will allow.             7.2  Broadcast Suspension Procedures . State, local, and other Federal agencies use frequencies near the NWR band. On occasion, these agencies (e.g., Treasury, Forest Service) will temporarily move into an NWR service area with a mobile radio system to cope with a highly critical situation. When interference is caused to another emergency radio system, the NWS will cooperate in the elimination of the radio interference with the following procedures.             7.2.1  Routine Request .             a. Designated personnel of an agency involved in a critical operation should first establish, by ""on-off"" short duration tests with the local NWR involved, that the interference is actually a result of NWR.             b. If it is established that the interference can be eliminated by the temporary shutdown of an NWR station, the designated contact for that agency should request a temporary shutdown for that station. This request should be directed to WSH.             c. WSH should notify the appropriate RH of the need for the NWR shutdown. The RH, in turn, should inform the local office. The local office should not suspend operations in the absence of such notification.             Any office that has been requested to temporarily shut down, under the above procedures, has the authority to continue operations or to immediately resume the broadcast operations during actual or imminent severe weather, flood, or other disasters. NWR offices should inform the RH when this situation arises, and RH should relay that information to WSH.             7.2.2  Emergency Request . These instructions can only provide guidance for anticipated interference conditions; not all situations can be anticipated. When interference is caused to another emergency radio system (i.e., fire trucks, ambulance, etc.) and no severe weather is occurring or imminent, suspension of the NWR broadcasts is authorized by the WFO. The RH shall be notified as soon as possible.             7.2.3  Fire and Bomb Threats . When an NWR office must evacuate due to a bomb threat, fire, hazardous material incident, or other hazard, a short message should be added to the broadcast program if time permits. For example, ""Updates will not be available until further notice."" Never announce the office is being evacuated due to a bomb threat or fire.             8.  Quality Assurance . The primary responsibility for maintaining the quality of NWR broadcasts rests with the WFO and the RH. The RH should investigate the options available for training to maintain high broadcast quality. Quality assurance at the local office should consist of on-shift monitoring and active participation of an NWR program leader as described below. See also appendix B for information on training and practice requirements to assure proficiency.              8.1  Quality Assurance on Shift . The broadcast programming should be monitored frequently during the shift to ensure the information is timely, complete, consistent, accurate, and of clear audio quality. For those transmitters out of broadcast range of the WFO, the audio quality should be checked using the NWR system monitoring function and ROAMS. Actual broadcast audio from the transmitter should be checked once a week as part of the required weekly test (see section 6.5). Also, each person placing a message in the broadcast program should review the product, including text proofing, and evaluate the new product's impact on the total program before broadcasting it.             See appendix H for identification of NWR system problems by ROAMS and the appropriate responses by WFO personnel.             8.2  NWR Program Leaders . WFOs should have an NWR program leader(s) who will:             a. ensure manuals, handbooks, and logs are kept up-to-date and all NWR operators are familiar with current operating instructions and techniques for preventive maintenance;             b. see that adequate NWR supplies are maintained;             c. carry out any NWR-related duties assigned by the WFO management;             d. assist the NWR system focal point (if not the same person) in the programming and maintenance of the NWR system;              e. ensure educational and promotional materials are adequate and up-to-date (see section 12); and             f. assist WFO management in the NWR Operator Proficiency Program, as described in appendix B.             9.  NWR as a Substitute for Other Means of Dissemination . WFO management should be alert to situations where NWR broadcasts can be used to lighten the total dissemination workload of the office. NWR broadcasts may be used to reduce the number and variety of manual telephone recordings, as well as reduce the number of incoming telephone calls to the office.             10.  Use of NWR by the Electronic Media . The FCC has permitted AM, FM, TV, and cable TV broadcast stations to rebroadcast NWR transmissions. Appendix G is a copy of the FCC release to broadcasters which specifies the conditions placed on the blanket rebroadcast authority. The same conditions apply to rebroadcasts of NWR on amateur radio. Note that since the release was issued in 1978, four additional broadcast frequencies have been authorized (see section 2.c).             The rebroadcast of NWR programming is encouraged for cable TV systems and TV stations whose areal coverage coincides with the NWR service area. For cable TV systems and TV stations that extend well beyond the NWR listening range, rebroadcasts are discouraged since most material will not apply, particularly the warnings.             An important function of the NWR is to serve as the NWS's primary entry into the EAS through the use of NWR-SAME technology, which has the same communications protocols as the EAS. NWS at the national, regional, and WFO levels should continue to work closely with their respective electronic media and emergency management partners to assure the success of the EAS. WFOs, along with their EAS partners, should be involved in the creation of state and local EAS plans. See appendix F for details on NWS policy regarding the use of the 1050 Hz warning alarm tone and authorized NWR-SAME codes on NWR broadcast messages.             For information on providing commercial and public TV and radio stations with direct access to the audio output of NWR, see WSOM Chapter G-21, NOAA Weather Radio, which includes sample agreement forms.             11.  Restrictions Under Operating License . The NWS is licensed to operate individual NWRs through the Interdepartmental Radio Advisory Committee (IRAC). This Federal committee is chaired by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration of the DOC. IRAC controls NWS operations in the same way the FCC does for commercial and other non-Federal groups and organizations. Each NWR license is granted for a particular power setting and frequency at a specific site. The power, frequency, or location of an NWR station cannot be changed without prior IRAC approval.             12.  Public Education and Promotion . To be fully effective, NWR must employ a continuing program of public education. This program should involve the efforts of the NOAA Office of Public Affairs, WSH, RH, and WFOs.             Further information on promoting NWR can be found in the ""NOAA Weather Radio 2000, Console Replacement System Outreach Guide"" and ""The NWS NOAA Weather Radio Promotional Guide for a New Century."" Substantial publicity also is being garnered through public and private announcements about the ongoing expansion of NWR programming through placement of new transmitters throughout the country in partnership with external groups. The Office of Public Affairs at the national and regional levels, in coordination with OM and OSO, plays a significant role in these promotional efforts. This is particularly true in regard to written materials, such as press releases and brochures, and any audio or video ""spots"" for commercial broadcast. Much information on NWR for the public and NWS personnel is available on the Internet. Two Web sites of particular interest are:             http://www.nws.noaa.gov/nwr      http://www.nws.noaa.gov/pa.             12.1  General Promotion Activities . WFOs are encouraged to promote NWR. Promotions should highlight the warning alarm and NWR-SAME code features and the value of NWR to schools, hospitals, industrial centers, and homes. Potential NWR ownership and listenership also should be promoted through outreach activities at conventions, fairs, boat shows, and other gatherings at the local, regional, and national levels. Pursue personal contacts where necessary in dealing with special customer groups and business groups promoting the sales of NWR receivers, especially those with seven channels.              NOAA/NWS Public Affairs has a Web site listing many ideas that have been successful over the years. A list of these ideas is available at:              http://www.nws.noaa.gov/pa/secnews/nwr/101ideas.htm.             NOAA and King Features Syndicate have an agreement allowing for use of the Mark Trail comic strip character as a campaign symbol for promoting NOAA Weather Radio. NWS personnel should contact their Regional NOAA/NWS Public Affairs Officer for guidance on using the Mark Trail image in specific campaigns.             WSH has developed and periodically updated brochures that are available from the National Logistics Supply Center in Kansas City, Missouri. Pop-up displays are available from OSO's NWR Program Office.             The RH will assist local offices in obtaining NWR exhibits for use in increasing public awareness. WFOs are encouraged      to distribute maps showing the NWR coverage area; these handouts might include information about the NWR service. Other awareness avenues may include newspaper and the telephone.             A sample listing in the newspaper for the weather section or radio station listing section might be as follows:             WEATHER RADIO             For 24-hour NOAA Weather Radio broadcasts, tune to      162.--- MHz.             Brief NWR promotion messages can be placed on the office forecast-recorder phone or Internet Home page. An example of such a message might be as follows.             ""Because of high public interest in weather, you may be unable to reach this number (or Internet Home page) during active weather situations. You may wish to tune in to our NOAA Weather Radio station on 162.--- MHz to receive the latest weather information broadcast continuously from this office. Consult your radio sales outlet to select a suitable receiver.""             Another means of promoting NWR is to use NWR as ""audio"" whenever the office telephones are placed ""on-hold.""             12.2  Promotion with Electronic Media . WFOs should continue to cultivate positive relations with local electronic media with the goal of timely and direct rebroadcasts of NWR-SAME-coded emergency messages via EAS facilities to the public. (Further information on EAS and NWR-SAME is available in section 10 and appendix F.) In addition, WFOs should continue to encourage electronic media facilities to rebroadcast more of the NWR broadcasts outside of the EAS arena, including follow-up statements and other supporting forecasts. As examples, some television stations do this via the Secondary Audio Programming (SAP) technology, where people can tune modern televisions sets to the SAP to hear the information. Some cable television facilities use NWR rebroadcasts as a ""voice-over,"" along with radar or other graphics. These efforts should be expanded, where possible.             13.  Customer Surveys . From time to time, WFOs should make on-air requests for comments and suggestions from the listening audience. Surveys such as these are encouraged and should prove helpful in determining usefulness of the broadcast service and current broadcast scheduling. Summaries of the survey results should be sent to the RH. Plans to conduct a survey should be coordinated with the RH.             14.  Gift/Cooperator-Operated NWR Systems . The basic NWR network funded by the Federal Government was completed in the early 1980s. Because the completed network did not reach every community in the United States, local and state governments, private companies, and various civic groups can help establish complete new NWR stations or expand service areas by purchasing supplemental transmitters. This is in keeping with the overall NWR expansion goal of the NWS, as outlined in section 1.1. WSOM Chapter G-21 provides specific information on these efforts, including agreement forms for donated equipment.              OFFICE OF TELECOMMUNICATION POLICY (OTP)          EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT          WASHINGTON, DC 20504                  January 13, 1975                  NATIONAL POLICY FOR THE USE OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS          TO WARN THE GENERAL PUBLIC                  Policy Statement                     In November 1971, the Federal Government completed a review of national policies and programs for use of telecommunications to provide the American public with warning of an enemy attack or of natural disasters. It was established at that time, in a statement of national policy respecting home warning systems, that the acquisition and use of any warning receiver should be a voluntary decision by each citizen. Studies conducted since 1971 now have led the Government to update and reaffirm that policy.             It now has been established that in addition to the voluntary use of a warning receiver, the public interest would be served best by a single, Government-operated system for warning citizens in their homes of enemy attack or natural disaster. In this regard, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Weather Radio will be the only federally sponsored radio transmission of warning information to receivers optionally available to the general public.             The 1971 OTP policy statement committed the Federal Government to pursuing a program that would ""establish a rapid, reliable warning capability, and...bring the cost of a warning receiver within the reach of every American citizen."" To this end, a series of tests and studies were initiated to explore several proposed home warning systems and market demands for home receivers. During 1974, the results of these studies were reviewed by the Warning Steering Committee, an interagency group chaired by the Office of Telecommunications Policy, and including representatives of NOAA, the Defense Civil Preparedness Agency (DCPA), the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the Office of Preparedness (OP), and the Department of Transportation (DOT).             The studies focused primarily on two alternative home warning systems. The first is the Decision Information Distribution System (DIDS) of the Department of Defense. Designed originally for enemy attack warning, its scope could be expanded to include warning citizens of natural disasters. The system is in the experimental stage. The second system is the National Weather Service's (NWS) VHF/FM Tone Alert System. (The NWS is an agency of NOAA.) This system already is operational for weather forecasting and incorporates a special tone alert signal permitting receivers to be activated automatically  if desired by the owner .              After analyzing these studies, OTP concluded that the NOAA system is the choice for priority expansion and will serve as the single national home warning system. The reasons for this are:             (1) It provides routine daily weather services, tailored to local areas, thereby enhancing the marketability of receivers;             (2) Federal investment required to complete coverage of most populated areas will be much less than the investment required to complete the DIDS transmitting system, and can be accomplished much sooner; and             (3) Inexpensive commercial receivers for this system are already on the market.             The development of alternative systems, if allowed to continue unchecked, could result not only in a needless proliferation of home warning systems but could also effectively split the market for receivers because of different technologies, which, in turn, might keep the cost of receivers so high as to be a serious obstacle to widespread voluntary purchase. Therefore, in order to avoid duplication, public confusion and unnecessary future financial burden on the public (as consumers and taxpayers), the NOAA Weather Radio will be the only federally sponsored radio transmission of warning information to receivers optionally available to the general public. Other systems such as the DIDS should no longer be considered candidates for this function.             The market demand studies for home receivers indicated that many citizens would voluntarily purchase receivers capable of receiving home warning (if one were available), but that the total number of households with such receivers would not--for the foreseeable future--constitute a majority of the population. Therefore, this policy recognizes that Government-operated home warning systems, with purchase of the receiver on a voluntary basis, can only supplement other existing warning systems.             The Warning Steering Committee, chaired by the OTP, will coordinate efforts for the use of telecommunications for warning dissemination to attain a consolidated national warning capability. In support of this effort, NOAA and DCPA will develop necessary plans to use the NOAA Weather Radio as a supplementary attack warning system and will further develop plans and procedures to incorporate the civil defense siren systems into the consolidated warning system, as well as to maximize the provision of warning information to radio and television stations.             NOAA WEATHER RADIO (NWR)     OPERATOR PROFICIENCY PROGRAM                     Purpose : The purpose of this appendix is to emphasize the requirement that all NWS operational personnel at the WFOs must be proficient at disseminating warnings, watches, and advisories via the NWR system, including NWR-SAME, and any backup broadcast systems. Operational personnel include the Meteorologist in Charge, senior and general forecasters, Hydrometeorological Technicians (HMTs), Meteorological Interns, Service Hydrologists, Science Operations Officers (SOOs), Data Acquisition Program Managers (DAPMs), and Warning Coordination Meteorologists (WCMs).             Background : A critical mission of the NWS is the issuance of warnings, watches, and advisories for the protection of life and property. The prompt and efficient issuance of these products via NWR and the EAS provides a far-reaching and effective warning/alert system to the American citizen. Hence, all NWS operational personnel at NWR sites shall be proficient at providing this warning dissemination service.             Regional Headquarters (RH) : RHs shall have responsibility for the oversight of an NWR operator proficiency program in their region. This program will include an annual report from each WFO management to their RH. It will assure that each operational employee performed practice or real-time NWR/EAS warning issuances at sufficient intervals to demonstrate their ability to disseminate, in an operationally effective period of time, watches, warnings, advisories, and other appropriate messages over the NWR broadcast system(s) at their office. The report shall contain sufficient detail, as described in the following section, to accurately document the steps taken to confirm this capability. Each RH shall maintain this documentation on file for a period of five (5) years.              Weather Forecast Offices (WFO) : All operational employees shall perform practice or real-time NWR/EAS warning issuance on their the NWR system and any backup NWR broadcast systems no less than quarterly, and at other random times determined by the WFO management. These practice sessions shall be clearly indicated as such during broadcast. For the NWR system, this shall include correct and time-efficient usage of its Emergency Override function, Backup Live function with an NWR-SAME encoder, and Weather Message Creation function to disseminate an NWS warning.             One of these practice sessions per year shall be for the official record and be monitored by a local trainer (SOO, WCM, DAPM, or NWR Program Leader) for proper procedures and time effectiveness. Once a year, as determined by each region, the WFO management shall document in writing to their RH that all quarterly practice sessions have been successfully completed by all operational employees, including the date(s) of the monitored NWR/EAS warning issuance. The WFO management shall describe other actions taken throughout the year to ensure the proficiency of the office staff to effectively operate NWR in critical event situations, such as watches, warnings, and advisories.             At the time of issuance of this appendix to WSOM Chapter C-64, the FCC has not yet approved use of a planned demonstration code, a code specifically designed for use with practice EAS broadcasts. Until this code is approved, these exercises must be confined to the time of the manually produced NWR tone alarm/RWT (EAS Required Weekly Test), or confined to 1 DMO (practice demonstration code) issuance per day per NWR broadcast service area. Upon FCC approval of the unrestricted use of the DMO code, the exercises may be conducted at any time in accordance with WFO policy/procedure, ensuring that each practice broadcast is clearly indicated as such, and performed only during times of non-threatening weather. At that time, a quarterly practice session may be substituted by a routine weekly test but shall not be a substitute for a monitored yearly test by the local NWR trainer.             GUIDELINES FOR BASIC CORE AND     SPECIAL CUSTOMER MESSAGES                     Basic Core Messages . Basic core messages are those that are to be repeated, often as a set, on a frequent basis. Except for the brief station I.D., these messages may be deleted or cut as appropriate when warnings are in effect within the service area. This set of core messages should normally be programmed in the following order.             a.  Station I.D . A brief station identification should appear with each repetition of the core broadcast. It should include the call sign, general service area, programming office and, if necessary, attribution information. This may be necessary at sites where free tower rent is provided, but the tower owner requires frequent attribution. At least one version of the I.D. should contain a reference to NWR as the voice of the NWS. Two examples follow:             ""This is NOAA Weather Radio station KEC-74, serving central Indiana and originating from the National Weather Service Office in Indianapolis.""             ""You are listening to NOAA Weather Radio, the voice of the National Weather Service, serving western Washington and the adjacent coastal waters. KHB-60 Seattle and KIH-36 Neah Bay originate from the Weather Service Office in Seattle.""             A more detailed I.D. should be broadcast on a less frequent basis (i.e., once an hour) with appropriate attribution, frequency, and transmitter location and description of the service. The detailed I.D. should not be broadcast during critical event operations, only the brief I.D. Solicitations for feedback concerning NWR programming and scheduling can be included in the longer I.D.             b.  Synopsis and Optional Regional Forecast . Care should be taken to ensure these messages are broadcast frequently enough to avoid reference to time frames that may be surpassed before the issuance of a replacement message. For example, refrain from stating ""snow is expected over the Great Lakes by late morning..."" if the product will air past noon.             Synopsis ...The general synopsis should contain a discussion of weather systems that will be affecting the broadcast area during the valid forecast period. It should be very brief, in layman's terms and limited to highlighting only the most significant features. It should emphasize the first 48 hours and indicate pertinent information through the extended forecast periods. If marine messages are part of the core broadcast programming (see special customer messages section below), the marine synopsis may be used instead, provided it describes features affecting both marine and land areas in the broadcast service area.              Regional Forecast (optional) ...This is an optional overview of the weather beyond the broadcast service area for a multitude of uses, such as marine, travel, outdoor activities, construction, media rebroadcasts, etc. It normally should not exceed 1 minute in length. The region covered should include the area out to a radius of about 300 miles from the transmitter.             For brevity, the forecast portion should include information for no longer than the next 36 hours. Emphasis should be on problem areas associated with rain or snow, severely restricted visibility, and significant variations in temperature. A small number of larger city forecasts may be highlighted where there is a lot of listener need or interest. Alaska, Hawaii, or Puerto Rico may want to include weather to common destinations beyond the normal regional range (including mainland United States) or restrict the region to areas reachable by land. The latter would apply to U.S. coastal stations as well.             Information in the regional forecast for winter storm and high wind watches and warnings should be summarized with specific details avoided. Include specific information in other portions of the broadcasts.             Details on specific severe thunderstorm, tornado, flood, or flash flood watches should also be avoided in the regional forecast. Instead, language or terms should be used similar to the convective outlook with regard to the potential for severe convective weather and flash floods. Include specific watch and warning information for severe convective weather and flash flooding for the service area in other portions of the broadcast.              Information on hurricane/tropical storm watches and warnings should be given from the latest advisory. At a minimum, this would include the storm location and strength as well as the 24-hour forecast movement and strength. Local offices or RH should set policies or guidelines to broadcast such information for appropriate distances beyond the regional area.             Temperature forecasts should be general and need not be closer than 10 degree ranges. Discussions of current or past weather should not be mentioned unless it is relevant to the forecast conditions or will impact customers, such as those traveling into flooding or deep snow.             c.  Service Area Forecasts . The forecast should be for the entire service area, as covered in zone forecast product issuances, but with emphasis on conditions for the first      12 hours. The extended forecast modified for the service area also should be included but with more general information than the 1- to 2-day forecast. The service area forecast is usually the most important segment of the entire broadcast. The forecast issuance time should not be included. Short-fused warnings (e.g., for tornadoes, severe thunderstorms, and flash floods) are excluded from this forecast since they are carried on a separate broadcast segment. Most other watches, warnings, and advisories should be highlighted. When convective outlooks for significant severe weather potential include the service area, the information should be integrated into the forecast usually within the first two forecast periods.             d.  Weather Roundups . The latest observations within the service area should be broadcast around-the-clock and shall be updated at least hourly. The roundup may also include observations or a summary of weather conditions adjacent to the service area out to a range of 100 to 300 miles. The time of the observations should be stated. Observed weather should be updated or removed from the core set of messages no later than      1 hour and 20 minutes after the valid time of last observation. If for any reason it becomes impossible to update this hourly, either through automation or manually, it should be cut from the broadcast until it can be updated.             Some observations taken at 2- to 3-hour intervals, such as marine, still may be of some value for a longer time. If they are included in later updates, the specific time of these observations should be stated.             e.  Short Term Forecast . This message is broadcast when the product is in effect and should consist of a brief forecast of expected conditions, typically in the next 1 to      3 hours. This message should be updated as frequently as possible during active weather to maintain freshness. See WSOM Chapter C-21, Local and Regional Statements, Summaries, and Tables, for details on the short term forecast.             Special Customer Messages . These messages are of interest to well-defined customer groups that make up a large part of the listening audience. In order to avoid redundancy, limit the parameters to those not included in other broadcast material. With the exception of marine forecasts and forecasts for rivers near or at flood levels, special customer messages should be scheduled in selected and limited time periods. Special customer messages may vary during the day, week, or season as audience needs change. For example, commercial fishermen are closely tuned to marine forecasts early in the morning prior to leaving port. Lake and river stages, recreational/resort forecasts, and any special event forecasts become more important as weekends approach and are often seasonal. Messages for special customers include:             a.  Marine Forecast . The coastal waters forecast or near-shore forecast should be programmed for  all  NWR stations listed on Marine Weather Service charts. Offshore marine forecast also may be broadcast depending on listener interest. Where marine interests are dominant, the marine forecasts may make up a large portion of the broadcast cycle, or even become the core broadcast. For instance, the concept of a ""marine hour"" may be addressed through scheduling of a marine suite. Landlocked NWRs with significant public interest in marine areas that are outside the NWR service area but reasonably accessible should schedule marine programming for peak periods, such as weekends, holidays, or during the summer. Weather information for inland lakes may be included in the NWR service area forecast or recreational/resort area forecast if it is not part of the marine forecast programming. Tidal information and water temperature may be included in marine programming.              b.  Climate Data . For a period of 1 to 3 hours every morning and evening, each station should broadcast a brief summary of the day's climate data. This information should take up less than 1 minute and should include high and low temperatures and precipitation. Data, such as degree days and normals, solar information, and record reports, may be broadcast but are not required. Statements summarizing the monthly climatic data, dry spells, or other timely features may be programmed as desired. Recommended local broadcast times are from around 7 a.m. to 9 a.m. and 7 p.m. to 9 p.m., depending on input from listener surveys, AWIPS issuance times, and local staffing considerations.             c.  Hydrologic Observations and Forecasts, Tide Data, and Water Temperature . Include this information when reasonably large streams, rivers, lakes, or coasts are in or near the service area according to customer needs. When a hazard exists, this message should be available continuously. Otherwise, this message should be broadcast in a limited time interval.             d.  Fire Weather Forecasts . Include this information only during the fire season and where major forest, brush, or grass fires are possible. If the forest is out of the service area, the information could be contained in the regional forecast. See WSOM Chapter D-06, Fire Weather Services.             e.  Air Quality Information . This information should be provided when pollution is above a critical safety level and the information is available from a local government agency.             f.  Recreational/Resort Area Forecasts . Limit these to areas where a significant percentage of the listeners are expected to go. These forecasts should describe, in general terms, weather events that will enhance or restrict activity. These forecasts may be incorporated in the regional forecast.             g.  Weather-Related Road Information . Include road condition reports when there are hazards (typically in winter) and when the reports are easily available with frequent updates from an official source. The data should be summarized and require little or no writing or editing by NWS personnel. If approved by the officials involved, telephone numbers of the official sources may be broadcast to aid motorists. The time and source of the report should be included in the broadcast.             Example :             ""AT 11:00 AM THE IOWA STATE POLICE REPORT INTERSTATE HIGHWAYS AND MAJOR US ROUTES WEST OF...ARE....""             h.  Ultraviolet Index (UVI) Forecasts . WFOs that have UVI forecast sites within their NWR broadcast service area(s) are responsible for broadcasting those UVI values on the appropriate NWR transmitters. These values should be broadcast generally from early April to the end of September. These start and stop dates may be adjusted at RH/WFO discretion depending on local climatic factors and customer needs. See Operations Manual Letter 4-95, Ultraviolet Index Forecasts, section 3.2, or any superseding policy directive for further operational instructions.                     NWR SYSTEM     BASIC TERMS AND DEFINITIONS     RELATED TO BROADCAST SCHEDULING                     (Weather) Messages :  The most important unit of information that the NWR system handles.  A message consists of two parts: the message header (i.e., the message attributes including the message identifier) and the message content (i.e., information intended for broadcast). Messages may be live voice, digitized voice, or ASCII text. They may be input directly at the NWR system (by microphone or from floppy disk) or from an external source (i.e., Automation of Field Operations and Services [AFOS], AWIPS).                     Message Type : Names of messages. The NWR system uses message types as analogous to AFOS PILs, i.e., contains information in nine characters about the node origination site (source of the message), the product category (e.g., severe weather statement), and the specific product designator. Essentially the same as AFOS PILs but only restricted to AFOS PILs while AFOS is the NWR system's sole communication source.                     Broadcast Suite : A list of message types that are eligible to be broadcast when that suite is active. Categorized by ""General,"" ""High,"" and ""Exclusive,"" these are ascending orders of program urgency relating to restricted message types in the suite. (More about this under Scheduling.)                     Broadcast Program : Each suite is assigned to a program, and there will be multiple suites assigned to a single program. These programs are then assigned to a specific transmitter and result in the broadcast itself.                     Backup Live:  Condition of operation if the NWR system has failed. Allows direct human-to-transmitter dissemination of information through bypassing the failed NWR system.                     Emergency Override:  Operation used when the NWR system is working, but an emergency situation exists that requires immediate human access to the transmitter. Cuts off current broadcast for the operator to ""go live"" with emergency information. These ""live"" messages can be recorded for subsequent insertion into the ongoing broadcast program.                     NWR System Identifier:  A numeric field contained within the Message Reference Descriptor (MRD), used to identify messages for purposes of replacement or output ordering. ( This is different from the 9-letter ID defined as message type.)                     Listening Area Codes : Also known as LACs, these are essentially Universal Geographic Codes renamed to identify their specific use by the NWR system. It is a code that identifies geopolitical areas (e.g., NWS defined zones, counties, parts of counties, and even independent cities) to which a message applies.                     MRD:  Message Reference Descriptor. One of the attributes required to uniquely identify messages in the NWR system. Used ultimately to determine whether a message should be replaced or not.                     Periodicity : Messages may be scheduled so they are inserted at specific time intervals. This time interval set between times of broadcast is the periodicity. (""Weather on the Eights,"" for instance, refers to the message recurring every 10 minutes, at 08, 18, 28, 38, 48, and 58 minutes after the hour, or having a  periodicity  of 10 minutes.)                     Broadcast Cycle : The broadcast cycle can be considered as the core set of messages currently playing, including those playing sequentially and those playing periodically. From the AMPRO analogy, those tapes that are playing, from Digital or Interalia those ""bins"" that are playing beginning with the first and ending with the last. On the NWR system, the broadcast cycle is depicted as inclusive of those message types listed on the broadcast cycle screen. Broadcast cycle length is the length of time it takes to broadcast all of those messages.                     Manual Operations : Use of the NWR system for manually recording and scheduling messages rather than using automated text-to-voice capability.                             DISSEMINATION PROCEDURES FOR     NATIONAL AND REGIONAL     NON-WEATHER-RELATED EMERGENCY MESSAGES                     NON-WEATHER-RELATED NATIONAL OR REGIONAL HAZARDS             These procedures shall be used to disseminate messages from authorized organizations for non-weather-related hazards affecting the Nation or large regions of the country normally consisting of several states or territories. These would include, but are not limited to, nuclear attack, earthquakes, tsunamis, terrorist attack, etc. The details of these instructions outlined here will be amended occasionally by replacing this appendix to account for changes in NWS communications systems, such as AFOS being replaced by AWIPS, as the NWR system matures, and as new NWR-SAME and EAS codes are developed by FEMA, FCC, and NWS. The basic concept, however, should not be affected by these changes.             A.  Initial Dissemination .             (1) Following a 7-second ring on NAWAS, the National Warning Center or its authorized alternate will announce the title of the WARNING message.             (2) The regional warnings centers or other authorized alternate emergency operation centers (which normally operate in these types of situations) acknowledge to the National Warning Center. The state warning points then acknowledge. The state warning points will then request acknowledgment from locations on the state warning circuits (including NWS locations). (Note for FEMA personnel reading this directive: ""Activate the warning signal"" means to transmit the appropriate NWR-SAME/EAS code and the 1050 Hz warning alarm tone to activate NWR receivers.)             (3) NWS offices shall prepare the appropriate message for dissemination. If the message is:             a.  NUCLEAR ATTACK : Get the red-bordered envelope containing the approved text for this specific type of hazard. The text of the message on this card may be prerecorded and stored on a diskette with the diskette sealed along with the card in the red-bordered envelope. THE TEXT OF THIS MESSAGE, HOWEVER, SHALL, UNDER NO CONDITIONS, BE RECORDED AND STORED AS A FILE ON THE NWR SYSTEM OR ANY OTHER ON-LINE NWR MESSAGING SYSTEM PRIOR TO ITS ACTUAL USE IN A REAL EVENT. DO NOT leave the envelope out in the open. The NWS must eliminate the possibility of a false or accidental ATTACK WARNING.             b.  OTHER NON-WEATHER NATIONAL/REGIONAL HAZARDS : Obtain the text of the message by either copying or recording it from the NAWAS. If the message is obtained from another authorized source, such as AWIPS, AFOS, or FAX, use the state or nationally established method of confirmation.             (4) Until updated with a more specific event code, select the NWR-SAME/EAS code for Civil Emergency Message (CEM) to disseminate these types of messages along with ALL the appropriate geographic codes available on the NWR system or NWR-SAME panel if it is being used in backup mode for some reason. Suspend all normal broadcast operations and cause the NWR to send the code followed by the public warning alarm tone. At the conclusion of the warning alarm tone, immediately begin  READING THE MESSAGE EXACTLY AS WRITTEN .             (5) The message should be read live and recorded. An alternative is to play the message from the prerecorded diskette. Following transmission of the NWR-SAME/EAS End-Of-Message, immediately program the NWR for this message and a short station identification to play indefinitely until manually replaced with another message. If the WFO will be evacuated, broadcast a recurring short message informing listeners that the WFO will not provide any service until further notice. Do NOT mention that the office has been evacuated.             (NOTE: When a new event code is established for this specific type of message, offices should investigate the creation of a special high priority product suite that will be activated when a message is broadcast with this specific code.)             B.  Termination .             (1) Following a 7-second ring on NAWAS, the National Warning Center or its authorized alternate will announce the termination of the specific hazard WARNING as follows.             a.  NUCLEAR ATTACK :             ""ATTENTION ALL STATIONS, THIS IS THE NATIONAL WARNING CENTER. THE ATTACK WARNING IS TERMINATED. REPEAT. THE ATTACK WARNING IS TERMINATED. WARNING CENTERS ACKNOWLEDGE.""             b.  OTHER NON-WEATHER NATIONAL/REGIONAL HAZARD : A similar type of statement to that in B(1)a. will be read on NAWAS. If a message is sent by another authorized source, such as AWIPS, AFOS, or FAX, use the state or nationally established method of confirmation.             (2) The regional warning centers or other authorized alternate emergency operations centers (which normally operate in these types of situations) acknowledge to the National Warning Center. The state warning points then acknowledge. The state warning points will then request acknowledgment from locations on the state warning circuits (including NWS locations).             (3) Following acknowledgment to the appropriate warning centers or as soon as the NWS office is again occupied, NWS offices shall disseminate these types of cancellation messages. Until updated with a more specific event cancellation code, select the NWR-SAME/EAS code for Civil Emergency Message along with ALL the appropriate geographic codes available on the NWR system or NWR-SAME panel if it is being used in backup mode for some reason. Interrupt the existing broadcast operations and cause the NWR to send the code followed by the public warning alarm tone. At the conclusion of the warning alarm tone, immediately begin  READING THE MESSAGE EXACTLY AS WRITTEN .             a.  NUCLEAR ATTACK :             ""THE U.S. GOVERNMENT HAS ISSUED A TERMINATION OF THE ATTACK WARNING. REPEAT. THE U.S. GOVERNMENT HAS ISSUED A TERMINATION OF THE ATTACK WARNING. FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS ISSUED BY YOUR LOCAL GOVERNMENT. SINCE THERE MAY BE A DANGER OF RADIOACTIVE FALLOUT, YOU SHOULD NOT LEAVE A SHELTER OR PROTECTED LOCATION UNTIL YOUR LOCAL GOVERNMENT ANNOUNCES THAT IT IS SAFE TO DO SO.""             b.  OTHER NON-WEATHER NATIONAL/REGIONAL HAZARD : Read the text of the message as provided by the appropriate authority.             The CANCELLATION MESSAGE shall be recorded and placed on the NWR routine broadcast cycle for at least 1 hour.             C.  Training Exercises .             NWS WFOs will be notified of training exercises in advance by the official government source. WFO management shall periodically review these instructions with all employees who might have to broadcast the warning.             USE OF NWR-SAME CODES AND 1050 HZ TONE ALARM                     Initial broadcasts of certain warnings and watches for the NWR service area shall be preceded by the NWR-SAME codes and the 1050 Hz warning alarm tones, as indicated below. Other watches, warnings, and certain related follow-up statements may be preceded by the codes and alarms, at regional option, as indicated below. Note that a future goal is to apply the NWR-SAME code to other broadcast messages, with this appendix updated accordingly.              Use of     NWR-SAME  NWR-SAME &     EVENT: Weather-Related   Code 1050 Hz               Tornado Watch TOA Yes     Tornado Warning TOR Yes     Severe Thunderstorm Watch SVA Yes     Severe Thunderstorm Warning SVR Yes     Severe Weather Statement SVS RH Option     Flash Flood Watch FFA RH Option     Flash Flood Warning FFW Yes     Flash Flood Statement FFS RH Option     Flood Watch FLA RH Option     Flood Warning FLW RH Option     Flood Statement FLS RH Option     Winter Storm Watch WSA No     Winter Storm Warning WSW RH Option     Blizzard Warning BZW RH Option     High Wind/Dust Storm Watch HWA No     High Wind/Dust Storm Warning HWW RH Option     Hurricane/Trop.

Many new NWR-SAME/EAS codes, particularly for non-weather-related events, are also being considered for authorization by the Federal Communications Commission, as mentioned above.     FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION     AUTHORIZATION FOR NWR REBROADCAST                     April 3, 1978             REBROADCAST OF NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE TRANSMISSIONS ALLOWED                     The commission has authorized AM, FM, and TV broadcast stations to rebroadcast weather transmissions originated by the National Weather Service on the 162.400, 162.475, and 162.550 MHz frequencies.             The action becomes effective immediately.             The Commission put four conditions on this authority:             -- Messages must be rebroadcast within one hour of receipt from the National Weather Service;             -- If commercials are aired in connection with a weather rebroadcast, they must not convey an endorsement by the Government of products or services advertised;             -- Credit must be given to indicate the messages originated with the National Weather Service; and             -- A station may not rebroadcast the transmissions of a Personal Radio Services station.             The FCC noted that when the Emergency Broadcast System (EBS) and the EBS two-tone attention signal were used in conjunction with a weather emergency, operations must be conducted in accordance with section 73.935 of the rules (below) and the local or state EBS operational plans in effect for the area. It stressed emergency plans would take precedence over any monitoring and rebroadcasting conducted under the new authority.             Update notes:             (1) There are four additional frequencies for NOAA Weather Radio transmissions: 162.425 MHz, 162.450 MHz, and 162.525 MHz.             (2) The Emergency Alert System (EAS) replaced the Emergency Broadcast System (EBS).             (3) An updated Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) section 11.55 (shown on page G-2) replaces CFR section 73.935.             (4) An updated CFR section 73.1207 is on page G-3.                                  §  11.55 EAS operation during a State or Local Area emergency.                (a) The EAS may be activated at the State or Local Area levels by broadcast stations and cable systems at their discretion for day-to-day emergency situations posing a threat to life and property. Examples of natural emergencies which may warrant activation are: tornadoes, floods, hurricanes, earthquakes, heavy snows, icing conditions, widespread       fires, etc. Man-made emergencies may include: toxic gas leaks or liquid spills, widespread power failures, industrial explosions, and civil disorders.      (b) EAS operations must be conducted as specified in State and Local Area EAS Plans. The plans must list all authorized entities participating in the State or Local Area EAS.      (c) Immediately upon receipt of a State or Local Area EAS message, participating broadcast stations and cable systems must do the following:      (1) State Relay (SR) sources monitor the State Relay Network or follow the State EAS plan for instructions from the State Primary (SP) source.      (2) Local Primary (LP) sources monitor the Local Area SR sources or follow the State EAS plan for instructions.                (3) Participating National (PN) and Non-participating National (NN) sources monitor the Local Area LP sources for instructions.      (4) Broadcast stations and cable systems participating in the State or Local Area EAS must discontinue normal programming and follow the procedures in the State and Local Area Plans. Television stations must comply with Sec. 11.54(b)(7). Broadcast stations providing foreign language programming shall comply with Sec. 11.54(b)(8).      (5) Upon completion of the State or Local Area EAS transmission procedures, resume normal programming until receipt of the cue from the SR or LP sources in your Local Area. At that time begin transmitting the common emergency message received from the above sources.      (6) Resume normal operations upon conclusion of the message.      (7) The times of the above EAS actions must be entered in the       broadcast station or cable system records as specified in       Sec. 11.54(b)(15), FCC Form 201 may be used to report EAS activations.      (8) Use of the EAS codes or Attention Signal automatically grants rebroadcast authority as specified in Sec. 11.54(d).                                                   § 73.1207 Rebroadcasts.                (a) The term rebroadcast means reception by radio of the programs or other transmissions of a broadcast or any other type of radio station, and the simultaneous or subsequent retransmission of such programs or transmissions by a broadcast station.      (1) As used in this section, ``program'' includes any complete programs or part thereof.      (2) The transmission of a program from its point of origin to a broadcast station entirely by common carrier facilities, whether by wire line or radio, is not considered a rebroadcast.      (3) The broadcasting of a program relayed by a remote pickup       broadcast station is not considered a rebroadcast.      (b) No broadcast station may retransmit the program, or any part thereof, of another U.S. broadcast station without the express authority of the originating station. A copy of the written consent of the licensee originating the program must be kept by the licensee of the station retransmitting such program and made available to the FCC upon request.      (1) Stations originating emergency communications under a State EAS plan are considered to have conferred rebroadcast authority to other participating stations.      (2) Permission must be obtained from the originating station to rebroadcast any subsidiary communications transmitted by means of a multiplex subcarrier or telecommunications service on the vertical blanking interval or in the visual signal of a television signal.      (3) Programs originated by the Voice of America (VOA) and the Armed Forces Radio and Television Services (AFRTS) cannot, in general, be cleared for domestic rebroadcast, and may therefore be retransmitted only by special arrangements among the parties concerned.      (4) Except as otherwise provided by international agreement,       programs originated by foreign broadcast stations may be retransmitted without the consent of the originating station.      (c) The transmissions of non-broadcast stations may be rebroadcast under the following conditions:      (1) Messages originated by privately-owned non-broadcast stations other than those in the Amateur and Citizens Band (CB) Radio Services may be broadcast only upon receipt of prior permission from the non-broadcast licensee. Additionally, messages transmitted by common carrier stations may be rebroadcast only upon prior permission of the originator       of the message as well as the station licensee.      (2) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, messages originated entirely by non-broadcast stations owned and operated by the Federal Government may be rebroadcast only upon receipt of prior permission from the government agency originating the messages.      (3) Messages originated by stations in the amateur and Citizens Band (CB) radio services may be rebroadcast at the discretion of broadcast station licensees.      (4) Emergency communications originated under a State EAS plan.      (d) The rebroadcasting of time signals originated by the Naval       Observatory and the National Bureau of Standards and messages from the National Weather Service stations is permitted without specific authorization under the following procedures:      (1) Naval Observatory Time Signals. (I) The time signals rebroadcast must be obtained by direct radio reception from a naval radio station, or by land line circuits.                (ii) Announcement of the time signal must be made without reference to any commercial activity.      (iii) Identification of the Naval Observatory as the source of the time signal must be made by an announcement, substantially as follows: ``With the signal, the time will be . . . courtesy of the U.S. Naval Observatory.''      (iv) Schedules of time signal broadcasts may be obtained upon       request from the Superintendent, U.S. Naval Observatory, Washington, DC 20390.      (2) National Bureau of Standards Time Signals. (I) Time signals for rebroadcast must be obtained by direct radio reception from a National Bureau of Standards (NBS) station.      (ii) Use of receiving and rebroadcasting equipment must not delay the signals by more than 0.05 second.      (iii) Signals must be rebroadcast live, not from tape or other recording.      (iv) Voice or code announcements of the call signs of NBS stations are not to be rebroadcast.      (v) Identification of the origin of the service and the source of the signals must be made by an announcement substantially as follows:       ``At the tone, 11 hours 25 minutes Coordinated Universal Time. This is a rebroadcast of a continuous service furnished by the National Bureau of Standards, Ft. Collins, Colo.'' No commercial sponsorship of this announcement is permitted and none may be implied.      (vi) Schedules of time signal broadcasts may be obtained from, and notice of use of NBS time signals for rebroadcast must be forwarded semiannually to: National Bureau of Standards, Radio Stations WWV/WWVB, 2000 East County Road 58, Ft. Collins, Colorado 80524.      (vii) In the rebroadcasting of NBS time signals, announcements will not state that they are standard frequency transmissions. Voice announcements of Coordinated Universal Time are given in voice every minute. Each minute, except the first of the hour, begins with an 0.8 second long tone of 1000 hertz at WWV and 1200 hertz tone at WWVH. The first minute of every hour begins with an 0.8 second long tone of 1500 hertz at both stations. This tone is followed by a 3-second pause, than the announcement, ``National Bureau of Standards Time.'' This is followed by another 3-second pause before station identification. This arrangement allows broadcast stations sufficient time to retransmit the hour time tone and the words ``National Bureau of Standards Time''either by manual or automatic switching.      (viii) Time signals or scales made up from integration of standard frequency signals broadcast from NBS stations may not be designated as national standard scales of time or attributed to the NBS as originator. For example, if a broadcasting station transmits time signals obtained from a studio clock which is periodically calibrated against the NBS time signals from WWV or WWVH, such signals may not be announced as NBS standard time or as having been originated by the NBS.      (3) National Weather Service Messages. (I) Messages of the National Weather Service must be rebroadcast within 1 hour of receipt.      (ii) If advertisements are given in connection with weather       rebroadcast, these advertisements must not directly or indirectly convey an endorsement by the U.S. Government of the products or services so advertised.      (iii) Credit must be given to indicate that the rebroadcast message originates with the National Weather Service.                  NWR REMOTE OFF-AIR MONITORING SYSTEM (ROAMS)                     Purpose : The purpose of this appendix is to describe the monitoring capabilities of the ROAMS and the actions WFO personnel should take in response to ROAMS messages to facilitate timely NWR transmitter network maintenance.             ROAMS Operation : ROAMS is designed to monitor and report on the failure status of several transmitter parameters/applications. Among the parameters/applications monitored by ROAMS are:     (1) primary transmitter AC power, (2) secondary transmitter AC power, (3) primary transmitter low broadcast power, (4) secondary transmitter low broadcast power , (5) program audio feed (signal at input to transmitter), (6) proper transmission of NWR-SAME messages from the transmitters, (7) transmitter radio frequency (RF) carrier output, and (8) lack of broadcast audio output. Additional parameters/applications (e.g., shelter temperature) may be added to this list at the discretion of the regions.             Response to ROAMS Calls : If ROAMS calls the site on an administrative telephone line, the operator should log the date and time of the call, the ROAMS ID, and the fault number(s) reported. A command to acknowledge the report should be sent following the report. Instructions on the remote operation of ROAMS are provided to each WFO that is programmed to receive these calls.             The ROAMS fault numbers and the required actions are listed in Table 1.             Response to ROAMS Fault Report on the NWR System : If ROAMS calls the NWR system, ROAMS will alert the operator through the Alert Message window. Each ROAMS telephone call will be reported with the transmitter ID in the Alert Message window without detailed alarm status. The operator should then use the ROAMS Data window under the Transmitters menu to check the detailed alarm status. Response to ROAMS status should be as listed in Table 1.                          Table 1                           ROAMS Fault ID*              Fault        Description              Follow-Up         Action              Whom to         Notify                 Input Power         Alarm       AC Power Failure to #1 Transmitter and System Power       If not equipped for automatic switch-over, switch to backup transmitter if available       Transmitter Site Power point of contact (POC)                 Alarm #1       Transmitter #1 output power is low        Same as for Input Power Alarm       Transmitter Technician                 Alarm #2       Transmitter #2 output power is low        Same as for Input Power Alarm       Transmitter Technician                 Alarm #3       AC Power Failure to #2 Transmitter       Same as for Input Power Alarm       Transmitter Site Power POC                 SAME        Alarm #8       Indicates bad SAME message       Retransmit SAME message to determine if bad messages persist       If bad messages persist, National ROAMS Control/ Monitoring point and local office technical staff as necessary                 Alarm #9       No broadcast audio       Response for last three alarms listed:               (a) Use ROAMS to check transmitter input audio                                                              If audio level acceptable, then (b); else (c)                 Alarm #10       No RF carrier from transmitter                                  (b) Use ROAMS to check broadcast audio       If audio level is acceptable, then problem has cleared; else Transmitter Technician                 Input Audio Alarm       Audio telephone feed has dropped below level to keep transmitter keyed       (c) Monitor console audio       If console level is acceptable, then Telecommunications        POC; else CRS technician                      * Note: Additional faults selected for monitoring should be coordinated at both regional and NWR Program Office levels.             Points of Contact : Table 1 shall be included in the station manual with telephone numbers for the five points of contact identified in the table.             Action Report : If maintenance action is required for any equipment as the result of a ROAMS report, an Engineering Management Reporting System report should be opened."

Purpose.  This chapter outlines National Weather Service (NWS) policy for obtaining special observations in support of various warning programs. It also provides the procedures an office should follow to request these observations.              2.  Aircraft Observations . Aircraft reconnaissance observations are provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Research Facilities Center (RFC) and the U.S. Air Force. Those offices that may request aircraft reconnaissance and the procedures they should use are given in the  National Hurricane Operations Plan and the National East Coast Winter Storms Operations Plan.              3.  Satellite Observations.  Special satellite observations are available through the Satellite Field Service Stations (SFSS) of the National Environmental Satellite Service (NESS). The National Severe Storms Forecast Center (NSSFC) receives special support from SFSS Kansas City. The National Hurricane Center (NHC), Eastern Pacific Hurricane Center (EPHC), and Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC) are supported by SFSS's Miami, San Francisco, and Honolulu, respectively.              The SFSS's provide special sectors to cover the storm areas of concern to these centers. WSFO's (Weather Service Forecast Office) may receive the special sectors by telephone request to the supporting SFSS.              4.  Surface Observations.  Special surface observations are available from all U.S. synoptic and aviation network stations, ships, Marine Reporting Stations (MARS), Great Lakes Coast Guard Stations, and coastal tide stations. All offices are encouraged to arrange for cooperative observations from areas in which regular coverage is sparse.              4.1  Hurricane Office Support . Surface observations in support of the hurricane warning service may be requested by any hurricane center, hurricane warning office, or weather service office while performing a hurricane warning function. This includes both tropical and subtropical storms.              4.1.1  Land Observations.  The forecaster will specify, depending on the capability of the office, whether aviation or synoptic observations are required. The Federal Meteorological Handbook No. 1 (FMH-l), Surface Observations; FMH-2, Synoptic Observations; and Weather Service Operations Manual (WSOM) Chapter E-41 give the observing procedures to be followed. In the synoptic observations the forecaster must specifically request tide height, sea, swell, or wind fluctuations.                  a.  MARS . Forecasters will make their requests for additional and special MARS observations through the appropriate Coast Guard (CG) District Headquarters as follows.                                                 First Coast Guard District                                    Maine to Rhode Island                                            Third Coast Guard District                                    Connecticut to Delaware                                            Fifth Coast Guard District                                    Maryland to North Carolina                                            Seventh Coast Guard District                                    South Carolina to Florida (east of 85 o W)                                            Eighth Coast Guard District                                    Florida (west of 85 o W) to Mexico                                            Eleventh Coast Guard District                                    Santa Maria River to Mexico                                            Twelfth Coast Guard District                                    Oregon Border to Santa Maria River                                            Thirteenth Coast Guard District                                   Washington to California                                The locations of stations in this program are given in WSOM Chapter B-16.              b.  Transmission of Observations . One of the following methods of transmission will be used where available, otherwise the observation will be telephoned to the requesting office.                  a. National Distribution Circuit (NDC)/State Distribution Circuit (SDC) (these are the main circuits used with the Automation of Field Operation & Services (AFOS) System)         b. RAWARC         c. 7072         d. Service A or C as appropriate, in first open period         e. West Coast Marine Circuit         f. NOAA Weather Wire         g. Any other telecommunications system that would be available at the requesting office.              4.1.2  Ship Observations . During the hurricane season the NWS makes requests for special ship observations from the Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean, North Atlantic waters west of 35EW, and North Pacific waters east of 180E W. Observations can be requested at 1-, 2-, or 3-hourly intervals as required.              a.  Atlantic and Pacific Merchant Vessel Reporting Program.  The CG (Coast Guard) Rescue Coordination Centers (RCC) New York, New York, and San Francisco, California, operate the Automated Merchant Vessel Reporting Program (AMVER). When no or only a few observations are received from a storm area, the Hurricane Center responsible for issuing marine advisories may ask their local CG station to send a message addressed to ""AMVER, NEW YORK, NY,"" or ""AMVER, SAN FRANCISCO, CA,"" as appropriate, requesting a list of ships, with their radio call signs, that are underway in the storm area.

To speed delivery of messages from storm areas and to identify them as such, the word ""STORM"" should appear immediately following the radio address.                  b.  Method of Requesting Observations.  Requests to ships are broadcast by radio shore stations operated by the Radio Corporation of America (RCA), TRT Telecommunications Corp., American Telephone and Telegraph Co. (AT&T), ITT World Communications, Inc., Mobile Radio (WLO), and the U.S. Coast Guard. In Puerto Rico, requests are made through facilities operated by the CG at San Juan, the Cable and Wireless Ltd. at Barbados, the French Government of Martinique, and the Netherlands Antilles Government of Curacao.              Requests for special ship weather reports should be sent to the NWS office located near the radio shore station, for relay to the radio shore station, or should be sent directly to the radio shore station(s) if there is no nearby NWS office. The NWS offices and/or radio shore stations to be contacted can be determined from exhibit B-90-1.                  c.  Requests Transmitted by Radio Station NMR, San Juan PR . NHC requests for special ship observations transmitted by Radio Station NMR will be sent to Airway Observer, San Juan, Puerto Rico, via Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) radio teletypewriter (RTT) circuit.                  d.

Requests Via Marine Broadcasts.  Whenever radio shore stations have been asked to make direct calls to ships for special reports, the hurricane warning office (HWO) or center initiating the action will also arrange for including similar requests in the warning section of the marine broadcasts. The office concerned should forward its requests via the NDC/ SDC, teletypewriter, telegraph, telephone, or radio in order to reach the WSFO preparing material for the marine broadcasts at least 2 hours prior to the starting time of the broadcasts. The office originating the request, the radio station(s) making the broadcast, and the broadcast schedule for the marine broadcasts are shown in exhibit B-90-2.              In addition, WSFO San Francisco will arrange with the USCG Communications Station San Francisco and WSFO Honolulu will coordinate with the U.S. CG Communications Station, Honolulu, for inclusion of requests for special ship observations in the NMC Point Reyes and NMO Honolulu, General Weather Broadcasts as indicated in exhibit B-90-2.                  f.  Example of Request in Marine Broadcast.  If requests are worded in accordance with the example below, they will require little, if any, editing by marine forecast units.

Duration of Request . Each request for special ship observations will be confined to a period not to exceed the ensuing 24 hours. The hurricane warning office (HWO) or hurricane center concerned will renew its request every 24 hours thereafter, or more often, when the geographical area in the preceding request requires modification. On occasions when responsibility for issuing advisories is transferred from one office to another, the latter office will continue to renew the requests for special ship observations under the same conditions as indicated above, as long as the storm is in progress overwater or until it moves inland over the United States, Mexico, or Canada.                                                       North Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, and Caribbean Waters                                                                                                                                              Starting                         Message to be                                            Office                                   To be included in                                   Schedules of                                   addressed via                                            Originating Request                                    broadcasts from                                   Broadcasts                                   TT or RTT To:                                            #NHC, Miami, FL                  NSS Annapolis, MD.                                                                              #WSFO, New Orleans,LA/HWO                                    NAR Key West, FL.                                    0030, 0630Z                                KWBC                                            #WSFO, San Juan, PR/HWO                                    NAM Norfolk, VA.                                   1230, 1900Z                                Washington,DC                                            #WSFO, Boston, MA/HWO                                    NSS Londonderry, N.Ire.                                                                                         #WSFO, Washington, DC|HWO                                    NRK Reykjavik, Iceland                                                                                                                            GXH Thurso, Scotland                                                                                                                            AOK Rota, Spain                                                                                        North Pacific Waters, West of Central America and Mexico                                            WSFO, San Francisco,                                    KFS, San Francisco,                                             0420, 1620                                            CA/EPHC                                   CA (Marine)                                            2300Z                                                                               KOK, Los Angeles,                                             0450, 1650Z KSFO                                            WSFO, Honolulu,                                   CA (Marine)                                            San Francisco,                                            HI/CPHC                                   NMQ, Long Beach                                   0420, 1720Z                                CA                                                                               CA (Marine)                                                                                                                           NMC, San Francisco,                                             0030, 0630                                                                               CA (Marine)                                            1900, 2100Z                                            North Pacific Waters, Adjacent to Hawaiian Islands                           WSFO, Honolulu, HI/CPHC                                                                                                                                                              NMO, Honolulu, HI 0500, 2000Z                                            #All broadcasts keyed simultaneously from Northern Ireland                                Exhibit B-90-2:  Schedule of Radiotelegraph High Seas Marine Broadcasts Containing Requests for Special Ship Weather Observations                      Offices preparing marine broadcasts will include the same request for observations in each succeeding broadcast during the ensuing 24 hours, unless superseded by a new request.              4.1.3  Requests by Navy Fleet Weather Central in the Pacific . Occasionally, U.S. Navy Fleet Weather Centrals in the Pacific area may originate requests for special reports from ships in the vicinity of the storm. There is no objection to this arrangement provided the special reports are requested only from Military Sea Lift Command (MSC) and other government vessels that employ government communications for relaying their messages. If the request involves message tolls to be paid by the NWS, such requests should be coordinated with the CPHC or EPHC before broadcast.              4.1.4  Special Radio Reports on Overtime . The NWS has arranged with a number of the U.S. registry vessels, which have a single radio operator, to transmit to ""OBS METEO WASHDC"" 1200Z weather reports from eastern Pacific waters. The radio operator is paid overtime by the NWS for transmitting these reports. A current list of the ships authorized overtime, together with their radio call signs, is supplied to NHC, EPHC, CPHC, and the HWO's.              4.1.5  Request for Hourly Reports . In the event any of the ships listed for overtime reports are in a storm area and special reports are needed at hourly intervals during the day or night, the HWO responsible for issuance of the advisories should dispatch individual messages to each vessel. These messages will be sent via government or commercial radio stating the times at which special radio reports are required.              4.1.6  Time for Filing Messages . Individual messages requesting special nighttime or early morning reports should be filed early to allow their receipt before the radio officer completes his watch (8 a.m. to 8 p.m. local time).              4.1.7  Message to Individual Vessels . Individual messages maybe sent to vessels other than overtime contract ships in the storm area, whether U.S. or foreign registry, at the discretion of the forecaster. Messages addressed to individual U.S. ships, other than overtime contract ships, may have the following statement added to their request: RADIO OPERATOR OVERTIME PAY AUTHORIZED IF NECESSARY.              4.1.8  Verification of Suspected Data . Whenever the HWO responsible for issuing formal advisories notes that ""LaLaLa,"" ""LoLoLo,"" ""PPP,"" or other important data appear to be in error, the office entering the reports on Service C, circuit 7072 or the SDC/NDC should be asked to send a service message to the radio shore station requesting the ship to verify the questioned data. However, the office should first ascertain that such errors are not merely transposition of code figures in the message; e.g., LaLaLacoded as 271 instead 217.              4.1.9  Distribution of Ship Observations.  When radio shore stations receive special ship observations, they utilize a number of methods in relaying these reports to the NWS. These methods include Timed Wire Service (TWX), AFOS external users circuits, telephone, RAWARC, and direct teletypewriter links to NWS offices. The NWS office which originally receives the observation is responsible for relaying it to all possible users according to the following:                  a.  Camp Springs, Communications Branch . All messages addressed ""OBS METEO,"" or observations preceded by the word ""STORM"" from the Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean, and North Atlantic waters will be promptly placed on circuit 7072 and the NDC/SDC. In addition, they will feed into the computer along with other ship reports for later readouts in summary form on Service C, Service O, and the NDC. Messages of interest to San Francisco and Honolulu will also be relayed via circuits GD60138 and GF10211, respectively, until these stations are placed on the NDC. All 0000, 0600, 1200, and 1800Z ""OBSMETEO WASHDC"" ship weather messages will be entered by the Suitland Communications Branch via the WMSC, 7072, and the NDC.                  b.  Pacific Offices.  Observations needed by EPHC San Francisco are addressed to ""OBS METEO WASHDC"" and relayed to Suitland through San Francisco. These observations are returned to San Francisco via circuit GD60138 and Services C and O until San Francisco becomes a node on the NDC. Observations needed by CPHC Honolulu are addressed to ""OBS METEO HONOLULU"" and sent directly to Suitland via the NWS cable and land lines. Suitland returns them to Honolulu via circuit GF10211 and to San Francisco via circuit 23401 and Services C and O until these stations are included on the NDC.              4.1.10  Weather Observations from Environmental Data Buoys . System maintenance, calibration, and final data quality verification are under the technical control of the NOAA Data Buoy Office and its supporting contractors. Requests for system status and schedule information should be directed to the NOAA Data Buoy Office in Mississippi.              NHC, HWO, and Storm Coordination Center (SCC) requests for special or more frequent interrogations during critical storm periods will be accommodated by phone requests to the Miami Radio Station Duty Officer, telephone (305) 233-2743 or FTS 350-4750. The start and stop time for special hourly reports should be given and limited to 12 consecutive hours of operation unless an emergency exists. In this case, consultation should be made with the NOAA Data Buoy Office.              4.1.11  Radar Observations.  Special radar observations may be requested in accordance with FMH-7, Weather Radar Observations and Chapter B-50.              4.2  Support to Other Offices . Any NWS office may request extra observations from any office in the surface observational network in order to carry out its warning responsibilities. All offices are also encouraged to establish cooperative observation networks in data sparse regions of their warning area for use in potential or actual warning situations.              NWS offices which normally close during the night may be requested by the WSFO to remain open to make and transmit additional surface observations. Overtime, paid or compensatory, in accordance with the provisions of  NOAA Personnel Handbook and subsequent directives updating these provisions, is authorized when necessary to fulfill a station's warning responsibility. Requests from offices outside a given forecast area for extra hours of operation at stations within the forecast area should be coordinated through the responsible WSFO and not with the individual station.              4.2.1  Coastal Flood Warning Service Observations.  Coastal offices have arranged for cooperative tide observations from stations of the Tide Height Reporting Network during potential or actual warning situations. NWS offices should initiate calls to cooperative tide stations for observations whenever needed. Supplemental observations should be input to the NDC/SDC, RAWARC, or phoned to the appropriate WSFO.              The NWS offices equipped with tide recorders from National Ocean Survey (NOS) tide gages and the tide gage from which they receive their information are indicated in the Operations of the National Weather Service and exhibit B-90-3.              4.2.2  Flash Flood Warning Observations . NWS offices should request special observations from their river and rainfall observers whenever the potential for flash flood producing precipitation exists. Reporting instructions are contained in WSOM E-41. Some observers have instructions to report as soon as certain criteria are met. Instructions for special radar observations can be found in WSOM Chapter E-13, Flash Flood Program.              4.2.3  Ship Observations.  Any WSFO with coastal waters or high seas forecast responsibility may obtain special ship reports by following the procedures given in subsections 4.1.2 to 4.1.9.

Upper-air stations may make special observations into the eye of a hurricane on their own initiative.              5.1.1  Special Observations from Weather Service Land Stations . All requests for special rawinsonde or winds-aloft observations during tropical storm situations should be routed through the appropriate hurricane center, including requests from the National Meteorological Center (NMC), NSSFC, and the National Hurricane and Experimental Meteorology Lab (NHEML). The hurricane center will relay the final instructions to rawinsonde stations so maximum use is being made of the special reports. The hurricane center should always specify whether complete runs or only winds-aloft observations are required and the height to be reached. Special runs should be requested for the usual intermediate synoptic times of 06 to 18 GMT insofar as possible. Also, requests should be placed 6 hours in advance of taking the observation. The hurricane center will advise its regional headquarters Data Acquisition Division (DATAC) personnel of actions taken. For pibals, only a copy of the request needs to be sent to the station involved and its regional headquarters.              Pacific area officials in charge are authorized to make special rawinsonde observations, up to a frequency of one observation each 6 hours, whenever the center of a tropical storm or typhoon is suspected to be within 300 nautical miles of their station; whenever local conditions indicate that a tropical storm is developing in the vicinity of the station; or as requested by a center.              5.1.2  Special Upper-Air Observations from a Foreign Meteorological Service . When feasible, requests for special observations from cooperative upper-air stations operated by foreign meteorological services will be placed by NHC through the director of the foreign meteorological service concerned or his authorized representative. When time does not permit prior coordination, requests may be made directly to the foreign upper-air station when such action has been authorized.              5.1.3  Special Observations from Ocean Station Vessel HOTEL (C7H).  Requests for special upper-air observations from Ocean Station Vessel HOTEL in the Eastern Region Ocean Weather (ROW) project, either on station or enroute, will be made through the marine forecaster, WSFO Washington. The request should include the desired frequency of additional observations and for how long a period they are required.              5.1.4  Calling Out Ocean Station Vessel C7H.  During June and July when C7H has yard period, the ship can be called out and be on station in 48 hours. When the NHC determines that C7H is necessary for the forecasting of a tropical cyclone, the Director or his Deputy will so notify the Warnings Program Leader (W112x3). The Warnings Program Leader will call the U.S. Coast Guard and request that C7H return to station,              5.2  Severe Local Storms Support . NSSFC and any WSFO are authorized to request special upper-air observations from any NWS upper-air station within its area of responsibility, but requests must be coordinated through NSSFC. Each office's regional headquarters DATAC Division must be advised of all requests. NSSFC will consolidate requests with their own requirements and advise field stations via RAWARC, phone, or an administrative message on the NDC/SDC. The special upper-air observation should be sent back to NSSFC or the requesting WSFO via RAWARC, telephone, or as an addressed special observation on the NDC/SDC. The authority to request a special observation rests with the meteorologist in charge of the requesting office or, in his absence, the senior forecaster on duty. The request may be complete rawinsonde, a rawin, or a pibal observation. NSSFC requires runs to be evaluated up to 400 mbs.              5.2.1  NSSFC.  Whenever there is a possibility of severe weather developing anywhere in the contiguous United States, NSSFC is authorized to request special upper-air observations from any NWS upper-air station.              5.2.2  Weather Service Forecast Offices.  These offices are authorized to request special upper-air observations for a severe weather situation whenever NSSFC has not requested them and such requests would assist in the preparation of their forecasts, but such requests must be coordinated through NSSFC.              5.2.3  Upper-Air Station . Upon receipt of such a request, the upper air station involved should make every effort to accomplish the special observation. Necessary overtime is authorized. Do not report these specials on WS Form A-22.              5.2.4  Limit on Specials.  Each region is limited to a total of no more than 200 special rawins and/or rawinsondes per year. However, should additional flights be desired Weather Service Headquarters' authorization may be requested. No limit is set on special pibal observations.              5.2.5  Requests by Air Weather Service.  Special rawinsondes requested by the Air Weather Service are authorized on a reimbursable basis but specific regional headquarters' (DATAC) approval is required. NSSFC should receive a copy of any special rawinsonde request made by the Air Weather Service.              5.3  Support to Other NWS Offices . WSFO's are authorized to request special upper-air observations directly from upper-air stations whenever such observations will assist in making timely forecasts for any of the WSFO's programs. The authorization is normally limited to nearby upper-air stations. The requests should be made in sufficient time to allow any necessary rescheduling of shifts except in an emergency. Stations should be given a minimum of 6 hours' notice, Also, as soon as possible, regional headquarters DATAC should be advised of requests made.              6.  Tsunami Warning System Observations.  Tsunami warning centers have arranged for seismic and tide observations from selected NWS offices and cooperating stations participating in the Tsunami Warning System. Warning centers will initiate calls to cooperative stations for data whenever needed (exhibit B-90-4 indicates Weather Service Offices WSO's supplying tide data to the tsunami warning center).              NWS offices which normally close at night may be requested to remain open to make and transmit observations. Overtime provisions are as stated in subsection 4.2.

NOAA Weather Radio stations broadcast the latest             weather information and are one of the primary means for receiving severe weather             information and general forecast information. Weather radios can be purchased from local             electric supply dealers, and some scanners are equipped to pick up the weather radio             frequencies.                             Some models have an alarm feature. This feature sounds a tone and turns on the radio when             we activate the tone alert from our office. We activate the tone alert for the following             watches or warnings:                                  Tornado watch                   Tornado warning                   Severe thunderstorm watch                   Severe thunderstorm warning                   Flash flood warning                               If the following weather situations evolve quickly, the             following warnings or statements may also be ""toned"".

GX051-48-16471792	"AUTOMATED BROADCASTS ON NOAA WEATHER RADIO:  A CENTRAL ILLINOIS LISTENER SURVEY         Christopher W. Geelhart, Kirk M. Huettl, and Christopher J. Miller  National Weather Service Office  Central, Illinois (Lincoln)         INTRODUCTION    The National Weather Service (NWS) has deployed the Console Replacement System (CRS), to operate the NOAA Weather Radio (NWR) system. The CRS is equipped with synthesized voice capability, for immediate broadcast of forecasts, warnings, and observations.    Each Weather Forecast Office (WFO) is required to periodically conduct listener surveys, as part of the quality control process of NWR. It is recommended that this be done at least every two years.    The last listener survey conducted by WFO Central Illinois (ILX) was in the Fall of 1996. The next survey, which normally would have been conducted in 1998, was postponed until the CRS was fully deployed at ILX. This would allow listeners to provide input about the new synthesized voice system.    USE OF THE CRS IN CENTRAL ILLINOIS    The CRS was deployed at WFO ILX in May 1998. The system was configured for local use during the Summer of 1998, with most routine broadcasts utilizing the old AMPRO tape system. Routine use of CRS (in manual mode) began in August 1998.    In November 1998, the hourly weather roundup was the first product to be automated. Other products were gradually added through the winter and spring. Routine automation was completed in June 1999, with the zone forecast product being automatically generated. Severe weather products, as well as winter and non-precipitation advisories and warnings, were manually recorded during this time.    METHODS OF REACHING NWR LISTENERS    An announcement was broadcast on each of the ILX NWR stations (WXJ-71 in Peoria, WXJ-75 in Springfield, WXJ-76 in Champaign) for approximately two weeks. Listeners were asked to either send a letter or postcard, or call the office to request a survey. An online version was also posted on the ILX Internet homepage. A copy of the survey can be found in Appendix A.    We had a significant increase in participation in this year's survey. The 1996 survey had 188 participants, including 12 through the Internet version. In 1999, 428 surveys were completed, 237 of which were done on the ILX Internet. Nearly every mailed survey was returned. The increase in participation could possibly be traced to any number of factors, including the initiation of automated broadcasts, the opportunity to call the office and request a survey (instead of mailing the request), and the explosion of Internet usage over recent years.    QUESTION FORMAT    The 1999 ILX survey featured ten questions. The first few are standard questions, including strength of signal, perception of our severe weather coverage, whether their receiver has an alarm feature, and if the alarm is used. Figure 1 shows a map of each NWR listening area, and how listeners perceived the quality of the signal.       Figure 1. WFO Lincoln, Illinois (ILX) Weather Radio Coverage Area.    Six questions addressed the CRS and automated broadcasts. A short introduction was given, to explain the reasoning for switching to automated broadcasts. These were:        Preference of voice type. ILX uses the three voices approved by Weather   Service Headquarters. Names for each voice were the ones given by DEC-Talk,   creators of the synthesized voice. These are: Harry (""deep male""   voice), Paul (""standard male""), and Frank (""older male"").   The question also referenced which products use which voices.        Clarity of the voices. Listeners were asked if the voices are usually   understandable, somewhat understandable, or usually not understandable.        Listeners were asked to list any words they thought the voices had   a hard time pronouncing.        Timeliness of broadcasts. Since faster updates were promoted as one   of the reasons for CRS implementation, listeners were asked to rank the   timeliness as improved, same, or worse.        Automated ""critical"" products. There has been concern in   many areas, about using the synthesized voice for severe weather products.   Listeners were asked how they would react if ILX were to implement automated   severe weather products. They could say they would react the same as now,   switch to commercial radio/TV or the Internet, or they would be less likely   to react.        Listeners were given space for additional comments.     RESULTS        Listener locations (Figure 2): Forty-four percent listed to   WXJ-71 (Peoria); 32 percent listened to WXJ-75 (Springfield); and 24 percent   listened to WXJ-76 (Champaign).          Figure 2. Locations of the listeners of NOAA Weather Radio for WFO Lincoln, IL (KILX) grouped by transmitter.        When asked about an alarm feature, 56 percent of the listeners said   their receivers have an alarm feature. Of those, 77 percent of them use   the alarm feature. When asked why they didn't, most said they get information   off commercial radio/TV, or the Internet.        For severe weather coverage, 49 percent ranked our coverage   as excellent; 43 percent as good; 5 percent as fair; and 3 percent as poor   (Figure 3).          Figure 3. Rankings of NOAA Weather Radio Severe Weather coverage for WFO Lincoln, IL (KILX).        The majority of listeners do not have a ""favorite"" voice   type. As shown in Figure 4, 45 percent said they had no preference; 24   percent couldn't tell the difference between them; 12 percent prefer Paul   (""standard male""); 12 percent prefer Harry (""deep male"");   and 7 percent prefer Frank (""older male"").          Figure 4. Rankings of Console Replacement System (CRS) synthesized voice preference for WFO Lincoln, IL (KILX).        Most listeners felt the voices are understandable (Figure 5.) Eighty-two   percent ranked them as ""usually understandable"", followed by   15 percent as ""sometimes understandable"", and 3 percent as ""usually   not understandable"".            Figure 5. Survey responses of the understandability/clarity of the automated voices used on the WFO Lincoln, IL (KILX) CRS.        About a third of the listeners gave examples of words that are hard   to distinguish. These included town names, ""yesterday"", and numbers   (especially teens and in the 40 to 60 range). Many also commented about   how some words are not distinguishable at times, including those with ""s"",   ""th"", ""n"", and ""f"" sounds.    Most people were satisfied with the timeliness of updates. As indicated   in Figure 6, 54 percent said ILX has improved in this category; 42 percent   perceived no change; and 5 percent felt timeliness has worsened.        Figure 6. Survey results of the timeliness of updated products on the WFO Lincoln, IL (KILX) CRS.        Figure 7 shows how respondents expressed their feelings about automated   warnings. Fifty-eight percent said it would not change their reactions   to the warnings. Twenty-three percent said they would switch to commercial   radio/TV, or the Internet. Eighteen percent felt they would be less likely   to react to the warning.        Figure 7. Survey results of how WFO Lincoln (KILX) NOAA Weather Radio Listeners would react to automated severe weather warnings.        Many people took the opportunity to make additional comments. These   can be found in Appendix B.     SUMMARY    The listeners of the central Illinois NWR stations seem to have accepted the automation of NWR. Many have noticed an increase in timeliness of the broadcasts, which is one of the benefits of the CRS. They expressed concern about automating severe weather products, but a majority would continue to use NWR if this were the case. They also made several suggestions for improvement, which will be incorporated in NWR programming.

Please take the time to answer the following questions and return the completed survey to us by October 17, 1999. (A pre-addressed, stamped envelope is provided for your convenience.)    1.  Where are you located? From what city, town, or portion of a county do you listen to us?         2.  Please rank the strength of the signal from your location:         Strong    Good    Weak    Variable        3.  Please answer the following questions regarding your weather radio receiver.          Yes/No    Does it have an alarm feature?       Yes/No    Do you use the alarm feature?            If you answered ""No"" to part B, why not?      _____ It goes off too much.    _____ I don't know how to program it (only applies to the latest generation of radio receivers).    _____ I get my severe weather information off commercial radio/TV or the Internet.    _____ Other (please explain):    4.  How would you rank our severe weather coverage?              Excellent      Good      Fair      Poor (please explain)               Over the past year, we introduced computerized voicing for routine weather radio broadcasts. This was done to allow for more frequent and timely updates, to ease the burden of programming the multiple NWR stations we operate, to allow NWS personnel to focus on other critical tasks, and to replace 1970's-era tape equipment.    The next few questions will deal with the ""new"" NWR.    5.  We use three different voice types. ""Harry"" reads the station identification, regional synopsis, and traveler's forecast. ""Frank"" reads the climatic summary. ""Paul"" reads the hourly weather report and the forecast. Which of these is easiest to listen to?    ______ Harry    ______ Frank    ______ Paul    ______ No preference    ______ I can't tell the difference.    6.  Overall, how easily understood are the voices?    ______ Usually understandable    ______ Sometimes understandable    ______ Usually cannot understand the voices    7.  Are there any words that you think it has a hard time pronouncing?    8.  Do you feel the timeliness of updates has improved, stayed the same, or gotten worse?    ______ Improved    ______ Same    ______ Worse    9.  How would you react if the computerized voices were to be used during severe weather?        I would react the same as I do now.    I would switch to radio/TV/Internet for information.    I would be less likely to react to the warning.     10.

APPENDIX B         LISTENER COMMENTS        I guess if you had to use the artificial voice, then you had to. I   don't like it, and think it is stupid to use different tones of the same   voice. Until I read this survey, I had no idea that you thought they were   different in any way. They are not, and do not sound human. Even if they   were to sound human, they make simple mistakes, such as saying ""conditions   range from clear to clear,"" which isn't something a human would say.   If it saves you taxpayer dollars and allows you to focus on more important   issues, then go ahead.            I do not really like the computer voices. It is like automated telephone   stuff.`Course I`m an old guy and some alleged progress isn't, in my opinion.            I listen every morning between the hours of 6-8. Would be nice if all   you had in early a.m. was temp. and daily forecast. Sometimes it takes   forever to get through the traveler's forecast, hurricane update, and weather   synopsis just to get the temperature. Your early warning of severe weather   is ALWAYS several minutes ahead of local TV and radio which I appreciate.            I think that the NOAA weather radio is the best form of receiving alerts   for severe weather. I live in a rural area where it is difficult to hear   warning sirens, especially if the windows are closed, and I can't keep   my local TV station turned on 24 hours like I can with the NOAA weather   radio. I have really come to depend on the weather alerts that you broadcast.            Forecasts are fine. But during severe weather, timeliness is everything!!   Whose voice and whether computerized or live is not important. Keep up   the good work!            I have listened to WXJ-75 since the early 1980's. It is a VERY valuable   service to our region. Our thanks to all of you who make this service possible.            The fake voices are so monotonous that my wife and I quit listening   and had to run the forecast three or four times before we know what it   says. The voices are terribly boring, and have lowered my opinion of NOAA.            I would still like to hear live transmissions during severe weather   as one can never be sure if the computer system is functioning correctly   and therefore I may not be sure if severe weather reports are current enough.   Live broadcasts during severe weather would make me feel more secure, knowing   that a ""person"" is keeping up with the situation.            It seems as if statements aren't issued often during a warning. Many   times a warning is issued for 30 minutes to 1 hour, and no updates are   issued before it expires. It would be good if we could know what the storm   is doing while we are taking cover. This may help keep people inside during   the storm. Sometimes the expiration message is broadcast several minutes   after the warning has expired, and local media seem confused about what   is happening.            I must admit, I was disappointed when you began deploying the computerized   voicing on your broadcasts. But I've grown accustomed to hearing the computer   voices during the past year. Unfortunately, we hear and talk to computers   more and more all the time; the personal element of communication is gradually   disappearing.            Thank you for doing this survey. It shows that public input is considered   instead of just government big bucks dictating what is done.            Your service is much appreciated. It has become part of my morning   rituals, #1. Start the coffee! #2. Take the weather radio from the kitchen   drawer. #3. Drink coffee and listen.            I really enjoy your weather program. It informs me of everything I   need to know about what the current weather is, what the next few days   will be like, and it does a great job updating me on severe weather. Thanks.            This past spring I didn't really feel like I could depend on NOAA to   give me accurate weather updates. I live in a rural area and I really depend   on my weather radio to protect my kids and myself, because there are no   sirens out here! The coverage you provided in April of 1996 on that unforgettable   night was top notch! You guys were right on top of everything that was   happening that night! That's the kind of severe weather coverage I would   like to see come back to NOAA.            I have listened to my Radio Shack brown box weather radio for almost   25 years and it's an almost daily occurrence. I miss it when I am not at   home. I have listened to it also when there are severe weather conditions   in addition to radio or TV.            I think severe weather information should continue to be live -- the   NWS has done such a good job over the years of connecting with the public,   and employing the computerized voice would be a step backward in this regard.            The quality of the voices is getting better, or I'm getting used to   them; they still don't sound very good. Human voices are much more pleasant   to listen to, but I recognize the cost to keep humans there 24 hours a   day is very high.            LOSE the automated voice! This is the worst feature ever implemented   by NOAA!! The voice sounds about as clear as the programs that came with   sound cards on computers ten years ago!!! If NOAA can't find a better,   more clear voice program to use go back to the human system.            Overall, my listening experience has been degraded by the introduction   of ""NOAA Weather Radio 2000"". Even though the service is probably   designed to provide information in the strictest possible sense, I feel   that an intangible quality is lost in the forecasts by having a machine   read them.... The forecasts are much less user-friendly since the introduction   of this new system.            This ""generation"" of computerized voice is excellent - much   improved over the original - as you well know. Thanks for a very fine service.            When you really blow a forecast, acknowledge it and explain why. Your   credibility suffers when you predict dangerous conditions and half an hour   later have an entirely different forecast. Leaves the listeners wondering   if you know what you are talking about.            It seems ""Paul"" has improved since you first began using   computerized voicing, but I prefer Harry or Frank. I wear two hearing aids,   and that is a factor for me in deciding which I can more easily understand.            There seems to be a lot of background noise and voices, as though too   many ""mikes"" were audible to listeners, or someone ""back   there"" has a radio on!            Timeliness has always been excellent - the immediacy of the broadcasts   during severe weather is outstanding! Would like to see all local radio   and TV stations use your severe weather broadcasts as transmitted immediately   upon receipt!"

The Mississippi          River will always have its own way, no engineering skill can persuade          it to do otherwise...” In 1993, the Mississippi River and the Missouri          River provided emphatic proof of Twain’s words.  (NOAA image          of Iowa levee from the Great Flood of 1993.)         By the time          flood waters subsided in October, the Great Flood of 1993 had inundated          20 million acres in nine states, taking 50 lives and costing about $20          billion. Approximately 54,000 people were evacuated from flooded areas,          approximately 50,000 homes were destroyed or damaged and 75 towns had          been completely inundated. Some riverside communities were abandoned or          relocated to higher ground.         According          to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (as noted in the  NOAA          National Weather Service  natural disaster survey report) 40 of 229          federal levees and 1,043 of 1,347 non-federal levees were over-topped          or damaged. Every breeched levee contributed to the amount of flood water          flowing outside the main drainages. The flood eroded more than 600 billion          tons of top soil and deposited great amounts of sand and silt on valuable          farm land. In large areas inundated by the flood, the harvest of 1993          was a total loss and some farmers lost any chance for a 1994 harvest,          as well.         The entire          state of Iowa was declared a disaster area, as were portions of eight          other states: North Dakota, South Dakota,  Minnesota ,          Wisconsin, Illinois, Missouri, Nebraska and Kansas.         Flood          Timeline          Hydrologists at two  NOAA National          Weather Service River Forecast Centers  had warned that a wet fall          1992 and normal or above normal snowpack in the central United States          were setting the table for possible serious flooding when the spring thaw          hit in 1993.          Experienced          personnel at the North Central River Forecast Center in  Minneapolis ,          Minn., knew soils in the upper Mississippi River drainage basins were          too saturated to absorb much more rainfall. The same situation existed          for the Missouri River basin, which is monitored by the Missouri Basin          River Forecast Center, located at the time in  Kansas          City  prior to a move to a new office in Pleasant Hill, Mo. Heavy snowpack          in the Dakotas, Minnesota and Wisconsin, they warned, could be released          in a rush if certain weather patterns prevailed in the spring. Flood forecasters,          however, had no indication they were only months and weeks away from the          most costly and devastating flood to ravage the United States in modern          history.         “The          NOAA National Weather Service was just a few years into the modernization          that brought us new radars, satellites and other weather and hydrologic          tracking and forecasting tools, so, even though we knew there was strong          potential for continued flooding, we didn’t know the rains would          be so heavy and last for so long,” said Kenneth D. King, chief of          hydrologic services at the NOAA National Weather Service Central Region          Headquarters in Kansas City, Mo. “I think everyone was ready for          some short-term heavy rain and serious flooding, but nobody thought it          would last all summer.”         Late March          rains quickened the melting rate of snow on the ground and added volume          to the runoff in southern Minnesota and Wisconsin, feeding the headwaters          of the Mississippi River. At the same time the northern reaches of the          Missouri River were becoming saturated.         An annual          weather condition termed a Bermuda High (a high-pressure system that develops          in late spring off the southeastern U.S. coast and steers weather systems          across the eastern part of the country) had a few surprises of its own          in store for weather forecasters. The 1993 Bermuda High was of greater          intensity and moved farther to the north and west than usual. The High          formed an atmospheric dam over the Ohio River Valley and prevented storms          from following their normal course to the eastern seaboard. Instead, storms          kept re-generating over the central states, dropping record amounts of          rain on a nine-state area (North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin,          Nebraska, Iowa, Illinois, Kansas and Missouri) primed for flooding.         “I          think the two most important aspects of the flood of 1993 were its intensity          and its duration,” King said. “That made it a historic flood.          This part of the country had never seen such heavy rainfall over such          a long period of time and had never experienced such heavy flooding over          such an extended period. The magnitude and duration of flooding were almost          overwhelming and it’s a tribute to the millions of people impacted          by the flood that they continued to battle to save their homes, farms          and communities. That perseverance is difficult enough to maintain when          flooding lasts for several days or a few weeks. To maintain it for the          duration of the flooding took incredible fortitude.”         Through the          course of the Great Flood of 1993, flooding occurred at approximately          500 Weather Service flood forecast points with record flooding recorded          at 93 forecast points (44 points in the upper Mississippi River drainage          and 49 on the Missouri). Some forecast points were above flood stage non-stop          for five months.         Producing          accurate flood and flash flood forecasts through all this was especially          difficult, King said, because the volume of water was so great it overwhelmed          the mainstem drainages. “In many locations, there was as much water          running outside the leveed river channels as there was running inside          the levees,” King said. “We had sufficient gauges to help          us determine the flow levels within the river basins but had to make educated          estimates about how much unaccounted for runoff was flowing outside the          levees.”         At  St.          Louis , the first spring flooding on the Mississippi River was recorded          April 8, cresting at .2 feet above flood stage and lasting only that day.          The Mississippi rose above flood stage again on April 11 and stayed above          flood stage until May 24. The city got a respite as the Mississippi stayed          below flood stage May 24 to June 26. On June 27, the Mississippi again          went above flood stage and didn’t drop below flood stage for the          year until October 7—a total of 146 days above flood stage. The          Mississippi River was above the old record flood stage for more than three          weeks at St. Louis from mid July to mid August. Prior to 1993, the historic          flood of record on the Mississippi River at St. Louis had been 43.2 feet,          recorded April 28, 1973. That record was broken July 21, 1993, with a          level of 46.9 feet and broken again 11 days later with a record stage          of 49.58 feet on Aug. 1. St. Louis is located near the confluence of the          Missouri, Illinois and Mississippi rivers, all of which were in flood          at the same time.         During July,          central Iowa became the focus of media attention when flooding devastated          Ames and  Des Moines . Record          rainfall July 8-9 pushed Saylorville Reservoir near Des Moines to a record          level for the third time in three weeks. The Racoon River flooded the          Des Moines water works, despite dikes that had been built six feet above          the flood of record, and flooded several electrical plants. More than          250,000 Des Moines residents were without electricity and without water.          At Ames, Squaw Creek flooding inundated Hilton Coliseum on the Iowa State          University campus with 14 feet of water.         Later in          July, Iowa City was impacted by the flood. The Iowa River at Iowa City          reached its second highest level ever, cresting at 28.21 feet July 19.          Water levels at Coralville Reservoir, about nine miles upstream from Iowa          City, peaked July 24 at 716.75 feet, the highest level recorded since          the reservoir was completed in 1958. Water went over the Coralville Reservoir          spillway from July 5 to Aug. 1, the only time in the reservoir’s          history the spillway had been topped.         Some locations          on the Mississippi River were in flood for almost 200 days while locations          on the Missouri neared 100 days of flooding. On the Mississippi, Grafton,          Ill., recorded flooding for 195 days, Clarksville, Mo, for 187 days, Winfield,          Mo., for 183 days, Hannibal, Mo., for 174 days, and Quincy, Ill., for          152 days. The Missouri River was above flood stage for 62 days in Jefferson          City, Mo., 77 days at Hermann, Mo.; and for 94 days at St. Charles in          the St. Louis metropolitan area.         At different          times, the survey report noted, flooding closed all bridges on the Mississippi          River from Davenport, Iowa, to St. Louis; and all bridges on the Missouri          River from Kansas City to St. Louis. Flooding forced closure of seven          of eight railroad lines in Missouri, as well as 12 commercial airports          and portions of interstate highways 29, 35 and 70 across the state and          of Interstate 64 to Kentucky.         In the prologue          for the disaster survey report, the NOAA administrator at the time wrote:          “Although the Great Flood of 1993 has caused devastating human,          environmental and economic impacts, the lessons learned will guide us          in providing improved services and benefits to the nation in the future.”         “Our          forecasters were highly complimented by emergency managers and others          for the accuracy of their weather and flood forecasts and vital information          provided through the flood of 1993,” King said. “That is a          great source of pride for us. Still, the Weather Service always strives          to improve its services and its efficiency.”         NOAA is dedicated          to enhancing economic security and national safety through the prediction          and research of weather and climate-related events and providing environmental          stewardship of the nation’s coastal and marine resources.

Its size and impact was          unprecedented and has been considered the most costly and devastating          flood to ravage the U.S. in modern history. The number of record river          levels, its aerial extent, the number of persons displaced, amount of          crop and property damage and its duration surpassed all earlier U.S.          floods in modern times.                                                                                                                                             The Missouri River at Saint                Louis, Missouri                                                                     Uniquely extreme weather and hydrologic          conditions led to the flood of 1993. The stage was set in 1992 with a          wet fall which resulted in above normal soil moisture and reservoir          levels in the Missouri and Upper Mississippi River basins.                               These conditions were followed by          persistent weather patterns that produced storms over the same          locations. Their persistent, repetitive nature and aerial extent          throughout the late spring and summer, bombarded the Upper Midwest with          voluminous rainfall amounts. Some areas received more than 4 feet of          rain during the period.                               In the St. Louis National Weather          Service (NWS) forecast area encompassing eastern Missouri and southwest          Illinois, 36 forecast points rose above flood stage, and 20 river stage          records were broken. The 1993 flood broke record river levels set during          the 1973 Mississippi and the 1951 Missouri River floods.                               In April, the Mississippi River had          crested 6 to 10 feet above flood stage and once again near the same          levels during the month of May. In the beginning of June the rivers          dropped below flood stage and were receding. During the second week of          June, river levels rose to near flood stage before yet again beginning          their slow recession. By the end of June, the Mississippi River was four          feet below flood stage at St. Louis, while many other river locations in          the region were near flood stage. Precipitation for the month averaged          from one inch above normal at Kansas City, to nearly four inches above          normal at Springfield.                                                                                                                                                       The view at the riverfront                                                           Starting as early as June 7, reports          of levees being overtopped and levee breaks became common. These          breaches acted to delay the flood crests, temporarily storing excess          water in the adjacent lowlands, but the rain kept falling.                               July brought more heavy rain to the          Missouri and upper Mississippi River basins in Missouri, Iowa, Kansas,          Nebraska, North and South Dakota, Illinois and Minnesota. Rainfall          amounts of 5 to 7 inches in 24 hours were common. Precipitation for the          month averaged from one inch above normal at St. Louis and Springfield,          to between six and seven inches above normal at Columbia and Kansas          City, Missouri. The copious rain amounts during July sent record setting          crests down the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers, causing river gages to          malfunction along the way. Both record crests met each other at their          confluence near St. Louis within days of each other.                                                                                                                                                       Water encroaching on the City                of Alton, Illinois                                                           The Mississippi River stalled a few          days at the April 1973 record stages, seemingly waiting for the Missouri          River to arrive, before pushing levels upwards again, breaking levees,          driving people and their possessions to higher ground and causing havoc          with anything in its path.                               The crests, now combined as one,          moved downstream through St. Louis and Chester on its way to the          confluence with the Ohio River at Cairo, IL. Only minor flooding          occurred below the Ohio due to the drought the eastern U.S. was facing          the same time.                               Major sandbagging activities were          underway on the lower Missouri River, the River Des Perre in St. Louis,          the Mississippi River south of St. Louis and on many other tributaries          across Missouri and Illinois. Some of these efforts were successful          while others were not as the river continued to spawn destruction.                                                                                                                                             Volunteers sandbagging to                protect life and property                                                           Over 1,000 flood warnings and          statements, five times the normal, were issued to notify the public and          need-to-know officials of river levels. In places like St. Louis          Missouri, river levels were nearly 20 feet above flood stage and had          never been this high in its 150 year history. The 52 foot St. Louis          Flood wall, built to handle the volume of the 1844 flood, was able to          keep the 1993 flood out with just over two feet to spare.                               On August 1, levee breaks near          Columbia, Illinois flooded 47,000 acres of land, inundating the towns of          Valmeyer and Fults, Illinois. The released water continued to flow          parallel to the river, approaching the levees protecting historic          Prairie du Rocher and Fort de Chartres, Illinois. On August 3, the Corps          of Engineers made the tough decision to break through the stronger          Mississippi River levee to allow the water back into the river. The          innovative plan worked and the historic areas were saved.                                                                                                                                                       Eads Bridge at St. Louis,                Missouri                                                           On the Missouri River it was          estimated that nearly all of the 700 privately built agricultural levees          were overtopped or destroyed. Navigation on the Mississippi and Missouri          River had been closed since early July resulting in a loss of $2 million          (1993) dollars per day in commerce.                               The Mississippi River at St. Louis          crested at 49.6 feet on August 1, nearly 20 feet above flood stage and          had a peak flow rate of 1.08 Million cubic feet per second. At this          rate, a bowl the size of Busch Stadium would be filled to the brim in 69          seconds.                                                                                                                                                       Head for higher ground                                                           Some locations on the Mississippi          River were in flood for almost 200 days while locations on the Missouri          neared 100 days of flooding. On the Mississippi, Grafton, Ill., recorded          flooding for 195 days, Clarksville, Mo, for 187 days, Winfield, Mo., for          183 days, Hannibal, Mo., for 174 days, and Quincy, Ill., for 152 days.          The Missouri River was above flood stage for 62 days in Jefferson City,          Mo., 77 days at Hermann, Mo.; and for 94 days at St. Charles in the St.          Louis metropolitan area. On October 7, 103 days after it began, the          Mississippi River at St. Louis finally dropped below flood stage.                               In the 10 years since 1993, the NWS          has made many improvements to their river forecasting and information          delivery systems. Improved science, computing power, model calibration,          higher density, more frequent and timely river and rainfall data, along          with the Advanced Hydrologic Prediction Service (AHPS) have increased          our timeliness and service to the public. AHPS is now available on our          website at  http://www.crh.noaa.gov/lsx . By clicking 'River Info/AHPS' in the          left Margin under 'Hydrology', it is quick and easy to assess the          current hydrologic situation, accessing current and forecast hydrologic          conditions in addition to historic flood and low water information.

Fires on the          island are mainly affecting the island’s central mountainous region,          causing several villages to be evacuated while several homes and cars          have reportedly been destroyed, and 7 firefighters have been taken to          the hospital to be treated for the effects of smoke inhalation. Fires          have reportedly consumed an estimated 150,000 hectares of woodland in          Greece this summer.                         IRAQ (drought)            The Xinhua reported on Monday that Iraq is          suffering from a severe water shortage and has endured 2 successive          years of drought, with this year reportedly believed to be worse than          last year. It was reported that this year is believed to be the most          severe drought recorded in the past 100 years.                         RUSSIA (flood)            The Itar-Tass reported on Monday that floods have          occurred in Russia’a Primorye region (the Maritime territory) in the          Far East. A total of 627 houses have reportedly been submerged in the          cities of Bolshoi Karmen and Dalnegorsk, as well as 8 other districts.          Thirty-nine bridges, 218km of road and 17km of power lines were          reportedly damaged and destroyed. The worst hit district is reportedly          Partizanskiy where 7 bridges and 47km of road were destroyed, while 337          hectares of arable land were flooded. The total damage estimate is          reportedly more than 45 million rubles.                         SOUTH KOREA (flood)            The AP reported on Sunday that after 4 days of          unseasonable rain storms that engulfed rivers and caused landslides 5          individuals are dead and 3 are missing. The rains, which began on          Thursday, soaked most of South Korea, especially the country’s          southwestern region where the amount of rainfall was reportedly 22.8          inches. Hundreds of homes were reportedly submerged, vast rice fields          flooded and sections of major roads and rail lines washed away.                         UNITED STATES (drought)            The AP reported that north Texas entered its 59th          day without moisture on Monday, thus breaking the previous 58-day record          set during the dry spell of the Dust Bowl, which occurred during          Depression.                         UNITED STATES (fire)            CNN reported Tuesday that according to the National          Interagency Fire Center 84 wildfires continue to burn across 14 states          – Arizona, California, Florida, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico,          North Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Washington and Wyoming.          A reported 72,310 wildfires have burned 6,200,080 acres, or 9,687 square          miles, so far this year – an area slightly smaller than the state of          Maryland.

G-1 Federal Communications Commission Authorization for NWR Rebroadcast ........................................... H-1  1. Introduction. This National Weather Service (NWS) Instruction (NWSI) provides service guidelines and instructions for broadcasting on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Weather Radio (NWR) and identifies the managerial relationships and operational duties (as detailed in section 3). Guidelines and instructions for overall system management, engineering, maintenance, logistics, and other support for the NWR program can be found in NWSI 10-1711, NOAA Weather Radio System Management. 1.1 Mission Connection. The NWS carries out its mission to protect life and property by broadcasting directly to the general public, other government entities, and the private sector (hereafter referred to as ""the public,"" unless otherwise specified). Broadcasts include timely warnings and other weather and critical non-weather-related information to those in the affected areas under the ""all-hazards"" concept (see section 1.2.2). NWR broadcasts can be received using low cost, widely available receivers. Furthermore, NWR, as a primary NWS input to the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) Emergency Alert System (EAS) (see section 10), has the potential to reach the vast majority of the population with all-hazards information through the Nation's electronic media. 1.2 Fundamental Broadcast Concepts. NWR is a broadcast service by the NWS for the public. NWR uses formatted text input from the Advanced Weather Interactive Processing System (AWIPS) or other approved sources. The NWR system supports manual broadcast recording and scheduling operations for products not supported by text formatters, referred to as ""manual operations,"" and for critical events including backup. See ""CRS (Console Replacement System) Site Operator's Manual"" (the HTML version of the manual is available to CRS operators through the CRS ""help capability"" on the CRS). 1.2.1 Use of NWR Automated Voice. To broadcast critical information as quickly as possible, an NWS goal is to use automated voicing technology for broadcast of all messages. Any text to be converted automatically to speech should have full sentences, correct spelling, and effective punctuation to achieve clear communication. For instructions on set up and use of automated voicing, see ""Voice Improvement Processor Deployment and Implementation Plan"" on the Internet at: http://www.nws.noaa.gov/oso/oso1/oso12/document/vip20depimplan and ""Voice Improvement Processor User's Guide"" on the Internet at: http://www.nws.noaa.gov/oso/oso1/oso12/document/vip20guide . To maintain operator proficiency, Weather Forecast Office (WFO) staff should practice using manual mode, especially in backup live mode, for those times when manual operations are needed. See procedures outlined in section 6.1 and appendix A. 1.2.2 NWR ""All Hazards"" Concept. In support of Federal, state, and local government and private sector efforts to provide timely warnings to the public of events that threaten life and 4   NWSI 10-1710 OCTOBER 1, 2002 property, efforts to expand NWR to an ""All-Hazards"" service will continue. All-Hazards include natural disasters (e.g., weather, floods, earthquakes, volcanic activity, forest fires, etc.) and technological disasters, whether accidental or intentional (e.g., chemical or biological releases, oil spills, or nuclear incidents, etc.), and other emergency support activities. Emergency support activities include local emergency management incidents (e.g., train derailments, airplane crashes, marine collisions, industrial fires and accidents, etc.), and law enforcement emergencies (e.g., prison breaks, hostage situations, etc.), and search and rescue missions. 1.2.3 Official Voice of the NWS. NWR is the lone government-operated radio system providing direct warnings to the public. To many listeners, the NWR is the NWS. It is therefore critical NWR broadcasts adhere to the highest standards of timeliness, completeness, accuracy, and clarity. 2. Technical Description. The NWR system provides continuous automated real-time, or recorded, text-to-voice FM-radio broadcasts. The system consists of: a. b. A broadcast console, a personal computer that converts text to speech, and associated peripheral equipment used at WFOs. A communication link (dedicated telephone line, ultra high frequency radio, or microwave radio) between the transmitter audio output of the audio switching assembly and the broadcast transmitter. Each transmitter has its own dedicated communication link. A narrow-band very high frequency (VHF) transmitter operating on one of the following Government-assigned frequencies: 162.400, 162.425, 162.450, 162.475, 162.500, 162.525, and 162.550 Megahertz (MHz). Remote Off-Air Monitoring System (ROAMS) (see section 8.1 and appendix B), emergency power systems, telephone and other utilities, and services required for continuous operation. A 1050 Hertz (Hz) tone and/or NWR Specific Area Message Encoder (NWRSAME) transmission. Both either sound an alarm or switch specially equipped NWR receivers from standby to full-on mode for specified weather or nonweather-related emergencies (see section 6). This can be done through the NWR system automation or in manual mode when using the backup live function. See ""CRS Site Operator's Manual"" or other local instructions for operation of NWRSAME, and section 10 for explanation of the NWR role as entry to the EAS.  c.  d.  e.  3.  Procedural Responsibilities.  3.1 Weather Service Headquarters (WSH). The Office of Climate, Water, and Weather Services (OCWWS) provides service requirements and instructions for NWR broadcasts, contained in this document, in coordination with the Office of Operational Systems (OOS), and 5   NWSI 10-1710 OCTOBER 1, 2002 the Regional Headquarters, with input from WFOs. The OOS provides technical program management support, including operational procedures for expansion of the network, maintenance of a national NWR database, engineering, communications, equipment maintenance, and procedures for resolving interference issues (see NWS Instruction 10-1711, NOAA Weather Radio System Management). The NOAA Public and Constituent Affairs (PA) supports NWS outreach efforts, pursues new initiatives with the private sector, promotes NWR, and coordinates activities related to NWR public education and promotion (see section 12). 3.2 Regional Headquarters. Each Regional Headquarters manages the NWR program within its region and should have a designated regional focal point to oversee day-to-day broadcast operations. In addition, each Regional Headquarters will oversee an NWR Operator Proficiency Program (see section 8 and appendix A) and review and evaluate NWR broadcasts within its region. The Regional Headquarters also will coordinate, define, and document in regional supplements, as necessary, the broadcast service areas for all NWR stations in the region (see section 4.1). 3.3 Weather Forecast Offices (WFO). WFO management adopts these guidelines and regional supplements consistent with local service requirements and staffing. Each WFO should have an NWR program leader (see section 8.3). All operational employees must be proficient at disseminating warnings, watches, and advisories via NWR operational (and any backup) broadcast systems under the NWR Operator Proficiency Program. 3.3.1 Record Keeping. The NWR system at each WFO will automatically maintain a log to help monitor the currency of all broadcast material and the operational status of the equipment. In the event of an NWR system failure, the WFO should maintain a manual log, status board, or other equivalent mechanism for this purpose. 4. Broadcast Programming Goal.  4.1 Broadcast Service Area. The broadcast service area for each transmitter site is defined by counties or parts of counties or other defined areas and adjacent coastal or offshore waters where there is a reliable free space signal. Under ideal conditions (i.e., no obstructions to the signal within a uniform landscape), this would be a uniform ground-level signal of 8 microvolts within a 40-mile radius of the transmitter. The signal level will vary as a result of terrain, urban density, obstructions, and antenna mounting arrangements. The broadcast service area also is the region for which the warning alarm is authorized for use. Any changes must be approved by the Regional Headquarters. Because a broadcast service area depends on signal reception, it may extend beyond the programming office's warning and forecast area of responsibility. For areas with overlapping coverage by multiple transmitters, WFOs may broadcast routine programming for the overlapped area solely on the transmitter providing the best coverage. Periodic announcements over NWR should mention or define the broadcast service area. WFOs should distribute maps showing the broadcast service area as part of any NWR publicity, and post the maps on their Web site.  6   NWSI 10-1710 OCTOBER 1, 2002 Do not extend an NWR broadcast service area beyond its normal boundaries to accommodate listeners employing sophisticated high gain receiving equipment. 4.2 Broadcast Quality. While automated broadcasts will use the following broadcast practices, WFOs should adopt these practices when manually inserting products for broadcast to improve program quality and usability. 4.2.1 Style of Presentation. The broadcasts should be in complete sentences for both the leadin and main text. Use the word ""you"" as appropriate when referring to listeners. This projects interest and concern. a. b. c. Summarizing: Summarize tabular data, except in cases where precise listings are necessary or preferred by listeners. Wording: All messages should use the past or future tense. Time on Messages: Broadcasts should include time on messages containing highly perishable material. These include observations, radar or other position reports, and river stages.  Issue times should not be broadcast for forecasts, watches, warnings, or related statements. Generally, use times only for occurrences and expiration of an event. 5. Broadcast Message Priority. The four major elements of broadcast priority in descending order for the broadcast service area are: a. b. Messages for critical events. These normally include warnings, short duration watches, and other non-weather-related hazard information (see section 6). Basic core messages (always included unless de-emphasized or pre-empted by messages for critical events). These normally include the station identification, the hourly weather roundup, the service area forecast and synopsis, a marine forecast if that information meets the predominant needs of the community, and optionally a regional forecast. The basic core messages may vary according to local customer needs. See appendix C for program guidelines. Special customer messages (desirable). These normally include marine forecasts (if not already part of the basic core messages), lake and river stage reports, recreation forecasts, climatic data, fire weather forecasts, air quality information, weather-related road information, Ultraviolet Index (UVI) forecasts, and nonweather-related announcements. See appendix C for program guidelines. Educational and promotional messages (desirable, but optional). These normally include safety messages and announcements of awareness activities.  c.  d.  7   NWSI 10-1710 OCTOBER 1, 2002 Although there is special customer programming for groups with similar interests, NWR broadcasts will not be tailored to the needs of any individual person or individual business entity. 5.1 Guidelines. The NWR system programming can provide a more customer-oriented broadcast than a simple sequencing of standard products. Offices should find innovative uses of the enhanced scheduling functionality to best meet the preferences of the listeners. The dynamic use of time-insertion for certain products and frequent cycling of others is a good option. One example of this time-based information includes broadcasts of specific information at a prescribed time during the hour, day, week, month, or year. AWIPS and other platforms provide text formatters to produce NWR messages with conversational style. Follow basic format requirements in manual mode as well. When manually recording products, use a professional, but conversational, news style delivery. During critical events, place emphasis on watch/warning repetition, updates, and call to action statements with low (or even no) priority placed on the routine core and special customer broadcasts. For basic terms, approaches, and definitions related to the NWR system broadcast scheduling, see appendix D, and the ""CRS Site Operator's Manual"" (section 1.2), and the ""CRS Jump Start Kit: The Introductory Guidebook."" See sections 5.2 and 6 below for detailed guidelines on broadcasting operations for critical events. 5.2 Content. Messages should concentrate on what has recently happened and what is forecast to happen. Messages should be concise, avoiding acronyms and offensive language, and be mission related. Messages normally should not be broadcast longer than 6 hours after issuance (zone forecasts are, however, usually updated every 12 hours). Offices with broadcast service areas crossing state lines will provide balanced information and not favor one state over the other. If state or area weather summaries providing past weather information are broadcast, only air them for a limited time. Do not broadcast messages of national coverage except to highlight an event of long-term interest, such as a hurricane threatening the United States or a major winter storm. 5.3 Unauthorized Material. Ensure no unauthorized or improper material (or improper language) is broadcast, either directly or indirectly (through background noise when in manual broadcast mode). If the NWR system is in the WFO operational area, remember to limit or restrict background noise when recording manually. Specific material restricted from NWR broadcasts include: a. b. c. d. e. aviation weather in any form (i.e., ceilings, altimeter, terminal forecasts, etc.); music in any form or style, except as authorized by Regional Headquarters; encoded data, except NWR-SAME; excessive technical terms; foreign languages (except when authorized by Regional Headquarters); 8   NWSI 10-1710 OCTOBER 1, 2002 f. g. h. bulletin board announcements, such as meetings and activities for civic, business, and hobby clubs, lodges, professional and fraternal organizations, unions, business clubs, charities, fund raising, etc.; profanity and loud background noise; and proprietary data provided by private weather companies, unless permitted by agreement.  5.4 Non-Weather-Related Announcements. Only announcements (from NWS or from non-NWS sources) fitting one of the following criteria should be permitted. Non-NWS sources of information should be identified in the message. a. Activities helping the NWS to fulfill its primary mission, such as requests for NWR listener feedback, major public preparedness activities, open houses, dedications, safety information, Skywarn training meetings, and educational and promotional information about NWS products and services. (1) Some of these announcements are appropriate for random or occasional broadcast. These messages should be shorter than 60 seconds, preferably between 15 and 20 seconds. Use no more than two such messages at any one time. Prerecorded messages may be used. Announcements for the recall of NWR receivers may be broadcast, following the guidelines in Appendix E, ""NWS Action Plan for NWR Receiver Recall."" This appendix, approved by General Counsel, should be used to address each receiver recall in the same manner.  (2)  b. c.  Civil emergency and other non-weather-related emergency messages authorized in section 6.5. Other messages requested through official channels by the DOC/NOAA, such as outlined in the National Marine Fisheries Service Memorandum of Agreement, construed to be time critical and related to the NOAA mission.  If doubt exists whether a message meets one of the criteria, the WFO will coordinate with their Regional Headquarters. If further doubt exists within the Regional Headquarters, coordinate with the OCWWS Dissemination Services Manager (W/OS51). 6. Operations for Critical Events. For the broadcast service area, you must broadcast as soon as possible all watches, warnings, and related statements for: a. b. c. severe weather, floods, flash floods, and tsunamis; marine weather; and any non-weather civil emergency messages (as per agreements with state and local authorities) affecting the designated broadcast service area (see section 6.5).  9   NWSI 10-1710 OCTOBER 1, 2002 The automated text-to-speech feature of the NWR system is the most effective way to broadcast warnings as quickly as possible. Offices should strive to automate as much of their warning programming as possible. Offices should rarely modify these broadcast messages other than to: d. e. f. form complete sentences (if necessary); include appropriate punctuation; eliminate: (1) naming of counties/areas outside the broadcast service area; (2) material that is relevant only to areas outside the broadcast service area; (3) generic calls to action if calls to action are included elsewhere in the broadcast program; and (4) acronyms; summarize tables and lists.  g.  6.1 Backup Live Mode. In the event of catastrophic failure of any of the playback functions of the NWR system during a potentially life-threatening emergency, the WFO should make every attempt to keep the transmitter on the air and provide a minimum-level warning service in backup live mode. (Transmitters are designed to shut down if there is no continuous audio feed within a predetermined amount of time, typically 10 to 20 seconds.) 6.2 Role of NWR in the National Warning System (NAWAS). The role of NWR in support of national defense is covered in detail in appendix F. The role of NWR as part of an ""all hazards"" emergency alert network is detailed in sections 6.3, 6.4, and 6.5. 6.3 Initial Issuance of Short Duration Watches, Warnings, and Related Statements. Broadcast the initial issuance of a short duration watch, warning, and related statements, valid for the NWR broadcast service area, immediately. Start these initial broadcasts with the NWRSAME codes and the 1050 Hz warning alarm tones. These codes and alarms may also precede, at Regional Headquarters option, other watches, warnings, and certain related follow-up statements. See appendix G. The rules for initial broadcasts of these messages are described below. Do not broadcast numbers and plotting points for convective watches. Initial Watch/Warning Broadcast Rules. a. b. Transmission of the NWR-SAME codes followed by the 1050 Hz alarm tone. Broadcast the watch/warning information. This information may be abbreviated to suit emergency management or media needs, but the more detailed information should then follow without the codes and alarms. When in manual mode, to minimize any lag time between issuance and broadcast of a short duration warning, you should broadcast the initial warning live. Repeat highlights (i.e., what, where, and when). 10  c.   NWSI 10-1710 OCTOBER 1, 2002 d. NWR-SAME end-of-message code.  You may broadcast certain short duration warnings for counties/parishes/areas just outside the NWR broadcast service area with NWR-SAME codes, as per local agreement, but without the warning alarm tone. 6.4 Programming After Initial Watch/Warning Issuances. Highlight or summarize most public watches and warnings in the service area forecasts or optional regional forecasts, as outlined in Exhibit 1. But, use separate messages for details of hurricane warnings and short duration warnings for tornadoes, severe thunderstorms, and flash floods. As threatening weather gets closer to the broadcast service area or when ongoing conditions become more hazardous, eliminate less essential parts of the broadcast program to allow additional time for watch, warning, or special/severe weather statement information. If time permits, include generic safety rules and call to action statements appropriate to the hazard in the programming as separate messages when watches or warnings are in effect. The remaining subsections in 6.4 provide guidance on how programming should be conducted during specific hazardous events. Within these subsections, the term ""regional area"" means beyond the broadcast service area to around 300 miles or so from the NWR station. ""Nearby"" means only locations in the regional area adjoining the official NWR broadcast service area. Exhibit 1 provides a tabular summary of the guidelines in the following subsections for handling critical NWR information. 6.4.1 Watches for Tornadoes, Severe Thunderstorms, and Flash Floods. After the initial watch message is aired, highlight information on short duration watches for the NWR broadcast service area in the service area forecast and/or include in a separate message. 6.4.2 Warnings for Tornadoes, Severe Thunderstorms, and Flash Floods. Replace the short duration warning message with any updated severe weather/flash flood statements issued after initial broadcast of these warnings. These replacement statements should briefly restate the essential basics of the warning (what, where, when) followed by the new information concerning the event. The replacement statement will mention if a warning has been cancelled or allowed to expire. You may use a summary message containing up-to-date information on all existing watches, warnings, and advisories in the area, but the summary must include up-to-the-minute current information. When multiple warnings are in effect, limit call to action statements to only the most appropriate. 6.4.3 Watches and Warnings for Winter Storms, High Winds, and Dust Storms. Highlight information for these watches and warnings in the service area forecast and/or summarize in the optional regional forecast and/or include in a separate message. If you broadcast a separate watch or warning message, ensure the message does not contain conflicting information and, to  11   NWSI 10-1710 OCTOBER 1, 2002  EVENT  AREA AFFECTED (1)  SUMMARIZE IN REGIONAL FORECAST (Optional)  HIGHLIGHT IN SERVICE AREA FORECAST  DETAIL IN SEPARATE MESSAGE  PROGRAM STATUS: normal or as marked (2)  SHORT DURATION Thunderstorm/Tornado/ svc area X X Flash Flood Watches region N(3) --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thunderstorm/Tornado/ svc area X limited Flash Flood Warnings region N(3) --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Special Marine Warning svc area X LONG-FUSE Winter Storm/High svc area X X X(3) Wind Watches region X --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Winter Storm/High svc area X(4) X X (4) Wind Warnings region X --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Hurricane/Tropical svc area X X X Storm Watches region X(5) N --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Hurricane/Tropical svc area X X limited Storm Warnings region X(5) N --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Flood Watches/Warnings svc area X X(3) X region X N(3) MISCELLANEOUS Marine Warnings (nonspecial) area (6) X --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Tsunami Watches and (2) for warnings Warnings svc area X --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Civil emergency (3) messages svc area X --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Nuclear attack anywhere X limited  (1) Definition of areas: svc area = broadcast service area as defined in section 4.1. region = outside of broadcast service area to a radius of about 300 miles. N = only those ""nearby"" areas in the region adjoining the broadcast service area. (2) Limited program status means to confine information to the hazard, eliminating some basic or special customer programming. (3) Optional. (4) Should limit programming when conditions actually affect area. (5) May include areas an appropriate distance beyond region. (6) Marine forecast - see appendix C.  Exhibit 1: Guidelines for Handling Critical Information on NWR  12   NWSI 10-1710 OCTOBER 1, 2002 the extent possible, does not contain redundant information not useful for listeners in the broadcast service area. 6.4.4 Watches and Warnings for Hurricanes and Tropical Storms. Broadcast the latest Hurricane Local Statement (HLS) (edited for brevity, as necessary) along with any additional locally relevant information from the latest National Hurricane Center (NHC) or Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC) public advisory. Do not broadcast the entire NHC or CPHC forecast advisory due to its lengthy and detailed nature. Indicate total probabilities through 72 hours for locations within the broadcast service area as authorized in NWS Instruction 10-601, Tropical Cyclone Weather Services Program. Also highlight watches and warnings in the service area forecast. During hurricane and tropical storm warnings, limit the programming to: separate warning message with the advisory, service area forecast, short term forecast, tracking, conditions in the weather roundup, safety rules, or any HLS. 6.4.5 Warnings for Marine and Other Marine Events. a. Special Marine Warnings and Follow-up Statements. Broadcast information for each event in the broadcast service area as a separate message. See section 6.4.2 for suggested updating procedures. Other Marine Weather Warnings. Broadcast all other marine warnings, weather-related statements, and advisories that apply to a WFO's marine forecast area (see appendix C). Special/Urgent Marine Information. In the interest of marine safety and at the request of the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) or other appropriate authority as designated by Regional Headquarters, NWS offices should broadcast information dealing with an emergency marine situation where: (1) life and/or property is imminently threatened, and (2) such information could help prevent further losses. The USCG selects messages that are within the appropriate NWR listening range and delivers the information ready for broadcast (without editing by the NWS). Any WFO that has effective NWR coverage in the area of USCG concern should broadcast the USCG message as requested.  b.  c.  Try to limit these messages to no more than 30 to 40 seconds (about 70 words). Keep the broadcast in the programming until the message is updated (normally 2 to 3 hours) or until the USCG cancels it. Consider using the periodicity feature in the broadcast cycle for messages that are not frequently updated. Do not broadcast these messages for longer than 12 hours nor should they replace any routine weather products broadcast over NWR. The following message format is suggested: ""The following emergency marine information is transmitted at the request of the U.S. Coast Guard.... An oil tanker and freighter have collided at the entrance to 13   NWSI 10-1710 OCTOBER 1, 2002 the Puget Sound between Ft. Warden and Ft. Casey. The channel is blocked and oil covers much of the water surface in the area. All mariners are requested to stay clear of the area."" In the event NWS priorities require temporary suspension of the USCG broadcast or a station emergency prevents the NWS from broadcasting the message, the NWS should notify the requesting USCG office of the situation as soon as possible. The WFO and USCG periodically should review the procedures for delivery and broadcast of these messages. 6.4.6 Watches, Warnings, and Related Statements for Floods. Broadcast these products (including river, coastal and lakeshore flood) for the broadcast service area in a separate message. They also may be summarized in the service area forecast or optional regional forecast. This information for nearby areas also may be broadcast in the service area to meet listeners needs. 6.4.7 Watches and Warnings for Tsunamis. When these bulletins apply to the broadcast service area, broadcast them as a separate message using only the predictions for the broadcast service area. Because of rapidly changing water levels associated with a tsunami, DO NOT broadcast local water level observations. Broadcasting information on evacuation over NWR is only permitted when prior arrangements have been made with local disaster preparedness authorities to receive the information in a timely fashion. Provide the source of the evacuation information in the message. If there are no such arrangements, the following statement should be read at the end of a tsunami warning issued by the Pacific or West Coast/Alaska Tsunami Warning Centers: ""Due to rapidly changing conditions associated with tsunami wave activity, listeners are urged to tune to local Emergency Alert System media for the latest information issued by local disaster preparedness authorities. They will provide details on evacuation of low-lying areas, if that is necessary, and when it is safe to return after the tsunami threat has passed."" 6.5 Non-Weather-Related Emergency Messages. The NWS is authorized by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) (or its equivalent) to relay on NWR potential lifesaving messages originated and authenticated by local, state and other Federal government agencies. These messages should meet the requirements outlined in the following subsections. Subsections 6.5.a and 6.5.b provide overall guidelines that apply to all subsections. Subsection 6.5.c provides more specific guidelines any agreements should follow. Subsection 6.5.d provides guidelines when agreements do not exist and an emergency occurs. Subsection 6.5.e provides guidelines on regional/national emergencies. a. The lead-in to any non-NWS message should be as follows:  14   NWSI 10-1710 OCTOBER 1, 2002 ""The following type of message is transmitted at the request of (OTHER GOVERNMENT AGENCY) (remainder of text)."" b. General Criteria for Broadcasting Non-Weather-Related Emergency Messages. To be permitted on NWR, these messages should comply with all the following criteria. (1) (2) PUBLIC SAFETY IS INVOLVED -- Information will aid in reducing the loss of life or the substantial loss of property. OFFICIAL INFORMATION -- The source of the information should be a government agency, Federal, state, or local, whose information directly supports Federal responsibilities concerning the protection of life and property. TIME CRITICAL -- Event requires immediate public knowledge to avoid adverse impact. Other means of disseminating the information are not adequate to ensure rapid delivery of urgent information of an immediate threat or of significant importance to life and property. Information length and format is consistent with other NWR broadcast program material. Inclusion of this information should not compromise the remaining NWR broadcast content. Information should be non-routine and infrequent.  (3) (4)  (5)  (6) c.  Local Non-Weather-Related Emergencies Covered by Agreement. As a general rule, there should be only one statewide agreement with one agency, such as a state EAS plan, to cover all the anticipated situations. Keep a copy of agreements and detailed procedures to carry out the agreements near the weather radio operations area. Regional Headquarters will approve agreements to broadcast non-weather emergency information (including possible use of the warning alarm tones and NWR-SAME codes), but may assign development and coordination of such agreements to the WFO state liaison office. Local Non-Weather-Related Emergencies Not Covered by Agreement. At times when events occur requiring the use of NWR by external sources not covered by any agreements, the WFO senior official on duty should determine if the event presents a clear and immediate threat to lives and property in the listening area. If found to be so, and the use of NWR could reduce the threat, authorize these broadcasts, as requested by locally recognized public safety officials. The authority is not to be extended to develop or promote any unofficial or nonapproved agreements. If time permits, contact the Regional Headquarters before 15  d.   NWSI 10-1710 OCTOBER 1, 2002 the broadcast is made. If time does not permit, contact the Regional Headquarters as soon as possible afterward with details of the event. Examples of situations that would fall under this category are (1) a serious chemical spill or leak, (2) a biological release, (3) an explosion in a populated area, or (4) a nuclear release. e. National and Regional Non-Weather-Related Emergencies. The NWS, in support of FEMA (or its equivalent), should disseminate emergency messages over the NWR, including but not limited to, attack warnings and large-scale non-weatherrelated events, such as earthquakes and volcanic activity. The dissemination rules for national and regional non-weather-related emergency messages, including nuclear attack, are described in detail in appendix F, with broadcast instructions in Exhibit 1.  6.6 Required Weekly Test (RWT). Activate the public alarm tone and NWR-SAME test code features of NWR for test purposes each Wednesday between 10 a.m. and noon local time, except when severe weather is ongoing or threatening. At Regional Headquarters discretion, WFOs may broadcast the RWT additionally at certain other times (e.g., evening prime time) to suit stated customer needs and within office capabilities. WFOs should not broadcast the RWT using automated scheduling unless there is a specific procedure for ensuring the test does not inadvertently air during threatening weather. Immediately after transmitting the appropriate NWR-SAME codes and tones, broadcast the following message (it may be shortened, at WFO option, except include counties/parishes/areas). ""This is the National Weather Service Office in city . The preceding signal was a test of the Weather Radio Station LLL-NN's public warning system. During potentially dangerous weather situations, specially built receivers can be automatically activated by this signal to warn of the impending hazard. Tests of this signal and receivers' performance are normally conducted by the National Weather Service at time each day of the week . If there is a threat of severe weather, the test will be postponed to the next available good-weather day. Reception of this broadcast, and especially the warning alarm tone, will vary at any given location. This variability, normally more noticeable at greater distances from the transmitter, can occur even though you are using a good quality receiver in good working order. The warning alarm tone will be activated for hazardous watches and warnings for the following counties list of counties/parishes/independent cities, or other designated areas . This concludes the weekly test of Weather Radio Station LLL-NN."" Where more than one state is involved, include the state name before the names of the counties in that state. If, for any reason, the test was missed during the scheduled time frame, then the next test should not take place until about 24 hours later on the next available good-weather day.  16   NWSI 10-1710 OCTOBER 1, 2002 As part of the weekly test, use ROAMS to quality control the broadcast and validate the proper operation of NWR-SAME from all stations. This procedure is described in appendix B. 7. Broadcast Outage and Suspension Rules.  7.1 Notice of Planned NWR Facility Outage. In the event of an NWR facility outage planned at least 24 hours in advance, broadcast a brief message periodically during the 24-hour period before the outage. Immediately broadcast and frequently repeat planned outages scheduled to occur in less than 24 hours. For example: ""NOAA Weather Radio station KEC-75, Des Moines, Iowa, will be off the air for maintenance from 10 a.m., Wednesday, until about 9 a.m., Thursday."" Include the estimated time of return if it is known. Avoid such terms as ""Thursday morning"" or ""Monday night."" When NWR equipment is taken off the air or unplanned outages occur, send a Public Information Statement (PNS) or announce it using the local NWS telephone recording system, if feasible. When interference with other agencies requires temporary suspension of NWR broadcasts, a brief message should be aired over the NWR just before the suspension. A sample message follows: ""NOAA Weather Radio station KHB-36, Washington, DC, will be off the air from 7 a.m. until 3 p.m., Thursday, because of technical difficulties. If weather warnings are required during the period, NOAA Weather Radio will resume broadcasts as soon as possible."" Also send an additional PNS and announce it using the local telephone recording system. The following is an example of a suggested message that may be used to advise subscribers of the NWR outage. Example: NOUS41 KLWX 161230 PNSLWX PUBLIC INFORMATION STATEMENT NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE BALTIMORE/WASHINGTON 830 AM EST TUE APR 16 2002 NOAA WEATHER RADIO KHB-36 WASHINGTON DC WILL BE OFF THE AIR DUE TO TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES FROM 10 AM TODAY...TUESDAY...UNTIL ABOUT 9 AM WEDNESDAY. IF WEATHER WARNINGS ARE REQUIRED 17   NWSI 10-1710 OCTOBER 1, 2002 DURING THE PERIOD...NOAA WEATHER RADIO WILL RESUME BROADCASTS AT ONCE. $$ Whether the outage is planned or unplanned, if it is expected to be for more than 12 hours, notify the Regional Headquarters. If the station goes off the air in an emergency or potentially threatening situation, notify the Regional Headquarters as quickly as time will allow. 7.2 Broadcast Suspension Rules. Federal, state, and local government agencies use frequencies near the NWR band. On occasion, these agencies (e.g., Treasury, Forest Service) will temporarily move into an NWR broadcast service area with a mobile radio system to cope with a highly critical situation. When NWR is the suspected cause of interference to another emergency radio system, the NWS will eliminate the radio interference by following procedures in NWS Instruction 10-1711, NOAA Weather Radio System Management. For further help, the Regional Headquarters may contact the OOS NWR Program Office (W/OPS17). In addition, the following provides rules for when to suspend NWR operations. 7.2.1 Routine Request. Following are guidelines to suspend NWR operations when interference is expected. a. Designated staff of an agency involved in a critical operation should first prove, by ""on-off"" short duration tests with the local NWR involved, the interference is actually a result of NWR. If it is shown that the interference can be eliminated by the temporary shutdown of an NWR station, the designated contact for that agency should request from the WFO a temporary shutdown for that station. The WFO should strive to solve the problem, with immediate notification to the Regional Headquarters for relay to the Dissemination Services Manager in OCWWS (W/OS51). If unable to resolve the problem, the WFO should coordinate with the Regional Headquarters, who will notify or coordinate with the Dissemination Services Manager, if necessary.  b.  Any office that has been requested to temporarily shut down, under the above rules, should continue operations--or immediately resume the broadcast operations--during actual or imminent severe weather, flood, or other disasters. NWR offices should inform the Regional Headquarters when this situation arises, and the Regional Headquarters should relay that information to the Dissemination Services Manager in OCWWS (W/OS51), who will relay it to the designated contact for the other agency involved. Outside of normal business hours, follow the procedures at the end of section 7.2.1b. 7.2.2 Emergency Request. Section 7.2.1 provides guidance for expected interference conditions, but not all situations can be expected. When NWR unexpectedly causes interference to another emergency radio system (i.e., fire trucks, ambulance, etc.) and no severe weather is occurring or imminent, the NWR office should suspend the NWR broadcasts. The WFO should 18   NWSI 10-1710 OCTOBER 1, 2002 notify the Regional Headquarters as soon as possible, who will relay it to the Dissemination Services Manager. The WFO, in coordination with the Regional Headquarters and the Dissemination Services Manager, if feasible, should work with the involved parties toward resolution and resume NWR broadcasts as soon as possible. 7.2.3 Fire and Bomb Threats. When an NWR office must evacuate due to a bomb threat, fire, hazardous material incident, or other hazard, add a short message to the broadcast program if time permits. For example, ""Updates will not be available until further notice."" Never announce the office is being evacuated due to a bomb threat or fire. 8. Quality Assurance. The WFO and Regional Headquarters have the primary responsibility for maintaining the quality of NWR broadcasts. The Regional Headquarters should ensure that appropriate training is available to WFO staff to maintain high broadcast quality. The WFO should assure quality by on-shift monitoring and active participation of an NWR program leader as described below. See appendix A for information on training and practice requirements to assure proficiency. 8.1 Quality Assurance on Shift. Monitor the broadcast programming frequently during the shift to ensure the information is timely, complete, consistent, accurate, and of clear audio quality. For those transmitters out of broadcast range of the WFO, check the audio quality using the NWR system monitoring function and ROAMS. Check actual broadcast audio from the transmitter once a week as part of the RWT (see section 6.6). Also, each person placing a message in the broadcast program should see that the product is reviewed and proofread, and evaluate the new product's impact on the total program before broadcasting it. See appendix B for identification of NWR system problems by ROAMS and the appropriate responses by WFO personnel. 8.2 Drills of Broadcast Rules for Critical Events. Each WFO will establish rules for conducting and documenting periodic drills under the rules outlined in appendix A. The RWTs should be conducted live through on-air or recorded emergency override, or through backup live. These tests will provide experience for the staff in the event they have to use the emergency override or backup live function of the NWR system. 8.3 NWR Program Leaders. Each WFO should have an NWR program leader(s) who will: a. ensure manuals, handbooks, and logs are kept up-to-date and all NWR operators are familiar with current operating instructions and techniques for preventive maintenance, as locally determined; carry out any NWR-related duties assigned by the WFO management; assist the NWR system focal point (if not the same person) in the programming and maintenance of the NWR system; 19  b. c.   NWSI 10-1710 OCTOBER 1, 2002 d. e. ensure educational and promotional materials and the NWR Web page on the WFO Web site, if appropriate, are adequate and up-to-date (see section 12); and assist WFO management in the NWR Operator Proficiency Program, as described in appendix A.  9. NWR as a Substitute for Other Means of Dissemination. WFO management should try to use NWR broadcasts to lighten the total dissemination workload of the office. NWR broadcasts may be used to reduce the number and variety of manual telephone recordings, as well as reduce the number of incoming telephone calls to the office. 10. Use of NWR by the Electronic Media. The FCC permits AM, FM, TV, and cable TV broadcast stations to re-broadcast NWR transmissions. Appendix H is a copy of the FCC release to broadcasters that specifies the conditions placed on the blanket re-broadcast authority. The same conditions apply to re-broadcasts of NWR on amateur radio. See also NWS Instruction 101711, NOAA Weather Radio System Management, which includes a template agreement form. The Regional Headquarters and WFOs should encourage cable TV systems and TV stations whose areal coverage coincides with the NWR broadcast service area to re-broadcast NWR programming. For cable TV systems and TV stations that extend well beyond the NWR listening range, re-broadcasts are discouraged since most material will not apply, particularly the warnings. An important function of the NWR is to serve as the NWS's primary input to the EAS through the use of NWR-SAME technology, which has the identical communications protocols as the EAS. NWS at the national, regional, and WFO levels should continue to work closely with their respective electronic media and emergency management partners to assure the success of the EAS. WFOs, along with their EAS partners, should be involved in the creation of state and local EAS plans. See appendix G for NWS policy regarding the use of the 1050 Hz warning alarm tone and authorized NWR-SAME codes on NWR broadcast messages. 11. Restrictions Under Operating License. The NWS is licensed to operate individual NWRs through the Interdepartmental Radio Advisory Committee (IRAC). This Federal committee is chaired by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration of the DOC. IRAC controls NWS operations of the NWR, and other government-operated radio stations, in the same way the FCC does for commercial and other non-Federal groups and organizations. Each NWR license is granted for a particular power setting and frequency at a specific site. The power, frequency, or location of an NWR station cannot be changed without prior IRAC approval. 12. Public Education and Promotion. To be fully effective, NWR must employ a continuing program of public education. Public education and promotion should involve the efforts of WSH (PA, OCIO, OCWWS, OOS), and Regional Headquarters and WFOs. The following PA Web site provides further information on promoting NWR: 20   NWSI 10-1710 OCTOBER 1, 2002 http://www.publicaffairs.noaa.gov/grounders/nwr.html. Substantial publicity is accruing from announcements about the ongoing NWR expansion through installation of new transmitters throughout the country. (These installations are in partnership with external groups.) The PA at the national and regional levels, in coordination with WSH, plays a significant role in these promotional efforts. This is most true for written materials, such as press releases and brochures, and any audio or video ""spots"" for commercial broadcast. Much information on NWR for the public and NWS staff is available on the Internet. Two Web sites of particular interest are: http://www.nws.noaa.gov/nwr http://www.nws.noaa.gov/pa/secnews/nwr. 12.1 General Promotion Activities. WFOs should promote NWR, highlighting the warning alarm and NWR-SAME code features and the value of NWR to schools, hospitals, industrial centers, and homes. WFOs should also promote NWR awareness through outreach activities at conventions, fairs, boat shows, and other gatherings at the local, regional, and national levels. Pursue personal contacts where necessary in dealing with special customer groups and business groups promoting the sales of NWR receivers. NOAA and King Features Syndicate have an agreement allowing for use of the Mark Trail comic strip character as a campaign symbol for promoting NWR. NWS staff should contact their regional PA Officer for guidance on using the Mark Trail image in specific campaigns. The OCWWS and the OOS have developed and periodically update NWR brochures. These are available from the National Logistics Supply Center in Kansas City, Missouri. NWR exhibits are available from the OOS NWR Program Office. The OOS has supplied Regional Headquarters with briefcase size NWR exhibits for use by regional and WFO staff in promoting NWR. The exhibits are self contained and unfold to display a variety of NWR receivers with a brief text message on NWR. NWR videotapes and NWR Public Service Announcement video and audio tapes are available from the NWR Program Office. The videos, exhibit, and brochures can be used in combination to provide a very effective presentation on NWR. WFOs should distribute, and post to the WFO Web page, maps showing the NWR coverage area, that also might include information about the NWR service. Other awareness avenues may include newspaper articles and telephone recordings. A sample listing in the newspaper for the weather section or radio station listing section might be as follows: WEATHER RADIO For 24-hour NOAA Weather Radio broadcasts, tune to 162.--- MHz. 21   NWSI 10-1710 OCTOBER 1, 2002 Brief NWR promotion messages can be placed on the office phone or WFO Web page. An example of such a message might be as follows. ""Because of high public interest in weather, you may be unable to reach this number (or Web page) during active weather situations. You may wish to tune in to our NOAA Weather Radio station on 162.--- MHz to receive the latest weather information broadcast continuously from this office. Consult your radio sales outlet to select a suitable receiver."" Another means of promoting NWR is to use the NWR broadcast as ""audio"" whenever the office telephones are placed ""on-hold."" 12.2 Promotion with Electronic Media. WFOs should cultivate positive relations with local electronic media. The goal would be to have EAS facilities directly re-broadcast NWR-SAMEcoded emergency messages in a timely manner to the public. In addition, WFOs should continue to encourage electronic media facilities to rebroadcast more of the NWR broadcasts outside of the EAS arena, including follow-up statements and other supporting forecasts. As examples, some television stations do this through the Secondary Audio Programming (SAP) technology, where people can tune televisions sets to the SAP to hear the information. Some cable television facilities use NWR re-broadcasts as a ""voice-over,"" along with radar or other graphics. These efforts should be expanded where possible. 13. Customer Feedback. From time to time, WFOs should make on-air requests for comments and suggestions from listeners. This feedback should prove helpful in providing an overall more useful broadcast service. WFOs should coordinate plans to solicit customer feedback with, and send summaries of the results to, the Regional Headquarters. 14. Gift/Cooperator-Operated NWR Systems. The basic NWR network funded by the Federal government was completed in the early 1980s. Because the completed network did not reach every community in the United States, state and local governments, private companies, and various civic groups can help establish complete new NWR stations or expand broadcast service areas by buying supplemental transmitters. NWS Instruction 10-1711, NOAA Weather Radio System Management, provides specific information on these efforts, including agreement forms for donated equipment.  22   NWSI 10-1710 OCTOBER 1, 2002 APPENDIX A - NOAA Weather Radio (NWR) Operator Proficiency Program Purpose: All NWS operational staff at the WFO must be skilled at disseminating warnings, watches, and advisories on the NWR system, including NWR-SAME, word pronunciation interfaces, and any backup broadcast systems. Operational staff include the Meteorologist in Charge (MIC), senior and general forecasters, Hydrometeorological Technicians (HMTs), Meteorological Interns, Service Hydrologists, Science Operations Officers (SOOs), Data Acquisition Program Managers (DAPMs), and Warning Coordination Meteorologists (WCMs). Background: The NWS's critical mission is to issue warnings, watches, and advisories for the protection of life and property. The prompt and efficient issuance of these products on NWR and the EAS provides a far-reaching and effective warning/alert system to the American citizen. Hence, all NWS operational staff at NWR sites must be skilled at providing this warning dissemination service. Regional Headquarters: Regional Headquarters oversee an NWR operator proficiency program in their region. This program will include an annual report from each WFO MIC to their Regional Headquarters. It will assure each operational employee performed practice or real-time NWR/EAS warning issuances at enough intervals to show they can disseminate, in an operationally effective time, watches, warnings, advisories, and other appropriate messages over the NWR broadcast system(s) at their office. The report will contain enough detail, as described in the following section, to document the steps taken to confirm this capability. Each Regional Headquarters will maintain this documentation on file for a period of 5 years. Weather Forecast Offices (WFO): All operational employees will perform practice or real-time NWR/EAS warning issuance on the NWR system and any backup NWR broadcast systems no less than quarterly, and at other random times determined by the WFO management. These practice sessions will be clearly indicated as such during broadcast. For the NWR system, this will include correct and timely use of its Emergency Override function, Backup Live function with an NWR-SAME encoder, and Weather Message Creation function to disseminate an NWS warning. One of these practice sessions per year will be for the official record and be monitored by a WFO trainer (SOO, WCM, DAPM, or NWR Program Leader) for proper rules and timeliness. Once a year, the WFO management will document to their Regional Headquarters that all quarterly practice sessions have been successfully completed by all operational employees, including the date(s) of the monitored NWR/EAS warning issuances. The WFO management will describe other actions taken throughout the year to ensure the skill of the office staff to effectively operate NWR in critical event situations, such as watches, warnings, and advisories. Use the planned practice demonstration code (DMO), a code specifically designed for use with practice EAS broadcasts. The exercises may be conducted at any time under WFO policy/rules, ensuring that each practice broadcast is clearly indicated as such, and performed only during A-1   NWSI 10-1710 OCTOBER 1, 2002 times of non-threatening weather. A quarterly practice session may be replaced by a routine weekly test but will not be a substitute for a monitored yearly test by the local NWR trainer. If the DMO code is not available, these practice broadcasts must be confined to the time of the manually produced NWR tone alarm/RWT (EAS Required Weekly Test).  A-2   NWSI 10-1710 OCTOBER 1, 2002 APPENDIX B - NWR Remote Off-Air Monitoring System (ROAMS) Purpose: This appendix describes the monitoring capabilities of the ROAMS and the actions WFO staff should take in response to ROAMS messages to help timely NWR transmitter network maintenance. ROAMS Operation: ROAMS is designed to monitor and report on the failure status of several transmitter parameters/applications. Among the parameters/applications monitored by ROAMS are: (1) primary transmitter AC power; (2) secondary transmitter AC power; (3) primary transmitter low broadcast power; (4) secondary transmitter low broadcast power; (5) program audio feed (signal at input to transmitter); (6) proper transmission of NWR-SAME messages from the transmitters; (7) transmitter radio frequency (RF) carrier output; and (8) lack of broadcast audio output. Additional parameters/applications (e.g., shelter temperature) may be added to this list at regional discretion. Response to ROAMS Calls: If ROAMS calls the site on an administrative telephone line, the operator should log the date and time of the call, the ROAMS ID, and the fault number(s) reported. The operator should send a command to acknowledge the report. Each WFO has instructions on the remote operation of ROAMS that is programmed to receive these calls. The ROAMS fault numbers and the required actions are listed in Table 1. Response to ROAMS Fault Report on the NWR System: If ROAMS calls the NWR system, ROAMS will alert the operator through the Alert Message window. Each ROAMS telephone call will be reported with the transmitter ID in the Alert Message window without detailed alarm status. The operator should then use the ROAMS Data window under the Transmitters menu to check the detailed alarm status. Response to ROAMS status should be as listed in Table 1.  B-1   NWSI 10-1710 OCTOBER 1, 2002  Table 1: ROAMS Response Status ROAMS Fault ID* Input Power Alarm Fault Description AC Power Failure to #1 Transmitter and System Power Transmitter #1 output power is low Transmitter #2 output power is low AC Power Failure to #2 Transmitter Indicates bad SAME message Follow-Up Action If not equipped for automatic switch-over, switch to backup transmitter if available Same as for Input Power Alarm Same as for Input Power Alarm Same as for Input Power Alarm Retransmit SAME message to determine if bad messages persist Response for last three alarms listed: (a) Use ROAMS to check transmitter input audio Alarm #10 No RF carrier from transmitter (b) Use ROAMS to check broadcast audio If audio level acceptable, then (b); else (c) If audio level is acceptable, then problem has cleared; else Transmitter Technician Whom to Notify Transmitter Site Power point of contact (POC)  Alarm #1 Alarm #2 Alarm #3 SAME Alarm #8  Transmitter Technician Transmitter Technician Transmitter Site Power POC If bad messages persist, National ROAMS Control/ Monitoring point and local office technical staff as necessary  Alarm #9  No broadcast audio  Input Audio Alarm  Audio telephone feed has dropped below level to keep transmitter keyed  (c) Monitor console audio  If console level is acceptable, then Telecommunications POC; else CRS technician  * Note: Coordinate additional faults selected for monitoring at both regional and OOS NWR Program Office (W/OPS17) levels. Points of Contact: Table 1 will be included in the station manual with telephone numbers for the five points of contact identified in the table. Action Report: If maintenance action is required for any equipment as the result of a ROAMS report, start an Engineering Management Reporting System report.  B-2   NWSI 10-1710 OCTOBER 1, 2002 APPENDIX C - Guidelines for Basic Core and Special Customer Messages 1. Basic Core Messages. Basic core messages are those to be repeated, often as a set, on a frequent basis. Except for the brief station identification (I.D.), delete or shorten these messages, as appropriate, when warnings are in effect within the broadcast service area. Normally, program this set of core messages in the following order. a. Station I.D. A brief station identification should appear with each repetition of the core broadcast. It should include the call sign, general broadcast service area, programming office and, if necessary, attribution information. This may be necessary at sites where free tower rent is provided, but the tower owner requires frequent attribution. At least one version of the I.D. should refer to NWR as the voice of the NWS. Two examples follow: ""This is NOAA Weather Radio station KEC-74, serving central Indiana and originating from the National Weather Service Office in Indianapolis."" ""You are listening to NOAA Weather Radio, the voice of the National Weather Service, serving western Washington and the adjacent coastal waters. KHB-60 Seattle and KIH-36 Neah Bay originate from the National Weather Service Office in Seattle."" A more detailed I.D. should be broadcast on a less frequent basis (e.g., once an hour) with appropriate attribution, frequency, and transmitter location and description of the service. The detailed I.D. should not be broadcast during critical event operations, only the brief I.D. should be broadcast. Include requests for feedback concerning NWR programming and scheduling in the detailed I.D. b. Synopsis and Optional Regional Forecast. These messages should be updated frequently enough to avoid reference to times that may be surpassed before the issuance of a replacement message. For example, do not say ""snow is expected over the Great Lakes by late morning..."" if the product will air past noon. (1) Synopsis. The general synopsis should contain a discussion of weather systems that will be affecting the broadcast service area during the valid forecast period. The synopsis should be very brief, in layman's terms, and limited to highlighting only the most significant features. It should emphasize the first 48 hours of the forecast period and indicate pertinent information through the extended forecast periods. If marine messages are part of the core broadcast programming (see special customer messages section below), the marine synopsis may be used instead, provided it describes features affecting both marine and land areas in the broadcast service area. C-1   NWSI 10-1710 OCTOBER 1, 2002 (2) Regional Forecast (optional). This is an optional overview, created for NWR, of the weather beyond the broadcast service area for a multitude of uses, such as marine, travel, outdoor activities, construction, media rebroadcasts, etc. It normally should not exceed 1 minute in length. The region covered should include the area out to a radius of about 300 miles from the transmitter. For brevity, include in the forecast portion information for no longer than the next 36 hours. Place emphasis on problem areas associated with rain or snow, severely restricted visibility, and significant variations in temperature. A small number of larger city forecasts may be highlighted where there is a lot of listener need or interest. Alaska, Hawaii, or Puerto Rico may want to include weather to common destinations beyond the normal regional range (including mainland United States) or restrict the region to areas reachable by land. The latter would apply to U.S. coastal stations as well. Information in the regional forecast for winter storm and high wind watches and warnings should be summarized, avoiding specific details. Include specific information in other portions of the broadcasts. Avoid details on specific severe thunderstorm, tornado, flood, or flash flood watches in the regional forecast. Instead, use language or terms similar to the convective outlook about the potential for severe convective weather and flash floods. Include specific watch and warning information for severe convective weather and flash flooding for the broadcast service area in other portions of the broadcast. Use information from the latest advisory on hurricane/tropical storm watches and warnings. At a minimum, include the storm location and strength as well as the 24-hour forecast movement and strength. Local offices or Regional Headquarters should set policies or guidelines to broadcast such information for appropriate distances beyond the regional area. Temperature forecasts should be general and need not be closer than ranges of 10 degrees. Do not mention discussions of current or past weather unless relevant to the forecast conditions or if they will impact customers, such as those traveling into flooding or deep snow. c. Service Area Forecasts. This forecast should cover, at a minimum, the main population base of the broadcast service area, as covered in the zone forecast product. Also include the extended forecast modified for the broadcast service area but with more general information than the 1- to 3-day forecast. Do not include short duration warnings (e.g., for tornadoes, severe thunderstorms, and C-2   NWSI 10-1710 OCTOBER 1, 2002 flash floods) since they are carried on a separate broadcast segment. Highlight most other watches, warnings, and advisories. d. Weather Roundups. Broadcast the latest observations within the broadcast service area around-the-clock and update them at least hourly. You may also include in the roundup observations or a summary of weather conditions adjacent to the broadcast service area out to a range of 100 to 300 miles. Offices in Alaska, Hawaii or Puerto Rico, because of their large areas of coverage, may include weather observations of interest to listeners beyond 300 miles. State the time of the observations. Update or remove observed weather from the core set of messages no later than 1 hour and 20 minutes after the valid time of last observation. If for any reason it becomes impossible to update this hourly, either automatically or manually, remove the weather roundup from the broadcast until it can be updated. Some observations taken at 2- to 3-hour intervals, such as marine, still may be of some value for a longer time. If you include them in later updates, state the specific time of these observations. Use an available formatter to produce the roundup. e. Short Term Forecast. Broadcast any Short Term Forecast in effect for the broadcast service area. Refer to NWSI 10-517, Multi-Purpose Weather Products Specification.  2. Special Customer Messages. These messages are of interest to well-defined customer groups that make up a large part of the listening audience. To avoid redundancy, limit the parameters to those not included in other broadcast material. With the exception of marine forecasts and forecasts for rivers near or at flood levels, schedule special customer messages in selected and limited time periods. Special customer messages may vary during the day, week, or season as audience needs change. For example, commercial fishermen are closely tuned to marine forecasts early in the morning before leaving port. Messages for special customers include: a. Marine Forecast. Program the coastal waters forecast or Great Lakes near-shore and open lake forecast for all NWR stations listed on Marine Weather Service charts. Also broadcast offshore marine forecasts depending on listener interest. Where marine interests are dominant, the marine forecasts may make up a large portion of the broadcast cycle, or even become the core broadcast. For instance, the concept of a ""marine hour"" may be addressed through scheduling of a marine suite. Landlocked NWRs with significant public interest in marine areas that are outside the NWR broadcast service area but reasonably accessible also should schedule some marine programming. Include weather information for inland lakes in the NWR service area forecast or recreational/resort area forecast if it is not part of the marine forecast programming. You may also include tidal information and water temperature in marine programming. Remember, NWR programming is very important to mariners! C-3   NWSI 10-1710 OCTOBER 1, 2002 b. Climate Data. For a period of 1 to 3 hours every morning and evening, each station should broadcast a brief summary of the day's climate data. This information should take up less than 1 minute and should include high and low temperatures and precipitation. You may broadcast data, such as degree days and normals, solar information, and record reports. You also may program statements summarizing the monthly climatic data, dry spells, or other timely features. Recommended local broadcast times are from around 7 a.m. to 9 a.m. and 7 p.m. to 9 p.m., depending on listener feedback, AWIPS issuance times, and local staffing considerations. Hydrologic Observations and Forecasts, Tide Data, and Water Temperature. Include this information when reasonably large streams, rivers, lakes, or coasts are in or near the broadcast service area according to customer needs. Broadcast this message continuously when a hazard exists. Otherwise, broadcast this message in a limited time interval. Fire Weather Forecasts. Include this information only during the fire season and where major forest, brush, or grass fires are possible or occurring. If the forest is out of the broadcast service area, you could include the information in the regional forecast. Air Quality Information. Broadcast this information when pollution is above a critical safety level and the information is available from a local government agency. Include the time and the source of the report. Recreational Forecasts. Limit these to areas where a significant percentage of the listeners are expected to go. These forecasts should describe weather events that will enhance or restrict activity. Incorporate these forecasts, as desired, in the regional forecast. Weather-Related Road Information. Include road condition reports when there are hazards (typically in winter) and when the reports are easily available with frequent updates from an official source. The data should be summarized and require little or no writing or editing by NWS staff. If approved by the officials involved, broadcast telephone numbers of the official sources to aid motorists. Also include the time and source of the report.  c.  d.  e.  f.  g.  Example: ""AT 11:00 AM THE IOWA STATE POLICE REPORT INTERSTATE HIGHWAYS AND MAJOR US ROUTES WEST OF...ARE...."" h. Ultraviolet Index (UVI) Forecasts. WFOs that have UVI forecast sites within their NWR broadcast service area(s) should broadcast those UVI values on the appropriate NWR transmitters. C-4   NWSI 10-1710 OCTOBER 1, 2002 APPENDIX D - NWR System Basic Terms and Definitions Related to Broadcast Scheduling (Weather) Messages: The most important unit of information that the NWR system handles. A message consists of two parts: the message header (i.e., the message attributes including the message identifier) and the message content (i.e., information intended for broadcast). Messages may be live voice, digitized voice, or ASCII text. They may be input directly at the NWR system (by microphone or from floppy disk) or from an external source (i.e., AWIPS). Name of message. The NWR system uses message types analogous to legacy Automation of Field Operations and Services PILs, i.e., contains information in nine characters about the node origination site (source of the message), the product category (e.g., severe weather statement), and the specific product designator. A list of message types that are eligible to be broadcast when that suite is active. Categorized by ""General,"" ""High,"" and ""Exclusive,"" these are ascending orders of program urgency relating to restricted message types in the suite. Each suite is assigned to a program, and there will be multiple suites assigned to a single program. These programs are then assigned to a specific transmitter and result in the broadcast itself. Condition of operation if the NWR system has failed. Allows direct human-to-transmitter dissemination of information, bypassing the failed NWR system. Operation used when the NWR system is working, but an emergency situation exists that requires immediate human access to the transmitter. Cuts off current broadcast for the operator to ""go live"" with emergency information. These ""live"" messages can be recorded for subsequent insertion into the ongoing broadcast program. Also known as LACs, these are essentially Universal Geographic Codes renamed to identify their specific use by the NWR system. It is a code that identifies geopolitical areas (e.g., NWS defined zones, counties, parts of counties, and even independent cities) to which a message applies. D-1  Message Type:  Broadcast Suite:  Broadcast Program:  Backup Live:  Emergency Override:  Listening Area Codes:   NWSI 10-1710 OCTOBER 1, 2002 Message Reference Descriptor: Also known as MRD. One of the attributes required to uniquely identify messages in the NWR system. Used ultimately to determine whether a message should be replaced or not. Messages may be scheduled so they are inserted at specific time intervals. This time interval is the periodicity (i.e., a message set to broadcast every 10 minutes has a periodicity of 10 minutes). The broadcast cycle can be considered as the core set of messages currently playing, including those playing sequentially and those playing periodically. On the NWR system, the broadcast cycle is depicted as inclusive of those message types listed on the broadcast cycle screen. Broadcast cycle length is the length of time it takes to broadcast all of those messages. Use of the NWR system for manually recording and scheduling messages rather than using automated text-tovoice capability.  Periodicity:  Broadcast Cycle:  Manual Operations:  D-2   NWSI 10-1710 OCTOBER 1, 2002 APPENDIX E - NWS Action Plan for NWR Receiver Recall NWS Action Officer: Office of Climate, Water, and Weather Services Dissemination Services Manager (W/OS51) or designee. 1. The action officer will research available information and determine if the NWR receiver recall circumstances meet criteria for broadcasting non-weather-related announcements as listed in NWS Instruction 10-1710, ""NOAA Weather Radio (NWR) Dissemination,"" section 5.4. 2. If the recall circumstances do not meet the criteria, the action officer will inform NWS Headquarters and regional offices of the pertinent facts. 3. If recall circumstances meet the listed criteria, the action officer will: a. Coordinate with General Counsel and Public Affairs on a draft Special Announcement, using the Special Announcement template in Attachment 1 as guidance. Inform the weather radio manufacturer's point of contact of the planned NWS action, provide a copy of the draft Special Announcement if possible, and allow reasonable time (five business days) for comment. Distribute via email instructions and Special Announcement script to Weather Forecast Office (WFO) Warning Coordination Meteorologists and Regional Headquarters Meteorological Service Divisions (MSD). The MSDs may redistribute at their discretion. Transmit a version of the scripted Special Announcement via a national Public Information Statement with the following Communications Identifier: NOUS41 KWBC (and issuance date/time in UTC) PNSWSH e. Maintain a weather radio receiver recall link to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) on the NWS NWR receiver information Web page at: http://www.nws.noaa.gov/nwr/nwrrcvr.htm.  b.  c.  d.  4. Upon receipt of the instructions and Special Announcement script, WFOs will take the following actions as soon as practicable: a. Record and broadcast on every NWR transmitter the Special Announcement script provided verbatim without deviation. Broadcast the scripted message once each hour for a seven day period, then re-record and broadcast twice each day at 9 a.m. and 9 p.m. local time for three additional weeks. E-1   NWSI 10-1710 OCTOBER 1, 2002 b. WFOs that maintain a local NWR Web page on their WFO Web page will have a weather radio receiver recall link to the CPSC Web site. As a template, use the format seen at: http://www.nws.noaa.gov/nwr/nwrrcvr.htm. Provide the following information to telephone and personal inquiries regarding the scripted Special Announcement for the recalled weather radio: (1) (2) the recalled radio is only (manufacturer and model number). if they own a (model number) radio, they should call (manufacturer) at (phone number, including hours number is attended if not covering daytime business hours for entire U.S.) or visit the company's Web site at (company Web page). the CPSC 24-hour hot-line is 1-800-638-2772, and the CPSC Web site is: http://www.cpsc.gov.  c.  (3)  E-2   NWSI 10-1710 OCTOBER 1, 2002 Attachment 1 Weather Radio Receiver Recall Script THIS IS A SPECIAL ANNOUNCEMENT. (Manufacturer), in cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, is (voluntarily) recalling one of its Weather Radios, Model (number). (Sentence describing appearance of radio and where to find model number, if appropriate). The radios are being recalled because (reason, taken from CPSC information). (Advisory information taken from CPSC press release or received from the manufacturer such as ""consumers should not rely on the recalled weather radio to receive emergency information."")  Owners of (model number) should call (manufacturer) at (phone number, include hours number is attended if not covering daytime business hours for entire U.S.) (...or visit the company's Web site at (URL) (if Web option available)). This recall is ONLY for (manufacturer) Weather Radio (model number). This message will be repeated (hourly, daily at 9 a.m. and 9 p.m.).  E-3   NWSI 10-1710 OCTOBER 1, 2002 APPENDIX F - Dissemination Rules for National and Regional Non-Weather-Related Emergency Messages Non-Weather-Related National or Regional Emergencies Use these rules to disseminate messages from authorized government agencies for non-weatherrelated hazards affecting the Nation or large regions of the country normally consisting of several states or territories. These would include, but are not limited to, nuclear attack, earthquakes, terrorist attack, etc. The details of the rules outlined here will be amended occasionally by replacing this appendix to account for changes in NWS communications systems as the NWR system matures, and as new NWR-SAME and EAS codes are developed. The basic concept, however, should not be affected by these changes. 1. Initial Dissemination. a. b. Following a 7-second ring on NAWAS, the National Warning Center or its authorized alternate will announce the title of the WARNING message. The regional warning centers or other authorized alternate emergency operation centers (that normally operate in these situations) acknowledge the National Warning Center. The state warning points then acknowledge. The state warning points will then request acknowledgment from locations on the state warning circuits (including NWS locations). (Note for FEMA staff reading this directive: ""Activate the warning signal"" means to transmit the appropriate NWRSAME/EAS code and the 1050 Hz warning alarm tone to activate NWR receivers.) NWS offices will prepare the appropriate message for dissemination. If the message is: 1. NUCLEAR ATTACK: Get the red-bordered envelope containing the approved text for this specific hazard. The text of the message on this card may be prerecorded and stored on a diskette with the diskette sealed along with the card in the red-bordered envelope. THE TEXT OF THIS MESSAGE, HOWEVER, SHALL, UNDER NO CONDITIONS, BE RECORDED AND STORED AS A FILE ON THE NWR SYSTEM OR ANY OTHER ON-LINE NWR MESSAGING SYSTEM BEFORE ITS ACTUAL USE IN A REAL EVENT. DO NOT leave the envelope out in the open. The NWS must eliminate the possibility of a false or accidental ATTACK WARNING. OTHER NON-WEATHER NATIONAL/REGIONAL HAZARDS: Get the text of the message by either transcribing or recording it from the NAWAS. If you get the message from another authorized source, such as F-1  c.  2.   NWSI 10-1710 OCTOBER 1, 2002 AWIPS or fax, use the state or nationally established method of confirmation. d. Until updated with a more specific event code, select the NWRSAME/EAS code for Civil Emergency Message (CEM) to disseminate these messages along with ALL the appropriate geographic codes available on the NWR system (or NWR-SAME panel if it is being used in backup mode). Suspend all normal broadcast operations and trigger the NWR to send the event code followed by the 1050 Hz public warning alarm tone. At the conclusion of the 1050 Hz warning alarm tone, immediately begin READING THE MESSAGE EXACTLY AS WRITTEN. Read the message live and record it. An alternative is to play the message from the prerecorded diskette. Following transmission of the NWRSAME/EAS End-Of-Message, immediately program the NWR for this message and a short station identification to play indefinitely until manually replaced with another message. If the WFO will be evacuated, broadcast a recurring short message informing listeners that the WFO will not provide any service until further notice. Do NOT mention that the office has been evacuated.  e.  (Note: When a new event code(s) is established for this civil emergency message(s), offices should consider creating a special high priority product suite that will be activated when a message is broadcast with this specific code.) 2. Termination. a. Following a 7-second ring on NAWAS, the National Warning Center or its authorized alternate will announce the termination of the specific hazard WARNING as follows. 1. NUCLEAR ATTACK:  ""ATTENTION ALL STATIONS, THIS IS THE NATIONAL WARNING CENTER. THE ATTACK WARNING IS TERMINATED. REPEAT. THE ATTACK WARNING IS TERMINATED. WARNING CENTERS ACKNOWLEDGE."" 2. OTHER NON-WEATHER NATIONAL/REGIONAL HAZARD: A similar statement to that in 2(a)1 above will be read on NAWAS. If a message is sent by another authorized source, such as AWIPS or fax, use the state or nationally established method of confirmation. Include the source and time of the report.  F-2   NWSI 10-1710 OCTOBER 1, 2002 b. The regional warning centers or other authorized alternate emergency operations centers (which normally operate in these situations) acknowledge to the National Warning Center. The state warning points then acknowledge. The state warning points will then request acknowledgment from locations on the state warning circuits (including NWS locations). Following acknowledgment to the appropriate warning centers or as soon as the NWS office is again occupied, NWS offices will disseminate these cancellation messages. Until updated with a more specific event cancellation code, select the NWR-SAME/EAS code for Civil Emergency Message along with ALL the appropriate geographic codes available on the NWR system (or NWR-SAME panel if it is being used in backup mode). Interrupt the existing broadcast operations and cause the NWR to send the appropriate event code followed by the 1050 Hz warning alarm tone. At the conclusion of the 1050 Hz warning alarm tone, immediately begin READING THE MESSAGE EXACTLY AS WRITTEN. 1. NUCLEAR ATTACK:  c.  ""THE U.S. GOVERNMENT HAS ISSUED A TERMINATION OF THE ATTACK WARNING. REPEAT. THE U.S. GOVERNMENT HAS ISSUED A TERMINATION OF THE ATTACK WARNING. FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS ISSUED BY YOUR LOCAL GOVERNMENT. SINCE THERE MAY BE A DANGER OF RADIOACTIVE FALLOUT, YOU SHOULD NOT LEAVE A SHELTER OR PROTECTED LOCATION UNTIL YOUR LOCAL GOVERNMENT ANNOUNCES THAT IT IS SAFE TO DO SO."" 2. OTHER NON-WEATHER NATIONAL/REGIONAL HAZARD: Read the text of the message as provided by the appropriate authority. Include the source and time of the report.  Record the CANCELLATION MESSAGE and place it on the NWR routine broadcast cycle for at least 1 hour. 3. Training Exercises.  NWS WFOs will be notified of training exercises in advance by the official government source. WFO management will periodically review these instructions with all staff who might have to broadcast the warning.  F-3   NWSI 10-1710 OCTOBER 1, 2002 APPENDIX G - Use of NWR-SAME Codes and 1050 Hz Tone Alarm NWR Tone Alert and SAME activations give immediate information about life-threatening conditions. The NWR-SAME codes and 1050 Hz warning tone will precede initial broadcasts of watch and warning events, as specified below. The tones and codes may precede events with an *, at forecaster discretion or in response to customer demand. Forecasters will consider the specific situation and the need for immediate notification. Customer demand includes requirements of emergency managers and broadcasters as agreed to in state and local EAS Plans. Note: Events and their codes in bold are operational. The rest of the events/codes listed below (from the FCC 2002 EAS Report and Order), and the authorization to use them, will be implemented by NWS in 2003 after broadcasters have opportunity to upgrade EAS encoder/decoder equipment to recognize the new codes.

Washington, D.C. 20554 For recorded listing of releases and texts call 632-0002 For general information call 632-7260 99084  NEWS  Federal Communications Commission  [FCC logo]  April 3, 1978 - B REBROADCAST OF NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE TRANSMISSIONS ALLOWED The Commission has authorized AM, FM, and TV broadcast stations to rebroadcast weather transmissions originated by the National Weather Service on the 162.400, 162.475 and 162.550 MHz frequencies. The action becomes effective immediately. The Commission put four conditions on this authority:   Messages must be rebroadcast within one hour of receipt from the National Weather Service; If commercials are aired in connection with a weather rebroadcast, they must not convey an endorsement by the Government of the products or services advertised; Credit must be given to indicate the messages originated with the National Weather Service; and A station may not rebroadcast the transmissions of a Personal Radio Services station.     The FCC noted that when the Emergency Broadcast System (EBS) and the EBS two-tone attention signal were used in conjunction with a weather emergency, operations must be conducted in accordance with Section 73.935 of the rules (below) and the local or state EBS operational plans in effect for the area. It stressed emergency plans would take precedence over any monitoring and rebroadcasting conducted under the new authority.  Update notes: (1) There are four additional frequencies for NOAA Weather Radio transmissions: 162.425 MHz, 162.450 MHz, 162.500 MHz, and 162.525 MHz. (2) The Emergency Alert System (EAS) replaced the Emergency Broadcast System (EBS). (3) An updated Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) section 11.55 (shown on page H-2) replaces CFR section 73.935. (4) An updated CFR section 73.1207 is on page H-3.  H-1   NWSI 10-1710 OCTOBER 1, 2002  11.55 EAS operation during a State or Local Area emergency. (a) The EAS may be activated at the State or Local Area levels by broadcast stations and cable systems at their discretion for day-to-day emergency situations posing a threat to life and property. Examples of natural emergencies which may warrant activation are: tornadoes, floods, hurricanes, earthquakes, heavy snows, icing conditions, widespread fires, etc. Man-made emergencies may include: toxic gas leaks or liquid spills, widespread power failures, industrial explosions, and civil disorders. (b) EAS operations must be conducted as specified in State and Local Area EAS Plans. The plans must list all authorized entities participating in the State or Local Area EAS. (c) Immediately upon receipt of a State or Local Area EAS message, participating broadcast stations and cable systems must do the following: (1) State Relay (SR) sources monitor the State Relay Network or follow the State EAS plan for instructions from the State Primary (SP) source. (2) Local Primary (LP) sources monitor the Local Area SR sources or follow the State EAS plan for instructions. (3) Participating National (PN) and Non-participating National (NN) sources monitor the Local Area LP sources for instructions. (4) Broadcast stations and cable systems participating in the State or Local Area EAS must discontinue normal programming and follow the procedures in the State and Local Area Plans. Television stations must comply with Sec. 11.54(b)(7). Broadcast stations providing foreign language programming shall comply with Sec. 11.54(b)(8). (5) Upon completion of the State or Local Area EAS transmission procedures, resume normal programming until receipt of the cue from the SR or LP sources in your Local Area. At that time begin transmitting the common emergency message received from the above sources. (6) Resume normal operations upon conclusion of the message. (7) The times of the above EAS actions must be entered in the broadcast station or cable system records as specified in Sec. 11.54(b)(15), FCC Form 201 may be used to report EAS activations. (8) Use of the EAS codes or Attention Signal automatically grants rebroadcast authority as specified in Sec. 11.54(d).  H-2   NWSI 10-1710 OCTOBER 1, 2002  73.1207 Rebroadcasts. (ii) Announcement of the time signal must be made without reference to any commercial activity. (iii) Identification of the Naval Observatory as the source of the time signal must be made by an announcement, substantially as follows: ``With the signal, the time will be . . . courtesy of the U.S. Naval Observatory.'' (iv) Schedules of time signal broadcasts may be obtained upon request from the Superintendent, U.S. Naval Observatory, Washington, DC 20390. (2) National Bureau of Standards Time Signals. (I) Time signals for rebroadcast must be obtained by direct radio reception from a National Bureau of Standards (NBS) station. (ii) Use of receiving and rebroadcasting equipment must not delay the signals by more than 0.05 second. (iii) Signals must be rebroadcast live, not from tape or other recording. (iv) Voice or code announcements of the call signs of NBS stations are not to be rebroadcast. (v) Identification of the origin of the service and the source of the signals must be made by an announcement substantially as follows: ``At the tone, 11 hours 25 minutes Coordinated Universal Time. This is a rebroadcast of a continuous service furnished by the National Bureau of Standards, Ft. Collins, Colo.'' No commercial sponsorship of this announcement is permitted and none may be implied. (vi) Schedules of time signal broadcasts may be obtained from, and notice of use of NBS time signals for rebroadcast must be forwarded semiannually to: National Bureau of Standards, Radio Stations WWV/WWVB, 2000 East County Road 58, Ft. Collins, Colorado 80524. (vii) In the rebroadcasting of NBS time signals, announcements will not state that they are standard frequency transmissions. Voice announcements of Coordinated Universal Time are given in voice every minute. Each minute, except the first of the hour, begins with an 0.8 second long tone of 1000 hertz at WWV and 1200 hertz tone at WWVH. The first minute of every hour begins with an 0.8 second long tone of 1500 hertz at both stations. This tone is followed by a 3-second pause, than the announcement, ``National Bureau of Standards Time.'' This is followed by another 3-second pause before station identification. This arrangement allows broadcast stations sufficient time to retransmit the hour time tone and the words ``National Bureau of Standards Time''either by manual or automatic switching. (viii) Time signals or scales made up from integration of standard frequency signals broadcast from NBS stations may not be designated as national standard scales of time or attributed to the NBS as originator. For example, if a broadcasting station transmits time signals obtained from a studio clock which is periodically calibrated against the NBS time signals from WWV or WWVH, such signals may not be announced as NBS standard time or as having been originated by the NBS. (3) National Weather Service Messages. (I) Messages of the National Weather Service must be rebroadcast within 1 hour of receipt. (ii) If advertisements are given in connection with weather rebroadcast, these advertisements must not directly or indirect`````ly convey an endorsement by the U.S. Government of the products or services so advertised. (iii) Credit must be given to indicate that the rebroadcast message originates with the National Weather Service.  (a) The term rebroadcast means reception by radio of the programs or other transmissions of a broadcast or any other type of radio station, and the simultaneous or subsequent retransmission of such programs or transmissions by a broadcast station. (1) As used in this section, ``program'' includes any complete programs or part thereof. (2) The transmission of a program from its point of origin to a broadcast station entirely by common carrier facilities, whether by wire line or radio, is not considered a rebroadcast. (3) The broadcasting of a program relayed by a remote pickup broadcast station is not considered a rebroadcast. (b) No broadcast station may retransmit the program, or any part thereof, of another U.S. broadcast station without the express authority of the originating station. A copy of the written consent of the licensee originating the program must be kept by the licensee of the station retransmitting such program and made available to the FCC upon request. (1) Stations originating emergency communications under a State EAS plan are considered to have conferred rebroadcast authority to other participating stations. (2) Permission must be obtained from the originating station to rebroadcast any subsidiary communications transmitted by means of a multiplex subcarrier or telecommunications service on the vertical blanking interval or in the visual signal of a television signal. (3) Programs originated by the Voice of America (VOA) and the Armed Forces Radio and Television Services (AFRTS) cannot, in general, be cleared for domestic rebroadcast, and may therefore be retransmitted only by special arrangements among the parties concerned. (4) Except as otherwise provided by international agreement, programs originated by foreign broadcast stations may be retransmitted without the consent of the originating station. (c) The transmissions of non-broadcast stations may be rebroadcast under the following conditions: (1) Messages originated by privately-owned non-broadcast stations other than those in the Amateur and Citizens Band (CB) Radio Services may be broadcast only upon receipt of prior permission from the non-broadcast licensee. Additionally, messages transmitted by common carrier stations may be rebroadcast only upon prior permission of the originator of the message as well as the station licensee. (2) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, messages originated entirely by non-broadcast stations owned and operated by the Federal Government may be rebroadcast only upon receipt of prior permission from the government agency originating the messages. (3) Messages originated by stations in the amateur and Citizens Band (CB) radio services may be rebroadcast at the discretion of broadcast station licensees. (4) Emergency communications originated under a State EAS plan. (d) The rebroadcasting of time signals originated by the Naval Observatory and the National Bureau of Standards and messages from the National Weather Service stations is permitted without specific authorization under the following procedures: (1) Naval Observatory Time Signals. (I) The time signals rebroadcast must be obtained by direct radio reception from a naval radio station, or by land line circuits.  H-3"

This was the 27th flight for the Shuttle Discovery and the 3rd servicing  mission for the Hubble Space Telescope (HST).      The Hubble Space Telescope had lost a fourth gyroscope in mid November 1999 and although the craft remained safely in  orbit, it was placed in a ""safe mode"" until repairs could be completed.  Having fewer than three working gyroscopes  precluded any scientific observations, since the telescope has very precise pointing requirements.  When three of Hubble's  six gyros failed earlier this year, NASA officials decided to move forward the June 2000 Hubble servicing mission.  Three  gyroscopes must be working to meet the telescope's scientific observational requirements.  Other mission servicing activities  on  the HST included the replacement of a guidance sensor, a new transmitter, the spacecraft's computer, and some degraded  insulation.      The crew was led by Curtis L. Brown, Mission Commander and Scott J. Kelly, Pilot.  Other crewmembers were  Steven L. Smith, Mission Specialist, C. Michael Foale, Mission Specialist, John M. Grunsfeld, Mission Specialist,  Claude Nicollier, Mission Specialist (ESA), and Jean-Francois Clervoy, Mission Specialist (ESA).     With the grounding of the shuttle fleet after STS-93, several launch dates were used after the STS-103 mission was slipped  from the original September 13, 1999 date to mid-October, then late November, and finally to December:     1st Launch Date  - 11 Dec 1999 05:13Z  - Saturday PM  - Delayed at L-2 Day MMT     2nd Launch Date - 17 Dec 1999 02:18Z - Thursday PM - Delayed 24 hours at Tanking MMT earlier in day     3rd Launch Date - 18 Dec 1999 01:47Z -  Friday PM - Weather Scrub     4th Launch Date - 19 Dec 1999 01:21Z -  Saturday PM  - Delayed 24 hours at 2nd Tanking MMT earlier in day     5th Launch Date - 20 Dec 1999 00:50Z -  Sunday PM  - On Time Launch     Launch Weather:   After several delays including a weather scrub in the launch count, STS-103 had an on-time launch on the evening of the  19th of December at 6:50 PM CST.  Weather was relatively benign as mid and high level cloudiness from the Gulf of Mexico  streamed over the Florida peninsula.  West and northwest winds prevailed keeping the low levels dry and cloud free.  A weak  frontal boundary had persisted over the Florida panhandle with an associated weak low-pressure center located off of the  Carolina coast.  The prime Transoceanic Abort Landing (TAL) site was Ben Guerir since weather at Banjul, The Gambia,  was NO GO due to visibility restrictions caused by smoke and haze from a controlled burn near the airport.     Weather two days earlier had caused a weather scrub as multi-layered clouds, rain, crosswinds, turbulence, and the potential  for triggered lightning caused forecasters to issue a  NO GO  forecast.  A weak warm frontal boundary had moved into the  mid portions of Florida creating the disturbed weather, which persisted throughout the launch count.  The scrub was called  several minutes after the opening of the launch window.     Landing Weather: A weak frontal boundary over the Florida panhandle drifted southward during the day, producing an increased pressure  gradient over central Florida.  No weather was associated with this boundary as it drifted southward and virtually cloudless  skies prevailed at the SLF throughout the day.  Westerly winds persisted, causing surface winds to go out of limits for cross  winds at the de-orbit decision time for the first landing opportunity.  Winds subsided as the sun set and the subsequent landing  opportunity was observed ""GO"" at the decision time and forecast ""GO"".      The mission was cut short by two days because of launch delays and the possible Y2K impact.  Landing occurred after  almost 8 days in orbit at the Shuttle Landing Facility in Florida on December 27th at 18:01 CST (28th  00:02 UTC ).     SMG Lead Meteorologist Dan Bellue worked his 86th mission and the 16th as Lead.  Steve Sokol was the Assistant Lead and  Doris Rotzoll was the Techniques Development Unit Meteorologist.

We appreciate all the comments. This will help us to provide you more            of the information you need. We will begin to highlight flood events,            both immediately after they occur and historical floods. The Great Mississippi            Flood of 1927 is highlighted in this edition.                                           We          are nearing the end of hurricane season and have been fortunate to not          have had a hurricane in the LMRFC area. We are preparing for the upcoming          flood season by making adjustments to our forecast model. We are also          making the final changes to use AWIPS as our primary forecast tool. These          changes will allow us to make forecasts more accurately and in a more          timely manner.                                        - Dave Reed                                                                      Y2k          Readiness at the LMRFC                                 The            entire National Weather Service (NWS) including the Lower Mississippi            River Forecast Center (LMRFC)have been working since 1996 to ensure            all its systems are Y2K-ready so there is no disruptions to operations            when the new millennium arrives. In addition, other Y2K date problems            such as the leap day (February 29 in 2000) have been tested and found            to cause no problems.                        The systems which collect hydrologic and meteorologic data and the systems            which generate and disseminate forecasts at the LMRFC and NWS-wide have            all been tested and are Y2K compliant. This includes the Advanced Weather            Interactive Processing System (AWIPS), NWS River Forecast System (NWSRFS)            and numerous local programs at the LMRFC. Both the LMRFC and NWS have            a great deal of confidence there will be no interruption of our services            to the public or other customers.                             The            NWS has worked with telecommunications and power companies which the            NWS rely upon to ensure they are also Y2K ready. All NWS offices are            equipped with HAM radios, cell phones, and emergency power generators            as back up.                        In addition to successful tests on individual systems, the NWS conducted            a series of integrated end-to-end tests in early 1999. In this test,            all of its systems were connected to ensure all systems are able to            exchange and process hydrologic and meteorologic data properly when            Y2K occurs. The tests included many of the LMRFC and NWS partners and            customers and were successful as all systems functioned properly, with            no anomalies found.                                      - Eric Jones                                                                        XSETS          - the new standard for river forecast products                                  On            November 15, 1999, LMRFC officially changed to a new RVF (river forecast)            product format using the XSETS (Shef Encoded Time Series) software.            XSETS, developed by the Arkansas Basin RFC, is supported nationally            and makes full use of the AWIPS hydrologic software. This eliminates            the need to maintain site-specific software at LMRFC and helps to standardize            RVF products across River Forecast Centers.                       The            format of each forecast has changed but the content remains the same.            At this time, forecasts will continue to be issued in 24-hour time steps.            However, river forecasts are now being .ER SHEF encoded in contrast            to the previous .B code.                       The            following changes became effective on the above date:  1.)  the            SHEF-encoded 7AM observed river stages in the RVF product have been            dropped. The  latest  available observed stage, is, however, provided            in commented form;  2.)  multiple versions of the same RVF product            per WFO (e.g., JANRVFJAN) are transmitted each day. The content of each            RVF version now contains forecasts for only a specific river basin or            Forecast Group (FGROUP) as is defined in the LMRFC NWSRFS model. Users            will have to review previous versions to see all river/flood forecasts            issued to a single                             WFO.            For example for WFO JAN, we issue a separate JANRVFJAN product with            forecasts for only the Lower Yazoo basin; other versions contain forecasts            for the Upper Pearl, Lower Pearl, Pascagola, Big Black, and Lower Ouachita            basins (i.e., 6 versions);  3.)  flood only points are not included            in the RVF unless that location is expected to reach or exceed flood            stage within the forecast period;  4.)  crest information is shown            on a separate line in .AR SHEF code. The date/time of above/below flood            stage are provided as comments;  5.)  flood stages and warning            stages (if available) are shown as comments;  6.)  basin average            QPF is .E SHEF encoded in 6-hour amounts for the periods ending at 18Z,            00Z, 06Z, and 12Z; and,  7.)  a Y2K compliant Date Creation (DC)            code is now used having the form DCyyyymmddhhmm.

In 1927, one of the greatest natural disasters of the United States            occurred with the great Mississippi River Flood. This flood, a result            of above average rainfall from August, 1926, through April, 1927, over            the entire Mississippi River drainage of over 1.25 million square miles,            had a tremendous impact socially and on the commerce of the United States            and was a watershed event in flood control.                       The            Rainfall.  Above average rainfall in late Summer of 1926 soaked much            of the Mississippi Basin. During the Fall, heavy rains produced above            average flows on the Mississippi during a period of normally low flows.            In December through April, an average of over 12 inches of rain fell            over the entire Mississippi  Basin,            more than 2 inches above normal. The climax came in the second week            of April when southern Missouri and most of Arkansas received over 9            inches of rainfall. During one day that week, New Orleans received over            14 inches of rain in just 19 hours. This excessive rainfall fell on            already saturated grounds. The runoff produced added to already swollen            rivers to produce one of the most devastating floods of all time.                        Flood            Crests and Flooding.  Above average flows were recorded during the            Fall of 1926 on the Mississippi River. In December, record flooding            occurred in the Tennessee and Cumberland Rivers. The Ohio River and            the Red River flooded in January. A flood crest from the Upper Mississippi            moved past the confluence of the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers in March            and now all major tributaries were contributing above normal flows.            From excessive rainfall the first three weeks of April, a second crest            from the Tennessee and Ohio Rivers that was lower than those earlier            in the year occurred in mid-April and caused Cairo, IL, to crest at            56.4 feet. The stage at Cairo was the highest measured                             since            records began in 1844 and has only been exceeded 3 times since. As this            flood wave moved downstream, it combined with record flows on the Arkansas            and high flows on the Red Rivers to produce disastrous flooding to the            Gulf of Mexico. The flood waters passed New Orleans on May 15 when the            Mississippi River crested at 20.7 feet there. Note that New Orleans            had reached a stage of 21.0 feet about 3 weeks prior to that date when            the Caernarvon Levee south of New Orleans was dynamited to allow the            river to get to the Gulf faster.                       During            the height of the flood, the Mississippi River in northern Louisiana            was over 80 miles wide. The levee system, thought to be sufficient to            control any flood on the Mississippi River, was decimated with over            120 crevasses or breaks. These crevasses played an important role in            reducing flood levels downstream and are estimated to have reduced the            peak stage at New Orleans by over 6 feet. Over 600,000 people were driven            from their homes and damages totaled over $230 million dollars in 1927.            It is estimated that 246 people died in the flood.                       Changes            as a Result.  This flood changed the nation's approach to flood control.            Prior to 1927, it was believed that levees alone could control floods            on the Mississippi and reservoirs upstream were not needed. The Federal            Government had provided some money for flood control but there had never            been a comprehensive plan to protect the country from floods. As a result            of this flood, the Flood Control Act of 1928 was enacted giving the            Corps of Engineers responsibility for flood control on the Mississippi            River. Upstream reservoirs were built on the major tributaries, levees            were to be constructed using engineering principles under the direction            of the Corps of Engineers, and floodways were built to divert flood            waters from the main channel. All these measures were completed before            the flood of 1937. The levees held during this flood even though the            flows during that flood exceeded those of the flood of 1927.                       Significant            social and economic changes resulted from the flood. Author John Barry            wrote  The Rising Tide  detailing the events surrounding the flood            and the social and economic impacts. See this book for more details            on the flood and the changes the it wrought.                                       - Dave Reed                                                              National        Climate Data Online                          The          NOAA/National Climatic Data Center announces the Climatic Data Online          (CDO) system, with full period of record digital data for 5 types of climatic          data:                                U.S. daily surface data                       U.S. monthly surface data            U.S.            hourly precipitation data            U.S.            15-minute precipitation data            Global            monthly surface data                            Data from as early as the late 1800's are available, and each dataset          is updated as soon as the latest data are available.

GX018-08-3266206	NOAA      News  ||  NOAA Home Page       ||  Back to Story                 NOAA'S TOP U. S. WEATHER,      WATER AND CLIMATE EVENTS OF THE 20TH CENTURY          The nation’s weather,      water, and climate scientists of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric      Administration (NOAA) had the difficult job of selecting a few      of the most notable tornadoes, floods, hurricanes, and climate      events that have marked the 20th Century in the United States.      Factors taken into consideration included an event’s magnitude,      meteorological uniqueness, as well as its economic impact and      death toll. Some of NOAA’s best meteorological minds gave      a perspective based upon their areas of expertise. The events      are found in no particular order and the list is by no means      exhaustive.          Galveston Hurricane, 1900          On September 8, 1900, a 20-foot      storm surge, associated with one of the most powerful hurricanes      of the century, inundated Galveston Island in Texas. More than      8,000 people died, making this the deadliest natural disaster      in U. S. history. The Galveston office of the U. S. Weather Bureau      later recalled: “Sunday, Sept 9, 1900, revealed one of the      most horrible sights that ever a civilized people looked upon.      About 3,000 homes, nearly half of the residence portion of Galveston,      had been completely swept out of existence, and probably more      than 6,000 people had passed from life to death during that dreadful      night. The correct number of those who perished will be probably      never be known, for many entire families are missing. Where 20,000      people lived on the 8th, not a house remained on the 9th, and      who occupied the houses may, in many instances, never be known.”          Technology Sidebar:  In those days, forecasters relied      on ship reports, tidal measurements, barometric readings and      the color of the sky as warnings of impending tropical storms.      It was known that a hurricane was nearby in the Gulf of Mexico,      but forecasters lacked the ability to track storms. Today’s      advancements in technology and science allow NOAA’s National      Weather Service and National Environmental Satellite, Data, and      Information Service to give a forecast for the year’s tropical      storm activity before the hurricane season starts in June. This      year’s hurricane season forecast was the agency’s most      accurate yet.          Dust Bowl, 1930s          An ecological and human disaster      caused by the impact of years of drought on misused farmland      throughout 100 million acres of the Great Plains. The Dust Bowl,      which occurred during the Great Depression, indelibly changed      the lives of every Plains resident at the time, and has continued      to impact land use practices today. The Dust Bowl is often referred      to as “The Black Blizzard” and “Black Roller”      due to the reduction of visibility to a few feet in dust storms.      The climate event forced the migration of hundreds of thousands      of families to other states, looking for a better situation.      This was the subject of John Steinbeck’s classic tale, The      Grapes of Wrath.          Technology Sidebar:  Seventy years later, significant advances      have occurred that enable scientists to better understand climate-      scale weather events. During the summer of 1999, NOAA and its      federal partners unveiled a new tool known as the National Drought      Monitor, which not only summarizes the extent and intensity of      drought nationwide, but forecasts whether droughts will strengthen      or weaken. In cooperation with the Agriculture Department, NOAA      posts these weekly assessments on the Internet ( http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/predictions/threats )      to allow agricultural interests to prepare for drought. In addition,      NOAA will have the technology to forecast the probability of      heat waves two weeks in advance by summer 2000.          Super Tornado Outbreak,      1974          Within a 17-hour period of      April 3-4, a strong weather system produced 148 tornadoes from      the Great Lakes region southward through the Ohio and Tennessee      Valleys into Mississippi and Alabama. The outbreak killed 315      people and injured 6,142. As many as six tornadoes were rated      F-5 on the Fujita Scale. At the time, damage estimates surpassed      $600 million.          Technology Sidebar:  In the early 70’s, forecasters      used early computer technology to produce basic forecast model      to identify weather patterns to predict severe weather. Still      satellite images were not clear enough, and radar images only      identified rainfall patterns associated with storm systems giving      them the inability to predict the formation of a tornado, and      usually were unable to issue warnings before a tornado was sighted      or touched down. Today, increased understanding by skilled forecasters,      and new tools such as the high-resolution Doppler radar, allow      detection of tornadic circulations within thunderstorms, and      make it possible to issue warnings when tornadoes are in their      earliest stages. The high-speed Advanced Weather Interactive      Processing System (AWIPS), brings data from Doppler radar, satellites,      automated weather observations and computer-generated numerical      weather models into one workstation, enabling NWS meteorologists      to issue faster, more accurate forecasts. All 121 U. S. Weather      Forecast Offices use AWIPS daily.          Hurricane Camille, 1969          Making landfall at Pass Christian,      Miss. with wind gusts estimated to near 200 mph and a storm tide      measured at 24.6 feet, Hurricane Camille claimed 256 lives and      caused $1.4 billion in damages ($6.2 billion in current dollars).      Camille was only the second Category 5 hurricane to strike the      U. S. It’s relatively small size and extreme winds made      it an unusually intense storm, leaving a narrow, destructive      path. More than 5,000 homes were destroyed and 13,000 others      suffered damage. The storm surge was so high that one survivor      was washed over Pass Christian without encountering any utility      poles, buildings, or trees. The storm had a “double- barrel”      effect as it caused record inland flooding after turning northeast      through Tennessee, Kentucky, and Virginia before exiting into      the Atlantic. The storm dumped a record 28 inches of rain in      central Virginia causing massive flooding and rain-induced landslides.      Virginia counted 113 dead from a storm that came not from the      Atlantic, but from the west.          Technology Sidebar:  Camille was the first major land falling      hurricane whose approach was followed closely by geostationary      satellite images. Later, an operational network of weather satellites      provided all NWS forecast offices with crucial data to track      tropical storm activity. Since Camille, the NOAA’s National      Hurricane Center has improved the accuracy of its hurricane track      forecasting by one percent each year, allowing forecasters to      stretch warning lead time from 18 to 24 hours.          The Great Midwest Flood,      1993          The costliest flood in U. S.      history, huge stretches of the Missouri River (from Pipe Stem      Reservation, North Dakota to St. Louis) and the Upper Mississippi      River (from Minneapolis to St. Louis) overflowed their banks      due to heavy rainfall, claimed 48 lives and caused nearly $18      billion in damage. More than 15 million acres across nine states      were inundated, prompting 54,000 people to evacuate. Observations      found that 95 points along the two rivers exceeded previous floods      of record, many by 6 feet or more. Nearly 500 points along the      rivers and tributary systems exceeded flood stage at some time      during the event, and although the most intense flooding occurred      from June to August, some areas remained above flood stage for      five straight months.          Technology Sidebar:  Since this catastrophic flood, the      NWS has developed a sophisticated, high- technology flood forecasting      and water management tool called the Advanced Hydrologic Prediction      Service (AHPS). A recent two-year test in the Des Moines, Iowa      river basin has proven AHPS to accurately provide flood forecasts      hours, days, and even weeks before the waters rise. The agency      will soon field AHPS in the upper Midwest and Ohio River basin,      and with additional funding, hopes to implement the service nationwide.          El Niño Episodes      1982-83 and 1997-98          In the later part of the 20      th Century, NOAA scientists learned more about how these climate      episodes shape global weather patterns. The latest El Niño      has been called the “Event of the Century” for its      bold impacts on extreme weather events. One hundred year rainfall      records were set in the Southeast, one hundred year warm temperature      records were set in the upper Midwest, and a series of strong      storms, which included early season tornadoes in Florida, hammered      the east coast states during the 1997-98 El Niño episode.          Technology Sidebar:  The 1997-98 El Niño was a milestone      for the NWS’ long-range weather and climate forecast abilities.      Scientists at NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental      Prediction saw the recent El Niño coming as early as six      months in advance, and began issuing its forecast. That forecast,      according to a report published by the American Meteorological      Society, prompted California to conduct major mitigation efforts,      which helped save the state about $1 billion in losses.          Hurricane Andrew, 1992          The costliest hurricane in      U. S. history, Hurricane Andrew raked across southern Florida      and Louisiana, causing 23 deaths and $25 billion in damages.      More than 138,000 homes were destroyed and 86,000 lost their      jobs. Some say the storm permanently altered the area’s      economy and forced the closure of Homestead Air Force Base, which      was leveled by wind damage. Had Andrew crossed the Florida coast      just 10 miles further to the north, it would have devastated      downtown Miami. Andrew serves as the benchmark when discussing      potential devastation to populated coastal areas.          Technology Sidebar:  The NWS provided one of its most accurate      hurricane forecasts thanks to computer models that predicted      the initial landfall south of Miami and the subsequent landfall      near New Orleans three days in advance. Many of the NWS’      dedicated cooperative weather observers in South Florida braved      Andrew’s intense and deadly conditions and continued to      send weather information to forecasters right up until the time      when their instruments, or homes, were destroyed.          New England Hurricane, 1938          This was one of the most destructive      and powerful storms ever to strike southern New England, and      was the first tropical storm to hit the heavily populated area      of the Northeast in modern times. The storm roared ashore over      Long Island, N. Y. at nearly 60 miles per hour, at the time of      high tide on September 21 st . This created a deadly tidal surge,      which even submerged downtown Providence, R. I. under 20 feet      of water. Hurricane force winds were felt throughout New England,      with a gust to186 miles per hour recorded at the Blue Hill Observatory      in Milton, Mass. The Great New England Hurricane of 1938 was      responsible for nearly 600 deaths and 1,700 injuries in Southern      New England, along with catastrophic property damage estimated      at $400 million.          Technology Sidebar:  As the storm, later called the “Long      Island Express,” neared Long Island, and three hours before      high tide, residents reported seeing a   thick bank of fog between 25 and 40 feet above      the water. The fog bank turned out to be a massive wall of water,      or a storm surge. A storm surge equals the magnified effects      of an unusually high tide and forward speed of the storm. The      New England Hurricane narrowly missed Manhattan by 55 miles to      the east. Forensic hurricanologists agree that New York City      would have been devastated had the storm been a few miles more      to the west. Today, NWS storm surge experts use high- tech, 3-      D models that simulate the impacts of a hurricane’s incoming      waters and help prepare communities living along the coasts.          Superstorm, March 1993          A gigantic low pressure system      screamed up the eastern seaboard, bringing everything from a      storm surge to the western coastline of Florida to nearly 60      inches of snow in some parts of the Appalachian. This storm will      long be remembered for paralyzing the entire eastern seaboard,      at one point shutting down every airport on the Washington/ Boston      corridor. The superstorm was responsible for 79 direct deaths      and more than 600 injuries, along with $2 billion in damage.      It was one of the most well-forecasted storms in history, with      timely warnings that limited the death toll of this fierce weather      system.          Technology Sidebar:  At the time of the 1993 Superstorm,      the NWS’ ability to predict accurate snowfall amounts was      37 percent. In 1997, the accuracy improved to 45 percent. The      NWS is striving to reach a goal of 75 percent snowfall accuracy      by 2005. While this storm will be long remembered for its heavy      snow in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast, it impacted every state      in the south with torrential rains, a deadly coastal surge, tornadoes      and hail.          Tri- State Tornado, 1925          The deadliest tornado in U.      S. history swept down the Ohio Valley on March 18, cutting a      219- mile long swath in areas of southeast Missouri, southern      Illinois and southwest Indiana. At times, some observers said,      this mammoth tornado was a huge, black wall of debris, moving      at speeds toping 60 mph. This tornado claimed 695 lives and holds      the record for the most lives lost in one location–234–in      Murphysboro, Ill. The tornado also holds the U. S. record for      the longest continuous track on the ground, and the longest duration—3½      hours. It is also the third fastest forward- moving tornado at      62 mph.          Technology Sidebar:  The Tri-State Tornado occurred more      than 20 years before the first official tornado warning issued      at Oklahoma’s Tinker Air Force in 1948. In 1925, the NWS,      then called the U. S. Weather   Bureau,      had no ability to provide advance warning of tornadoes. However,      the Tri- State Tornado helped to raise awareness among meteorologists      about the prevalence of a “tornado season” and paved      the way for a formal tornado warning program.          Oklahoma/ Kansas Tornado      Outbreak, May 3- 4, 1999          This was the most expensive      tornado outbreak in U. S. history. In less than 48 hours, a total      of 74 tornadoes touched down across the two states, with as many      as four tornadoes from different storms on the ground at once.      An F- 5 tornado, the strongest on the Fujita Tornado Scale, tracked      for 40 miles, skirting south of Oklahoma City through the communities      of Moore and Chickasaw. The tornadoes killed 42 people, injured      800, and caused $1 billion in damage, including the destruction      of portions of Oklahoma City.          Technology Sidebar:  The event proved the effectiveness      of the modernized National Weather Service and its improved tornado      warning system where the average lead time was 21 minutes (up      from an 11 minute average), with some areas receiving more than      30 minutes notice before being hit. NOAA storm researchers estimate      that more than 600 people would have died in the absence of warnings.      During this tornado outbreak, a mobile Doppler radar on wheels      recorded the strongest winds ever measured on earth—318      mph.          The Great Okeechobee Flood      and Hurricane of 1928          An immense Category 4 Hurricane      with 150 mph winds, rain and resulting flooding caused a death      toll of 1,836 in Florida, and another 1,575 in the Caribbean.      Some estimate the death toll as high as 3,500. The hurricane      fell just short of establishing a new record low for barometric      pressure at 27.43 inches (a reading of 27.37 inches was measured      in 1919). Only the Galveston Hurricane of 1900 (over 6,000 deaths),      the Johnstown Flood of 1889 (2,200 deaths) and the two hurricanes      of 1893 (2,000 deaths each) are likely to have caused more deaths      in the United States.          The Storm of the Century,      Nov. 1950          The first storm ever forecasted      using NWS numerical model programs, brought heavy snow and hurricaneforce      winds across 22 states. The storm killed 383 lives and caused      $70 million in damages.          Florida Keys Hurricane,      1935          The 1935 “Labor Day Hurricane,”      which struck the Florida Keys was the first of only two Category      5 hurricanes to make landfall in the U. S. A relief train was      sent from Miami to rescue Keys residents and several hundred      World War I veterans workings in the area. On its return trip,      a storm surge—estimated at 15 to 20 feet—swept all      the cars of the train from the tracks, drowning hundreds. All      told, more than 400 people died as a result of this hurricane.          New England Blizzard, 1978          A rapidly intensifying low      pressure center stalled off the southern New England coast for      more than 24 hours. Blizzard conditions and coastal flooding      were the big stories in this storm, as hurricane force winds      drove an angry sea onshore, causing great damage to coastal property.      Snowfall amounts on the order of 30 to 38 inches fell in and      around the Boston metropolitan area. The storm paralyzed New      England for a week.

Those in the affected area are urged to be                    ready to take action if a flash flood warning is issued or flooding                    is observed. These watches are issued for flooding that is expected                    to occur within 6 hours after the heavy rains have ended.                                          Flash Flood Warning                     - A flood warning issued for life/property threatening flooding                    that will occur within 6 hours. It could be issued for rural                    or urban areas as well as for areas along the major rivers.                    Very heavy rain in a short period of time can lead to flash                    flooding, depending on local terrain, ground cover, degree of                    urbanization, amount of man-made changes to the natural river                    banks, and initial ground or river conditions. Dam breaks or                    ice jams can also create flash flooding.                                          Flash Flood Statement                     - A Flash Flood Statement is issued to inform the public about                    current flash flood conditions. These statements usually contain                    river stage information if major streams or rivers are involved.                                                             Urban/Small Stream Flood Advisory                     - Alerts the public to flooding which is generally only an inconvenience                    (not life-threatening) to those living in the affected area.                    Issued when heavy rain will cause flooding of streets and low-lying                    places in urban areas. Also used if small rural or urban streams                    are expected to reach or exceed bankfull. Some damage to homes                    or roads could occur.

They                    are caused by stationary or slow-moving thunderstorms that produce                    heavy rain over a small area. The Black Hills are especially                    vulnerable to flash floods, where steep terrain and narrow canyons                    can funnel heavy rain into small creeks and dry ravines, turning                    them into raging walls of water. Even on the prairie, normally-dry                    draws and low spots can fill with rushing water during very                    heavy rain.                                                       •                      Flash                    Flood -  Flash                    floods can strike any time and any place with little or no warning.                    In mountainous or flat terrain, distant rain may be channeled                    into gullies and ravines, turning a quiet streamside campsite                    or wash into a rampaging torrent in minutes .                                                                        •                     Flooding                                         - Of all the tricks in mother nature's weather bag, the deadliest                    in the United States today is flooding and flash flooding.

The Great Flood of 1993 was unprecedented in magnitude, extent, and     impact. This year marks the 10 year anniversary of possibly the most costly     and devastating flood to impact the United States. By the time the flooding     finally subsided in October, the Great Flood had inundated 20 million acres     in nine states, damaged or destroyed approximately 50,000 homes, and forced     around 54,000 people to be evacuated at some time during the event. The     economic impact was staggering. The total cost of the flood was around $20     billion.     Transportation was severely impacted. Barge traffic was halted on the     Missouri and Mississippi Rivers for nearly two months. Railroad traffic came     to a standstill in the Midwest. Ten commercial airports were flooded. Truck     traffic either stopped or had to be rerouted due to closed bridges and     flooded roadways.     Affected locks, dams and levees had to be inspected and/or repaired after     the flood. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers reported that 40 of 229 federal     levees and 1,043 of 1,347 non-federal levees were overtopped or damaged     during the flood. (As noted in the NOAA, Natural Disaster Survey Report.)     The Weather Service Office in Paducah had not yet been spun up to a     full-service Weather Forecast Office as part of the National Weather Service     Modernization. As such, hydrologic responsibility during the Great Flood     remained at the state Weather Service Forecast Offices located for Missouri     in St. Louis and for Illinois in Chicago.     Got photos?

We will try to return any photos sent by mail.     Please send only photos taken in our area, from Thebes to New Madrid.     We will post them here for all to see.      Why did it happen?        There were many factors that set the stage for the summer flooding.     The fall of 1992 was a wet one, saturating soils and raising stream levels.     The winter that followed left a normal to above normal snowpack in the     central United States. Heavy rainfall in late March, on top of a melting     snowpack, fed the headwaters of the Mississippi River. At this same time,     the northern reaches of the Missouri River were becoming saturated.      The final factor that led to the record flooding was an unusually     persistent weather pattern from June into early August. The Bermuda High (an     area of high pressure that sets up off the southeast coast of the United     States and helps to steer weather systems across the eastern half of our     country) was stronger and further north and west than usual. This prevented     storms from following a more normal track across the Ohio Valley. Instead,     storm systems regenerated in the Central Plains following a northeast track     toward the Great Lakes. Record amounts of rainfall fell across the nine     states of the Northern and Central Plains. Some locations recorded over 4     feet of rain!      So what did happen in our area?        During the Great Flood of 1993, flooding occurred at approximately     500 Weather Service forecast points, and record flooding occurred at 93     forecast points across the nine-state region. Many locations were above     flood stage for three to five months straight! The Mississippi River at Cape     Girardeau was above its 32 foot flood stage for 126 days.      In our region, flooding occurred mainly on the Mississippi River.     Water from the Mississippi River backed into the Big Muddy and Ohio Rivers     causing Murphysboro and Cairo to rise above flood stage. Below are graphs     plotting the daily 8 am stage from May 1 through August 31.                                                                                                              New record stages were reached at Cape Girardeau, Missouri and Thebes, Illinois. Below is a table and a graph comparing the crests reached in 1993 compared with the record crests at the time.

In Perry County, Missouri, a break in the southern portion of the levee surrounding the Bois Brule Bottoms broke, and water behind the levee flooded the approach to the Chester Bridge. This closed the bridge for over a month. In Cape Girardeau, Scott, Mississippi, and New Madrid Counties, nearly 100,000 acres of rich farmland flooded with a loss of around $22 million. Many unprotected houses and towns along both sides of the river flooded. In Illinois, around 2,400 people were evacuated in Jackson, Union, and Alexander Counties.           Where can I read more?   In the past 10 years, the National Weather Service has made many improvements in the science of   river forecasting , as well, as our warning and dissemination services. Advanced Hydrologic Prediction Service (AHPS) will take hydrologic modernization even further. The beginning phases of AHPS are now available on WFO Paducahs website at  http://www.crh.noaa.gov/pah .

A tally of the votes and comments by the panel of 17 meteorologists and hydrologists made this a most interesting endeavor. Some of the events come as no surprise that they rate so high, as they were the molders of some of our local history, good or bad. Some of our more notable weather episodes locally made the national Top 10 list revealed by National Weather Service Headquarters before Christmas. The New Orleans/Baton Rouge service area comprises of all parishes east of the Atchafalaya River, the Mississippi coastal counties of Hancock, Harrison and Jackson, along with Pearl River, Walthall, Pike, Amite, and Wilkinson Counties.     What is considered a significant event? Some try to apply a formula of dollars lost, lives lost or harmed, or some other measure. Perhaps the most important factor is the number of individual lives that are touched or affected from an event - a loved one lost, an entire town destroyed, widespread ruin. In the case of approaching Hurricane Georges, an unprecedentedly large portion of the population had to evacuate a vulnerable coastline, a memory that will linger on local minds for quite some time. Several of the events were from generations past, but the stories still remind us of what can happen in our area.    Throughout the 1900's, Southeast Louisiana and Southern Mississippi experienced a vast array of weather episodes. At the close of this century, it helps to reflect on what has happened in the past, how much we have learned and improved upon, and how to prepare for what can potentially happen in the future. Before revealing the list of top vote getters, many worthy events were considered, none of which were least important for their impact on the local communities. Here are several of those episodes for honorable mention, in chronological order.    September 27, 1906: Pascagoula, Mississippi Hurricane     A violent hurricane moved onshore near the Pascagoula River, producing a storm surge in excess of 10 feet from Jackson County, MS to the westernmost Florida peninsula. A total of 134 lives were lost from Pascagoula to Pensacola, FL during this hurricane.       September 24, 1956: Hurricane Flossy     This hurricane completely submerged Grand Isle with its surge and beared down on the Greater New area. Local residents remember evacuating to shelters with fear of the 1947 hurricane on their minds.              October 3, 1964: Hurricane Hilda       Hilda reached maximum strength about 350 miles south of New Orleans and headed into Southeast Louisiana. Winds to 135 mph were recorded at Franklin, LA. Despite a massive evacuation effort, 38 fatalities were accounted. Most notable was the killer tornado spawned at Larose, LA, claiming 22 of the 38 lives and injuring 200 others.        Spring 1973: Mississippi River Flood     A heavy snow thaw in the Ohio River and upper Mississippi River Valleys sent the Lower Mississippi River into extensive flood. The City of New Orleans was threatened, thereby prompting the opening of the Bonnet Carre and Morganza Spillways - a first.        April 1979 and 1983: Pearl River Floods     These two major floods inundated many towns and cities along the Pearl River for weeks at a time. In both instances, portions of Interstate 10 over the Pearl River basin was covered by flood waters between Slidell and the Mississippi State Line.       Summer/Fall 1985: Hurricane Season     An unforgettably active season which saw an erratic moving Hurricane Elena threaten the Mississippi Gulf Coast, turn towards Florida, only to loop back and make landfall at Ocean Springs, MS. That season also saw a minimal Hurricane Juan spin erratically across south Louisiana soaking the region with flooding rains and storm surge inundation for several days. Many parishes in southeast Louisiana were declared federal disaster areas.       August 26, 1992: Hurricane Andrew     After striking lower Florida as a Category 4 hurricane, it moved into south Louisiana. While approaching Louisiana, Andrew spawned a deadly tornado in Laplace, LA, killing 2 people and causing $1.5 million damage several hours prior to Andrew's landfall.        December 31, 1996: Dense Fog pile-up     Dense sea fog over the coastal region provided hazardous driving conditions that resulted in a 100 vehicle chain reaction pile-up on the I-10 twin spans over eastern Lake Pontchartrain. The pile-up claimed one life with 47 others injured. The Interstate was closed down all day, impacting the arrival of Sugar Bowl attendees from Florida into the Crescent City.        September 27, 1998: Hurricane Georges     Large scale evacuation of the City of New Orleans and the Mississippi Gulf coast as Georges approaches the mouth of the Mississippi River, ultimately making landfall at Biloxi, MS. That evacuation effort was the largest effort in U.S. history at the time, overwhelming the infrastructure of the region for several hundred miles. The Louisiana Superdome was used as a last resort evacuation shelter for the first time.        Top Ten    In the interest of minimizing subjectivity the following listing is broken into what were considered events number 6 through 10 in chronological order and events 1 through 5 in chronological order.    September 19, 1947: Mississippi Gulf Coast and New Orleans Area Hurricane     This Category 4 hurricane in south Florida proceeded towards the Mississippi and Louisiana coast as a Category 3 hurricane, moving into Lake Borgne and over downtown New Orleans. Tides rose to 12 feet at Biloxi, Bay Saint Louis and Gulfport, MS. A total of 51 lives were lost, 17 in Florida, 12 in Louisiana and 22 in Mississippi. Total damage in 1990 dollars was more than $700 million. A storm surge of 16 feet occurred in the Slidell area of Lake Pontchartrain while most of downtown New Orleans was flooded extensively due to tidal surges from Lake Pontchartrain.        December 31, 1963: New Orleans Area Heavy Snow     A most unusual weather event for the otherwise balmy and mild climate of the Gulf Coast. A low pressure system that developed in the southern Gulf of Mexico and moving towards the Florida peninsula interacted with intruding cold air across the Deep South to produce heavy snow along the Gulf Coast. New Orleans Audubon Park measured four and a half inches of snow while the Slidell area measured nine inches. This was the greatest snowfall to occur in the Greater New Orleans area this century. Portions of the region became snowbound due to a lack of snow removal equipment.       May 3, 1978: New Orleans Flash Flood     A squall line approaches the Greater New Orleans area from the west, intersecting a stationary front that was settled over the city. The result was a morning of torrential rains in excess of 10 inches, with rates of 2 inches per hour at  times. Coffins were lifted from ground level tombs, along with empty gasoline tanks at service stations in the New Orleans area. The city's population was at a virtual standstill as nearly all main arteries were flooded or inaccessible well into the evening hours.        December 22-26, 1989: Arctic Outbreak     The most significant cold spell of the century for the Deep South. New Orleans experienced 64 consecutive hours at or below 32 degrees Fahrenheit and a total of 81 out of 82 hours below freezing. A total of 15 hours were below 15 degrees with the lowest reading of 11 degrees on the morning of the 23 rd . A low temperature of 8 degrees was recorded at Baton Rouge. Snow and sleet paralyzed transportation systems where as much as two to four inches of snow accumulated in Lafourche and Terrebonne Parishes. Snow and ice covered the ground in New Orleans. The greatest impact was on breakage of water pipes in homes and businesses. Over 100 fires resulted in the New Orleans area within a 24 hour period due to a loss of water pressure and improperly utilized heating sources. Ice formed over shallow lakes and waterways where commercial fishing took heavy losses. Five weather related deaths occurred in the service area during this rare Arctic outbreak.         May  8-9, 1995: Widespread Torrential Rainfall and Flood     A cold front approaching from the west stalled after moving east of the Baton Rouge area. An abundance of tropical moisture over southeast Louisiana and coastal Mississippi was ignited by the approaching front with a nearly continuous train of thunderstorms pounding over the same area from Morgan City, across the metropolitan New Orleans area, and from Mandeville to upper Harrison County, MS on the night of the 8 th . A large swath of 4 to 12 inches of rain fell that night with a maximum of 12.4 inches at the New Orleans International Airport. The entire area affected experienced widespread flooding of homes and businesses and the metro area was halted to a standstill as the Interstate system had portions inundated and nearly all major arteries were impassible.  The second night saw similar results, only displaced about 10 to 20 miles farther north as a new round of repeat thunderstorms developed over northern Lake Pontchartrain, moving across the southern half of St. Tammany Parish and continuing across the lower counties of Mississippi. A large area of 10 to 16 inches of rainfall extended from extreme eastern Tangipahoa Parish all the way to the Mississippi-Alabama state line. Widespread flooding of streets and record flooding of many streams and creeks occurred in the Lake Pontchartrain Drainage Basin as well as the Gulf Drainage. The second night saw a maximum of 15.8 inches reported at the Abita Springs Fire Tower. The two day maximum was a bucket survey measurement of 27.5 inches in extreme northeastern part of Hancock County, MS near Necaise. In Louisiana, a maximum of 24.46 inches was measured at Abita Springs. In all, the event lasted for 40 hours and damaged 44,500 homes and businesses. Seven deaths were directly related to the flooding. Eleven parishes and counties were declared federal disaster areas where $3.1 Billion in insurance claims were accounted. This was the costliest single non-tropical weather related episode to affect the United States on record.       TOP FIVE    April 24, 1908: Amite, LA to Purvis, MS killer Tornado     Excerpt from ""The Tornado Project"" (credit to Thomas Grazulis) -- ""This major tornadic event touched down near ""Weiss"" in NW Livingston Parish, and moved ENE. Two people were killed at ""Dennis Springs"". In St. Helena Parish, two were killed near Montpelier. The worst damage in Louisiana took place in Amite, Tangipahoa Parish, where the path was said to have been over two miles wide. At least 29 people were killed in the town of Amite, and four others died south of Wilmer. Eleven people were injured in the Aurora-Franklinton area of Washington Parish, and nine people were killed near Pine. Crossing into Mississippi near Balltown, the tornado killed two people in Marion County...continuing onward into Forest County 8 miles south of Hattiesburg."" Fifty-five people were killed in the town of Purvis as most of the town was leveled to the ground. In all 143 people were killed and 770 injured making this the seventh deadliest tornado event in United States history.       September 29, 1915: Grand Isle Hurricane     This devastating Category 4 hurricane moved over Grand Isle and into the Greater New Orleans area. Winds were measured at 140 mph at Grand Isle. 275 people were killed across Southeast Louisiana as the storm moved up the Mississippi River. In Leeville, LA, only 1 building out of 100 survived the storm.       1927 Great Mississippi River Flood     Mississippi River floods have been recorded since DeSoto's expeditions of 1543. Man has tried to tame this major artery of the United States ever since. Federal legislation was enacted on May 15, 1928, with the passage of the Flood Control Act as a result of the Great 1927 Flood. An unusually wet period from August 1926 through the Spring of 1927 soaked the middle Mississippi Valley. A period of excessive rainfall during the first three weeks of April proved to be a disastrous climax to the rainy period. In 19 hours on April 14-15, the New Orleans area received over 14 inches of rainfall, while much of Arkansas and southern Missouri received over 9 inches in a one week period. The lower tributaries of the Mississippi River were experiencing record flooding along the Arkansas and Red Rivers, contributing to high flood crest moving down the mainstem. Baton Rouge exceeded its flood stage of 35 feet on February 12 th  and remained above flood stage until July 14 th , a period of 153 days. The river at Baton Rouge crested at 47.8 feet on May 15 th , nearly 2 feet higher than its previous record set in 1922, and a record that still exist today. On April 25 th , the stage at New Orleans was at a record 21.0 feet. The main flood crest had not reached the city yet, and fears were mounting that this major commerce hub of the era was in danger of being inundated. By order of the Governor, the levee was dynamited at a point on the river 14 miles south of New Orleans, at Caernavon on April 29 th . The effort lowered the river level one-half foot before the crest passed New Orleans on May 15 th  at 20.7 feet. Then entire levee system along the reach of the Mississippi River was decimated, and a large government effort was employed to restore and construct new and better structures for flood control. These efforts helped launch Commerce Secretary Herbert Hoover into the White House in the ensuing presidential election. The impact of this flood was 16.5 million acres of land in seven states inundated and 246 people died. Over 600,000 people were driven from their homes and damages totaled $230 million in 1927 standards. The river was 80 miles wide in some places.        September 9, 1965: Hurricane Betsy      The New Orleans area was still recovering from the affects of Hurricane Hilda of October 1964. Concerns were growing about the city's vulnerability to a hurricane moving just west of the Mississippi River towards the Greater New Orleans area. During the latter days of August 1965, a hurricane was moving across the Atlantic Ocean and began to make a seemingly harmless curve well of the Florida Atlantic coast, which would ultimately see the storm go out to sea. However, Betsy had different ideas and made a complete loop some 350 miles east of St. Augustine, Florida and was now heading south towards the Grand Bahamas. On September 7 th , Betsy began to move due west and crossed extreme south Florida and the Florida Keys as a Category 3 hurricane. Betsy then accelerated to the northwest and moved into Barataria Bay on the evening of the 9 th . This placed New Orleans on the worst side of the storm and sending the storm surge up the Mississippi River and into Lake Pontchartrain. A storm surge of 10 feet caused New Orleans to suffer its worst flooding since the hurricane of 1947 and proved inadequacies in the levee protection system surrounding the area. The resulting levee improvements spared the city from similar flooding in 1969 when Hurricane Camille impacted the area. Betsy claimed 81 lives and was the first United States hurricane to produce over $1 billion damage, thus becoming known as Billion Dollar Betsy. The affects of Betsy were also felt well inland after landfall. The potent hurricane moved up the Mississippi River into Baton Rouge, where maximum winds were measured as East-Northeast at 58 mph with gusts to 92 mph.        August 17, 1969: Hurricane Camille     Only one of two Category 5 hurricanes to landfall on a United States coastline. Hurricane Camille evolved from an Atlantic tropical wave near the Cape Verde Islands that traveled into the western Caribbean Sea before developing into a tropical storm on August 14 th . After crossing the extreme western tip of Cuba, she took aim on the Mississippi River delta. On the morning of the 17 th , Camille rapidly intensified into a Category 5 system and the entire Mississippi and southeast Louisiana areas braced for her fury as warnings were extended to include the entire Mississippi Gulf coast and the New Orleans area. Hurricane reconnaissance aircraft reported a central pressure of 901 millibars, or 26.63 inches of mercury, and winds estimated at 190 mph near its center. Harrison County Civil Defense Director, Wade Guice, proceeded with a door-to-door evacuation effort in the Gulfport and Biloxi communities. Many adhered his advice, others didn't. On the night of the 17 th , Camille moved just east of the mouth of the Mississippi River then continued towards the eastern side of Bay St. Louis, making landfall at Pass Christian, MS. Winds sustained over 200 mph at her peak but accurate measurements were not attainable due to failure of wind equipment from the extreme winds. An unprecedented storm surge of 25 feet crashed into the Mississippi Coast, inundating everything within two miles of the beach from Henderson Point to Biloxi. Party-goers at the Richelieu Apartments in Pass Christian met their fate when this multiple story structure was leveled. Ocean-going ships were washed ashore and smaller vessels littered the area well inland. Train trestles and bay bridges were washed out and large segments of U.S. Highway 90 were removed from the fierce tides and erosion. Deaths in Mississippi accounted for 135 of the 258 total. Louisiana had 9 deaths. Over 73,000 families suffered losses in Mississippi and Louisiana. Damage estimates exceeded $1.4 billion along the Mississippi and Louisiana Gulf Coast. After devastating the Gulf Coast, Camille continued into the Appalachians where many deaths occurred to extensive rainfall and widespread flash flooding. After 30 years, many natives and long-time residents remember vivid details of this major event of our United States and local history. Local reminders still exist, such as empty slabs where homes once stood, the St. Timothy Episcopal Church bell tower in Biloxi, and a beached tugboat named the 'Hurricane Camille' now serves as a souvenir shop along Highway 90. Hurricane Camille was also selected as one of the top ten weather events of the century for the entire U.S.                                                                                                Local Climate Water & Weather Topics:   Current Hazards ,  Current Conditions ,  Radar / ,  Satellite ,  Climate ,  Weather Safety ,  Contact Us                     National Weather Service  New Orleans/Baton Rouge Weather Forecast office  62300 Airport Rd.

Those in the affected area are urged to be                    ready to take action if a flash flood warning is issued or flooding                    is observed. These watches are issued for flooding that is expected                    to occur within 6 hours after the heavy rains have ended.                                          Flash Flood Warning                     - A flood warning issued for life/property threatening flooding                    that will occur within 6 hours. It could be issued for rural                    or urban areas as well as for areas along the major rivers.                    Very heavy rain in a short period of time can lead to flash                    flooding, depending on local terrain, ground cover, degree of                    urbanization, amount of man-made changes to the natural river                    banks, and initial ground or river conditions. Dam breaks or                    ice jams can also create flash flooding.                                          Flash Flood Statement                     - A Flash Flood Statement is issued to inform the public about                    current flash flood conditions. These statements usually contain                    river stage information if major streams or rivers are involved.                                                             Urban/Small Stream Flood Advisory                     - Alerts the public to flooding which is generally only an inconvenience                    (not life-threatening) to those living in the affected area.                    Issued when heavy rain will cause flooding of streets and low-lying                    places in urban areas. Also used if small rural or urban streams                    are expected to reach or exceed bankfull. Some damage to homes                    or roads could occur.

They                    are caused by stationary or slow-moving thunderstorms that produce                    heavy rain over a small area. The Black Hills are especially                    vulnerable to flash floods, where steep terrain and narrow canyons                    can funnel heavy rain into small creeks and dry ravines, turning                    them into raging walls of water. Even on the prairie, normally-dry                    draws and low spots can fill with rushing water during very                    heavy rain.                                                       •                      Flash                    Flood -  Flash                    floods can strike any time and any place with little or no warning.                    In mountainous or flat terrain, distant rain may be channeled                    into gullies and ravines, turning a quiet streamside campsite                    or wash into a rampaging torrent in minutes .                                                                        •                     Flooding                                         - Of all the tricks in mother nature's weather bag, the deadliest                    in the United States today is flooding and flash flooding. Over                    the past 30 years, flood waters have claimed an annual toll                    of nearly 140 lives in this country.                                                                            •                      Natural                     Hazards   -  With Safety Rules                    For Tornadoes, Hurricanes, Floods, Flash Floods, Thunderstorms/Lightning,                    Winter Storms WATCH: Severe weather is possible within the designated                    watch area.                                                      •                      National Weather Service                    Low-Water Crossing Flood Safety Video                     -  The NWS, as a public service, provides                    a video (at nominal cost) to disseminate motorist safety information.

Since this new methodology has not been thoroughly tested in an operational environment, it poses significant risks to National Weather Service operations.  With no guarantee that it will improve forecast accuracy or increase productivity, what is the motivation for implementing such a massive change in the way forecasts are generated?  The answer is that weather forecast information can be much better communicated to users when the forecast can be visualized graphically via modernized products (as in Figure 1).   Defining the weather forecast digitally offers great benefits to users who need comprehensive weather information in order to make better decisions.  Once the forecast is expressed as a set of gridded weather elements, users can view this information in virtually unlimited ways, and tailor products to match their specific needs.  For example, people traveling by car are interested in weather parameters that affect driving conditions such as precipitation, wind, and visibility.  Anyone interested in recreational sailing would be concerned with wind and waves.  A system that disseminates forecast data in this way not only gives users the information they need, but also avoids cluttering products with irrelevant information that might be confusing.           Figure 1.  Modernized product of temperature values; each color represents a value.         Even after the Grapical Forecast Editor (GFE) is operational nationwide, weather forecast offices will continue to disseminate alpha-numeric products based on these grids on a regular schedule.  However, with recent advances in high-speed communications such as the World Wide Web and wireless technology, an opportunity arises to fundamentally change the way forecast information is delivered to consumers.  Rather than accessing a fixed set of products from each forecast office, users interested in the forecast could invoke interactive applications that query a digital forecast database and be able to precisely specify the type and location of any forecast information desired, and then generate a graphical or textual representation of the future state of the weather.  In this article, we discuss some of these applications from the users perspective.     Graphical Products     Because gridded datasets contain a large amount of detail, graphical products are a natural way to view them since they can accurately represent this detail.  Graphical products can take on many forms, such as image, contour analysis, time-series, or as combinations of these types.     Image Products   The simplest way to convey digital gridded data is via an image or picture.  Figure 1 is an example of such a product, generated by the ifpGIF program.  In this example, the color of each picture element represents a temperature value.  Using the map background as a reference, a user of this product can locate the area of interest and deduce the temperature.  A simple time animation of temperature images informs the user of how the temperature is expected to change with time.     Vector Graphics   Vector graphics can denote magnitude and direction on the display.  This type of product has the added advantage, in that graphics can be overlaid on top of a different image product to produce a combined display of different weather elements.  Figure 2 displays a wind field as a graphic plotted on top of an ocean wave height field.  This is useful to a sailor in locating the best combination of moderate winds and low wave height.     Grids   Some customers need detailed predictions of weather conditions as input to complex algorithms.  These ""high-end"" customers would receive the gridded data directly, in order to run their applications that require high-resolution surface weather elements. Examples of this type of user include a laboratory running a fire behavior model, a state transportation department interested in predictions of road conditions, and any agency that predicts pollution dispersion.     Interactive Products   One of the best advantages of expressing the forecast in digital form is that customers need not be limited (as they are today) to a specified set of products.  The digital nature of the forecast information makes it possible for interactive applications to generate forecast displays of weather-specific user needs.  An interface prompts the user for location, time, and weather element type and the application displays the information on the screen.  Users can see precise information of interest, and the display is not cluttered with data they consider irrelevant.  A few examples follow to illustrate this concept.            Figure 2.  Displays of wind fields as a graphic plotted on top of an ocean wave height field.           Point Forecast in Time   Many times users are interested in knowing what time is ideal for planning a particular activity that could be affected by the weather.  For instance, a user who might be planning an outdoor gathering can specify the location on a map and a time period to a point forecast application.  The application then fetches the data interactively and generates a display of the weather forecast at that location.  The display in Figure 3 illustrates the forecast as a series of graphical objects to indicate weather conditions as a function of time.           Figure 3.  Display of the forecast as a series of graphical objects to indicate weather conditions as a function of time and place.          Traveling Forecast   A traveler would not want a forecast at a fixed point, but one that moves in space and time.  The traveling forecast allows the user to indicate a route and a time of departure and arrival, and the traveling forecast application retrieves the forecast data just like the point forecast, but with location and time as a variable.  Figure 4 shows a depiction of the weather as the traveler is enroute.           Figure 4.  The Graphical Forecast Viewer (GFV) can interface forecast information that moves in space and time.            Graphical Forecast Viewer   At FSL we have developed a Java-based application, the Graphical Forecast Viewer (GFV), that combines several of the examples discussed above.  The GFV displays plan (map) view images that animate over time, generates a point forecast as a time-series plot, and allows the user to probe a specific point or area to get more detailed weather and geographical information.  (Figure 4 shows one possible interface to the GFV.)  The GFV is based on the same type of software modules as those comprising the FSL-developed Local Data Acquisition and Dissemination (LDAD) system [see the November 1997 issue of the  FSL Forum ].  Users of the GFV can look at any component of the forecast in several different formats.  Weather information can be overlaid in any combination, giving the user maximum flexibility for obtaining weather forecast information.  In combination with its geographical information, the GFV is a very powerful tool for millions of people (everyone at some time or another) whose decisions are based on the weather forecast.     Audio Products   Interactive products are not limited to those that can be visualized.  An automated telephone system could be used to disseminate weather information as well.  After dialing, a caller ID system could identify the callers location, retreive the appropriate weather information, and deliver the weather forecast for that area in the form of a computer-generated voice. Customers interested in a forecast for a location other than their own could enter a zip code to identify a new location.       Interactive Text   Despite the gridded approach to forecasting, text products will continue to be distributed from every forecast office. This does not necessarily imply that every product received by users originates from the prescribed list.  The concept of querying the forecast database still applies, even for text products.     Summary      The primary motive for changing the method by which forecasters express the weather forecast from text to digital is so that users of these datasets can make faster and more accurate weather-related decisions.  The digital nature of this information allows applications to disseminate the data in a variety of ways so that customers with varying degrees of requirements can be easily accommodated.  The National Weather Service has invested great resources into its modernization over the past 10 years.

GX004-92-12070991	"About the Gridded       Forecast Database         Written by Mark Mathewson, Forecast Systems Laboratory (FSL)         http://www.fsl.noaa.gov         Graphical Forecast Editor  |               Product Generation  |   Product Suite                                        Graphical Forecast Editor        The Graphical Forecast Editor (GFE) presents gridded forecast fields to meteorologists for editing, and they can select the weather elements, sources, and grids to view, and  use a variety of tools to edit the data.  The capabilities of the GFE include views of the data with three editors – grid inventory, spatial, and temporal, as well as spatial interpolation and basic and advanced editing tools (Figure 1).      In providing an inventory view of weather elements, the Grid Manager shows the valid time of each grid for each weather element.  Using the editing capabilities in the Grid Manager, meteorologists can copy derived model data into the forecast, adjust the valid time of grids, and interpolate data from one grid to another.    The Spatial Editor displays one or more grids with underlying map backgrounds.  Meteorologists can control the appearance of the display by varying the color enhancement curves, set of displayed weather elements, and contour intervals.  In addition, zoom/pan, overlay, and animation capabilities are provided.        The Temporal Editor provides a view of weather elements in a time-series representation that allows forecasters to quickly view and edit how a weather element changes over time.  It also shows the value of multiple weather elements over a point or geographical area depicted on the Spatial Editor (shown in Figure 1).                                                                                       Figure 1.   The GFE includes views of data using three editors: Grid Manager (an inventory of weather elements), Spatial Editor (grids in plan view), and Temporal Editor (a time-series representation of weather elements).                                                                              Before a forecast can be completed, it must be defined for all times in the forecast period.  The Spatial Interpolation capabilities of the GFE allow the forecaster to ""fill-in"" and interpolate data from one grid to another.  For example, if the forecaster defines a wind grid at 1200 UTC and another at 2000 UTC, the system can provide hourly interpolation for all periods between 1200 and 2000 UTC.    Basic and Advanced Tools  – Forecasts are edited through a series of basic and advanced editing tools that allow users to define an area on the Spatial Editor and then apply an editing action to that area.  Basic tools are used to assign specific values to that area, slightly adjust existing values up or down, and smooth out gradients.  The defined areas on the Spatial Editor need not be drawn by hand, but can be calculated based on other grids.  For instance, forecasters may direct the system to select an area where temperatures are below freezing, and if the precipitation type is shown as rain, they can change it to snow.        Advanced tools known as ""Smart Tools"" add meteorological concepts into the system and have full access to all model and terrain data.  Forecasters can enhance the Quantitative Precipitation Forecast (QPF) based on vertical motion.  The Smart Tools can be used to calculate the vertical motion from the high-resolution terrain and surface winds, and then apply a correction factor to the QPF.  Meteorologists can use these tools to compare a particular forecast field to others and define their relationship.  ""Smart Scripts"" can be used to chain the Smart Tools together for more efficient use.      As mentioned before, configurability is the most important function of Smart Tools.  It is impossible to write a fixed set of tools that will work for everyone everywhere.  Instead, we have written a basic set of tools and provided a framework in which forecasters can write their own version of Smart Tools in a powerful language called Python.  (See a later article on the development of Smart Tools.)      A contour-editing tool is also provided to make small corrections to existing grids by redrawing portions of contours, or to generate a completely new grid from scratch by drawing a series of contours.                          Product Generation        Another very needed feature of the GFESuite technology is automatic product generation, the last of the three steps of the IFPS process.  To reiterate, the first step in forecast preparation is initialization of the digital database, usually with objective forecasts derived from at least one numerical model.  Since the forecast is defined in far greater detail than was possible in the traditional system, comprehensive monitoring and verification systems now alert forecasters of any meteorological inconsistencies, or if the forecast deviates from the observations.  In the second step, forecasters interactively modify weather elements from which many products can be automatically composed and formatted.  Once the set of gridded forecast elements is defined, products can be generated with little or no forecaster intervention.                              Product Suite        The IFPS/GFESuite product suite is tiered in order to accommodate various user levels: high-end users, ""modern"" users, and low-end users (Figure 2). High-end users could receive gridded products (such as raw forecast numbers) that would be used to generate additional products or serve as input to numerical models. Modern users could access the Web to display imagery and graphics that represent the forecast.  Some of these products could be interactive: a click on a map would bring up a forecast tailored to that exact location.  Low-end users could only access the digital forecast in the form of simplified text products.        The flexible and tailorable product generation capabilities of the GFESuite provide three types of output products: grids, graphics, and text (Figure 2).                                                                                 Figure 2.              IFPS tiered product suite to accommodate different levels of users.                                                                          The very detailed gridded datasets can be best viewed in graphical form, which can accurately represent the detail. Graphical products can be customized to provide imagery, contour analysis, time series, domains, and a combination of some or all of these attributes. The graphical output from GFESuite is available as Portable Network Graphics (PNG) imagery, which is compatible with all popular Web browsers. The text capability provides full access to the forecast grids using data sampling techniques.  Formatted table-type products that depict weather elements, areas, and times can be constructed with minimal effort.  Free-flowing text products can also be generated, and a text language translator will translate the forecasts from English to French and Spanish.  Interactive products, available through a Web interface, allow users to query the grids for specific information; for example, users can click on a specific location for a customized worded or graphical forecast.

D uring                                        severe weather, National Weather Service                                        forecasters can interrupt the routine weather                                        broadcasts and insert special warning messages                                        concerning imminent threats to life and                                        property. The forecaster can also add special                                        signals to warnings that trigger ""alerting""                                        features of specially equipped receivers.                                        In the simplest case, this signal activates                                        audible or visual alarms, indicating that                                        an emergency condition exists within the                                        broadcast areas of the station being monitored                                        and alerts the listener to turn up the volume                                        and stay tuned for more information. More                                        sophisticated receivers are automatically                                        turned on and set to an audible volume when                                        an alert is received.

NOAA                                        Weather Radio capability is currently available                                        on some automobile, aircraft, marine, citizens                                        band, and standard AM/FM radios as well                                        as communications receivers, transceivers,                                        scanners, and cable TV.                                         B y                                        nature and by design, NOAA Weather Radio                                        coverage is limited to an area within 40                                        miles of the transmitter. The quality of                                        what is heard is dictated by the distance                                        from the transmitter, local terrain, and                                        the quality and location of the receiver.                                        In general, those on flat terrain or at                                        sea, using a high quality receiver, can                                        expect reliable reception far beyond 40                                        miles. Those living in cities surrounded                                        by large buildings and those in mountain                                        valleys with standard receivers may experience                                        little or no reception at considerably less                                        than 40 miles. If possible, a receiver should                                        be tested in the location where it will                                        be used prior to purchase.

The capabilities of the GFE include views of the data with three editors  grid inventory, spatial, and temporal, as well as spatial interpolation and basic and advanced editing tools(Figure 1). In providing an inventory view of weather elements, the Grid Manager shows the valid time of each grid for each weather element.  Using the editing capabilities in the Grid Manager, meteorologists can copy derived model data into the forecast, adjust the valid time of grids, and interpolate data from one grid to another.   The Spatial Editor displays one or more grids with underlying map backgrounds.  Meteorologists can control the appearance of the display by varying the color enhancement curves, set of displayed weather elements, and contour intervals.  In addition, zoom/pan, overlay, and animation capabilities are provided.    The Temporal Editor provides a view of weather elements in a time-series representation that allows forecasters to quickly view and edit how a weather element changes over time.  It also shows the value of multiple weather elements over a point or geographical area depicted on the Spatial Editor (shown inFigure 1).                                                                                Figure 1.  The GFE includes views of data using three editors: Grid Manager (an inventory of weather elements), Spatial Editor (grids in plan view), and Temporal Editor (a time-series representation of weather elements).                                                                 Before a forecast can be completed, it must be defined for all times in the forecast period.  The Spatial Interpolation capabilities of the GFE allow the forecaster to ""fill-in"" and interpolate data from one grid to another.  For example, if the forecaster defines a wind grid at 1200 UTC and another at 2000 UTC, the system can provide hourly interpolation for all periods between 1200 and 2000 UTC. Basic and Advanced Tools   Forecasts are edited through a series of basic and advanced editing tools that allow users to define an area on the Spatial Editor and then apply an editing action to that area.  Basic tools are used to assign specific values to that area, slightly adjust existing values up or down, and smooth out gradients.  The defined areas on the Spatial Editor need not be drawn by hand, but can be calculated based on other grids.  For instance, forecasters may direct the system to select an area where temperatures are below freezing, and if the precipitation type is shown as rain, they can change it to snow.    Advanced tools known as ""Smart Tools"" add meteorological concepts into the system and have full access to all model and terrain data.  Forecasters can enhance the Quantitative Precipitation Forecast (QPF) based on vertical motion.  The Smart Tools can be used to calculate the vertical motion from the high-resolution terrain and surface winds, and then apply a correction factor to the QPF.  Meteorologists can use these tools to compare a particular forecast field to others and define their relationship.  ""Smart Scripts"" can be used to chain the Smart Tools together for more efficient use. As mentioned before, configurability is the most important function of Smart Tools.  It is impossible to write a fixed set of tools that will work for everyone everywhere.  Instead, we have written a basic set of tools and provided a framework in which forecasters can write their own version of Smart Tools in a powerful language called Python.  (See a later article on the development of Smart Tools.) A contour-editing tool is also provided to make small corrections to existing grids by redrawing portions of contours, or to generate a completely new grid from scratch by drawing a series of contours.               Product Generation Another very needed feature of the GFESuite technology is automatic product generation, the last of the three steps of the IFPS process.  To reiterate, the first step in forecast preparation is initialization of the digital database, usually with objective forecasts derived from at least one numerical model.  Since the forecast is defined in far greater detail than was possible in the traditional system, comprehensive monitoring and verification systems now alert forecasters of any meteorological inconsistencies, or if the forecast deviates from the observations.  In the second step, forecasters interactively modify weather elements from which many products can be automatically composed and formatted.  Once the set of gridded forecast elements is defined, products can be generated with little or no forecaster intervention.                      Product Suite The IFPS/GFESuite product suite is tiered in order to accommodate various user levels: high-end users, ""modern"" users, and low-end users(Figure 2). High-end users could receive gridded products (such as raw forecast numbers) that would be used to generate additional products or serve as input to numerical models. Modern users could access the Web to display imagery and graphics that represent the forecast.  Some of these products could be interactive: a click on a map would bring up a forecast tailored to that exact location.  Low-end users could only access the digital forecast in the form of simplified text products.    The flexible and tailorable product generation capabilities of the GFESuite provide three types of output products: grids, graphics, and text(Figure 2).                                                                          Figure 2.             IFPS tiered product suite to accommodate different levels of users.                                                            The very detailed gridded datasets can be best viewed in graphical form, which can accurately represent the detail. Graphical products can be customized to provide imagery, contour analysis, time series, domains, and a combination of some or all of these attributes. The graphical output from GFESuite is available as Portable Network Graphics (PNG) imagery, which is compatible with all popular Web browsers. The text capability provides full access to the forecast grids using data sampling techniques.  Formatted table-type products that depict weather elements, areas, and times can be constructed with minimal effort.  Free-flowing text products can also be generated, and a text language translator will translate the forecasts from English to French and Spanish.  Interactive products, available through a Web interface, allow users to query the grids for specific information; for example, users can click on a specific location for a customized worded or graphical forecast.

The capabilities of the GFE include views of the data with three editors – grid inventory, spatial, and temporal, as well as spatial interpolation and basic and advanced editing tools (Figure 1).      In providing an inventory view of weather elements, the Grid Manager shows the valid time of each grid for each weather element.  Using the editing capabilities in the Grid Manager, meteorologists can copy derived model data into the forecast, adjust the valid time of grids, and interpolate data from one grid to another.

The periods of record vary by station, with some stations having data back to about 1900, although many begin around the 1948 time frame. The data files are complete through 1997. The directory has a data file for each state, along with one file for several stations outside the U.S. such as Guam and Puerto Rico (filename 'others.txt'). There are currently over 8000 NWS and cooperative weather stations active and included in this directory, with many more currently inactive stations also included.   The files consist entirely of ASCII character data. A header record begins each file with the station number, station name, state abbreviation, year, 12 months (Jan - Dec), and 'annual' appearing from left to right. The monthly and annual precipitation amounts are in inches and hundredths (e.g., 1122 = 11.22 inches, 522 = 5.22 inches, 55 = .55 inches). A value of '9999' indicates missing or incomplete data for that month, with '99999' indicating missing for the yearly total. The monthly total is only presented when all data were available and validated for that month. Likewise, the annual total is only presented when every monthly total for the year was available. These data are taken from NCDC digital database TD3220, which also contains additional elements such as temperature and snowfall. These additional elements are available off line on tape or diskette.    Known data problem:  Precipitation is known to actually be in units of millimeters (rather than hundredths of inches) for several stations outside the U.S. mainland. We believe that this problem is confined to Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands during the early 1960s.   If you have any technical questions about these data, or to order additional data, send a message to  ncdc.orders@noaa.gov  or call 828-271-4800. We'll be glad to assist in any way.

NWR broadcasts National Weather Service warnings,                watches, forecasts and other hazard information 24 hours a day.                              Working with the  Federal                Communication Commission's  (FCC)  Emergency                Alert System , NWR is an ""all hazards"" radio network, making                it your single source for comprehensive weather and emergency information.                NWR also broadcasts warning and post-event information for all types                of hazards--both natural (such as earthquakes and volcano activity)                and environmental (such as chemical releases or oil spills).

The periods of record vary by station, with some stations having data back to about 1900, although many begin around the 1948 time frame. The data files are complete through 1997. The directory has a data file for each state, along with one file for several stations outside the U.S. such as Guam and Puerto Rico (filename 'others.txt'). There are currently over 8000 NWS and cooperative weather stations active and included in this directory, with many more currently inactive stations also included.   The files consist entirely of ASCII character data. A header record begins each file with the station number, station name, state abbreviation, year, 12 months (Jan - Dec), and 'annual' appearing from left to right. The monthly and annual precipitation amounts are in inches and hundredths (e.g., 1122 = 11.22 inches, 522 = 5.22 inches, 55 = .55 inches). A value of '9999' indicates missing or incomplete data for that month, with '99999' indicating missing for the yearly total. The monthly total is only presented when all data were available and validated for that month. Likewise, the annual total is only presented when every monthly total for the year was available. These data are taken from NCDC digital database TD3220, which also contains additional elements such as temperature and snowfall. These additional elements are available off line on tape or diskette.    Known data problem:  Precipitation is known to actually be in units of millimeters (rather than hundredths of inches) for several stations outside the U.S. mainland. We believe that this problem is confined to Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands during the early 1960s.   If you have any technical questions about these data, or to order additional data, send a message to  ncdc.orders@noaa.gov  or call 828-271-4800. We'll be glad to assist in any way.

GX022-89-9574140	"By Mark Mathewson   FSL Forum - December, 2000    Introduction   The Graphical Forecast Editor Suite (GFESuite) is a series of programs that provide an end-to-end interactive forecast preparation capability. The GFESuite components derive surface sensible weather elements from model data, manage the forecast data and metadata in a database, provide viewing and editing capability of the forecast data, and generate output products in a variety of formats (Figure 1). The GFESuite software was incorporated into the AWIPS build 5.0 as part of the Interactive Forecast Preparation System (IFPS) and is scheduled for release to the field early 2001.     Derivation of Surface Elements   Without the capability to derive surface weather elements from numerical models, meteorologists would not be able to take advantage of the high-resolution numerical models that exist on AWIPS and would have to create each forecast grid from scratch. The GFESuite derivation component provides the following capabilities:     Derivation of surface weather elements that are not provided by the numerical model, but are needed in generating digital forecasts     Enhancement of model resolution in time and space to provide more detailed forecasts      Introduction of terrain datasets to improve the accuracy of surface weather element generation.    Most of today’s models do not generate surface weather elements, such as surface temperature, sky or cloud condition, and precipitation type. These are the elements, however, that make up virtually every type of forecast available for the general public, aviator, fire weather manager, and mariner. In the past, meteorologists would rely on training and experience to interpret the model in determining the surface weather elements, and then would express these surface weather elements in text form, with little spatial and temporal resolution. Using the GFESuite, model data can be interpreted and the required surface weather elements can be derived while preserving model resolution and features.  Model resolutions are typically 30 to 40 kilometers with 6 hourly time steps, which are not sufficient for high-resolution forecasts. The gridded forecasts from the GFESuite are nominally 10-kilometer resolution and available hourly. The derivation component of the GFESuite uses interpolation in both time and space to effectively bring the model resolution down to that required for generating detailed gridded forecasts.   The introduction of high-resolution terrain datasets is essential in the successful derivation of certain weather elements, such as surface temperature. The model terrain (Figure 2) is usually quite smooth due to its spatial resolution and may not be sufficient to represent the actual terrain (Figure 3). Hence, the model's surface temperature field can be incorrect simply because of the difference between the model and the actual terrain (Figures 2 and 3). In areas of flat terrain, this is not generally an issue; however, in areas of mountainous terrain, the difference in terrain can be as great as 1,000 meters, resulting in errors of several degrees. (A later article provides more detail about the derivation of sensible weather elements from models.)      Figure 2. Screen showing model terrain grid at 30–40 km resolution. Compare to GFESuite 1-km topography grid in Figure 3.        Figure 3. GFESuite 1-km topography grid showing same terrain area as in Figure 2.    Architecture and Database Server   The GFESuite architecture uses the same database server as the central repository of all data. In other words, the GFE is not configured for a particular grid domain and set of weather elements; instead it connects to the database server and determines that information through a series of queries and replies. This architecture design ensures that all components of the GFESuite are working harmoniously with the same set of information and eliminates the possibility of redundant configurations that can get out of synchronization. The result is a system that is easy to configure and maintain, and provides storage of gridded forecast and derived fields, map backgrounds, topography data, and metadata. Clients can access AWIPS model data and are notified when data change. The database features a locking mechanism to prevent simultaneous editing on the same grid. The GFESuite network client/server provides access to the database via the Remote Procedure Call (RPC). Figure 4 shows data stored with RPC clients connected to the GFESuite.      Figure 4. GFESuite database includes gridded forecast and derived fields, map backgrounds, and metadata, accessible to clients via the Remote Procedure Call.    The GFESuite database is used primarily for the storage and retrieval of gridded fields. A grid consists of a series of scalar, vector, or discrete parameters that represent the weather over a geographic area for a given time. For instance, a particular sky condition grid might depict the percent of cloud cover over Colorado for early afternoon.  Multiple grids depicting the sky condition would comprise a weather element and represent one element of the forecast over many time periods. Collections of weather elements make up a database source, such as FCST, which holds the work copy of the gridded forecast, or OFFICIAL, which holds the officially released digital forecast, or ETA, which holds the weather elements derived from the Eta numerical model. Typically the database contains a set of weather elements for public forecasting that include surface temperature, dewpoint temperature, sky condition, freezing level, surface wind, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, quantitative precipitation forecast, probability of precipitation, snow accumulation, and weather coverage, type, and intensity. Additional weather elements exist for aviation, fire weather, and marine forecasting.  The underlying structure of the gridded fields is in an indexed netCDF data format designed to economize disk space. The format is hidden from users, who cannot directly access the data files. A hierarchy of data sources, weather elements, and gridded fields in the database is enforced (see diagram in Figure 5).      Figure 5. GFESuite database hierarchy of data sources, weather elements, and gridded fields.    The GFESuite database server contains many other types of information used by other GFESuite components. Detailed 1-kilometer terrain information for the entire world is available and used for display on the GFE as well as in the derivation of surface weather elements.  Geopolitical, river, highway, and other map backgrounds are provided to the GFE and product generation programs. The map backgrounds are stored in shapefile format, thus allowing users to customize and install additional maps. Specific configuration information and other metadata are also stored in the server for use in the GFE.  The GFESuite has been designed for forecast offices where more than one forecaster will be simultaneously editing grids, which is usually the case at most NWS forecast offices. The database server prevents simultaneous editing of the same forecast grids and lockout of grids while editing. It also provides notification of data changes, and when forecasters save their edited gridded forecast, all other GFEs connected to the same database server will see the changes immediately.   Of course AWIPS model data are important for the GFESuite, not only in the derivation of sensible weather elements but also for display and editing decisions in the GFE. AWIPS model data are available through the interface provided by the GFESuite database server. Since model data typically cover a much larger domain at lower resolution than the gridded forecast fields, these data are interpolated and mapped to the higher resolution of the forecast fields on retrieval.  The GFESuite database server architecture uses RPCs (see Figure 4) and Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) to communicate with clients. It does not rely on file systems mounted through the Network File System (NFS), resulting in straightforward installation and configuration and enhanced flexibility. Since RPCs are used, the networking capability of the GFESuite is intrinsically part of the system. Generally in the NWS environment, all components of the GFESuite run in the same network domain. However, a very useful feature of the GFESuite is that its various components can communicate with any database server anywhere in the world, provided the network connectivity is present. The networking capability allows for access to forecasts at other sites and intersite coordination and forecast boundary reconciliation.   Users can easily configure the database to customize components to meet their specific needs. That is, the list of data sources, weather elements and their attributes, resolution, and domain of the grids can be varied using a single configuration file.   Graphical Forecast Editor   The Graphical Forecast Editor (GFE) presents gridded forecast fields to meteorologists for editing, and they can select the weather elements, sources, and grids to view, and use a variety of tools to edit the data. The capabilities of the GFE include views of the data with three editors – grid inventory, spatial, and temporal, as well as spatial interpolation and basic and advanced editing tools (Figure 6).  In providing an inventory view of weather elements, the Grid Manager shows the valid time of each grid for each weather element. Using the editing capabilities in the Grid Manager, meteorologists can copy derived model data into the forecast, adjust the valid time of grids, and interpolate data from one grid to another.   The Spatial Editor displays one or more grids with underlying map backgrounds. Meteorologists can control the appearance of the display by varying the color enhancement curves, set of displayed weather elements, and contour intervals. In addition, zoom/pan, overlay, and animation capabilities are provided.   The Temporal Editor provides a view of weather elements in a time-series representation that allows forecasters to quickly view and edit how a weather element changes over time. It also shows the value of multiple weather elements over a point or geographical area depicted on the Spatial Editor (shown in Figure 6).      Figure 6. The GFE includes views of data using three editors: Grid Manager (an inventory of weather elements), Spatial Editor (grids in plan view), and Temporal Editor (a time-series representation of weather elements).    Before a forecast can be completed, it must be defined for all times in the forecast period. The Spatial Interpolation capabilities of the GFE allow the forecaster to ""fill-in"" and interpolate data from one grid to another. For example, if the forecaster defines a wind grid at 1200 UTC and another at 2000 UTC, the system can provide hourly interpolation for all periods between 1200 and 2000 UTC.  Basic and Advanced Tools  – Forecasts are edited through a series of basic and advanced editing tools that allow users to define an area on the Spatial Editor and then apply an editing action to that area. Basic tools are used to assign specific values to that area, slightly adjust existing values up or down, and smooth out gradients. The defined areas on the Spatial Editor need not be drawn by hand, but can be calculated based on other grids. For instance, forecasters may direct the system to select an area where temperatures are below freezing, and if the precipitation type is shown as rain, they can change it to snow.  Advanced tools known as ""Smart Tools"" add meteorological concepts into the system and have full access to all model and terrain data. Forecasters can enhance the Quantitative Precipitation Forecast (QPF) based on vertical motion. The Smart Tools can be used to calculate the vertical motion from the high-resolution terrain and surface winds, and then apply a correction factor to the QPF. Meteorologists can use these tools to compare a particular forecast field to others and define their relationship. ""Smart Scripts"" can be used to chain the Smart Tools together for more efficient use.  As mentioned before, configurability is the most important function of Smart Tools. It is impossible to write a fixed set of tools that will work for everyone everywhere. Instead, we have written a basic set of tools and provided a framework in which forecasters can write their own version of Smart Tools in a powerful language called Python. (See a later article on the development of Smart Tools.)  A contour-editing tool is also provided to make small corrections to existing grids by redrawing portions of contours, or to generate a completely new grid from scratch by drawing a series of contours.  Product Generation   Another very needed feature of the GFESuite technology is automatic product generation, the last of the three steps of the IFPS process. To reiterate, the first step in forecast preparation is initialization of the digital database, usually with objective forecasts derived from at least one numerical model. Since the forecast is defined in far greater detail than was possible in the traditional system, comprehensive monitoring and verification systems now alert forecasters of any meteorological inconsistencies, or if the forecast deviates from the observations. In the second step, forecasters interactively modify weather elements from which many products can be automatically composed and formatted. Once the set of gridded forecast elements is defined, products can be generated with little or no forecaster intervention.   Product Suite   The IFPS/GFESuite product suite is tiered in order to accommodate various user levels: high-end users, ""modern"" users, and low-end users (Figure 7). High-end users could receive gridded products (such as raw forecast numbers) that would be used to generate additional products or serve as input to numerical models. Modern users could access the Web to display imagery and graphics that represent the forecast. Some of these products could be interactive: a click on a map would bring up a forecast tailored to that exact location. Low-end users could only access the digital forecast in the form of simplified text products.   The flexible and tailorable product generation capabilities of the GFESuite provide three types of output products: grids, graphics, and text (Figure 7).       Figure 7. IFPS tiered product suite to accommodate different levels of users.     The very detailed gridded datasets can be best viewed in graphical form, which can accurately represent the detail. Graphical products can be customized to provide imagery, contour analysis, time series, domains, and a combination of some or all of these attributes. The graphical output from GFESuite is available as Portable Network Graphics (PNG) imagery, which is compatible with all popular Web browsers. The text capability provides full access to the forecast grids using data sampling techniques. Formatted table-type products that depict weather elements, areas, and times can be constructed with minimal effort. Free-flowing text products can also be generated, and a text language translator will translate the forecasts from English to French and Spanish. Interactive products, available through a Web interface, allow users to query the grids for specific information; for example, users can click on a specific location for a customized worded or graphical forecast.  Summary   All of the GFESuite features outdate the past time-consuming process of completely typing out the text-only, ""incomplete"" forecast. The success of the GFESuite and its parent IFPS will be measured according to how much it helps forecasters issue timely forecasts with no degradation of high quality data.   The GFESuite allows the end-to-end gridded forecast to become a reality. Derivation programs calculate surface forecast elements directly from the model.  The GFE and its Smart Tools concept provide easy manipulation of these forecast fields. The product generation software provides different tiers of formats for low-end to sophisticated users of meteorological forecasts. The configurability aspect of GFESuite can be used in many different meteorological environments. (A separate article in this issue covers the GFESuite software in greater detail.)  During the next two years, additional capability will be added, tested, and then deployed as part of the AWIPS baseline. Also planned for future releases are enhancements to the Smart Tools framework, intersite coordination, and improved derivations of sensible weather elements from models."

Since this new methodology has not been thoroughly tested in an operational environment, it poses significant risks to National Weather Service operations.  With no guarantee that it will improve forecast accuracy or increase productivity, what is the motivation for implementing such a massive change in the way forecasts are generated?  The answer is that weather forecast information can be much better communicated to users when the forecast can be visualized graphically via modernized products (as in Figure 1).     Defining the weather forecast digitally offers great benefits to users who need comprehensive weather information in order to make better decisions.  Once the forecast is expressed as a set of gridded weather elements, users can view this information in virtually unlimited ways, and tailor products to match their specific needs.  For example, people traveling by car are interested in weather parameters that affect driving conditions such as precipitation, wind, and visibility.  Anyone interested in recreational sailing would be concerned with wind and waves.  A system that disseminates forecast data in this way not only gives users the information they need, but also avoids cluttering products with irrelevant information that might be confusing.                 Figure 1.  Modernized product of temperature values; each color represents a value.             Even after the Grapical Forecast Editor (GFE) is operational nationwide, weather forecast offices will continue to disseminate alpha-numeric products based on these grids on a regular schedule.  However, with recent advances in high-speed communications such as the World Wide Web and wireless technology, an opportunity arises to fundamentally change the way forecast information is delivered to consumers.  Rather than accessing a fixed set of products from each forecast office, users interested in the forecast could invoke interactive applications that query a digital forecast database and be able to precisely specify the type and location of any forecast information desired, and then generate a graphical or textual representation of the future state of the weather.  In this article, we discuss some of these applications from the users perspective.        Graphical Products        Because gridded datasets contain a large amount of detail, graphical products are a natural way to view them since they can accurately represent this detail.  Graphical products can take on many forms, such as image, contour analysis, time-series, or as combinations of these types.        Image Products   The simplest way to convey digital gridded data is via an image or picture.  Figure 1 is an example of such a product, generated by the ifpGIF program.  In this example, the color of each picture element represents a temperature value.  Using the map background as a reference, a user of this product can locate the area of interest and deduce the temperature.  A simple time animation of temperature images informs  the user of how the temperature is expected to change with time.        Vector Graphics   Vector graphics can denote magnitude and direction on the display.  This type of product has the added advantage, in that graphics can be overlaid on top of a different image product to produce a combined display of different weather elements.  Figure 2 displays a wind field as a graphic plotted on top of an ocean wave height field.  This is useful to a sailor in locating the best combination of moderate winds and low wave height.        Grids   Some customers need detailed predictions of weather conditions as input to complex algorithms.  These ""high-end"" customers would receive the gridded data directly, in order to run their applications that require high-resolution surface weather elements. Examples of this type of user include a laboratory running a fire behavior model, a state transportation department interested in predictions of road conditions, and any agency that predicts pollution dispersion.        Interactive Products   One of the best advantages of expressing the forecast in digital form is that customers need not be limited (as they are today) to a specified set of products.  The digital nature of the forecast information makes it possible for interactive applications to generate forecast displays of weather-specific user needs.  An interface prompts the user for location, time, and weather element type and the application displays the information on the screen.  Users can see precise information of interest, and the display is not cluttered with data they consider irrelevant.  A few examples follow to illustrate this concept.                  Figure 2.  Displays of wind fields as a graphic plotted on top of an ocean wave height field.                Point Forecast in Time   Many times users are interested in knowing what time is ideal for planning a particular activity that could be affected by the weather.  For instance, a user who might be planning an outdoor gathering can specify the location on a map and a time period to a point forecast application.  The application then fetches the data interactively and generates a display of the weather forecast at that location.  The display in Figure 3 illustrates the forecast as a series of graphical objects to indicate weather conditions as a function of time.                 Figure 3.  Display of the forecast as a series of graphical objects to indicate weather conditions as a function of time and place.               Traveling Forecast   A traveler would not want a forecast at a fixed point, but one that moves in space and time.  The traveling forecast allows the user to indicate a route and a time of departure and arrival, and the traveling forecast application retrieves the forecast data just like the point forecast, but with location and time as a variable.  Figure 4 shows a depiction of the weather as the traveler is enroute.                 Figure 4.  The Graphical Forecast Viewer (GFV) can interface forecast information that moves in space and time.                 Graphical Forecast Viewer   At FSL we have developed a Java-based application, the Graphical Forecast Viewer (GFV), that combines several of the examples discussed above.  The GFV displays plan (map) view images that animate over time, generates a point forecast as a time-series plot, and allows the user to probe a specific point or area to get more detailed weather and geographical information.  (Figure 4 shows one possible interface to the GFV.)  The GFV is based on the same type of software modules as those comprising the FSL-developed Local Data Acquisition and Dissemination (LDAD) system [see the November 1997 issue of the  FSL Forum ].  Users of the GFV can look at any component of the forecast in several different formats.  Weather information can be overlaid in any combination, giving the user maximum flexibility for obtaining weather forecast information.  In combination with its geographical information, the GFV is a very powerful tool for millions of people (everyone at some time or another) whose decisions are based on the weather forecast.        Audio Products   Interactive products are not limited to those that can be visualized.  An automated telephone system could be used to disseminate weather information as well.  After dialing, a caller ID system could identify the callers location, retreive the appropriate weather information, and deliver the weather forecast for that area in the form of a computer-generated voice. Customers interested in a forecast for a location other than their own could enter a zip code to identify a new location.          Interactive Text   Despite the gridded approach to forecasting, text products will continue to be distributed from every forecast office. This does not necessarily imply that every product received by users originates from the prescribed list.  The concept of querying the forecast database still applies, even for text products.        Summary         The primary motive for changing the method by which forecasters express the weather forecast from text to digital is so that users of these datasets can make faster and more accurate weather-related decisions.  The digital nature of this information allows applications to disseminate the data in a variety of ways so that customers with varying degrees of requirements can be easily accommodated.  The National Weather Service has invested great resources into its modernization over the past 10 years.  This move toward digital forecasts and modernized products is the last step toward delivering better products and services to the public.

Washington       Etcetera       Recent Publications                    Contact The Editor       Design:     Wilfred von Dauster                             By Mark Mathewson      Introduction     The Graphical Forecast Editor Suite (GFESuite) is a series of programs that provide an end-to-end interactive forecast preparation capability.  The GFESuite components derive surface sensible weather elements from model data, manage the forecast data and metadata in a database, provide viewing and editing capability of the forecast data, and generate output products in a variety of formats (Figure 1).   The GFESuite software was incorporated into the AWIPS build 5.0 as part of the Interactive Forecast Preparation System (IFPS) and is scheduled for release to the field early 2001.                      Derivation of Surface Elements     Without the capability to derive surface weather elements from numerical models, meteorologists would not be able to take advantage of the high-resolution numerical models that exist on AWIPS and would have to create each forecast grid from scratch.  The GFESuite derivation component provides the following capabilities:     Derivation of surface weather elements that are not provided by the numerical model, but are needed in generating digital forecasts   Enhancement of model resolution in time and space to provide more detailed forecasts    Introduction of terrain datasets to improve the accuracy of surface weather element generation.   Most of todays models do not generate surface weather elements, such as surface temperature, sky or cloud condition, and precipitation type.  These are the elements, however, that make up virtually every type of forecast available for the general public, aviator, fire weather manager, and mariner. In the past, meteorologists would rely on training and experience to interpret the model in determining the surface weather elements, and then would express these surface weather elements in text form, with little spatial and temporal resolution. Using the GFESuite, model data can be interpreted and the required surface weather elements can be derived while preserving model resolution and features.   Model resolutions are typically 30 to 40 kilometers with 6 hourly time steps, which are not sufficient for high-resolution forecasts.  The gridded forecasts from the GFESuite are nominally 10-kilometer resolution and available hourly.  The derivation component of the GFESuite uses interpolation in both time and space to effectively bring the model resolution down to that required for generating detailed gridded forecasts.     The introduction of high-resolution terrain datasets is essential in the successful derivation of certain weather elements, such as surface temperature. The model terrain (Figure 2) is usually quite smooth due to its spatial resolution and may not be sufficient to represent the actual terrain (Figure 3).  Hence, the model's surface temperature field can be incorrect simply because of the difference between the model and the actual terrain (Figures 2 and 3).  In areas of flat terrain, this is not generally an issue; however, in areas of mountainous terrain, the difference in terrain can be as great as 1,000 meters, resulting in errors of several degrees.  (A later article provides more detail about the derivation of sensible weather elements from models.)           Figure 2.  Screen showing model terrain grid at 3040 km resolution.  Compare to GFESuite 1-km topography grid in Figure 3.                 Figure 3.  GFESuite 1-km topography grid showing same terrain area as in Figure 2.         Architecture and Database Server     The GFESuite architecture uses the same database server as the central repository of all data.  In other words, the GFE is not configured for a particular grid domain and set of weather elements; instead it connects to the database server and determines that information through a series of queries and replies.  This architecture design ensures that all components of the GFESuite are working harmoniously with the same set of information and eliminates the possibility of redundant configurations that can get out of synchronization.  The result is a system that is easy to configure and maintain, and provides storage of gridded forecast and derived fields, map backgrounds, topography data, and metadata.  Clients can access AWIPS model data and are notified when data change.  The database features a locking mechanism to prevent simultaneous editing on the same grid.  The GFESuite network client/server provides access to the database via the Remote Procedure Call (RPC). Figure 4 shows data stored with RPC clients connected to the GFESuite.           Figure 4.  GFESuite database includes gridded forecast and derived fields, map backgrounds, and metadata, accessible to clients via the Remote Procedure Call.       The GFESuite database is used primarily for the storage and retrieval of gridded fields. A grid consists of a series of scalar, vector, or discrete parameters that represent the weather over a geographic area for a given time.  For instance, a particular sky condition grid might depict the percent of cloud cover over Colorado for early afternoon.   Multiple grids depicting the sky condition would comprise a weather element and represent one element of the forecast over many time periods.  Collections of weather elements make up a database source, such as FCST, which holds the work copy of the gridded forecast, or OFFICIAL, which holds the officially released digital forecast, or ETA, which holds the weather elements derived from the Eta numerical model.  Typically the database contains a set of weather elements for public forecasting that include surface temperature, dewpoint temperature, sky condition, freezing level, surface wind, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, quantitative precipitation forecast, probability of precipitation, snow accumulation, and weather coverage, type, and intensity. Additional weather elements exist for aviation, fire weather, and marine forecasting.   The underlying structure of the gridded fields is in an indexed netCDF data format designed to economize disk space.  The format is hidden from users, who cannot directly access the data files.  A hierarchy of data sources, weather elements, and gridded fields in the database is enforced (see diagram in Figure 5).           Figure 5.  GFESuite database hierarchy of data sources, weather elements, and gridded fields.       The GFESuite database server contains many other types of information used by other GFESuite components.  Detailed 1-kilometer terrain information for the entire world is available and used for display on the GFE as well as in the derivation of surface weather elements.   Geopolitical, river, highway, and other map backgrounds are provided to the GFE and product generation programs.  The map backgrounds are stored in shapefile format, thus allowing users to customize and install additional maps.  Specific configuration information and other metadata are also stored in the server for use in the GFE.   The GFESuite has been designed for forecast offices where more than one forecaster will be simultaneously editing grids, which is usually the case at most NWS forecast offices.  The database server prevents simultaneous editing of the same forecast grids and lockout of grids while editing.  It also provides notification of data changes, and when forecasters save their edited gridded forecast, all other GFEs connected to the same database server will see the changes immediately.     Of course AWIPS model data are important for the GFESuite, not only in the derivation of sensible weather elements but also for display and editing decisions in the GFE.  AWIPS model data are available through the interface provided by the GFESuite database server.  Since model data typically cover a much larger domain at lower resolution than the gridded forecast fields, these data are interpolated and mapped to the higher resolution of the forecast fields on retrieval.   The GFESuite database server architecture uses RPCs (see Figure 4) and Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) to communicate with clients. It does not rely on file systems mounted through the Network File System (NFS), resulting in straightforward installation and configuration and enhanced flexibility.  Since RPCs are used, the networking capability of the GFESuite is intrinsically part of the system.  Generally in the NWS environment, all components of the GFESuite run in the same network domain.  However, a very useful feature of the GFESuite is that its various components can communicate with any database server anywhere in the world, provided the network connectivity is present.  The networking capability allows for access to forecasts at other sites and intersite coordination and forecast boundary reconciliation.    Users can easily configure the database to customize components to meet their specific needs.  That is, the list of data sources, weather elements and their attributes, resolution, and domain of the grids can be varied using a single configuration file.      Graphical Forecast Editor     The Graphical Forecast Editor (GFE) presents gridded forecast fields to meteorologists for editing, and they can select the weather elements, sources, and grids to view, and  use a variety of tools to edit the data.  The capabilities of the GFE include views of the data with three editors  grid inventory, spatial, and temporal, as well as spatial interpolation and basic and advanced editing tools (Figure 6).   In providing an inventory view of weather elements, the Grid Manager shows the valid time of each grid for each weather element.  Using the editing capabilities in the Grid Manager, meteorologists can copy derived model data into the forecast, adjust the valid time of grids, and interpolate data from one grid to another.   The Spatial Editor displays one or more grids with underlying map backgrounds.  Meteorologists can control the appearance of the display by varying the color enhancement curves, set of displayed weather elements, and contour intervals.  In addition, zoom/pan, overlay, and animation capabilities are provided.     The Temporal Editor provides a view of weather elements in a time-series representation that allows forecasters to quickly view and edit how a weather element changes over time.  It also shows the value of multiple weather elements over a point or geographical area depicted on the Spatial Editor (shown in Figure 6).           Figure 6.  The GFE includes views of data using three editors: Grid Manager (an inventory of weather elements), Spatial Editor (grids in plan view), and Temporal Editor (a time-series representation of weather elements).       Before a forecast can be completed, it must be defined for all times in the forecast period.  The Spatial Interpolation capabilities of the GFE allow the forecaster to ""fill-in"" and interpolate data from one grid to another.  For example, if the forecaster defines a wind grid at 1200 UTC and another at 2000 UTC, the system can provide hourly interpolation for all periods between 1200 and 2000 UTC.   Basic and Advanced Tools   Forecasts are edited through a series of basic and advanced editing tools that allow users to define an area on the Spatial Editor and then apply an editing action to that area.  Basic tools are used to assign specific values to that area, slightly adjust existing values up or down, and smooth out gradients.  The defined areas on the Spatial Editor need not be drawn by hand, but can be calculated based on other grids.  For instance, forecasters may direct the system to select an area where temperatures are below freezing, and if the precipitation type is shown as rain, they can change it to snow.    Advanced tools known as ""Smart Tools"" add meteorological concepts into the system and have full access to all model and terrain data.  Forecasters can enhance the Quantitative Precipitation Forecast (QPF) based on vertical motion.  The Smart Tools can be used to calculate the vertical motion from the high-resolution terrain and surface winds, and then apply a correction factor to the QPF.  Meteorologists can use these tools to compare a particular forecast field to others and define their relationship.  ""Smart Scripts"" can be used to chain the Smart Tools together for more efficient use.   As mentioned before, configurability is the most important function of Smart Tools.  It is impossible to write a fixed set of tools that will work for everyone everywhere.  Instead, we have written a basic set of tools and provided a framework in which forecasters can write their own version of Smart Tools in a powerful language called Python.  (See a later article on the development of Smart Tools.)   A contour-editing tool is also provided to make small corrections to existing grids by redrawing portions of contours, or to generate a completely new grid from scratch by drawing a series of contours.     Product Generation     Another very needed feature of the GFESuite technology is automatic product generation, the last of the three steps of the IFPS process.  To reiterate, the first step in forecast preparation is initialization of the digital database, usually with objective forecasts derived from at least one numerical model.  Since the forecast is defined in far greater detail than was possible in the traditional system, comprehensive monitoring and verification systems now alert forecasters of any meteorological inconsistencies, or if the forecast deviates from the observations.  In the second step, forecasters interactively modify weather elements from which many products can be automatically composed and formatted.  Once the set of gridded forecast elements is defined, products can be generated with little or no forecaster intervention.       Product Suite     The IFPS/GFESuite product suite is tiered in order to accommodate various user levels: high-end users, ""modern"" users, and low-end users (Figure 7). High-end users could receive gridded products (such as raw forecast numbers) that would be used to generate additional products or serve as input to numerical models. Modern users could access the Web to display imagery and graphics that represent the forecast.  Some of these products could be interactive: a click on a map would bring up a forecast tailored to that exact location.  Low-end users could only access the digital forecast in the form of simplified text products.     The flexible and tailorable product generation capabilities of the GFESuite provide three types of output products: grids, graphics, and text (Figure 7).             Figure 7.  IFPS tiered product suite to accommodate different levels of users.          The very detailed gridded datasets can be best viewed in graphical form, which can accurately represent the detail. Graphical products can be customized to provide imagery, contour analysis, time series, domains, and a combination of some or all of these attributes. The graphical output from GFESuite is available as Portable Network Graphics (PNG) imagery, which is compatible with all popular Web browsers. The text capability provides full access to the forecast grids using data sampling techniques.  Formatted table-type products that depict weather elements, areas, and times can be constructed with minimal effort.  Free-flowing text products can also be generated, and a text language translator will translate the forecasts from English to French and Spanish.  Interactive products, available through a Web interface, allow users to query the grids for specific information; for example, users can click on a specific location for a customized worded or graphical forecast.     Summary     All of the GFESuite features outdate the past time-consuming process of completely typing out the text-only, ""incomplete"" forecast.  The success of the GFESuite and its parent IFPS will be measured according to how much it helps forecasters issue timely forecasts with no degradation of high quality data.    The GFESuite allows the end-to-end gridded forecast to become a reality.  Derivation programs calculate surface forecast elements directly from the model.   The GFE and its Smart Tools concept provide easy manipulation of these forecast fields.  The product generation software provides different tiers of formats for low-end to sophisticated users of meteorological forecasts.  The configurability aspect of GFESuite can be used in many different meteorological environments.  (A separate article in this issue covers the GFESuite software in greater detail.)   During the next two years, additional capability will be added, tested, and then deployed as part of the AWIPS baseline.  Also planned for future releases are enhancements to the Smart Tools framework, intersite coordination, and improved derivations of sensible weather elements from models.                FSL Staff"
GX256-88-13144262	"SR SSD 2003-15 9/2003 Technical Attachment Developing a Local Outreach Program Mark A. Rose NWS Nashville, Tennessee Timothy W. Troutman NWS Huntsville, Alabama  Introduction In late 2000, a team at WFO Nashville (Old Hickory) was assembled to improve the slide show given at spotter talks. The outreach team consisted of one senior forecaster, four journeymen forecasters and the ITO. The outreach team began its work with the goal of producing a computer-based presentation with pictures from Middle Tennessee - not just the canned ""Great Plains photographs"" that are commonly delivered. By the following spring severe weather season the team had completed a polished 140-slide show using Corel Presentations. They also included a number of severe weather photographs contributed by residents across Middle Tennessee, but the team didn't stop there. After taking on the name ""Outreach Team,"" the members developed a collection of topical presentations to be delivered to various groups across Old Hickory's forecast area, which consists of 42 counties in Middle Tennessee. What followed was an expansion and improvement of the WFO's existing outreach program. The National Weather Service in Huntsville, Alabama, also began a local outreach team in early 2003. As a new WFO with developing programs, the Huntsville office team originally comprised just two members - the WCM participated at schools and Rotary Clubs in addition to his normal spotter training and preparedness safety talks, and the MIC concentrated on Rotary and Kiwanis Club presentations. Three additional outreach team members were soon added as school, marine and aviation outreach programs were begun and quickly expanded. The results of the well-planned team efforts at Nashville and Huntsville were surprising, and were achieved very quickly. Because of this, we want to share our experiences with other National Weather Service offices. Developing the Presentations When the idea of outreach was born, it was decided we would target groups outside the traditional warning preparedness circles of spotters and emergency management officials. NWS Old Hickory's outreach team would focus on civic groups and schools. The team was divided into two groups: one group would tackle the civic groups presentation, and the other would develop a slide show for high school students. Along the way, other presentation topics were addressed such as lightning safety, tornado safety, flooding, winter weather, agriculture and aviation. One presentation was developed for medical groups, another for historical societies. The service hydrologist then added his creation, and the ITO (also an amateur radio operator) developed a presentation for Amateur Radio Clubs. Finally, a presentation on unusual weather anecdotes in Middle Tennessee was added for the civic groups circuit. By the end of the first year, at least twelve topical presentations had been delivered by members of the Old Hickory outreach team, in addition to the original spotter slide show.   Going on the Road in Middle Tennessee and North Alabama The team from Old Hickory began delivering talks on October 1, 2001. It started with one goal: to visit all 42 counties in its warning and forecast area at least once by September 30, 2002. We began to make contacts with groups and organizations. Using the internet for contact information, many calls were made and e-mails were sent to potential audiences. The outreach team first targeted Rotary and Lions Clubs, Chambers of Commerce, and high school science teachers. Soon, the speaking engagements fell into place, and the team members were on their way. Within a few months, as word-of-mouth spread, people began to call the weather office, or send e-mails, requesting a talk for their group. So many requests were received, in fact, that we had to reluctantly turn some down or rescheduled them due to over-booking. When the initial year concluded on September 30, the team had fallen short of its goal of reaching all 42 counties, but the results were still amazing: 70 events, a total audience of 4,427, and 38 counties visited (90 percent of the total). The goal of visiting all 42 counties was realized on December 3, 2002. This was in spite of the team having lost two of its six members to transfers. Since beginning an outreach team of its own in June, 2002, and using Old Hickory's team as an example, the WFO Huntsville staff has been involved in 35 events, covering all 11 counties in its North Alabama county warning area. To improve on fiscal year 2002 outreach events, the Huntsville office developed FY2003 outreach goals. Specifically, the goals are to complete 20 school and academic-related talks and events, educating at least 500 students. Further weather education goals include working with the state of Alabama public broadcast stations in the development of a ""Professor Weather"" videotaped show, which will provide weather and severe weather safety education to children of all grade levels. Also planned is the mass mailing of around 5,000 weather cloud charts to all schools in North Alabama and the development of a weather explorers program at WFO Huntsville. Other outreach events planned include two major NOAA Weather Radio (NWR) promotional events across northern Alabama which will include tuning weather radios and distributing locally-produced NWR brochures to residents, emergency managers, storm spotters, and Chambers of Commerce. Since boating and outdoor water recreation are very popular in North Alabama, WFO Huntsville will again participate in Water Safety Day in Florence in late May. Another goal involving the marine community is to provide at least two weather tours of the NWS office to the local Coast Guard auxiliaries in order to educate these groups about weather safety as related to area rivers and lakes. Other outreach activities planned include providing SKYWARN spotter and safety training to at least 30 storm spotter, SKYWARN, and amateur radio groups, and completing 20 presentations to civic, historical, and climate groups. The aviation outreach effort will include visiting all north Alabama airports and hosting an aviation customer workshop in late summer (ed. note: the workshop was held on Saturday, August 23, with over 150 aviation customers and partners in attendance).   More Outreach Ideas Discovered There are ways to provide outreach other than speaking engagements alone. Following are a few ideas the outreach team at Old Hickory has employed. Letters-to-the-Editor. As in most areas, Middle Tennessee has many small town newspapers that publish at least weekly. The outreach team leader distributed numerous letters-to-the-editor which described the National Weather Service mission and operations. The letters began with a few weather facts about the paper's local area in order to ""personalize"" the message (and increase the likelihood of publication). A sample letter is included with this tech attachment. Refrigerator m 1,000 of these, free spotter nu Huntsville had These are also agnets. The WCM used local funds at WFO Nashville to purchase in the shape of the state and embossed with the NWS logo, the toll mber, and the office Web address. Picking up on that idea, WFO magnets made which highlight lightning safety and spotter training. used for school outreach and other weather safety presentations. g chambers of a weather link. S weather page of our outreach from the NWS,  Surf the internet. Most counties and municipalities, includin commerce, have their own Web sites, and many of those contain Webmasters can be asked to consider including a link to an NW which specifically addresses the local area weather needs. As part efforts we aim to ensure those individuals know what is available including URL's, an explanation of our products, etc. Conclusion  The National Weather Service has a critical mission delivery service to perform, and it is the responsibility of local offices to accomplish that for their areas of county warning and forecast responsibility. In many ways our role is unique from the function of private weather providers, so it's important that we work to make the distinction clear. We have discovered that many people do not yet fully understand the mission and service capabilities of the modernized NWS offices. The Huntsville and Old Hickory office outreach teams have the goal of improving that understanding through direct contact. Once people fully understand how the NWS forms the basis of meteorological data collection, weather forecasting, and severe weather watch and warning dissemination for the nation, they are naturally and genuinely interested, which makes it easy to communicate our message. We have found that if our presentations include local interest - and even some entertainment value - by using old weather-related photographs, unusual weather anecdotes, and perhaps a weather cartoon or two - then all the better. We know people appreciate our presentations by the questions we are asked, the compliments we receive, and by the number of speaking engagements we have secured by word-of-mouth.   Public outreach can be one of the most rewarding and satisfying endeavors a National Weather Service employee can experience. We are not just meteorologists, hydrologists, or technicians. We serve the public and should be quick to remind the general public who we are, what we do, and who funds our agency. That means learning and practicing additional skills. People find it refreshing when an employee of the federal government knocks on their door, eager to provide a service of this nature. By doing this, the National Weather Service can further increase a positive and long-lasting reputation among the communities we serve. Acknowledgments The authors recognize WFO Huntsville MIC John Gordon for providing the impetus for forming the outreach team while a senior forecaster at WFO Nashville. Without his leadership and vision, the accomplishments described in this paper would not have been realized. The authors acknowledge each member of the WFO Nashville and WFO Huntsville outreach teams for their hard work and support to make this project a success. We also extend thanks to SOO's Henry Steigerwaldt (Nashville) and Tom Bradshaw (Huntsville) for their reviews of this manuscript.   Sample Letter to the Editor  Dear Editor: Did you know that Winchester's largest snowfall on record was 10.5 inches, measured on March 13, 1993, in what has come to be known as the ""Storm of the Century?"" Do you remember December 22, 1990, when the city recorded its greatest one-day rainfall - a remarkable 7.52 inches? You probably don't remember the date of April 30, 1909. During the early morning hours, an F2 tornado tore through Decherd, killing 4 and injuring 30. These and other facts about Middle Tennessee came from the website of the National Weather Service Office located in Old Hickory (www.srh.noaa.gov/ohx). The National Weather Service is a branch of the federal government tasked with issuing weather warnings and forecasts for the protection of life and property and the enhancement of the economy. Not only can you get facts such as these, but you can also obtain the latest forecast for Franklin County, look at various surrounding radars, see if there are any warnings in effect, review every recorded tornado in the county's history, and find out which NOAA Weather Radio transmitter(s) cover your area. Not only does the National Weather Service provide the public with weather warnings and forecasts 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, it also provides the foundation for a thriving private weather industry. Companies such as The Weather Channel and AccuWeather, as well as your local television meteorologists, rely on weather observations (including radar and satellites, surface and upper-air data nationwide) and computer-generated forecasts from the National Weather Service to produce the value-added products and services they provide. The National Weather Service accomplishes its mission on an annual budget that averages less than $3 per U.S. citizen per year. The more citizens understand how we carry out our critical mission of protecting life and property through improved forecasts and warnings, the better we can serve them. A representative from the National Weather Service office in your area will be happy to speak to local schools or other groups on request. Please contact meteorologist Mark Rose at Mark.A.Rose@noaa.gov."

The periods of record vary by station, with some stations having data back to about 1900, although many begin around the 1948 time frame. The data files are complete through 1997. The directory has a data file for each state, along with one file for several stations outside the U.S. such as Guam and Puerto Rico (filename 'others.txt'). There are currently over 8000 NWS and cooperative weather stations active and included in this directory, with many more currently inactive stations also included.   The files consist entirely of ASCII character data. A header record begins each file with the station number, station name, state abbreviation, year, 12 months (Jan - Dec), and 'annual' appearing from left to right. The monthly and annual precipitation amounts are in inches and hundredths (e.g., 1122 = 11.22 inches, 522 = 5.22 inches, 55 = .55 inches). A value of '9999' indicates missing or incomplete data for that month, with '99999' indicating missing for the yearly total. The monthly total is only presented when all data were available and validated for that month. Likewise, the annual total is only presented when every monthly total for the year was available. These data are taken from NCDC digital database TD3220, which also contains additional elements such as temperature and snowfall. These additional elements are available off line on tape or diskette.    Known data problem:  Precipitation is known to actually be in units of millimeters (rather than hundredths of inches) for several stations outside the U.S. mainland. We believe that this problem is confined to Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands during the early 1960s.

INTRODUCTION    FX-Net National is the most recent version of an Internet-based meteorological workstation that is being developed at NOAA’s Forecast Systems Laboratory (FSL).  By leveraging recent AWIPS workstation developments, the system is now able to deliver forecasting information for any location in the lower 48 states.  As in previous versions, this information includes satellite imagery, model forecasts and observations (Wang and Madine, 1998). Significant improvements to the FX-Net system include access to nationally oriented scales and radar products for each of the WSR-88D sites. More powerful interactive functionality, such as a user-defined vertical cross-section capability, has also been implemented.  The client, which emulates the AWIPS D2D interface, runs on readily available PC hardware over network bandwidth as low as that which is available with phone line based modems.  These recent developments have led to an FX-Net server that can now provide relatively low-cost service to a large number of Internet-connected clients.      2.  SYSTEM OVERVIEW      Figure 1: FX-Net System   Corresponding author address:  Sean Madine, NOAA/FSL, Boulder, CO  phone: 303-497-6769;   email: madine@fsl.noaa.gov    FX-Net National is a request based, client-server system intended to be an extension of the D2D capability, not a PC version of the AWIPS work-station.  The server is primarily responsible for data management (i.e. time matching of products) and  for creation and delivery of these product files (Fig.1).  Written in C++, the server is a modified AWIPS workstation. Rather than support the local display of products, it uses the D2D software to produce and encode files in response to a product request by the client.  As is the case for any real-time AWIPS workstation, the server must be collocated with an appropriately localized AWIPS data server.  The client runs as a Java application on a PC.  After retrieving products via the Internet, it allows a user to locally interact with the information.  Connections to the server are only maintained during the request and retrieval of products.      Advantages of FX-Net    The Web has become an important resource for meteorological information.  Satellite imagery, forecast models, radar, and observations are available on numerous sites. A standard Web browser provides a basic forecasting capability to a meteorologist.  FX-Net National provides an improved capability in many ways.       1. Interactive functionality and emulation of D2D user interface     The FX-Net client is able to display products from a very large menu of choices.  As is the case with D2D, the client can load and overlay products of various types and interact with that information.  Functionality includes animation, toggle of overlays, zooming, and swapping of display windows.  By emulating the D2D interface, FX-Net is easily learned by those who have AWIPS experience.  This is an advantage in applications such as fire weather, where an incident meteorologist would be familiar with both the set of available products and the user interface.     2.1.2  Product Representation and Compression    A very important aspect of FX-Net is the approp-riate encoding and compression of meteorological products.  The sizes of image files are significantly reduced, when compared to standard compression formats, through the use of FSL-developed com-pression programs  (Madine and Wang, 1999).  When constrained by modest bandwidth, FX-Net is able, in a reasonable amount of time, to deliver products with much better resolution than those that are typically available on Web sites.    2.1.3 User Defined Products    FX-Net National offers some very unique capabilities beyond the features mentioned above. An interface has been developed that allows the user to define an arbitrary baseline from which vertical cross sections of virtually any model parameter can be created and displayed.   Similarly, arbitrary points can be defined from which time series of model parameters can be created and displayed.  These products are created upon request within a few seconds.     3. LOCALIZATION AND ""NON-LOCALIZATION""   One legacy of the original AWIPS design is the concept of localization.  Each NWS Weather Forecast Office (WFO) has a localization associated with it.  For a given localization, a set of nested scales is defined which progressively zoom in on the area that is relevant to the WFO.  This is a very effective approach when forecasting for a specific area. Previous versions of FX-Net servers were restricted by the concept of localization.  This limitation required that an FX-Net server and an appropriately localized AWIPS data server be dedicated to each group of users in different locations.  Even though the server can handle a large number of users, it was limited in utility due to the localized nature of the products that it could serve. Recent versions on the AWIPS software provide  national center localizations .  This, in a sense, can be thought of as a 'non-localization'.  Rather than defining a set of nested scales, the national center localizations define a set of peer scales that combine to cover large areas. This technique also provides improved resolution over standard scales such as the CONUS view in AWIPS.     FX-Net National supports this 'non-localization'.   Products such as satellite imagery are delivered by the server at a resolution that is appropriate to a given scale.  Due to the need to optimize for limited bandwidth, only enough information is sent to support a few zoom operations, depending on the scale.  Loading products at the smallest scale relevant to the forecasting needs provides the product at the best resolution.   By leveraging the new 'non-localization', a single FX-Net National server is capable of serving many users that are interested in forecasting for diverse geographic locations.   4. RADAR PRODUCTS    Soon after the NWS started disseminating NEXRAD products free-of-charge via NOAAPORT in January 2001, the FX-Net team leveraged this newly opened data stream by adding a software feature to its user interface aptly named the  Radar Chooser.  Closely emulating a related feature in the AWIPS D2D user interface, and operating as an adjunct tool within FX-Net, the Radar Chooser allows users access to 143 of the 154 WSR-88D sites currently producing data. (The 11 sites of Alaska and Hawaii are not yet offered.)     The tool's main display presents a map of the continental United States, and superimposes the locations of the radar sites, allowing the user to select an individual site with the mouse. Once a site has been selected, the application switches into a ""radar viewer"" mode. In this mode the background map of the FX-Net primary view port changes to reflect the user’s selected radar choice, displaying the state/county boundaries associated with that radar site (WFO scale). Radar products can then be loaded, followed optionally by graphic products (i.e., models, point observations, analysis, etc.).     In addition to displaying the radar sites, the Radar Chooser also superimposes the  10 km Radar Coded Message  national mosaic, the contents of which can be toggled visible or hidden. This allows users to see weather activity at sites close by.     Of the radar products being disseminated by the NWS, the following are displayed by FX-Net:       Composite Reflectivity  4 km (0.5 Degree Elevation Angle)       Composite Reflectivity  1 km (0.5 Degree Elevation Angle)       Base Reflectivity (0.5 Degree Elevation Angle)       Base Radial Velocity  (0.5 Degree Elevation Angle)       Storm Relative Mean Radial Velocity (0.5 Degree Elevation Angle)       Vertical Integrated Liquid       Surface Rainfall Accumulation      The client also provides the ability to animate some of the above products in angle rather than in time. This capability is supported for Composite Reflectivity  4 km,  Base Radial Velocity, and Storm Relative Mean Radial Velocity.   5. CENTRALIZED SCALABLE  SERVER      The AWIPS workstation can now be run on a server using the Linux operating system.  The FX-Net server has also been ported to this platform so that the system can take advantage of powerful and inexpensive hardware that has recently become available.  In addition, FX-Net servers can now be effectively load-balanced.  That is, the system can be effectively scaled to handle more demand by adding more hardware.  Recent experience with FX-Net usage in university teaching laboratories indicates that a server under normal operating conditions can handle at least 20 clients.   It is difficult to quantify the expense of a client request; different types of requests put different loads on the server.  With clients that are not requesting products in a synchronized fashion, initial estimates are that a server can support many tens of clients at any given time. As mentioned, the addition of the nonlocalization and the Radar Chooser makes a single server useful to users in many different locations.  By load-balancing many inexpensive servers at a central site, FX-Net National can effectively and inexpensively provide a very good meteorological workstation capability to a very large number of users via the Internet.      6.  USES OF FX-NET NATIONAL    The first operational use of FX-Net was at Plymouth State College (PSC) in New Hampshire. It has been almost three years since PSC installed a special meteorological computer laboratory which included 20 FX-Net workstations and a data projector. FX-Net is being used intensively at PSC to teach undergraduate students with a focus on high-tech forecasting tools. In summer 2001 the University of Iowa (UNI) was added to the list of FX-Net clients and is also using FX-Net for undergraduate laboratories. In addition, UNI is also holding special summertime workshops which are part of the STORM Project. The introduction of FX-Net National reduced the problem of an increasing number of localized FX-Net systems to a scalable system set-up. Two national center data servers (prime and backup) and a limited number of FX-Net National servers can provide AWIPS products to a large number of FX-Net clients. The list of products includes the radar products mentioned above. This large choice of radar products makes FX-Net National especially valuable for the university environment. The teaching and studying of severe weather is no longer limited to one location, and therefore can be conducted at any time.    The fire weather research is using the nonlocalized advantages of FX-Net National in the same manner as is done in the universities. Obviously, fire weather is not limited to any one location, and therefore a localized forecaster workstation product limited to one radar would not do the job. FX-Net National will be able to serve fire weather forecasters with the palette of radar products, needed for them to address fires in any area within the lower 48 states.     There are many other nontraditional forecast situations that FX-Net National will be able to serve extremely well. One of these is air quality forecasting. It is no problem for the FX-Net system to ingest and display additional data sets and parameters. Work is presently conducted to try to display air quality data collected in the state of New Hampshire as part of the AIRMAP project. Other air quality parameters can be added in the future.   7.  FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS TO SYSTEM    In order to enhance the usability of FX-Net National especially for the fire weather needs work is being conducted to serve additional high-resolution products. In the near future, FX-Net National will serve a very high-resolution visible image. The client will be able to choose an arbitrary view of visible satellite imagery by drawing a ""view window"" onto the existing CONUS or regional scale visible satellite image. The minimum size of this window will be defined by size of the primary window of the user interface.  In addition to the high-resolution satellite image, FX-Net National will also provide arbitrary mosaics of radar products. These new high-resolution products will be complemented with additional high-resolution forecast models, such as the MM5 and the MM5/Chem. On the larger scales additional global satellite products will be served. Presently the global satellite products are limited to GOES-East and GOES-West. Plans are to add products from the Japanese geostationary satellite (GMS) as well as the European counterpart METEOSAT. Mosaics of all four geostationary satellites will allow provision of full hemispheric views of water vapor, infrared, or visible satellite imagery.   8.  REFERENCES    Madine, S. and  N.

The GFESuite components derive surface sensible weather elements from model data, manage the forecast data and metadata in a database, provide viewing and editing capability of the forecast data, and generate output products in a variety of formats (Figure 1).   The GFESuite software was incorporated into the AWIPS build 5.0 as part of the Interactive Forecast Preparation System (IFPS) and is scheduled for release to the field early 2001.                                 Derivation of Surface Elements        Without the capability to derive surface weather elements from numerical models, meteorologists would not be able to take advantage of the high-resolution numerical models that exist on AWIPS and would have to create each forecast grid from scratch.  The GFESuite derivation component provides the following capabilities:       Derivation of surface weather elements that are not provided by the numerical model, but are needed in generating digital forecasts    Enhancement of model resolution in time and space to provide more detailed forecasts     Introduction of terrain datasets to improve the accuracy of surface weather element generation.     Most of todays models do not generate surface weather elements, such as surface temperature, sky or cloud condition, and precipitation type.  These are the elements, however, that make up virtually every type of forecast available for the general public, aviator, fire weather manager, and mariner. In the past, meteorologists would rely on training and experience to interpret the model in determining the surface weather elements, and then would express these surface weather elements in text form, with little spatial and temporal resolution. Using the GFESuite, model data can be interpreted and the required surface weather elements can be derived while preserving model resolution and features.     Model resolutions are typically 30 to 40 kilometers with 6 hourly time steps, which are not sufficient for high-resolution forecasts.  The gridded forecasts from the GFESuite are nominally 10-kilometer resolution and available hourly.  The derivation component of the GFESuite uses interpolation in both time and space to effectively bring the model resolution down to that required for generating detailed gridded forecasts.       The introduction of high-resolution terrain datasets is essential in the successful derivation of certain weather elements, such as surface temperature. The model terrain (Figure 2) is usually quite smooth due to its spatial resolution and may not be sufficient to represent the actual terrain (Figure 3).  Hence, the model's surface temperature field can be incorrect simply because of the difference between the model and the actual terrain (Figures 2 and 3).  In areas of flat terrain, this is not generally an issue; however, in areas of mountainous terrain, the difference in terrain can be as great as 1,000 meters, resulting in errors of several degrees.  (A later article provides more detail about the derivation of sensible weather elements from models.)                 Figure 2.  Screen showing model terrain grid at 3040 km resolution.  Compare to GFESuite 1-km topography grid in Figure 3.                          Figure 3.  GFESuite 1-km topography grid showing same terrain area as in Figure 2.              Architecture and Database Server        The GFESuite architecture uses the same database server as the central repository of all data.  In other words, the GFE is not configured for a particular grid domain and set of weather elements; instead it connects to the database server and determines that information through a series of queries and replies.  This architecture design ensures that all components of the GFESuite are working harmoniously with the same set of information and eliminates the possibility of redundant configurations that can get out of synchronization.  The result is a system that is easy to configure and maintain, and provides storage of gridded forecast and derived fields, map backgrounds, topography data, and metadata.  Clients can access AWIPS model data and are notified when data change.  The database features a locking mechanism to prevent simultaneous editing on the same grid.  The GFESuite network client/server provides access to the database via the Remote Procedure Call (RPC). Figure 4 shows data stored with RPC clients connected to the GFESuite.                 Figure 4.  GFESuite database includes gridded forecast and derived fields, map backgrounds, and metadata, accessible to clients via the Remote Procedure Call.           The GFESuite database is used primarily for the storage and retrieval of gridded fields. A grid consists of a series of scalar, vector, or discrete parameters that represent the weather over a geographic area for a given time.  For instance, a particular sky condition grid might depict the percent of cloud cover over Colorado for early afternoon.     Multiple grids depicting the sky condition would comprise a weather element and represent one element of the forecast over many time periods.  Collections of weather elements make up a database source, such as FCST, which holds the work copy of the gridded forecast, or OFFICIAL, which holds the officially released digital forecast, or ETA, which holds the weather elements derived from the Eta numerical model.  Typically the database contains a set of weather elements for public forecasting that include surface temperature, dewpoint temperature, sky condition, freezing level, surface wind, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, quantitative precipitation forecast, probability of precipitation, snow accumulation, and weather coverage, type, and intensity. Additional weather elements exist for aviation, fire weather, and marine forecasting.     The underlying structure of the gridded fields is in an indexed netCDF data format designed to economize disk space.  The format is hidden from users, who cannot directly access the data files.  A hierarchy of data sources, weather elements, and gridded fields in the database is enforced (see diagram in Figure 5).                 Figure 5.  GFESuite database hierarchy of data sources, weather elements, and gridded fields.           The GFESuite database server contains many other types of information used by other GFESuite components.  Detailed 1-kilometer terrain information for the entire world is available and used for display on the GFE as well as in the derivation of surface weather elements.     Geopolitical, river, highway, and other map backgrounds are provided to the GFE and product generation programs.  The map backgrounds are stored in shapefile format, thus allowing users to customize and install additional maps.  Specific configuration information and other metadata are also stored in the server for use in the GFE.     The GFESuite has been designed for forecast offices where more than one forecaster will be simultaneously editing grids, which is usually the case at most NWS forecast offices.  The database server prevents simultaneous editing of the same forecast grids and lockout of grids while editing.  It also provides notification of data changes, and when forecasters save their edited gridded forecast, all other GFEs connected to the same database server will see the changes immediately.       Of course AWIPS model data are important for the GFESuite, not only in the derivation of sensible weather elements but also for display and editing decisions in the GFE.  AWIPS model data are available through the interface provided by the GFESuite database server.  Since model data typically cover a much larger domain at lower resolution than the gridded forecast fields, these data are interpolated and mapped to the higher resolution of the forecast fields on retrieval.     The GFESuite database server architecture uses RPCs (see Figure 4) and Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) to communicate with clients. It does not rely on file systems mounted through the Network File System (NFS), resulting in straightforward installation and configuration and enhanced flexibility.  Since RPCs are used, the networking capability of the GFESuite is intrinsically part of the system.  Generally in the NWS environment, all components of the GFESuite run in the same network domain.  However, a very useful feature of the GFESuite is that its various components can communicate with any database server anywhere in the world, provided the network connectivity is present.  The networking capability allows for access to forecasts at other sites and intersite coordination and forecast boundary reconciliation.      Users can easily configure the database to customize components to meet their specific needs.  That is, the list of data sources, weather elements and their attributes, resolution, and domain of the grids can be varied using a single configuration file.         Graphical Forecast Editor        The Graphical Forecast Editor (GFE) presents gridded forecast fields to meteorologists for editing, and they can select the weather elements, sources, and grids to view, and  use a variety of tools to edit the data.  The capabilities of the GFE include views of the data with three editors  grid inventory, spatial, and temporal, as well as spatial interpolation and basic and advanced editing tools (Figure 6).     In providing an inventory view of weather elements, the Grid Manager shows the valid time of each grid for each weather element.  Using the editing capabilities in the Grid Manager, meteorologists can copy derived model data into the forecast, adjust the valid time of grids, and interpolate data from one grid to another.    The Spatial Editor displays one or more grids with underlying map backgrounds.  Meteorologists can control the appearance of the display by varying the color enhancement curves, set of displayed weather elements, and contour intervals.  In addition, zoom/pan, overlay, and animation capabilities are provided.       The Temporal Editor provides a view of weather elements in a time-series representation that allows forecasters to quickly view and edit how a weather element changes over time.  It also shows the value of multiple weather elements over a point or geographical area depicted on the Spatial Editor (shown in Figure 6).                 Figure 6.  The GFE includes views of data using three editors: Grid Manager (an inventory of weather elements), Spatial Editor (grids in plan view), and Temporal Editor (a time-series representation of weather elements).           Before a forecast can be completed, it must be defined for all times in the forecast period.  The Spatial Interpolation capabilities of the GFE allow the forecaster to ""fill-in"" and interpolate data from one grid to another.  For example, if the forecaster defines a wind grid at 1200 UTC and another at 2000 UTC, the system can provide hourly interpolation for all periods between 1200 and 2000 UTC.     Basic and Advanced Tools   Forecasts are edited through a series of basic and advanced editing tools that allow users to define an area on the Spatial Editor and then apply an editing action to that area.  Basic tools are used to assign specific values to that area, slightly adjust existing values up or down, and smooth out gradients.  The defined areas on the Spatial Editor need not be drawn by hand, but can be calculated based on other grids.  For instance, forecasters may direct the system to select an area where temperatures are below freezing, and if the precipitation type is shown as rain, they can change it to snow.      Advanced tools known as ""Smart Tools"" add meteorological concepts into the system and have full access to all model and terrain data.  Forecasters can enhance the Quantitative Precipitation Forecast (QPF) based on vertical motion.  The Smart Tools can be used to calculate the vertical motion from the high-resolution terrain and surface winds, and then apply a correction factor to the QPF.  Meteorologists can use these tools to compare a particular forecast field to others and define their relationship.  ""Smart Scripts"" can be used to chain the Smart Tools together for more efficient use.     As mentioned before, configurability is the most important function of Smart Tools.  It is impossible to write a fixed set of tools that will work for everyone everywhere.  Instead, we have written a basic set of tools and provided a framework in which forecasters can write their own version of Smart Tools in a powerful language called Python.  (See a later article on the development of Smart Tools.)     A contour-editing tool is also provided to make small corrections to existing grids by redrawing portions of contours, or to generate a completely new grid from scratch by drawing a series of contours.        Product Generation        Another very needed feature of the GFESuite technology is automatic product generation, the last of the three steps of the IFPS process.  To reiterate, the first step in forecast preparation is initialization of the digital database, usually with objective forecasts derived from at least one numerical model.  Since the forecast is defined in far greater detail than was possible in the traditional system, comprehensive monitoring and verification systems now alert forecasters of any meteorological inconsistencies, or if the forecast deviates from the observations.  In the second step, forecasters interactively modify weather elements from which many products can be automatically composed and formatted.  Once the set of gridded forecast elements is defined, products can be generated with little or no forecaster intervention.          Product Suite        The IFPS/GFESuite product suite is tiered in order to accommodate various user levels: high-end users, ""modern"" users, and low-end users (Figure 7). High-end users could receive gridded products (such as raw forecast numbers) that would be used to generate additional products or serve as input to numerical models. Modern users could access the Web to display imagery and graphics that represent the forecast.  Some of these products could be interactive: a click on a map would bring up a forecast tailored to that exact location.  Low-end users could only access the digital forecast in the form of simplified text products.       The flexible and tailorable product generation capabilities of the GFESuite provide three types of output products: grids, graphics, and text (Figure 7).                   Figure 7.  IFPS tiered product suite to accommodate different levels of users.               The very detailed gridded datasets can be best viewed in graphical form, which can accurately represent the detail. Graphical products can be customized to provide imagery, contour analysis, time series, domains, and a combination of some or all of these attributes. The graphical output from GFESuite is available as Portable Network Graphics (PNG) imagery, which is compatible with all popular Web browsers. The text capability provides full access to the forecast grids using data sampling techniques.  Formatted table-type products that depict weather elements, areas, and times can be constructed with minimal effort.  Free-flowing text products can also be generated, and a text language translator will translate the forecasts from English to French and Spanish.  Interactive products, available through a Web interface, allow users to query the grids for specific information; for example, users can click on a specific location for a customized worded or graphical forecast.        Summary        All of the GFESuite features outdate the past time-consuming process of completely typing out the text-only, ""incomplete"" forecast.  The success of the GFESuite and its parent IFPS will be measured according to how much it helps forecasters issue timely forecasts with no degradation of high quality data.      The GFESuite allows the end-to-end gridded forecast to become a reality.  Derivation programs calculate surface forecast elements directly from the model.     The GFE and its Smart Tools concept provide easy manipulation of these forecast fields.  The product generation software provides different tiers of formats for low-end to sophisticated users of meteorological forecasts.  The configurability aspect of GFESuite can be used in many different meteorological environments.  (A separate article in this issue covers the GFESuite software in greater detail.)     During the next two years, additional capability will be added, tested, and then deployed as part of the AWIPS baseline.  Also planned for future releases are enhancements to the Smart Tools framework, intersite coordination, and improved derivations of sensible weather elements from models.

This research has great potential benefits for rocket and NASA Space Shuttle launches and may someday be used to improve lightning safety for the general public.  Lightning is the number two weather killer in the US.  Lightning is the number one weather killer in Florida.            TAPE CONTENTS:           ITEM (1):        Predicting Lightning Strikes at Kennedy Space Center and Cape Canaveral Air Force Station  - In order to prepare and then to launch the Space Shuttle or any rockets, forecasters must predict a lightning free window within a twenty-mile radius of the launch pad one to four hours before a first strike. A Shuttle landing requires a 90-minute lightning forecast, whereas the movement of solid rocket boosters requires a four hour forecast. Predicting lightning strikes around the Florida Coast can be difficult, especially when storms can pop up at any moment.  In addition, Florida has the highest number of lightning strikes of anywhere in the United States.  Scientists have found a way to improve lightning predictions by combining total water vapor data from GPS with measurements of stability from weather balloons.  The new lightning index has great potential for improving the KSC desired lead-time and decreasing the false alarm rate.     Credit: NASA            ITEM (2):        Lightning Views From Space  - There are more than 2,000 thunderstorms taking place around the world at any given instant.  This view was taken aboard the space shuttle.  Scientists have a variety of tools for studying lightning including satellites, weather balloons, airplanes, and computer models.  Better lightning predictions could improve public safety and benefit construction companies, amusement parks and utilities.    Credit: NASA          ITEM (3):        Global Lightning Map   - Satellites like Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) are used to monitor lightning all over the world. TRMM confirms, on a global scale, that there are more lightning strikes over land than over the ocean.  Florida has the most lightning strikes in the United States.  Around Kennedy Space Center, the average square mile is struck directly by ground to cloud lightning  an average of 42 times per year.      Credit:  NASA/NASDA          ITEM (4):        Humidity Major Factor For Predicting Lightning  - Moisture is the fuel that drives thunderstorms.  Scientists use weather balloons and satellite data to monitor moisture in the atmosphere.  The moisture data is incorporated into weather and climate models for predicting storms and lightning strikes.      NASA           ITEM (5):        Land-Ocean Lightning Animation   - TRMM confirmed that thunderstorms over land produce more lightning than their ocean counterparts.  Negative charges and positive charges cluster in different regions of thunderclouds. Eventually the static charge or electrical potential is large enough that a negative spark is launched from the lower cloud to the ground.  The strike can also discharge to a positive region in the cloud.      Credit: NASA          ITEM (6):        TRMM: Watching Rain To Help Explain     - The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) is the first Earth Science mission dedicated to studying tropical and subtropical rainfall, precipitation that falls within 35 degrees north and 35 degrees south of the equator. Tropical rainfall comprises more than two-thirds of the world's total. The satellite uses several instruments to detect rainfall including radar, microwave imaging, and lightning sensors.

THE  HEAVIEST RAIN FELL OVER THE SOUTHERN HALF OF CAMBRIA COUNTY WHERE 1O  TO 12 INCHES OF RAIN OCCURRED.    MULTIPLE THUNDERSTORMS THAT WERE BORN IN NORTHWEST PENNSYLVANIA MATURED OVER JOHNSTOWN DROPPING THE BULK OF THEIR RAIN OVER THE CITY.  THESE THUNDERSTORMS TOOK ALMOST IDENTICAL TRACKS AS THEY CROSSED CAMBRIA COUNTY THUS THE SAME AREAS RECEIVED RAINFALL FROM MULTIPLE THUNDERSTORMS.    THIS EXCESSIVE RAINFALL PRODUCED FLOODING IN AND AROUND JOHNSTOWN  AND CAUSE SEVERAL SMALL DAMS TO BREAK.  THIS FLOODING CAUSED 78  DEATHS AND OVER 200 MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF DAMAGE.    IN THE PAST 25 YEARS THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE HAS MADE SOME SIGNIFICANT ADVANCES IN WEATHER AND COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY AS WELL AS FORECASTING TECHNIQUES.     A NATIONAL DOPPLER RADAR NETWORK IS NOW IN PLACE TO ACCURATELY TRACK STORMS AND ESTIMATE THE PRECIPITATION THEY PRODUCE. CONTINUOUS SATELLITE COVERAGE IS NOW AVAILABLE TO ALL NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE FORECAST OFFICES. ADDITIONALLY...FORECASTERS CAN NOW  DISSEMINATE WARNINGS IN REAL TIME TO PENNSYLVANIA COUNTY EMERGENCY  MANAGEMENT OFFICIALS VIA DIRECT COMMUNICATION LINKS.       IF ANOTHER EVENT LIKE THIS WERE TO OCCUR TODAY...THERE WOULD AGAIN BE FLOODING AND PROPERTY DAMAGE. HOWEVER...IT IS LIKELY THAT ADVANCES IN FORECASTING AND WARNING SYSTEMS WOULD HELP MITIGATE LOSS OF LIFE AND PROPERTY.                                                                            Local Climate, Water & Weather Topics: Forecasts ,  Current Hazards ,  Current Conditions ,  Hydrology ,  Radar ,  Satellite ,  Climate ,  Weather Safety ,  Feature Articles ,                                                                                                                                    National Weather Service Central Pennsylvania Weather  Forecast Office 227 W.
