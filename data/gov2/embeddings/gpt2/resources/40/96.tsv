For five months in 1925, the 40-square-mile Smackover field was the focal point of one of the wildest mineral booms in North America. Today, south Arkansas's oil fields produce petroleum throughout a 10-county area.   Columbia and Union counties also stretch over one of the largest brine reserves in the world. Bromine is derived from brine, or saltwater, and local companies play an international role in the commercialization of bromine and its many applications   The Arkansas Museum of Natural Resources in Smackover, featuring state-of-the-art indoor exhibits as well as working equipment on display outside in its adjacent Oil Field Park and shares the fascinating stories of this region’s natural resources, with emphasis on petroleum and brine recovered for bromine extraction.   The museum features a 25,000-square-foot main exhibition/research building that includes a 10,500-square-feet exhibit hall, orientation theater, exhibit work area, research center and museum store/gift shop.   Explore the museum and walk the streets of a 1920s Arkansas boom town or travel back 200 million years ago to discover the origins of oil. Take a chance drilling and see if you will become an oil tycoon or go flat broke. Learn how 95 percent of the products we use daily are made of or with two of Arkansas's natural resources.   Tour the Oil Field Park adjacent to the main building. Walk along its paved trail past full-sized operating examples of vintage derricks and equipment used from the 1920s to the modern era. See a re-creation of a 1920s standard rig and a 112-foot wooden derrick.   The museum staff offer a wide variety of year-round educational and interpretive programs. Choose from guided tours of the museum and the Oil Field Park, films, lectures, field trips, special demonstrations, and programs.   The museum's research center includes a special collection of library, archival, and photographic materials that emphasize the history of this region. Computerized data of Arkansas’s petroleum and brine development are available to researchers and members of the oil and brine industries.   Custom-fit educational programs are also available for students of all ages. The museum's education center is located behind the main building. The museum's two shaded picnic areas are within walking distance.   Admission to the museum is free.   The Arkansas Museum of Natural Resources is on Ark. 7 two miles south of Smackover.

Only 90 minutes from New York City and less than 2 hours from Philadelphia, the four counties spanned by the Poconos include Carbon, Monroe, Pike and Wayne.  Each have their own special appeal, making the Poconos ideal for a family vacation, reunion, meeting, convention, honeymoon, couple getaway, or bus, car or RV trip.    History       The Pocono Mountains have been a perennial favorite for resort visitors since the early 1800, when Philadelphia Quakers started the resorts of Buck Hill Falls and Pocono Manor. By 1900, the high altitudes brought thousands of visitors from the growing cities of Philadelphia and New York for summer vacations.     The year-round appeal of the Pocono Mountains was boosted by the opening of Pennsylvania first commercial ski area, Big Boulder, in 1946. The popularity of family-owned and operated resorts with all the comforts of home soared in the 1950, and the Poconos provided the ideal summer vacation including picnics, zany games, group sports and outdoor activities.     In 1963, the first heart-shaped tub was introduced at Caesar Cove Haven in Lakeville, PA. Life Magazine photos of this novelty generated a flood of publicity, and the Poconos became famous as the oneymoon Capital of the World.In the 1980, the growth of whitewater rafting, golfing, outlet shopping and other attractions further broadened the appeal of the Pocono Mountains as a vacation destination. Today the area boasts year-round attractions, from natural wonders, cultural events, and historic museums to relaxing spas, romantic retreats and active adventures for all ages.       Attractions       Opened in 2003, the Mountain Laurel Center for the Performing Arts in Bushkill offers performances ranging from symphony orchestras and piano concerts to country legends and rock nroll shows, in a center dedicated to the arts, education and the environment.        Pocono International Raceway in Long Pond, PA opened its 2mile super speedway for Indy racing in 1971, and NASCAR soon followed in 1972, bringing over 100,000 race fans to the area twice every summer.        Golfers can play over 35 courses here, including courses designed by Robert Trent Jones, AJ Tillinghast and Donald Ross.      Stressed out professionals, leading increasingly hectic lives, want to be pampered during their vacations, so the resorts of the Pocono Mountains began adding on-site spas.      Outdoor Wonders       The Poconos are a mecca for outdoor adventure enthusiasts for hiking, biking, fishing, canoeing and whitewater rafting, with 7 state parks offering snowmobile trails, snowshoeing, and eagle watching. The Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area, Upper Delaware Scenic and Recreational River, and Steamtown National Historic Site are not to be missed offering a wide variety of activities for the entire family. The mountains are home to 150 lakes, 18 waterfalls, 170 river miles and Lake Wallenpaupack, a 5,600 acre lake with 52 miles of shoreline. Hunters can pursue white-tailed deer, wild turkeys, ruffed grouse, and other area wildlife. In the southern Poconos, the northern end of the Appalachian Trail is a major flyway on the autumn raptor migration route, home of the nationally renowned Hawk Mountain sanctuary.        Recently, the Pocono Mountains celebrated the opening of the northeast largest indoor waterpark with 90,000 square feet of water slides, a lazy river, an interactive treehouse waterfort, a wave pool and much more.  Check out Great Wolf Waterpark for all the fun details     Ski areas in the Poconos are not particularly large and do not have large vertical drops (Sno Mountain and Elk Mountain, with 1000' vertical drops, are the largest), so runs tend to be on the shorter side. However, the Poconos do offer conveniently located skiing, and many areas also offer night skiing. Many Pocono ski resorts cater to both winter and summer, transforming themselves into waterparks for summer visitors.     Do You Believe in Magic?

clueweb09-enwp01-91-12312	"                     The Poconos          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia                 Jump to:  navigation ,  search                 Pennsylvania's Pocono region counties       The  Pocono Mountains  region is a mountainous region of about 2,400 square miles (6,200 km) located in northeastern  Pennsylvania .   The Pocono Mountains is a popular recreational destination for local and regional visitors. The region has a population of about 300,000, which is growing at a rapid pace, largely attributable to vacationers from the New York City region who are turning vacation homes into permanent residences. [ citation needed ]  The region lacks a major population center, although there are small municipalities which are scattered throughout the area. The Poconos now serves as a commuter community for the  Northern New Jersey  metropolitan areas, even though the commute often takes as much as 2 hours each way due to distance and traffic. Because the region lacks a population center, it has been difficult to establish transit infrastructure to feed (future) commuter rail and bus lines. Stroudsburg is usually known as the heart of the poconos and is growing very rapidly in population and in retail with the new Shoppes at Stroud, bartonsville plaza which is in stroud township and plans have been made to build the shoppes at crossroads and the bartonsville square which are also part of stroud and hamilton townships they are both currently waiting approval by the townships.

The Pocono Mountains is a vaguely defined area encompassing  Carbon ,  Monroe ,  Pike , and  Southern Wayne  Counties of Pennsylvania  [ 1 ] , as well as portions of neighboring counties such as  Susquehanna ,  Luzerne , and  Lackawanna . The region of  Northampton County  from the Slate Belt northwards is also sometimes included [ 2 ] . In total, the Poconos encompasses over 2,500 square miles. The Poconos are mountainous, geologically a southwestern extension of the  Catskills . The Poconos' highest summit, Elk Hills North Knob, reaches 2,693 feet (821 m), while its lowest elevation is 350 feet (107 m) in Pike County.   The  Delaware River  flows through the Pocono Mountains and gives the region its name, from a Native American term roughly translating to ""stream between two mountains."" The  Lehigh  and  Lackawaxen  Rivers also flow through the region, totaling about 170 miles (270 km) of waterways. The Pocono Mountains are also home to some 150 lakes and many  waterfalls , such as those in the  Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area  of  Monroe County  and  Ricketts Glen State Park  in northwestern  Luzerne County .     [ edit ]   Recreation   The popularity of the Pocono Mountains as a summer retreat began at the dawn of the 20th century when Philadelphia Quakers started the resorts of  Buck Hill Falls  and  Pocono Manor , and later in the 1920s,  Skytop .          Midday view of Lake Harmony              Evening view of Lake Harmony               Camelback Ski Area       The Poconos is a well-known outdoor recreation destination for visitors around the northeast, especially from  New York City  and  Philadelphia . Primary attractions are centered around the region's diverse natural offerings. The Poconos encompasses the  Delaware State Forest   [ 3 ] , including six designated natural areas  [ 4 ] , seven state parks  [ 5 ] , seventeen state game lands  [ 6 ] , and one national park: The  Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area . There are extensive opportunities for water sports, with many of the lakes and rivers stocked for fishing. Hunters pursue  white-tailed deer ,  wild turkeys ,  ruffed grouse , and other wildlife. More  American black bear  are killed here than anywhere else in the state, and likely the contiguous 48 states. This is largely due to acidic pine barren creek valleys teeming with  trout  and berries. Toward the southern margin of the Poconos, the  Blue Mountain  ridge is the site of the  Appalachian Trail  and a major  flyway  for the autumn  raptor   migration , including the nationally renowned  Hawk Mountain  sanctuary.   The Poconos is also home to Summer Camps, such as Camp Pocono Ridge [ 7 ]  and  Goose Pond Scout Reservation  near Lake Ariel.   The Poconos is and has been Pennsylvania's most popular tourist destination. The region contains over 80% of the state's resorts. These resorts earn 1.5 billion dollars in gross revenues and employ 18,000 workers. The region is also a popular winter destination. [ 8 ]  State parks offer snowmobile trails, snowshoeing, and eagle watching. [ 9 ]   Popular summer activities include whitewater rafting and canoeing down the Delaware and Lehigh Rivers, camping and hiking, water parks, and smaller attractions such as Claws N Paws Wild Animal Park  [ 10 ] , Kittatinny Rafting & Paintball  [ 11 ] , Houdini Museum  [ 12 ]  and others. Another popular recreation activity growing around the Poconos is  disc golf . Currently there are several  disc golf  courses located around the Poconos. Other outdoor activities, particularly  golf , are also popular options.   Another attraction is  Pocono Raceway , a major automobile racetrack, which is home to two  NASCAR Sprint Cup Series  races, the  Pocono 500  in June, and the  Pennsylvania 500  in August. It also serves as a racing school and motorcycle track.   The Poconos is a major resort destination with new additions such as Great Wolf Lodge for families, a resurrection of Mount Airy as a gaming (slots) and golf resort, the famous Ceasars Pocono Resorts with heart-shaped and champagne whirlpool baths for two (couples only) and a retreat known as  Woodloch Pines  that has added a spa facility.     [ edit ]   Gaming   A highly controversial proposal to license a gambling casino with slot machines in Monroe County was approved in 2007 and the casino at  Mount Airy Lodge  is now open to the public. [ 13 ]  Adding to the controversy is the reported connection between the casino's owner and organized crime which has placed Mount Airy under the supervision of a gaming commission appointee.   Mohegan Sun at Pocono Downs in the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre area is another site where slots and OTB are available, and a proposed facility in the Allentown area is scheduled to open in the near future.     [ edit ]   Skiing in the Poconos   Numerous ski resorts in and around the Poconos offer some of the closest and most accessible skiing to the major populated areas of Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington DC areas.     Camelback Ski Area  - the most ski runs in the Poconos   Blue Mountain Ski Area   [ 14 ]  - the largest vertical drop in the Poconos (1,082 feet) and closest to Philadelphia   Elk Mountain Ski Area  - one of the larger areas with 30 trails, the highest ski peak at 2,600+ feet and a 1,000-foot vertical drop   Sno Mountain Ski Area  - just outside of Scranton, features the steepest terrain in the Poconos and a 1,000-foot vertical drop   Shawnee Mountain Ski Area   [ 15 ]  - closest to New York City, just across the Delaware from New Jersey, suited for families & beginners   Jack Frost Mountain and Big Boulder  [ 16 ]  - two sister ski areas, family oriented skiing   Ski Big Bear  [ 17 ]   Tanglewood - closed for the 2007/2008 season due to economic reasons.   Alpine Mountain  [ 18 ]   Eagle Rock Resort - the westernmost of the Pocono ski areas     Ski areas in the Poconos are not particularly large and do not have large vertical drops (Sno Mountain and Elk Mountain, with 1000' vertical drops are the largest), so runs tend to be on the shorter side. However, the Poconos do offer conveniently located skiing, and many areas also offer night skiing. Many Pocono ski resorts cater to both winter and transform themselves into water parks for summer visitors.   Downhill skiing is also offered at resort-hotel properties (such as Skytop Lodge and Fernwood) where guests can use the facilities as part of their stay.     [ edit ]   Rail service          The  Delaware-Lackawanna Railroad  mainline runs over the  Pocono Mountains .       Rail service is provided by the  Pennsylvania Northeast Regional Rail Authority . One of its primary objectives is to establish rail passenger service with  New Jersey Transit  between  Scranton, Pennsylvania  and  Hoboken, New Jersey  with connecting service at  Secaucus Junction  for  Manhattan, New York . Designated operator of the line is  NJ Transit . There is currently no passenger rail service from the Poconos to Hoboken, New Jersey.   On January 23, 2007, NJ Transit was given an initial environmental 'OK' to re-establish a Hoboken-to-Scranton connection, a restoration of the  Lackawanna Cut-Off .   Rebuilding rails on the Lackawanna Cut-Off, and subsequent resumption of passenger service is slated to be completed in 2011 or 2012. [ 19 ]     [ edit ]   Newspapers   A few newspapers covering local events and happenings include the daily paper,  The  Pocono Record , a weekly paper, a shopper and  Blue Mountain Moments , which is published monthly. To the north, additional regional publications covering  Pike  and  Wayne  Counties include the  News Eagle ,  Pike County Dispatch ,  Milford Magazine ,  Pike County Courier , and  Wayne Independent .

clueweb09-enwp02-20-04995	"                     The Poconos          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia        (Redirected from  Pocono Mountain Range )            Jump to:  navigation ,  search                 Pennsylvania's Pocono region counties       The  Pocono Mountains  region is a mountainous region of about 2,400 square miles (6,200 km) located in northeastern  Pennsylvania .   The Pocono Mountains is a popular recreational destination for local and regional visitors. The region has a population of about 300,000, which is growing at a rapid pace, largely attributable to vacationers from the New York City region who are turning vacation homes into permanent residences. [ citation needed ]  The region lacks a major population center, although there are small municipalities which are scattered throughout the area. The Poconos now serves as a commuter community for the  Northern New Jersey  metropolitan areas, even though the commute often takes as much as 2 hours each way due to distance and traffic. Because the region lacks a population center, it has been difficult to establish transit infrastructure to feed (future) commuter rail and bus lines. Stroudsburg is usually known as the heart of the poconos and is growing very rapidly in population and in retail with the new Shoppes at Stroud, bartonsville plaza which is in stroud township and plans have been made to build the shoppes at crossroads and the bartonsville square which are also part of stroud and hamilton townships they are both currently waiting approval by the townships. An Olive Garden restaurant is planned to open March 29,2009 and several other projects are planned to open next Fall/Winter.

The Pocono Mountains is a vaguely defined area encompassing  Carbon ,  Monroe ,  Pike , and  Southern Wayne  Counties of Pennsylvania  [ 1 ] , as well as portions of neighboring counties such as  Susquehanna ,  Luzerne , and  Lackawanna . The region of  Northampton County  from the Slate Belt northwards is also sometimes included [ 2 ] . In total, the Poconos encompasses over 2,500 square miles. The Poconos are mountainous, geologically a southwestern extension of the  Catskills . The Poconos' highest summit, Elk Hills North Knob, reaches 2,693 feet (821 m), while its lowest elevation is 350 feet (107 m) in Pike County.   The  Delaware River  flows through the Pocono Mountains and gives the region its name, from a Native American term roughly translating to ""stream between two mountains."" The  Lehigh  and  Lackawaxen  Rivers also flow through the region, totaling about 170 miles (270 km) of waterways. The Pocono Mountains are also home to some 150 lakes and many  waterfalls , such as those in the  Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area  of  Monroe County  and  Ricketts Glen State Park  in northwestern  Luzerne County .     [ edit ]   Recreation   The popularity of the Pocono Mountains as a summer retreat began at the dawn of the 20th century when Philadelphia Quakers started the resorts of  Buck Hill Falls  and  Pocono Manor , and later in the 1920s,  Skytop .          Midday view of Lake Harmony              Evening view of Lake Harmony               Camelback Ski Area       The Poconos is a well-known outdoor recreation destination for visitors around the northeast, especially from  New York City  and  Philadelphia . Primary attractions are centered around the region's diverse natural offerings. The Poconos encompasses the  Delaware State Forest   [ 3 ] , including six designated natural areas  [ 4 ] , seven state parks  [ 5 ] , seventeen state game lands  [ 6 ] , and one national park: The  Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area . There are extensive opportunities for water sports, with many of the lakes and rivers stocked for fishing. Hunters pursue  white-tailed deer ,  wild turkeys ,  ruffed grouse , and other wildlife. More  American black bear  are killed here than anywhere else in the state, and likely the contiguous 48 states. This is largely due to acidic pine barren creek valleys teeming with  trout  and berries. Toward the southern margin of the Poconos, the  Blue Mountain  ridge is the site of the  Appalachian Trail  and a major  flyway  for the autumn  raptor   migration , including the nationally renowned  Hawk Mountain  sanctuary.   The Poconos is also home to Summer Camps, such as Camp Pocono Ridge [ 7 ]  and  Goose Pond Scout Reservation  near Lake Ariel.   The Poconos is and has been Pennsylvania's most popular tourist destination. The region contains over 80% of the state's resorts. These resorts earn 1.5 billion dollars in gross revenues and employ 18,000 workers. The region is also a popular winter destination. [ 8 ]  State parks offer snowmobile trails, snowshoeing, and eagle watching. [ 9 ]   Popular summer activities include whitewater rafting and canoeing down the Delaware and Lehigh Rivers, camping and hiking, water parks, and smaller attractions such as Claws N Paws Wild Animal Park  [ 10 ] , Kittatinny Rafting & Paintball  [ 11 ] , Houdini Museum  [ 12 ]  and others. Another popular recreation activity growing around the Poconos is  disc golf . Currently there are several  disc golf  courses located around the Poconos. Other outdoor activities, particularly  golf , are also popular options.   Another attraction is  Pocono Raceway , a major automobile racetrack, which is home to two  NASCAR Sprint Cup Series  races, the  Pocono 500  in June, and the  Pennsylvania 500  in August. It also serves as a racing school and motorcycle track.   The Poconos is a major resort destination with new additions such as Great Wolf Lodge for families, a resurrection of Mount Airy as a gaming (slots) and golf resort, the famous Ceasars Pocono Resorts with heart-shaped and champagne whirlpool baths for two (couples only) and a retreat known as  Woodloch Pines  that has added a spa facility.     [ edit ]   Gaming   A highly controversial proposal to license a gambling casino with slot machines in Monroe County was approved in 2007 and the casino at  Mount Airy Lodge  is now open to the public. [ 13 ]  Adding to the controversy is the reported connection between the casino's owner and organized crime which has placed Mount Airy under the supervision of a gaming commission appointee.   Mohegan Sun at Pocono Downs in the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre area is another site where slots and OTB are available, and a proposed facility in the Allentown area is scheduled to open in the near future.     [ edit ]   Skiing in the Poconos   Numerous ski resorts in and around the Poconos offer some of the closest and most accessible skiing to the major populated areas of Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington DC areas.     Camelback Ski Area  - the most ski runs in the Poconos   Blue Mountain Ski Area   [ 14 ]  - the largest vertical drop in the Poconos (1,082 feet) and closest to Philadelphia   Elk Mountain Ski Area  - one of the larger areas with 30 trails, the highest ski peak at 2,600+ feet and a 1,000-foot vertical drop   Sno Mountain Ski Area  - just outside of Scranton, features the steepest terrain in the Poconos and a 1,000-foot vertical drop   Shawnee Mountain Ski Area   [ 15 ]  - closest to New York City, just across the Delaware from New Jersey, suited for families & beginners   Jack Frost Mountain and Big Boulder  [ 16 ]  - two sister ski areas, family oriented skiing   Ski Big Bear  [ 17 ]   Tanglewood - closed for the 2007/2008 season due to economic reasons.   Alpine Mountain  [ 18 ]   Eagle Rock Resort - the westernmost of the Pocono ski areas     Ski areas in the Poconos are not particularly large and do not have large vertical drops (Sno Mountain and Elk Mountain, with 1000' vertical drops are the largest), so runs tend to be on the shorter side. However, the Poconos do offer conveniently located skiing, and many areas also offer night skiing. Many Pocono ski resorts cater to both winter and transform themselves into water parks for summer visitors.   Downhill skiing is also offered at resort-hotel properties (such as Skytop Lodge and Fernwood) where guests can use the facilities as part of their stay.     [ edit ]   Rail service          The  Delaware-Lackawanna Railroad  mainline runs over the  Pocono Mountains .       Rail service is provided by the  Pennsylvania Northeast Regional Rail Authority . One of its primary objectives is to establish rail passenger service with  New Jersey Transit  between  Scranton, Pennsylvania  and  Hoboken, New Jersey  with connecting service at  Secaucus Junction  for  Manhattan, New York . Designated operator of the line is  NJ Transit . There is currently no passenger rail service from the Poconos to Hoboken, New Jersey.   On January 23, 2007, NJ Transit was given an initial environmental 'OK' to re-establish a Hoboken-to-Scranton connection, a restoration of the  Lackawanna Cut-Off .   Rebuilding rails on the Lackawanna Cut-Off, and subsequent resumption of passenger service is slated to be completed in 2011 or 2012.

I know that this is a hunting and fishing blog, but I have to toss out a “Well done!” to the Arizona Cardinals. I am not a football fanatic, and could barely tell you the difference between a slant and a fade. That being said, I have followed the Cards all year. I have been dazzled by their moments of brilliance, and mad as a hornet when they inexplicably pull a “Keystone Cops” routine. I think I have watched almost every game this year (when aired).   In the same way that winters in Arizona make the summers worthwhile, these past 3 games have made the poor performances earlier in the season worthwhile. These guys are making an awesome run, and playing some excellent football. Of course I hope they make it to the Superbowl (and now I think it’s actually possible!) but regardless of how far they get, props to Coach Whiz, his Staff, and the players. It’s nice to be proud to be a fan!

Posted on 5th January 2009      Under:  Arizona News ,   Events ,   Hunting  |    No Comments »                 Apprentice License A Great Idea!                                  I think this is a great idea. I’m curious as to how many people take advantage of this. Any tool that enables us to expose more people to hunting is to be applauded. Well done to AZGFD.   New Apprentice Hunting License offers a test drive at no cost   License encourages sportsmen to mentor others, assist hunter recruitment effort in Arizona   Effective Jan. 1, the Arizona Game and Fish Department is offering a new Apprentice Hunting License, at no charge, to encourage existing hunters to become mentors and introduce a friend, neighbor, relative, or co-worker to the traditions and importance of hunting.   The Apprentice License allows an already licensed hunter to take a beginner on an actual huntwithout the beginner having to buy a hunting license. The Apprentice License is free for residents and nonresidents and is valid for two consecutive days for the take of small game, fur-bearing, predatory and nongame mammals, nongame birds, and upland game birds. (To take migratory birds or waterfowl, the appropriate stamps are required at normal costs). The license is not valid for the take of big game.   Many people express an interest in hunting but are deterred either because of not knowing how to get started or the initial expense. The Apprentice Hunting License removes the initial cost barrier of having to buy a license (which costs between $26.50 and $151.25, depending on age and residency), so that newcomers can try before they buy.   This will allow a seasoned hunter to take someone new under their wing and teach them the basics about hunting, firearm safety, and wildlife conservation without cost prohibitive burdens, said Chairman Bill McLean of the Arizona Game and Fish Commission. There are many states with this type of license, and it has become a model for removing barriers in the national effort to increase hunter participation.    The Apprentice Hunting License is only available at Arizona Game and Fish Department offices. The mentor must be at least 18 years old and possess a valid hunting license and is limited to two Apprentice Hunting Licenses per calendar year. The license must be made out to the name of the apprentice, with the mentors name associated with the license. The apprentice can only receive one license per calendar year. The mentor is required to be with the apprentice at all times while in the field, providing instruction and supervision on safe and ethical hunting.   This is a great opportunity to help preserve and expand Arizonas hunting heritage and wildlife management through the next generation, said Craig McMullen, Hunter Heritage Work Group team leader for the Arizona Game and Fish Department. Not only will this allow someone new to experience the thrill of the hunt, this also allows mentors to teach others about wildlife conservation and the important role that hunters, as conservationists play, in the management of all wildlife.   Outside of getting new hunters in the field, safety is our number one concern. Hunting in Arizona is very safe, and we have one of the lowest accident rates in the United States, said Dave Williams, hunter education coordinator of the Arizona Game and Fish Department. A good mentor will instill the basics of wearing hunter orange and how to safely handle a firearm through T.A.B.+1: Treat every firearm as if it were loaded; Always keep the muzzle pointed in a safe direction; Be sure of your target and beyond; and keep your finger outside of the trigger guard until you are ready to shoot. Nearly every hunting-related accident can be avoided by following these simple principles   However, with the added flexibility comes added responsibility. Mentors need to set a good example to these impressionable new comers. Mentors should consider the following guidelines:   Focus on the experience not the harvest  Obey all laws  Keep your apprentices physical limits in mind  Be informative  Teach field dressing and cooking  Take pictures    Plan a follow-up outing     Seasoned hunters can start the New Year giving. By introducing someone new to hunting, you are giving the gift of the American hunting heritage. Quail season runs until Feb. 8, 2009, cottontail rabbit season runs all year long and the both make excellent quarry (as well as, great table fare) for new hunters. A 2009 hunting license is required beginning Jan. 1, 2009.

Nature abhors a vacuum; note that the Center For Biological Diversity is already staking a claim in this issue. Staking a claim while APS and several Government entities are scratching their heads. Combine this with the absolute irresponsibility demonstrated by the average person when it comes to utilizing the environment for recreation - this has disaster written all over it.   From this story on AzCentral.com:   State trying to protect the lush Fossil Creek   Here are some snippets:   Like any river or lake in the desert, Fossil Creek has become a magnet for visitors seeking relief from the hot city. Its restoration has government and non-profit groups scrambling to protect one of the state’s most unusual waterways and give it a rare second chance.   “Fossil Creek remains one of our major concerns,” said Michelle Harrington, rivers-program director for the Tucson-based Center for Biological Diversity. “We think there needs to be a plan in place to handle the visitors.”   No such plan exists now, in part because the agency responsible, the U.S. Forest Service, previously couldn’t afford to do the work. Except for a temporary closure this year while parts of the old power plant were removed, the creek and its surroundings have been open to the public with few enforceable limits.   No one meant to let the restoration of Fossil Creek get this far without a plan, but that’s what happened after Arizona Public Service decided three years ago to shut two hydropower plants that had diverted flow from the creek since the early 1900s.   The U.S. Forest Service, already stretched thin, ran out of money to complete the environmental studies needed to write a management plan, and it lacked money to patrol the area or install toilets or campsites. In the meantime, lured by running water, stunning scenery and easy drives from Phoenix and Flagstaff, people discovered Fossil Creek.   Although visitor counts aren’t available, the effects of heavy use are obvious. Stream banks have eroded. Makeshift campsites have flattened vegetation. The area is strewn with litter after busy weekends. Without public restrooms, visitors improvise, leaving waste and tissue products along the creek, threatening water quality.   So - try and convince me that this is going to have a good ending…                                 Posted on 27th December 2008      Under:  Arizona News ,   Conservation Groups ,   General  |    No Comments »                 Michigan Man Fined $14,995                                  You may recall the saga of  the Droptine Bull  - a tale that created a lot of hubbub in Arizona - in more ways than one. Anyway, after being found guilty in criminal court, the man was  sentenced to 8 hours of community service .   That was the result of the criminal justice system - but the Game and Fish Commission still had some justice of their own to dispense.  According to an article on the White Mountain Independent’s website  the Arizona game and Fish Commission has fined Malik $14,995. Even better (in my mind) his hunting privileges have been suspended here and in 27 other partner states - for 5 years. Good.   The commission also revoked his hunting, fishing and trapping privileges in Arizona for five years. Malik must successfully complete a hunter education course prior to having his license privileges restored.       The commission’s action to revoke Malik’s license for five years has far-reaching implications. Arizona is a member of the Interstate Wildlife Violator Compact with 27 other states, including all western states and Malik’s home state of Michigan. Until his license privileges are restored in Arizona, he will not be able to legally hunt in any of those 27 states.

The public input is being sought to determine the extent and variety of issues that should be addressed by the draft environmental assessment.  All comments must be submitted in writing no later than 5 p.m. on Dec. 19 .   Once the comment period ends, the wildlife agencies will prepare a draft environmental assessment to evaluate the social, economic and environmental effects of stockings related to continue funding for the program through the Sport Fish Restoration Program.   Written comments can be sent to either:   David Weedman, Aquatic Habitat Program Coordinator, Arizona Game and Fish Department, 5000 W. Carefree Highway, Phoenix, AZ 85086.  E-mail: fishaz@azgfd.gov    or   Harold Namminga, Sport Fish Restoration Grant Administrator, Wildlife and Sport Fish  Restoration Program, U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, P.O Box 1306, Albuquerque, NM 87103.   The federal funding apportioned to Arizona is authorized under the Federal Aid in Sport Fish Restoration Act of 1950, commonly referred to as the Dingell-Johnson Act and Wallop-Breaux Act. It provides federal aid to state wildlife agencies for management and restoration of sport fish.   These Sport Fish Restoration funds are derived from a federal excise tax at the manufacturing level on certain items of sport-fishing tackle, fishing equipment and motor boat fuel.

This is a preemptive strike. The slobs and the morons and the fools and the uneducated have ruined it for all of us. Announcements such as this will prove out to be only a formality. I have been preaching this about hunters and OHV Users since I started blogging. Chances are, if you are reading this blog, you are not representative of most hunters. If you work for an OHV organization, you are one of the few that understands stewardship and responsibility.   We’re already seeing serious restrictions on Federal lands. Coming soon to state lands near you…..   From AZGFD:   Outdoor recreationists: Respect private and public land, or risk losing access   Dec. 12, 2008   Recent incidents involving thoughtless and even destructive acts by some outdoor recreationists have Arizona Game and Fish Department officials and responsible outdoor users concerned about retaining continued public access to vast tracts of public and private land.   We work cooperatively with landowners, especially ranchers, to keep access for recreation open, said Sal Palazzolo, the Game and Fish Departments Landowner Relations Program manager, but it is a daunting task because senseless acts by a few thoughtless outdoor recreationists can jeopardize relations and result in large tracts of land being closed to us all.   Palazzolo said some of the lands in question happen to be premier hunting areas where outfitters are sometimes willing to pay landowners thousands of dollars for exclusive access.   We cant do it all ourselves. We need the assistance of sportsmen and other conscientious recreationists to help curb these senseless acts, Palazzolo said.   Here are some examples of what is happening.   Recently, a rancher in northern Arizona had closed a section of road across a stream because the road crossing had become washed out.   One one day this autumn, an elk hunter ignored the closure sign and promptly got his truck stuck in the creek, Palazzolo said, The rancher took it in stride and helped the individual contact a tow truck to haul the vehicle out.   The following day, another person also ignored the closure sign and got stuck in the creek, but nobody was home at the remote ranch house. There was a bulldozer parked near the private residence that a contractor was going to use to repair the road crossing.   Without any permission, the person who had gotten his vehicle stuck got into the bulldozer, fired it up, and pulled his truck out of the creek, causing damage to the fragile riparian area, Palazzolo said. We are still waiting to hear if the bulldozer was damaged in any way.   That isnt all.   On another ranch, a ranch hand had collected and displayed lots of deer and elk antlers over the years, and had actually made a fence of the antlers around his ranch house. While the cowboy was out working the range, someone stole all the prized antlers.   On yet another ranch, three men wearing camouflage clothing and riding all-terrain vehicles were seen shooting at a herd of grazing horses. Fortunately, these illegal road hunters didnt hit anything.   Fences have been cut, windmills shot up and signs shot to doll rags. Trash and litter have been left to despoil the land. Vehicles have torn up cattle tanks and earthen dams.   These senseless acts and others are putting continued access for hunters, off-roaders, campers and other recreationists in danger  for many reasons.   For instance, one rancher in the area said it costs him about $5,000 annually to repair damage or address other issues associated with recreationists.   Fortunately, this conscientious rancher still keeps working with us despite the fact he has been offered thousands of dollars by outfitters for exclusive hunting rights to his property, Palazzolo said.   Incidents such as these concern the responsible majority of outdoor recreationists.   I spend a lot of time working with ranchers and land managers on projects, and its appalling to see some of the damage, says longtime sportsman John Koleszar. Some people do it willfully, but others just dont know any better and need to be educated on outdoor ethics. Remember, ethics is what you do when no one is watching.   Koleszar has seen a great deal of good behavior by outdoor users, but some bad behavior as well.  Good behavior, he says, is respecting other people and the land, helping others out, asking permission to use private property. Bad behavior is ignoring posted signs, causing damage to habitat and property, cutting fences, among others.   These recent incidents also highlight a much broader issue facing outdoor recreationists.   Palazzolo pointed out that Arizona consists of about 72.6 million acres, of which 18 percent is privately owned. These lands represent important recreational opportunities as well as access corridors into other publicly owned lands.   Public access restrictions in Arizona have increased substantially over the last decade as more landowners exercise their right to deny access to or through their private lands. In many cases, access is prevented to State Trust and public lands as a result of these closures.   The seven most common reasons for landowners denying access are:   Vandalism  Trespassing  Littering  Off-road activities  Disruption of landowner operations  Liability Issues  Undocumented Immigrants and drug trafficking (Southern Arizona)  We cant be everywhere. Recreationists, especially hunters, need to be our eyes and ears out there, and also be ambassadors for conscientious recreational ethics on the land, Palazzolo said.   If you see someone doing one of these senseless acts, contact local law enforcement or call our Operation Game Thief at 1-800-352-0700.   The thing that worries me is that some people seem unaware of the potential consequences of their bad behavior, says Koleszar. If you dont exercise good outdoor ethics and educate others to do the same, land management agencies and private property owners could close off access. Its in the hands of the users to demonstrate theyre responsibleor they could lose it forever.   Palazzolo adds, The tract of public land you help keep open might just be your favorite hunting ground or maybe one of your favorite places to ride your quad. These lands belong to all of us, so help us help others to treat them that way.                                   Posted on 14th December 2008      Under:  Arizona News ,   Conservation Groups ,   General ,   Hunting  |    No Comments »                 Arizona Game and Fish Commission to hold all 09 meetings in Phoenix to save costs                                  Arizona Game and Fish Commission to hold all 09 meetings in Phoenix to save cost s   Dec. 12, 2008   Options considered to facilitate public participation from other areas of state   In an effort to reduce costs in the current economic climate, the Arizona Game and Fish Commission has decided to hold all of its regularly scheduled public meetings in 2009 at the Game and Fish Department headquarters in Phoenix.   The decision, made at the Dec. 6 commission meeting in Casa Grande, comes in the midst of a state budget deficit that has the agency taking a variety of measures to reduce costs. Game and Fish officials estimate the cost savings of this measure will be approximately $30,000 or more in site rental, travel and related costs.   The commission emphasized its commitment to being accessible and providing good customer service to the substantial wildlife constituent bases in other parts of the state, including Tucson, Yuma, Kingman, Flagstaff, Payson, the White Mountains and other areas.    During these tough economic times, we are doing everything we can to reduce costs in order to continue to meet programmatic needs, said Commission Chair Bill McLean. However, this commission is committed to its constituents and their participation in our open meetings. We are looking into a number of options that will still allow folks to participate in these meetings - regardless of the meeting location.   The commission currently rotates its monthly meetings among various locations throughout the state (no meeting is held in July or November). For 2009, meetings previously scheduled for Pinetop, Flagstaff, Prescott, Casa Grande, Tucson and Yuma will now take place at the Phoenix headquarters at 5000 W. Carefree Highway.   We fully understand that all of Arizonas citizens have an interest in wildlife conservation, not just residents in the Metro Phoenix area, and we want people from all parts of the state to be engaged, McLean said. But given the budget situation were facing and the availability of a large meeting facility at the department headquarters, we felt this action was necessary for 2009.   The Arizona Game and Fish Commission makes rules and regulations for managing, conserving, and protecting wildlife and fisheries resources, and safe and regulated watercraft and off-highway vehicle operations for the benefit of the citizens of Arizona. The commission appoints the director of the Arizona Game and Fish Department, and the director, as the departments chief administrative officer, provides general supervision and control of all department functions and activities.   The commission is composed of five members appointed by the Governor pursuant to ARS 38-211. No more than one commissioner may be from any one county, and no more than three may be from the same political party. Each commissioner serves a five-year term, staggered.

For no single, apparent reason, I have been seeing record traffic the last 2 weeks. That’s always cool, and the guys back at  headquarters  love that kind of stuff.   Then I found out that  Blogger Kevin Callahan had recognized and listed my site on his blog  which is associated with the Courier Post in New Jersey.   Topping out the week though, has been the result of some conversations held with Matt Blake over at  Fanster.com . Fanster is an awesome sports website that features articles, blogs, forums and more which focus on sports - especially Arizona sports. Matt has asked me to be the  hunting and fishing editor over at Fanster ! As a part of this arrangement, the Desert Rat Blog has been syndicated, and will automatically feed Fanster. I’ll also be blogging over there, to supplement the auto-fed posts.   This is really cool stuff, and I appreciate the opportunity Matt has provided, and am looking forward to joining the ranks of some pretty cool sports writers that have also found their way over to  Fanster . Please stop by over there, and have a look around!

I think my knowledge is at a pretty decent level, I just need some practical experience in the field - tips and tricks that will finally put me over the top.

Posted on 30th April 2007      Under:  General ,   Hunting  |    No Comments »                 Fall Regs Coming                                  I need to start building some strategies…   Game and Fish Commission sets June 12 deadline for fall big game hunts  Regulations should be posted online by the 1st week of May   The Arizona Game and Fish Commission approved the fall big game hunts for deer, turkey, javelina, bighorn sheep, buffalo, bear and mountain lion on Saturday, April 21.   Hunters can start applying for the permitted fall big game hunts once the 2007-2008 Hunting and Trapping Regulation booklet is posted on the departments Web site by the first week of May.   License dealers in the state should have the printed regulation booklets by the third week of May. The online hunt application process is available but hunters can still choose to submit a paper application if they desire.   The hunt application deadline is June 12 at 7 p.m., (MST). Postmarks do not count. However, those applying via the paper hunt permit-tag application form have a grace period; if a submitted paper application contains an error and is received by May 30, the department will make three attempts within a 24-hour period to notify the applicant by telephone, if indeed a telephone number is provided on the application. The online application process allows hunters the assurance of entering a correct and complete application when submission occurs.   Dont forget that the small game seasons were set by the commission last year for a two-year period. However, the commission did make a slight modification to the season for blue grouse due to a planned grouse transplant effort.   Hunters this year will see a slight increase in deer permits and a continuation of fall javelina seasons.   Something new for the fall is juniors-only archery and muzzleloader javelina hunts in Unit 39. The commission also set a 400-permit juniors-only antlerless hunt in Unit 12A on the North Kaibab.   Although an early archery deer starting on Aug. 31 had been proposed for this upcoming fall season, the commission opted to move that season a week earlier to start on Aug. 24, thus preventing an overlap with early archery elk season that was previously set by the commission in December 2006.   Keep in mind that this is the first year for an early draw on elk and antelope. The draw has already taken place for those two species. Now hunters already know whether or not they have been drawn for those two species prior to applying for other fall hunts. Its anticipated that the next draw deadline for pronghorn antelope and elk hunts will be Feb. 12, 2008.

Some pending legislation has started everyone talking. As usual, I find it difficult to wade through the legislation, and the opinions of sportsmen seem to be varied, to say the least.   One thing is clear to me - every time I am afield, I see damage caused by ATVs. I see people riding where they are not supposed to be riding. Granted, many (most?) of these people are NOT hunters, but ultimately hunters will be affected. These people are the same types of buffoons that leave trash everywhere, shoot signs and other stuff, etc.   An interesting discussion can be found over at this site:   AZSJ                                 Posted on 28th April 2007      Under:  Arizona News ,   General ,   Hunting ,   Politics and More  |    No Comments »                 Public Input Sought by AZGFD                                  Public input sought on wildlife, recreation plans  April 26, 2007     Eight informational meetings to be held statewide in May    The Arizona Game and Fish Department is seeking public comment on draft plans that will guide how the agency manages wildlife, outdoor recreational opportunities and its own detailed operations for the next two years.   Eight public meetings will be held around the state the first two weeks in May to provide an overview of the plans and to accept comments.   The draft operational plans identify the approaches the department will take to implement key management programs, including game, nongame, sportfish, off-highway vehicle, watercraft and business administration, as well as support functions such as public information and education, law enforcement, shooting sports, habitat, research, and watchable wildlife. The department develops new operational plans every two years.   Public input is important in helping us develop and finalize these plans, says Bob Broscheid, the departments assistant director for wildlife management. Everyone has a stake in the continued health of our states wildlife populations and in future recreational opportunities. Its important to make your viewpoint known.   The operational plans are the middle tier in a three-part planning process for the department, bridging the departments six-year visionary strategic plan, Wildlife 2012, with annual work unit implementation plans that include information on what work will be accomplished.    The draft documents are posted for review on the departments Web site at azgfd.gov along with Wildlife 2012, the strategic plan that went into effect in January.   The public meetings will include a presentation on the planning process and an overview of operational plan highlights, and public comments will be accepted. The meetings will be held from 6-8 p.m. on the following dates:   Tuesday, May 1  Yuma, Arizona Game and Fish Department Yuma regional office, 9140 E. 28th St.   Wednesday, May 2  Safford, General Services Assembly Room, 921 Thatcher Blvd.   Thursday, May 3 - Tucson, Arizona Game and Fish Department Tucson regional office, 555 N.

Beginning Tuesday, May 1, the hours of operation will be:   Mondays: Closed  Tuesdays: 5-9:30 p.m.  Wednesdays: 7 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 5-9:30 p.m. (closed 1-5 p.m.)  Thursdays: 7 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 5-9:30 p.m. (closed 1-5 p.m.)  Fridays: 7 a.m. to 1 p.m.  Saturdays: 7 a.m. to 9:30 p.m.  Sundays: 7 a.m. to 5 p.m.  The new hours will allow us to better serve our customers this time of year, when days are longer and the weather hotter, says Dana Yost, assistant director of information and education for the Arizona Game and Fish Department. The expanded hours and lighted range areas will let shooters take advantage of more comfortable evening temperatures.   The Ben Avery Clay Target Center will resume offering evening trap, skeet and sporting clays shooting on May 1. Evening shooting had been suspended last November when the Arizona Game and Fish Department began renovations on the westernmost trap and skeet fields. Those renovations, which included installation of a new electrical system and lights, have been completed on most of the fields.    Yost added that when daytime temperatures begin consistently exceeding 100 F, the Main Range and Clay Target Center will adjust Saturday hours to 7 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 5-9:30 p.m. (closed 1-5 p.m.) and Sunday hours to 7 a.m. to 1 p.m.   Well post the changes well in advance at the range and on the Arizona Game and Fish Department Web site at azgfd.gov/basf and azgfd.gov/ctc, says Yost.   The department also is planning on lighting some of the archery ranges and will announce archery evening hours in the coming weeks.   Winter hours for the Main Range and Clay Target Center will resume sometime in late fall 2007. Those hours will be posted in advance at the range and on the Arizona Game and Fish Department Web site.   The Ben Avery Shooting Facility Main Range is located at 4044 W. Black Canyon Blvd. in Phoenix. The Ben Avery Clay Target Center is located at 37016 N. Archery Drive in Phoenix. To get to either, take I-17 to the Carefree Highway exit (exit 223). Go west on Carefree Highway about 1/4 mile for the Main Range entrance, or go west about 1/2 mile for the Clay Target Center entrance and follow the signs.

Nothing gets me going in a hurry as much as people on Arizona Message Boards saying we need to “weed out” the “casual” hunters. C’mon!! We should be trying to recruit hunters, not alienate them! Who decides who is “serious” enough and who is not? Has competition for tags and territory gotten that intense in Arizona that we are willing to eat our own?

If you like to use salt or other “baits”, you had better listen up. It seems as  though they are considering banning the use of bait, and that includes salt. In Arizona, you can bait anything excepts bears and migratory birds. A lot of hunters have used salt with great success, especially for setting up trail cams.

Let’s hope so!   From AZGFD   Governor nominates Woodhouse to Game and Fish Commission   Governor Janet Napolitano announced the nomination of Robert Robbie Woodhouse from the Yuma area to the Arizona Game and Fish Commission, subject to State Senate confirmation.   Robbie will bring a wealth of experience to the commission, Governor Napolitano said. His experience in working with the Legislature and active community leadership will make him a valuable asset to Arizona Game and Fish.   Woodhouse, a third-generation Arizonan and a third generation farmer in the Wellton-Mohawk Valley, is a lifelong sportsman who wants to give something back to the wildlife resources of this state. He is the owner of Casa de Lena Farms and president of the Woodhouse & Son Inc. Trucking Company.   I truly admire what the Game and Fish Commission and department have accomplished over the years, he says. Like most sportsmen, I look forward to those times when I am lucky enough to get drawn for something.    The Game and Fish Commission is the policy-setting board overseeing the Arizona Game and Fish Department. Commission members, who are appointed by the governor, serve staggered five-year terms.   Woodhouse, who lives in the community of Roll near Yuma, has served on numerous boards and commissions and has a keen insight to the needs of the western region of Arizona.   Woodhouse is excited about the opportunity to serve on the Game and Fish Commission. When you read the outdoor magazines, it becomes apparent that Arizona offers some of the best big game hunting in the nation. That speaks well for the wildlife resources here and the management we have in place.   A lifelong sportsman, Woodhouse is a member of the Yuma Rod and Gun Club, is a life member of the National Rifle Association, and also belongs to the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation, Arizona Deer Association and Safari Club International.   Woodhouse has already been busy looking through the minutes of all the recent meetings of the Game and Fish Commission. I know there is an immense learning curve ahead of me, so I have been anxious to get started.   Woodhouse is no stranger to serving on a public policy setting board. For more than two decades, he has served as a member of two different school boards. He served on the Mohawk Valley School Governing Board from 1980 to 1996, including six terms as president. From 1997 to the present, he has served on the Antelope High School Governing Board, including two terms as president.   There are a lot of parallels between a school board and the commission. Both are policy-setting boards and both have an enforcement aspect as well, Woodhouse says.   Woodhouse has also served as a board member of the Wellton-Mohawk Irrigation District, is a past board member of the Yuma County Farm Bureau and is the current president of the Growers Mohawk Gin Board. He also belongs to the Arizona Cotton Growers, Western Growers Association, Yuma Fresh Vegetable Association and the Arizona Crop Improvement Association.   Woodhouse says all those years of serving on boards and committees have taught him the importance of gathering as much information as possible from all sources during the decision-making process. I feel strongly that both the pros and cons need to be heard during the process. I think it is important for me to be approachable to anyone or to any side to an issue. I want to hear all ideas.   Having served on many governing boards, Woodhouse also recognizes the value of gathering the necessary data and other information from the subject experts as well. There is a lot that goes into making good decisions.   Woodhouse was born and raised in the Yuma area, and lives a short distance down the road from the house where he grew up on the family farm. He has been married to his wife, Blanca, for 31 years and has two children, Weston and Kellen.   Woodhouse is a master graduate of the Rapport Leadership Institute. He is bilingual and speaks fluent Spanish. He has also been a private pilot since 1971.   He replaces Joseph Melton of Yuma, whose term on the Game and Fish Commission expired in January.                                   Posted on 15th April 2007      Under:  Arizona News ,   General  |    No Comments »                 AZGFD Considering Fall Hunt Recommendations                                  Game and Fish Commission is considering fall hunt recommendations    A slight increase in deer permits, a continuation of fall javelina seasons, and a 3-month restriction on mountain lion hunting in units without multiple bag limits are three of the recommendations being considered by the Arizona Game and Fish Commission on Saturday, April 21 in Glendale.   The commission is meeting at the Glendale Civic Center, 5750 W. Glenn Drive (on 57th Drive one block north of Glendale Avenue), starting at 8 a.m. on April 21 to  set the seasons for deer, fall turkey, fall javelina, bighorn sheep, fall buffalo, fall bear and mountain lion. Those interested in the full recommendations can view them at the Game and Fish Departments Web site.  AZGF   Elk and antelope are not part of this current hunt proposal package. This is the first year for an early draw on elk and antelope and the draw has already taken place for those two species. Now hunters already know whether or not they have been drawn for those two species prior to applying for the other fall hunts.   The recommendation hunt package this year has some of the components that were introduced for the first time last year. The Game and Fish Department is recommending the commission maintain the deer and javelina fall seasons adopted last year, says Game Chief Leonard Ordway.   For instance, last year the commission set no more than 10 percent of the general white-tailed deer hunting opportunities during the December rut. The department is proposing the same season strategy for whitetails again this year to help maximize hunt opportunities.   Also, last year was the first time a fall hunt was offered for javelina in another effort to increase hunting opportunities. The department is recommending javelina seasons in the same format implemented last year.   The department is also recommending a juniors-only archery and muzzleloader javelina season in Unit 39.   Ordway explained that hunt recommendations were formulated following the two-year guidelines approved by the commission last year.    The department is recommending 40,055 general deer season permits in 2007, which is an increase of 2,080 compared to 2006.                                  Posted on 15th April 2007      Under:  Arizona News ,   General ,   Hunting  |    No Comments »                 More on elk crossings                                  I’ve blogged on these before. I’m happy to see that they are finding them useful in preventing elk/human collisions.   From AZ Central   A road less taken . . . by wildlife  High-tech project near Payson is reducing auto-animal collisions   DeWayne Smith  Special For The Republic  Apr. 12, 2007 03:27 PM  Elk, much like the proverbial chicken, cross the road to get to the other side. But when the road is Arizona 260 east of Payson, there can be grave and expensive consequences to the jaywalking wildlife as well as to the motorists who hit them.   However, a unique project to use regular and electrified fencing to “funnel” migrating elk through planned underpasses along the 3-mile stretch from east of Star Valley to where the highway begins to climb up the Mogollon Rim seems to be doing its job, according to Norris Dodd, a researcher for the Arizona Game and Fish Department.   A part of the $700,000 project is the installation of what is being called an elk crosswalk in a favored migration area where a tunnel or bridge is not feasible. Basically, the animals milling about adjacent to the highway are detected electronically and warnings are flashed on signs along the highway.   “A sign tells motorists they are entering the elk crosswalk area, and when the system detects the animals in the vicinity the signs flash telling them animals are crossing ahead,” Dodd said.   “Basically, what we are saying is if the signs are flashing there are definitely elk in the area. If they were flashing all the time nobody would pay attention.”   More here                                 Posted on 14th April 2007      Under:  Arizona News ,   General  |    1 Comment »                 « Previous Entries                            Desert Rat  is powered by  WordPress 2.7   and is adorned with the  Chameleon  theme  by  Ainslie Johnson                             
clueweb09-enwp01-80-06203	"                     The Poconos          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia        (Redirected from  Poconos )            Jump to:  navigation ,  search                 Pennsylvania's Pocono region counties       The  Pocono Mountains  region is a mountainous region of about 2,400 square miles (6,200 km) located in northeastern  Pennsylvania .   The Pocono Mountains is a popular recreational destination for local and regional visitors. The region has a population of about 300,000, which is growing at a rapid pace, largely attributable to vacationers from the New York City region who are turning vacation homes into permanent residences. [ citation needed ]  The region lacks a major population center, although there are small municipalities which are scattered throughout the area. The Poconos now serves as a commuter community for the  Northern New Jersey  metropolitan areas, even though the commute often takes as much as 2 hours each way due to distance and traffic. Because the region lacks a population center, it has been difficult to establish transit infrastructure to feed (future) commuter rail and bus lines. Stroudsburg is usually known as the heart of the poconos and is growing very rapidly in population and in retail with the new Shoppes at Stroud, bartonsville plaza which is in stroud township and plans have been made to build the shoppes at crossroads and the bartonsville square which are also part of stroud and hamilton townships they are both currently waiting approval by the townships.

The Pocono Mountains is a vaguely defined area encompassing  Carbon ,  Monroe ,  Pike , and  Southern Wayne  Counties of Pennsylvania  [ 1 ] , as well as portions of neighboring counties such as  Susquehanna ,  Luzerne , and  Lackawanna . The region of  Northampton County  from the Slate Belt northwards is also sometimes included [ 2 ] . In total, the Poconos encompasses over 2,500 square miles. The Poconos are mountainous, geologically a southwestern extension of the  Catskills . The Poconos' highest summit, Elk Hills North Knob, reaches 2,693 feet (821 m), while its lowest elevation is 350 feet (107 m) in Pike County.   The  Delaware River  flows through the Pocono Mountains and gives the region its name, from a Native American term roughly translating to ""stream between two mountains."" The  Lehigh  and  Lackawaxen  Rivers also flow through the region, totaling about 170 miles (270 km) of waterways. The Pocono Mountains are also home to some 150 lakes and many  waterfalls , such as those in the  Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area  of  Monroe County  and  Ricketts Glen State Park  in northwestern  Luzerne County .     [ edit ]   Recreation   The popularity of the Pocono Mountains as a summer retreat began at the dawn of the 20th century when Philadelphia Quakers started the resorts of  Buck Hill Falls  and  Pocono Manor , and later in the 1920s,  Skytop .          Midday view of Lake Harmony              Evening view of Lake Harmony               Camelback Ski Area       The Poconos is a well-known outdoor recreation destination for visitors around the northeast, especially from  New York City  and  Philadelphia . Primary attractions are centered around the region's diverse natural offerings. The Poconos encompasses the  Delaware State Forest   [ 3 ] , including six designated natural areas  [ 4 ] , seven state parks  [ 5 ] , seventeen state game lands  [ 6 ] , and one national park: The  Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area . There are extensive opportunities for water sports, with many of the lakes and rivers stocked for fishing. Hunters pursue  white-tailed deer ,  wild turkeys ,  ruffed grouse , and other wildlife. More  American black bear  are killed here than anywhere else in the state, and likely the contiguous 48 states. This is largely due to acidic pine barren creek valleys teeming with  trout  and berries. Toward the southern margin of the Poconos, the  Blue Mountain  ridge is the site of the  Appalachian Trail  and a major  flyway  for the autumn  raptor   migration , including the nationally renowned  Hawk Mountain  sanctuary.   The Poconos is also home to Summer Camps, such as Camp Pocono Ridge [ 7 ]  and  Goose Pond Scout Reservation  near Lake Ariel.   The Poconos is and has been Pennsylvania's most popular tourist destination. The region contains over 80% of the state's resorts. These resorts earn 1.5 billion dollars in gross revenues and employ 18,000 workers. The region is also a popular winter destination. [ 8 ]  State parks offer snowmobile trails, snowshoeing, and eagle watching. [ 9 ]   Popular summer activities include whitewater rafting and canoeing down the Delaware and Lehigh Rivers, camping and hiking, water parks, and smaller attractions such as Claws N Paws Wild Animal Park  [ 10 ] , Kittatinny Rafting & Paintball  [ 11 ] , Houdini Museum  [ 12 ]  and others. Another popular recreation activity growing around the Poconos is  disc golf . Currently there are several  disc golf  courses located around the Poconos. Other outdoor activities, particularly  golf , are also popular options.   Another attraction is  Pocono Raceway , a major automobile racetrack, which is home to two  NASCAR Sprint Cup Series  races, the  Pocono 500  in June, and the  Pennsylvania 500  in August. It also serves as a racing school and motorcycle track.   The Poconos is a major resort destination with new additions such as Great Wolf Lodge for families, a resurrection of Mount Airy as a gaming (slots) and golf resort, the famous Ceasars Pocono Resorts with heart-shaped and champagne whirlpool baths for two (couples only) and a retreat known as  Woodloch Pines  that has added a spa facility.     [ edit ]   Gaming   A highly controversial proposal to license a gambling casino with slot machines in Monroe County was approved in 2007 and the casino at  Mount Airy Lodge  is now open to the public. [ 13 ]  Adding to the controversy is the reported connection between the casino's owner and organized crime which has placed Mount Airy under the supervision of a gaming commission appointee.   Mohegan Sun at Pocono Downs in the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre area is another site where slots and OTB are available, and a proposed facility in the Allentown area is scheduled to open in the near future.     [ edit ]   Skiing in the Poconos   Numerous ski resorts in and around the Poconos offer some of the closest and most accessible skiing to the major populated areas of Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington DC areas.     Camelback Ski Area  - the most ski runs in the Poconos   Blue Mountain Ski Area   [ 14 ]  - the largest vertical drop in the Poconos (1,082 feet) and closest to Philadelphia   Elk Mountain Ski Area  - one of the larger areas with 30 trails, the highest ski peak at 2,600+ feet and a 1,000-foot vertical drop   Sno Mountain Ski Area  - just outside of Scranton, features the steepest terrain in the Poconos and a 1,000-foot vertical drop   Shawnee Mountain Ski Area   [ 15 ]  - closest to New York City, just across the Delaware from New Jersey, suited for families & beginners   Jack Frost Mountain and Big Boulder  [ 16 ]  - two sister ski areas, family oriented skiing   Ski Big Bear  [ 17 ]   Tanglewood - closed for the 2007/2008 season due to economic reasons.   Alpine Mountain  [ 18 ]   Eagle Rock Resort - the westernmost of the Pocono ski areas     Ski areas in the Poconos are not particularly large and do not have large vertical drops (Sno Mountain and Elk Mountain, with 1000' vertical drops are the largest), so runs tend to be on the shorter side. However, the Poconos do offer conveniently located skiing, and many areas also offer night skiing. Many Pocono ski resorts cater to both winter and transform themselves into water parks for summer visitors.   Downhill skiing is also offered at resort-hotel properties (such as Skytop Lodge and Fernwood) where guests can use the facilities as part of their stay.     [ edit ]   Rail service          The  Delaware-Lackawanna Railroad  mainline runs over the  Pocono Mountains .       Rail service is provided by the  Pennsylvania Northeast Regional Rail Authority . One of its primary objectives is to establish rail passenger service with  New Jersey Transit  between  Scranton, Pennsylvania  and  Hoboken, New Jersey  with connecting service at  Secaucus Junction  for  Manhattan, New York . Designated operator of the line is  NJ Transit . There is currently no passenger rail service from the Poconos to Hoboken, New Jersey.   On January 23, 2007, NJ Transit was given an initial environmental 'OK' to re-establish a Hoboken-to-Scranton connection, a restoration of the  Lackawanna Cut-Off .   Rebuilding rails on the Lackawanna Cut-Off, and subsequent resumption of passenger service is slated to be completed in 2011 or 2012. [ 19 ]     [ edit ]   Newspapers   A few newspapers covering local events and happenings include the daily paper,  The  Pocono Record , a weekly paper, a shopper and  Blue Mountain Moments , which is published monthly. To the north, additional regional publications covering  Pike  and  Wayne  Counties include the  News Eagle ,  Pike County Dispatch ,  Milford Magazine ,  Pike County Courier , and  Wayne Independent .

clueweb09-enwp01-53-04747	"                     The Poconos          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia        (Redirected from  Pocono Mountains )            Jump to:  navigation ,  search                 Pennsylvania's Pocono region counties       The  Pocono Mountains  region is a mountainous region of about 2,400 square miles (6,200 km) located in northeastern  Pennsylvania .   The Pocono Mountains is a popular recreational destination for local and regional visitors. The region has a population of about 300,000, which is growing at a rapid pace, largely attributable to vacationers from the New York City region who are turning vacation homes into permanent residences. [ citation needed ]  The region lacks a major population center, although there are small municipalities which are scattered throughout the area. The Poconos now serves as a commuter community for the  Northern New Jersey  metropolitan areas, even though the commute often takes as much as 2 hours each way due to distance and traffic. Because the region lacks a population center, it has been difficult to establish transit infrastructure to feed (future) commuter rail and bus lines. Stroudsburg is usually known as the heart of the poconos and is growing very rapidly in population and in retail with the new Shoppes at Stroud, bartonsville plaza which is in stroud township and plans have been made to build the shoppes at crossroads and the bartonsville square which are also part of stroud and hamilton townships they are both currently waiting approval by the townships.

The Pocono Mountains is a vaguely defined area encompassing  Carbon ,  Monroe ,  Pike , and  Southern Wayne  Counties of Pennsylvania  [ 1 ] , as well as portions of neighboring counties such as  Susquehanna ,  Luzerne , and  Lackawanna . The region of  Northampton County  from the Slate Belt northwards is also sometimes included [ 2 ] . In total, the Poconos encompasses over 2,500 square miles. The Poconos are mountainous, geologically a southwestern extension of the  Catskills . The Poconos' highest summit, Elk Hills North Knob, reaches 2,693 feet (821 m), while its lowest elevation is 350 feet (107 m) in Pike County.   The  Delaware River  flows through the Pocono Mountains and gives the region its name, from a Native American term roughly translating to ""stream between two mountains."" The  Lehigh  and  Lackawaxen  Rivers also flow through the region, totaling about 170 miles (270 km) of waterways. The Pocono Mountains are also home to some 150 lakes and many  waterfalls , such as those in the  Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area  of  Monroe County  and  Ricketts Glen State Park  in northwestern  Luzerne County .     [ edit ]   Recreation   The popularity of the Pocono Mountains as a summer retreat began at the dawn of the 20th century when Philadelphia Quakers started the resorts of  Buck Hill Falls  and  Pocono Manor , and later in the 1920s,  Skytop .          Midday view of Lake Harmony              Evening view of Lake Harmony               Camelback Ski Area       The Poconos is a well-known outdoor recreation destination for visitors around the northeast, especially from  New York City  and  Philadelphia . Primary attractions are centered around the region's diverse natural offerings. The Poconos encompasses the  Delaware State Forest   [ 3 ] , including six designated natural areas  [ 4 ] , seven state parks  [ 5 ] , seventeen state game lands  [ 6 ] , and one national park: The  Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area . There are extensive opportunities for water sports, with many of the lakes and rivers stocked for fishing. Hunters pursue  white-tailed deer ,  wild turkeys ,  ruffed grouse , and other wildlife. More  American black bear  are killed here than anywhere else in the state, and likely the contiguous 48 states. This is largely due to acidic pine barren creek valleys teeming with  trout  and berries. Toward the southern margin of the Poconos, the  Blue Mountain  ridge is the site of the  Appalachian Trail  and a major  flyway  for the autumn  raptor   migration , including the nationally renowned  Hawk Mountain  sanctuary.   The Poconos is also home to Summer Camps, such as Camp Pocono Ridge [ 7 ]  and  Goose Pond Scout Reservation  near Lake Ariel.   The Poconos is and has been Pennsylvania's most popular tourist destination. The region contains over 80% of the state's resorts. These resorts earn 1.5 billion dollars in gross revenues and employ 18,000 workers. The region is also a popular winter destination. [ 8 ]  State parks offer snowmobile trails, snowshoeing, and eagle watching. [ 9 ]   Popular summer activities include whitewater rafting and canoeing down the Delaware and Lehigh Rivers, camping and hiking, water parks, and smaller attractions such as Claws N Paws Wild Animal Park  [ 10 ] , Kittatinny Rafting & Paintball  [ 11 ] , Houdini Museum  [ 12 ]  and others. Another popular recreation activity growing around the Poconos is  disc golf . Currently there are several  disc golf  courses located around the Poconos. Other outdoor activities, particularly  golf , are also popular options.   Another attraction is  Pocono Raceway , a major automobile racetrack, which is home to two  NASCAR Sprint Cup Series  races, the  Pocono 500  in June, and the  Pennsylvania 500  in August. It also serves as a racing school and motorcycle track.   The Poconos is a major resort destination with new additions such as Great Wolf Lodge for families, a resurrection of Mount Airy as a gaming (slots) and golf resort, the famous Ceasars Pocono Resorts with heart-shaped and champagne whirlpool baths for two (couples only) and a retreat known as  Woodloch Pines  that has added a spa facility.     [ edit ]   Gaming   A highly controversial proposal to license a gambling casino with slot machines in Monroe County was approved in 2007 and the casino at  Mount Airy Lodge  is now open to the public. [ 13 ]  Adding to the controversy is the reported connection between the casino's owner and organized crime which has placed Mount Airy under the supervision of a gaming commission appointee.   Mohegan Sun at Pocono Downs in the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre area is another site where slots and OTB are available, and a proposed facility in the Allentown area is scheduled to open in the near future.     [ edit ]   Skiing in the Poconos   Numerous ski resorts in and around the Poconos offer some of the closest and most accessible skiing to the major populated areas of Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington DC areas.     Camelback Ski Area  - the most ski runs in the Poconos   Blue Mountain Ski Area   [ 14 ]  - the largest vertical drop in the Poconos (1,082 feet) and closest to Philadelphia   Elk Mountain Ski Area  - one of the larger areas with 30 trails, the highest ski peak at 2,600+ feet and a 1,000-foot vertical drop   Sno Mountain Ski Area  - just outside of Scranton, features the steepest terrain in the Poconos and a 1,000-foot vertical drop   Shawnee Mountain Ski Area   [ 15 ]  - closest to New York City, just across the Delaware from New Jersey, suited for families & beginners   Jack Frost Mountain and Big Boulder  [ 16 ]  - two sister ski areas, family oriented skiing   Ski Big Bear  [ 17 ]   Tanglewood - closed for the 2007/2008 season due to economic reasons.   Alpine Mountain  [ 18 ]   Eagle Rock Resort - the westernmost of the Pocono ski areas     Ski areas in the Poconos are not particularly large and do not have large vertical drops (Sno Mountain and Elk Mountain, with 1000' vertical drops are the largest), so runs tend to be on the shorter side. However, the Poconos do offer conveniently located skiing, and many areas also offer night skiing. Many Pocono ski resorts cater to both winter and transform themselves into water parks for summer visitors.   Downhill skiing is also offered at resort-hotel properties (such as Skytop Lodge and Fernwood) where guests can use the facilities as part of their stay.     [ edit ]   Rail service          The  Delaware-Lackawanna Railroad  mainline runs over the  Pocono Mountains .       Rail service is provided by the  Pennsylvania Northeast Regional Rail Authority . One of its primary objectives is to establish rail passenger service with  New Jersey Transit  between  Scranton, Pennsylvania  and  Hoboken, New Jersey  with connecting service at  Secaucus Junction  for  Manhattan, New York . Designated operator of the line is  NJ Transit . There is currently no passenger rail service from the Poconos to Hoboken, New Jersey.   On January 23, 2007, NJ Transit was given an initial environmental 'OK' to re-establish a Hoboken-to-Scranton connection, a restoration of the  Lackawanna Cut-Off .

Most of you by now have read about, and seen photos of the giant feral pig shot by an 11-year old boy in Alabama. This thing is definitely huge, and weighed in at well over 1000 pounds.  Story Here   Well, the boy and his family have created a website in honor (?) of the accomplishment. The site has photos, the story, info about the young man and his family, and a place to post comments. Now, you just knew that there would be some negative comments posted. Not everyone agrees with hunting. Did you ever suspect that people would ever show their displeasure with comments like this: ” hurry up enlist in the Army, I want to see you chased and shot at. And maybe beheaded on video for us to see….I will laugh while eating my veggie burger”  ?  Or maybe a comment like “You are a worthless piece of crap and i hope one day another noble american hunter such as yourself mistakes you for a large hog and shoots you about 12 times before your fat ass drops dead. They’ll definately need another backhoe in the woods to pick your body up with. I hope you’re enjoying your fame. Satan is going to have fun with you when you rot in hell.” This is an interesting one - “ I hope you’ll be shot someday.. People like you shouldn’t live (yes i mean it) May you burn up in hell, pigh4ter!” . Then, there is this well-thought out little gem : “What the f**k is your fu***ng problem you fat a** b**ch.  You fu**ing killed a f***ing innocent little pig.  Does it make your fat a** feel good to kill such an innocent creature.  Wow congratufu**inglations you fat ass fu**ing c**t.  I hope the boars babies come back alive and eat your sausage link penis you, fat piece of sh*t.  Fu**ing fat redneck.  I hope demons come and haunt your fat ass for the rest of your life.  Do you think your hot sh*t for this bitch?  Well your not fat ass.  Burn in hell you rotten piece of sh*t.  F**K YOU!!!!!  F**KING FAT ASS REDNECK PIECE OF SH*T!!!!!!!!!”   Now, granted, a lot of these comments were probably made by kids. The anonymity of the internet does make some brazen - it’s easy to say whatever you want, when no one can see you, or no one knows who you are. These visceral reactions though, should serve as a reminder of just what we are up against, when defending our sport. Would any of us post comments like this at a vegan website? I doubt it…  Do must of us defend our pastime with the same passion and vigor? I doubt it…..   As a matter of fact, I have read some disparaging comments from hunters on the message boards… The gist of the comments being that this was a low-fenced hunt, and thusly - not worth defending. It may not be your cup of tea, but do hunters really want to be picking the fly feces out of the pepper, when it comes to these issues?

Martin was appointed last year by Governor Janet Napolitano, but the Senate did not act upon her confirmation at that time.   Woodhouse, from the Wellton-Mohawk Valley town of Roll, was appointed this year to replace Joseph Melton of Yuma, whose term on the Game and Fish Commission expired in January.   Woodhouse is a third-generation Arizonan and a third generation farmer. He is a lifelong sportsman who wants to give something back to the wildlife resources of this state. He is the owner of Casa de Lena Farms and president of the Woodhouse & Son Inc. Trucking Company.   Martin, of Phoenix, operates a technical writing business and is experienced in the areas of strategic planning, project design and grant writing. She grew up in the foothills of Superstition Mountain, where she developed a strong interest in nature and wildlife.   Martin earned a Bachelor of Science in biology from Northern Arizona University and worked as a biologist in a variety of roles, which included coordination of a statewide bird conservation initiative and administration of a granting program for the Arizona Game and Fish Department.   Game and Fish Commissioners serve staggered five-year terms.

More from AZGF:   Camping season is here: Be bear aware   Prime camping season has arrived in the high country, and the Arizona Game and Fish Department wants to remind people heading to the great outdoors to be bear aware and keep a clean campsite.   The root cause of most conflicts between bears and people, especially in camping areas, is food. Bears cant change their behavior, but people can, says Bruce Sitko, a Game and Fish Department public information officer in the Pinetop regional office.   Prolonged drought and the subsequent decrease of food growing in the wild in some regions of the state have Game and Fish Department biologists concerned about a possible increase in bear-human encounters this year.    Officials say it is prudent for all outdoor recreationists to take the following precautions to minimize potential conflicts with bears and other wildlife:   Never intentionally feed wildlife.   Secure all garbage.   Keep a clean camp.   Do not cook in your tent or sleeping area.   Store all food, toiletries and other scented items well away from sleeping areas and unavailable to bears.   Wash up, change clothing, and remove all scented articles before retiring to your sleeping area.   Walk or jog in groups. Pay attention to your surroundings when hiking, jogging or bicycling.   Supervise your children and keep them in sight.   Keep your pets on a leash–dont allow them to roam free. Or better yet, leave them at home if you can. Pets can easily get into conflicts with a wide range of wildlife from skunks to coyotes.  If you are confronted by a bear, dont run. Try to make yourself look as big and imposing as possible. Stay facing the animal. Throw something at it. Speak and let it know you are human. Loud noises can help. Try clanging pans, using air horns, or whatever is available.

Let’s hope for rain, no lightning, and a fire season that just “fizzles out”…   From AZGF:   Arizona Game and Fish institutes fire restrictions at 11 wildlife areas   The Arizona Game and Fish Department instituted fire restrictions at 11 of its wildlife areas in the state starting May 23. The affected areas are:   Alamo Wildlife Area  Arlington Wildlife Area  Base and Meridian Wildlife Area  Colorado River Nature Center Wildlife Area  Mittry Lake Wildlife Area  Powers Butte Wildlife Area  Quigley Wildlife Area  Robbins Butte Wildlife Area  Roosevelt Lake Wildlife Area  Three Bar Wildlife Area  Upper Verde Wildlife Area  The following restrictions apply at those areas:   No open fires are allowed, including campfires, barbecue grills using charcoal or wood, or any other use of open fires.   No smoking is allowed, except within a vehicle. Please use your ashtray.   Propane cook stoves, heating devices and lanterns are allowed for use in designated camping areas only.  The restrictions will remain in effect until further notice.                                   Posted on 26th May 2007      Under:  Arizona News ,   General  |    1 Comment »                 Online Applications Suspended                                  This system seems to have been having  a lot of difficulties. Hopefully AZGF will find a competent vendor and put this to bed, once and for all.   Online application process no longer available for fall hunts; deadline extended to June 26   The Arizona Game and Fish Department has indefinitely suspended the online application process for big game hunts, including this falls hunts for deer, bighorn sheep, turkey, javelina and buffalo, after the department determined it could not resolve concerns that its online service provider could adequately perform under its contract.   Hunters applying after May 21 must submit a paper application form by mail; forms can also be dropped off at department offices. Hunters who already applied using the online process do not need to resubmit a paper application. Their online applications will be valid for the fall big game draw.   The deadline to apply for this years fall hunts has been extended from June 12 to June 26. All applications must be received by the department by 7 p.m. (MST) on June 26; postmarks dont count.   Applicants submitting paper forms must remember to include their tag and application fees, and license fee, if they havent already purchased a hunting license. Those fees can be submitted by personal check, cashiers check or money order.   The correction period for those applying with paper forms has been extended from May 30 to June 6. If a submitted paper application contains an error and is received by June 6, the department will make three attempts within a 24-hour period to notify the applicant by telephone, if a telephone number is provided on the application.   Printed application forms and 2007-08 Hunting and Trapping Regulations are available at all license dealers and department offices. They can also be downloaded from the departments Web site at azgfd.gov/draw.   Department officials suspended the online application process on May 21 after canceling the contract with its online service vendor. At issue was the vendors inability to meet a performance bond requirement, and this undermined the departments confidence in the vendor.   We apologize for the inconvenience this may cause some of our customers, says Harry Seck, assistant director for special services for the Arizona Game and Fish Department. The department, however, could not accept what the vendor offered to resolve this issue.   Despite the changes in the draw application process, there will be no effect on the draw itself or how it is conducted. Draw results will be available online at azgfd.gov/draw no later than Aug. 10, and hunt permit-tags for successful applicants will be mailed out no later than Aug. 10.   More information on the fall big game draw can be found on the Arizona Game and Fish Departments Web site at azgfd.gov/draw.

For all other outdoor recreationists in the deserts or the high country, this is the dry time so be extra careful out there.   This is still a great time to go fishing.   The dark of the moon on May 16 means this is a superb time to fish at night using submersible or floating lights for crappie, largemouth bass and striped bass. In fact, this is the leading edge of the great nighttime fishing season for a lot of species. The crappie lights attract plankton, plankton attracts shad, and shad attracts predatory fish.   One of the nighttime hot spots right now is Lake Pleasant, where anglers have been racking up lots of striped bass, white bass and largemouth bass using frozen anchovies and/or live minnows as bait. Yes, it is okay to chum using small pieces of anchovies to attract and/or hold stripers.   The three nighttime crappie hot spots right now are: Roosevelt, Alamo and Bartlett.   Along the Colorado River lakes, such as Mead, Mohave and Havasu, fishing at night using lights is a great way to avoid a majority of the recreational boating traffic and for catching lots of striped bass using frozen anchovies.   Warm spring nights are also perfect for shore anglers to catch catfish and carp. Just look for any large flat, or any major point on a lake. Channel catfish abound in the states warmwater lakes and for the most part, arent fished very heavily. The low level of fishing pressure typically results in catfish anglers having pretty good catch rates for these bottom dwellers.   For catfish, think underwater aroma. Catfish are attracted by scent. Try hot dogs, corn, dough bait, stink bait, or chicken liver fished with a small split shot or slip sinker. Remember, it is legal to have two baits per line, and with a two-pole stamp, you can use two poles per person. It is also okay (legal) to chum. Simply take little pieces of the bait you are using and just throw a handful into the water where you are fishing.   Those looking to catch some bottom-dwelling behemoths might try fishing for flathead catfish at Roosevelt, Bartlett, Pleasant or along the Colorado River near Yuma. Those huge flatheads can sometimes tip the scales at 45 or more pounds. The state record flathead is 71 pounds.   For the high country, its time to go for the gold: last week we had the first stockings of golden-colored Apache trout in the East and West Forks of Black River, and in the Little Colorado River in Greer. Silver Creek near Show Low is also stocked with these feisty native trout.   Apache trout dont always go for Power Bait, but typically love night crawlers and meal worms. A superb way to introduce a child to fishing is by helping the beginning angler to catch a native Apache trout. Besides being unique to Arizona, Apache trout are our State Fish. Go catch a golden memory with your child.   Good luck. Maybe Ill see you out there.     And more:   Central Arizona  URBAN LAKES   Fishing for catfish is very good at most Urban Fishing Program waters. Best baits for the 16-19 inch catfish are worms, stink baits and shrimp. Because of problem algae blooms, Alvord and Desert West Lakes were not stocked with catfish on April 19-20.   TEMPE TOWN LAKE  Bass fishing is red hot. Anglers are reporting lots of fish between 1 and 4 pounds.  Plastics and crankbaits worked around the ledges and docks is working especially early morning and right before dark. Channel catfish averaging 1 to 2 pounds will bite stink baits, hot dogs and shrimp. Carp fishing is excellent using corn and dough bait. Remember no gas motors are allowed (trolling motors are) and you must have a boating permit, which can be obtained, at the Town Lake operations center.     LAKE PLEASANT - Water level is at 1,691 feet (88-percent full). Bass fishing is great during the day and at night! Anglers at night are doing great catching striped bass, white bass and largemouth bass (sometimes crappies as well) using frozen anchovies cut into pieces and/or live minnows as bait.   Bruce Ivor, his 9-year-old son, and a buddy hit Pleasant and caught 50-plus stripers, adding that it was kind of slow at times and his son caught six stripers real quick then decided the bottom of the boat with a throw cushion looked good so he zonked out and slept until they left. We moved around and got stripers everywhere we fished but were stuck in the 1- to 2-plus-pound range.   Two other anglers reported catching 60-plus stripers fishing near the dam at night.   By the way, there was a report a few weeks ago of anglers catching crappies averaging a pound and a half in the back of Humbug and Coles at night under lights on minnows 15-18 feet down.   Look for topwater action in coves at first and last light. Typically, striped bass and white bass will start chasing shad right before and after sunrise (using anything white, such as curly tails), then the action will gradually shift to largemouth bass.   During the daytime. The most productive way to catch largemouth bass is using drop shots in 10-20 feet of water in the mouths of coves and off points.   The annual bald eagle closure is in effect on the Agua Fria. For those interested no Quagga mussels were found in the lake during recent SCUBA surveys near and around the marina, marina tires and the towers.    ROOSEVELT LAKE - The lake is 63-percent full at elevation 2,119 feet. The Salt River was flowing at 242 cfs Monday morning and Tonto Creek was at 29 cfs. With a dark of the moon on May 16, nighttime fishing should be great this week. Largemouth bass fishing and crappie fishing is fantastic. Water temperatures are in the low 70ss. Many fish are being caught on crankbaits as well as drop shots. Crappie fishing is very good at night under lights. Bluegills are becoming active in the shallows and can be caught under a bobber with night crawlers.  Catfishing is also picking up, use shrimp or hot dogs in the mouths of coves. Catfish will bite during the day at this time of year. We have also had reports of nice smallmouth being caught off points in 15 feet of water using night crawlers. Remember the slot is in place for smallmouth as well.  Flathead catfish will take water dogs, small carp, and bluegill and should be stacking up in the Salt end of the lake. Try fishing in 20-40 feet of water and gear up! Common carp are biting corn and dough baits along any shoreline and in coves right now (at night or during the day).    Note: anglers are reminded of the slot bass size limit that remains in effect at Roosevelt. Bass between 13 to 16 inches must be released immediately. Also those bass below 13 inches and above 16 inches that are kept can only be gutted with the head and tail attached so the legal length can be determined. All other fish such as crappie, catfish and bluegill harvested from the lake must have a piece of skin attached to the fillets so species can be determined.  ADEQ discovered and captured three gizzard shad in the lake in January, which was the first positive confirmation of this species in the lake.   APACHE - Lake is 90-percent full. We have received recent reports that bluegill, crappie and largemouth bass are being caught on and around the newly placed habitat areas (some are marked with buoys). Others are also doing well around Dinosaur Island for yellow bass using KastMasters in 40 feet of water. Catfish and carp fishing should be picking up. In a recent survey yellow bass were abundant and world-class size.  Carp and catfish are also doing well.  Walleye in the 12-15 inch range are also plentiful. We electro-shocked last week to get a feel for the bass population. During the survey, we were pleasantly surprised to find lots of young-of the-year largemouth as well as a good mix of one- and two-year-old bass.  Bottom line is the largemouth population is starting to recover nicely. Smallmouth bass were not found during the survey. There is a certified scale at the marina boathouse.    CANYON - Lake is 95-percent full at 1,659 feet. No reports lately. Carp and catfish fishing should be picking up.     SAGUARO - Lake level is 1,522 feet (92-percent full). No reports lately. Bass fishing has been very slow. There is a certified scale at the marina to get an official weight and still release your catch. Two witnesses are needed for the weight to be official.     BARTLETT  Lake level is at 1,750 feet (39 -percent full) With a new moon May 16, night fishing should be great this week for crappie and bass using submersible lights. Good news here. All warmwater sport-fish species are doing well. During a recent survey, crappies representing five different year classes were found.    Big crappies are almost 3 pounds!  Crappies are being caught in about 15-20 feet on minnows over structure. Many are also being caught at night near the Yellow Cliffs. Some anglers are picking up crappies in the 2-pound range upriver using and near submerged fish city. Kalin 1/16-ounce black/blue/chartreuse jigs, but overall, crappie fishing is good on the east side coves. An angler reported a 70-fish day last week.   Bass fishing is fantastic. We had some of the highest catch rates many of us biologists have ever seen electro-fishing recently. We caught and netted over 60 largemouth bass in 250 meters of shoreline at one site.  Bass averaged 1- 2/12 pounds. We found largemouth bass of this size all over the lake.   Crawdad imitations and worming rigs (drop shots and Texas-rigs) are producing. Catfishing is picking up. We found quite a few flathead catfish in the 10- to 20-pound range up lake where the Verde River comes in.  They will take live sunfish, carp or water dogs.  Remember the live bait most come from the lake itself (excluding minnows, water dogs or worms) not transported from another body of water!   Dont forget that the lake level is low, the launch ramp is out of the water, but people are having little difficulty launching from the dirt near the main launch ramp.     HORSESHOE - Lake is 9 percent. Road is now open. No reports on fishing.  Catfish Point below the dam should be good for flatheads as well as channel catfish at this time.  If you can cross the Verde at the low water crossing and get above Horseshoe Lake, a mixture of channel cats, smallmouth and largemouth bass should be found in the river itself.  This is a great area to fish if accessible.  I have had no reports from the area yet this spring.   VERDE RIVER The stretch of river below the dam to the Needle Rock area holds some nice bass and catfish. Use inline spinners and Power Bait. Remember that no baitfish can be transported into this part of the river (above Horseshoe). For further information concerning regulations, call the Arizona Game and Fish Department at (480) 324-3544. This morning flow was 290 cfs at Tangle Creek station above Horseshoe Lake.     LOWER SALT RIVER (below Saguaro Lake)  The Lower Salt River is flowing at 875 cfs Monday morning.  The Verde is flowing at 100 cfs coming in at Phon D Sutton.  Trout were stocked last week at Water Users and Blue Point Bridge.  Power Bait, inline spinners and corn will work. For fly fishermen courtesy of Curtis Gill: I would try dead drifting a beadhead prince, hairs ear or, pheasant tail nymph, especially early in the morning.  Beadhead prince and hairs ear nymphs are probably my two favorite for rainbows (typically size 12).  Also, I often like to drop the nymph off of a wooly bugger (size 6 to 8 streamer hook).  This is often a really good combo for rainbows.  I usually take about 18 to 24 inches of tippet and tie it to the shank of the wooly bugger hook and then tie the nymph to the end of that.  I often catch about as many fish on the wooly bugger as I do the nymph.  Place your strike indicator about 1.5x the depth of the water that you are fishing.  This will ensure that the flies are bouncing off of the bottom. Throw the flies directly upstream into pools or deep runs and let them drift downstream (without any drag if possible).  At the end of the drift flip the setup back upstream.  However, let the flies swing at the end of the drift before throwing them back upstream, as fish often will strike as the flies begin swing.  If you see fish rising I would have some parachute Adams in size 12 to 18 or even smaller.  Even if a the fly doesn’t match what they are rising for fish will often take an Adams.  I would also carry some elk hair caddis in a variety of sizes and colors as caddis flies make of the a large part of the macro-invertebrate community.  Another dry fly that also seems to work really well for rainbows is a royal wulff.  I often catch fish on this fly even when they aren’t rising.  Humpies in yellow or red are another good stimulator pattern that works well.  In shallower runs and riffles you can tie a small nymph to your dry fly (again off of the shank of the hook).  The dry fly will double as your strike indicator. Largemouth bass fishing can be good using crankbaits in back eddies and near brush.   CREEKS - Canyon Creek has been stocked recently and is a good bet for rainbows and browns.  Christopher, Tonto, Haigler, East Verde and Workman creeks also have been recently stocked with rainbow trout.  Use in-line spinners such as Rooster Tails, Panther Martins or live bait such as hoppers, meal worms, crawlers or baits like Power Bait or salmon eggs.   Colorado River Northwest  LAKE POWELL  By Wayne Gustaveson. Lake elevation: 3,602. Water temp: 60-70 F. Warm days this week will finally put cold weather in the rear view mirror. Weekend storms have increased river flows, jacked up runoff and that will continue until the snow is gone with warmer days ahead. The lake is now rising 2-6 inches a day. It should come up four more feet in the next few weeks.  Bass have been struggling with cold fronts. Bass spawning has been sporadic but there will be another spawning surge over the next 10 days where multiple spawning smallmouth bass will bring off one more nest of black fry. Rising lake levels will move the shoreline away from the existing nests. Sight-fishing for spawning fish is not as good in May but catching spawning fish will be great. Just fish deeper and further away from shore where the nests were made in April at lower lake levels. This week nests will be at least 2-feet deeper than when first constructed.   Warming water temperatures activate fish. Walleye have finished spawning (walleye) and get very hungry when their cold-blooded body finally warms up. They respond by eating early and often. The next three weeks will be the best time to catch hungry walleye. Fish in low light periods - early and late. Take advantage of boat wakes and windy afternoons to find murky water where walleye shade up to feed. Mud lines along rocky points, muddy coves, and mud covered brush are prime walleye spots during May.   Stripers are literally everywhere. They are in the backs of canyons, in mid channel and in deep water. Warming will make them seem even more abundant as the younger plankton-eaters will be caught more often. Troll, cast, or graph and bait fish - your preference. Keep all stripers. The smaller fish are better table fare and the bigger fish are fun to catch. Both sizes are equally caught on bait or lures. Stripers in the back of the canyons and coves are not boiling but they are “looking up” so they will hit a topwater lure early and late. It is possible to create your own boil from dawn to 8 a.m.    Known striper schools in the southern lake are found at the dam, buoy 1, Antelope Canyon (mouth and mid canyon), Navajo Canyon (double islands and back of canyon), Padre Bay canyons (back of canyons), main channel at the mouth of Friendship Cove, Rock Creek (directly across channel [east] from the floating restroom, and Oak Canyon.    At Bullfrog/Halls, stripers are being caught at Moki Wall, mouth of Moki, mouth of Hansen Creek (north side - mouth), buoy 90, mouth and inside Lake Canyon and in Bullfrog Marina at night under the lights.    Up lake the runoff is increasing and visibility is dropping. Stripers were caught handily trolling from buoy 118-119. All of the side canyons produce good fishing for all species and have clearer water than the main channel.    If you haven’t guessed it yet, fishing is darn good right now.    LEES FERRY  Report by Lees Ferry Anglers, by Tedd Welling. Fly fishing: With the low water, fishing was a lot more productive. Fish are hanging in close so, you dont have to cast half way across the river. Glass bead wd-40s small midges of all sorts were working today. Dries with a dropper also did the trick. The weather is sunny for the next week or so Im betting the fishing will remain good here for the duration.   Walk In: For the past couple of months, this section has been fishing very consistently. The two guys I talked to today who were down there did really well. Again, as the sun came over the cliffs and hit the water, midges came off in great numbers. This is the time of day to be there. They used all kinds of midges and the ever popular bead-head zebra. In mid-afternoon the fishing slowed down until just before dark.   Fishing Synopsis and Forecast by Terry Gunn: Midge fishing at Lees Ferry continues to be the ticket for most areas of the river. The midge hatches are getting heavier each day and the fish are starting to move into the riffles and shallow water to feed on the sub surface emergers. If you are not using 7X, you are not going to catch fish.   The water flows that began March 1 appear to be the best flows of the spring&the water is starting low and s-l-o-w-l-y rising throughout the morning, with the peak arriving at or near noon.  The trout are still spawning and we are seeing the best spawn that the river has experienced in years&fish are spawning throughout the river. Most spawning is occurring in deep water, which bodes well for fry survival and future recruitment of juvenile trout. The spawn began in December and has been building in strength the past few weeks. I have been expecting the spawn to peak but it just keeps on going.   Word has it that the walk-in is fishing very well. There are times in the spring that this area actually fishes better than upriver. Look for this area to continue fishing well until the summer high water arrives.    A couple weeks back, I saw a 27 to 30-in rainbow in the river. I got a good look at this fish and it was the largest trout that I have see at the Ferry in many years. Hopefully Ill be able to post a picture of this fish in the hands of a smiling angler in the near future.   Spin Fishing: Egg patterns are still producing down deep when drifting. Make sure that you have the proper weight on so that the flies are bouncing the bottom and not dragging bottom. Consider a scud dropped below the glo bug about a foot and a half. KastMasters and Rapalas are also productive while back trolling.   LAKE MEAD - Important notice: With the recent discovery of invasive quagga mussels in Mead, Mohave and Havasu, proper cleaning of all watercraft is critical to help prevent the spread of these invaders.  Please drain and dry your livewell and bilge on land. Drain all the water you can from your engine. Also, inspect your vessel and trailer, removing any visible mussels, but also feel for any rough or gritty spots on the hull. These may be young mussels that can be hard to see.   For more information, go to the Arizona Game and Fish Department’s web pages at azgfd.gov or visit http://100thmeridian.org/.   Fishing has been fair to good. This is a good time to find largemouth bass and bluegill in the backs of coves, especially at first light. The striper bite is getting good also. Try slow-trolling a small crankbait during the day. While the night fishing has been good under crappie lights, look for it to really heat with the new moon this week.  The ramp is open at South Cove, but it is a gravel ramp. The lake elevation is now 1,119, and continues to drop at nearly one foot per week.      LAKE MOHAVE - Important notice: With the recent discovery of invasive quagga mussels in Mead, Mohave and Havasu, proper cleaning of all watercraft is critical to help prevent the spread of these invaders.  Please drain and dry your livewell and bilge on land. Drain all the water you can from your engine. Also, inspect your vessel and trailer, removing any visible mussels, but also feel for any rough or gritty spots on the hull. These may be young mussels that can be hard to see.   For more information, go to the Arizona Game and Fish Department’s web pages at azgfd.gov or visit http://100thmeridian.org/.   Fishing for largemouth has picked up; some are in shallow. The striper bite has been slow.  Anchovies are the most popular bait for stripers, but if you want to try something different, use shrimp or squid. Davis Dam has plenty of shoreline for numerous anglers to enjoy the fishing. Cabinsite and Telephone Cove also provide plenty of shoreline fishing access.  Arizona Game and Fish Biologists surveyed Lake Mohave last week and observed the largemouth bass to average about 2.5 pounds.  Channel catfish and striped bass were also plentiful.  Also, there is a wheelchair accessible fishing pier just south of the main launch ramp at Katherine’s Landing.     WILLOW BEACH Important notice: With the recent discovery of invasive quagga mussels in Mead, Mohave and Havasu, proper cleaning of all watercraft is critical to help prevent the spread of these invaders. Please drain and dry your livewell and bilge on land. Drain all the water you can from your engine.

For more information, go to the Arizona Game and Fish Department’s web pages at azgfd.gov or visit http://100thmeridian.org/.   Trout are stocked every Friday. The fishing for trout has good from shore immediately following the stocking. The striper bite has picked up and some big fish are being caught.     TOPOCK MARSH - Important notice: With the recent discovery of invasive quagga mussels in Mead, Mohave and Havasu, proper cleaning of all watercraft is critical to help prevent the spread of these invaders.  Please drain and dry your livewell and bilge on land. Drain all the water you can from your engine.

For more information, go to the Arizona Game and Fish Department’s web pages at azgfd.gov or visit http://100thmeridian.org/.   Catfish and bass continue to bite well.  Game and fish biologist sampled lots of largemouth bass the middle of January throughout the marsh. The bass numbers were great and the crappie and catfish populations looked really good as well. You can access the marsh by boat at North Dike, Catfish Paradise, and Five-Mile Landing. All three also provide plenty of area for shoreline fishing too. For more information on the marsh, contact the Havasu National Wildlife Refuge at (760) 326-3853 or go to http://www.fws.gov/southwest/refuges/arizona/havasu/index.html.

The lake was stocked with trout in the early winter and fishermen were reporting good results with Power Bait, Mepp's spinners and corn or cheese. For information call (520) 455-5847.        In addition to a paved lakeside area, there is a fishing pier and a paved boat ramp.  The lakeshore country store, which is open Friday, Saturday and Sunday in the winter and week-long in the summer, offers supplies, boat rentals and fishing licenses. There is also a campground. A 5-mile hiking trail circles the lake.        Roper Lake State Park          At the foot of Mount Graham, on a tributary of the Gila river,  this 400-acre state recreation park offers fishing, camping and swimming. A level fishing pad has been provided for wheel-chair fishing access. Crappie is a favorite catch at nearby Dankworth Ponds. Both Roper Lake and Dankworth Ponds were also stocked with trout.        The park has seventy-one camping sites, restrooms, showers, and waste disposal facilities. Camping stays are limited to fifteen days. Non-fishermen can enjoy hiking, swimming and picnicking. Only electric motors are allowed on the lake and the ponds. Exit the interstate (I-10) at exit 355 or 352, between Bowie and Willcox. Go north about 30 miles on highway 191. The park is four miles south of Safford.

clueweb09-enwp01-69-06163	"                     The Poconos          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia        (Redirected from  Pocono Plateau )            Jump to:  navigation ,  search                 Pennsylvania's Pocono region counties       The  Pocono Mountains  region is a mountainous region of about 2,400 square miles (6,200 km) located in northeastern  Pennsylvania .   The Pocono Mountains is a popular recreational destination for local and regional visitors. The region has a population of about 300,000, which is growing at a rapid pace, largely attributable to vacationers from the New York City region who are turning vacation homes into permanent residences. [ citation needed ]  The region lacks a major population center, although there are small municipalities which are scattered throughout the area. The Poconos now serves as a commuter community for the  Northern New Jersey  metropolitan areas, even though the commute often takes as much as 2 hours each way due to distance and traffic. Because the region lacks a population center, it has been difficult to establish transit infrastructure to feed (future) commuter rail and bus lines. Stroudsburg is usually known as the heart of the poconos and is growing very rapidly in population and in retail with the new Shoppes at Stroud, bartonsville plaza which is in stroud township and plans have been made to build the shoppes at crossroads and the bartonsville square which are also part of stroud and hamilton townships they are both currently waiting approval by the townships. An Olive Garden restaurant is planned to open March 29,2009 and several other projects are planned to open next Fall/Winter.

The Pocono Mountains is a vaguely defined area encompassing  Carbon ,  Monroe ,  Pike , and  Southern Wayne  Counties of Pennsylvania  [ 1 ] , as well as portions of neighboring counties such as  Susquehanna ,  Luzerne , and  Lackawanna . The region of  Northampton County  from the Slate Belt northwards is also sometimes included [ 2 ] . In total, the Poconos encompasses over 2,500 square miles. The Poconos are mountainous, geologically a southwestern extension of the  Catskills . The Poconos' highest summit, Elk Hills North Knob, reaches 2,693 feet (821 m), while its lowest elevation is 350 feet (107 m) in Pike County.   The  Delaware River  flows through the Pocono Mountains and gives the region its name, from a Native American term roughly translating to ""stream between two mountains."" The  Lehigh  and  Lackawaxen  Rivers also flow through the region, totaling about 170 miles (270 km) of waterways. The Pocono Mountains are also home to some 150 lakes and many  waterfalls , such as those in the  Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area  of  Monroe County  and  Ricketts Glen State Park  in northwestern  Luzerne County .     [ edit ]   Recreation   The popularity of the Pocono Mountains as a summer retreat began at the dawn of the 20th century when Philadelphia Quakers started the resorts of  Buck Hill Falls  and  Pocono Manor , and later in the 1920s,  Skytop .          Midday view of Lake Harmony              Evening view of Lake Harmony               Camelback Ski Area       The Poconos is a well-known outdoor recreation destination for visitors around the northeast, especially from  New York City  and  Philadelphia . Primary attractions are centered around the region's diverse natural offerings. The Poconos encompasses the  Delaware State Forest   [ 3 ] , including six designated natural areas  [ 4 ] , seven state parks  [ 5 ] , seventeen state game lands  [ 6 ] , and one national park: The  Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area . There are extensive opportunities for water sports, with many of the lakes and rivers stocked for fishing. Hunters pursue  white-tailed deer ,  wild turkeys ,  ruffed grouse , and other wildlife. More  American black bear  are killed here than anywhere else in the state, and likely the contiguous 48 states. This is largely due to acidic pine barren creek valleys teeming with  trout  and berries. Toward the southern margin of the Poconos, the  Blue Mountain  ridge is the site of the  Appalachian Trail  and a major  flyway  for the autumn  raptor   migration , including the nationally renowned  Hawk Mountain  sanctuary.   The Poconos is also home to Summer Camps, such as Camp Pocono Ridge [ 7 ]  and  Goose Pond Scout Reservation  near Lake Ariel.   The Poconos is and has been Pennsylvania's most popular tourist destination. The region contains over 80% of the state's resorts. These resorts earn 1.5 billion dollars in gross revenues and employ 18,000 workers. The region is also a popular winter destination. [ 8 ]  State parks offer snowmobile trails, snowshoeing, and eagle watching. [ 9 ]   Popular summer activities include whitewater rafting and canoeing down the Delaware and Lehigh Rivers, camping and hiking, water parks, and smaller attractions such as Claws N Paws Wild Animal Park  [ 10 ] , Kittatinny Rafting & Paintball  [ 11 ] , Houdini Museum  [ 12 ]  and others. Another popular recreation activity growing around the Poconos is  disc golf . Currently there are several  disc golf  courses located around the Poconos. Other outdoor activities, particularly  golf , are also popular options.   Another attraction is  Pocono Raceway , a major automobile racetrack, which is home to two  NASCAR Sprint Cup Series  races, the  Pocono 500  in June, and the  Pennsylvania 500  in August. It also serves as a racing school and motorcycle track.   The Poconos is a major resort destination with new additions such as Great Wolf Lodge for families, a resurrection of Mount Airy as a gaming (slots) and golf resort, the famous Ceasars Pocono Resorts with heart-shaped and champagne whirlpool baths for two (couples only) and a retreat known as  Woodloch Pines  that has added a spa facility.     [ edit ]   Gaming   A highly controversial proposal to license a gambling casino with slot machines in Monroe County was approved in 2007 and the casino at  Mount Airy Lodge  is now open to the public. [ 13 ]  Adding to the controversy is the reported connection between the casino's owner and organized crime which has placed Mount Airy under the supervision of a gaming commission appointee.   Mohegan Sun at Pocono Downs in the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre area is another site where slots and OTB are available, and a proposed facility in the Allentown area is scheduled to open in the near future.     [ edit ]   Skiing in the Poconos   Numerous ski resorts in and around the Poconos offer some of the closest and most accessible skiing to the major populated areas of Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington DC areas.     Camelback Ski Area  - the most ski runs in the Poconos   Blue Mountain Ski Area   [ 14 ]  - the largest vertical drop in the Poconos (1,082 feet) and closest to Philadelphia   Elk Mountain Ski Area  - one of the larger areas with 30 trails, the highest ski peak at 2,600+ feet and a 1,000-foot vertical drop   Sno Mountain Ski Area  - just outside of Scranton, features the steepest terrain in the Poconos and a 1,000-foot vertical drop   Shawnee Mountain Ski Area   [ 15 ]  - closest to New York City, just across the Delaware from New Jersey, suited for families & beginners   Jack Frost Mountain and Big Boulder  [ 16 ]  - two sister ski areas, family oriented skiing   Ski Big Bear  [ 17 ]   Tanglewood - closed for the 2007/2008 season due to economic reasons.   Alpine Mountain  [ 18 ]   Eagle Rock Resort - the westernmost of the Pocono ski areas     Ski areas in the Poconos are not particularly large and do not have large vertical drops (Sno Mountain and Elk Mountain, with 1000' vertical drops are the largest), so runs tend to be on the shorter side. However, the Poconos do offer conveniently located skiing, and many areas also offer night skiing. Many Pocono ski resorts cater to both winter and transform themselves into water parks for summer visitors.   Downhill skiing is also offered at resort-hotel properties (such as Skytop Lodge and Fernwood) where guests can use the facilities as part of their stay.     [ edit ]   Rail service          The  Delaware-Lackawanna Railroad  mainline runs over the  Pocono Mountains .       Rail service is provided by the  Pennsylvania Northeast Regional Rail Authority . One of its primary objectives is to establish rail passenger service with  New Jersey Transit  between  Scranton, Pennsylvania  and  Hoboken, New Jersey  with connecting service at  Secaucus Junction  for  Manhattan, New York . Designated operator of the line is  NJ Transit . There is currently no passenger rail service from the Poconos to Hoboken, New Jersey.   On January 23, 2007, NJ Transit was given an initial environmental 'OK' to re-establish a Hoboken-to-Scranton connection, a restoration of the  Lackawanna Cut-Off .   Rebuilding rails on the Lackawanna Cut-Off, and subsequent resumption of passenger service is slated to be completed in 2011 or 2012. [ 19 ]     [ edit ]   Newspapers   A few newspapers covering local events and happenings include the daily paper,  The  Pocono Record , a weekly paper, a shopper and  Blue Mountain Moments , which is published monthly. To the north, additional regional publications covering  Pike  and  Wayne  Counties include the  News Eagle ,  Pike County Dispatch ,  Milford Magazine ,  Pike County Courier , and  Wayne Independent .

South Africa  /  Garden Route  |  ADD TO ENQUIRY BASKET Garden Route The Garden Route journey begins in Mossel Bay - first discovered by the Portuguese navigator, Bartholomeu Dias, in 1488. Attractions here include the Bartholomeu Museum and Old Post Office Tree. Bungee jumping and bridge swinging is offered at nearby Gouritz River mouth and daily boat trips to Seal Island and shark-cage diving draws many visitors. Contrasting sharply with the lush coast,  Oudtshoorn  is reached by travelling inland over the Robinson Pass. This area is the focal point of the ostrich industry and guided tours of show farms explain all the facets of the ostrich business culminating in an 'ostrich derby'.  The Cango Caves were formed more than 65 million years ago and are ranked among the most remarkable of Africa's natural wonders. Guided daily tours yield a marvellous fantasia of weirdly sculpted, multi-coloured stalagmites and stalactites. Nearby attraction, the Cango Wildlife Ranch, houses one of the world's top cheetah-breeding centres. George , the largest of the Garden Route towns, is reached by returning to the coast via the scenic Outeniqua Pass. The Outeniqua Choo Tjoe is a narrow-gauge steam train traversing the spectacular Wilderness lakes area between  George  and Knysna.  George  is also close to the delightful little village of Victoria Bay, well-known and popular as a surf destination. Celebrated for its fresh oysters and fine hardwood furniture is the historical town of  Knysna  located on the banks of the estuary and often referred to as the 'Jewel of the Garden Route'.   A little further east lies  Plettenberg Bay , a beach-lover's paradise where long stretches of soft sand give way to azure seas. Almost 40 species of whales and dolphins have been recorded here and are to be seen on various boat excursions.    For the brave at heart there is a treetop canopy tour through the Tsitsikamma forest or bungee jumping off the 216 metre high Bloukrans River Bridge - the highest jump in the world!  Completing the Garden Route to the northeast is the friendly city of  Port Elizabeth  - gateway to the Malaria-free game reserves of the Eastern Cape and a  Malaria-free family vacation . Leisure activities along the Garden Route include golf, bowls, horse riding, angling, sailing, blackwater tubing, abseiling, mountain biking, scuba-diving and surfing, as well as hiking and bird-watching in the nearby Robberg, Keurbooms River and Tsitsikamma nature reserves. Visitors to the area may also use the opportunity to walk and interact with elephants at the elephant sanctuary at The Crags or to visit the primate sanctuary of Monkeyland.

If you need a  self-adhesive   carpet protection , be sure to check out their site at the links below:     Carpet Protector        Carpet Protection               A Little History and Current   Information on The Quartzsite Shows           The Quartzsite RV Show opened     the gates on January 28th, 1984 at the corner of Hwy 95 (now Central) and Business 10 (now     Main Street) in Quartzsite, Arizona. With just 60 exhibitors and a small tent, the     ""new show in town"" was still very popular since the majority of the people in     Quartzsite we're RVers. In 1987 the show, now re-named  The Quartzsite     Sports, Vacation & RV Show , moved down the street to the Quartzsite Trailer Park     which was situated directly across from the major attraction in town at that time, the     Quartzsite Pow Wow. For the next several years The Quartzsite Sports, Vacation & RV     Show enjoyed a tremendous run and huge crowds, with the largest crowds of all showing up     during the Quartzsite Pow Wow. This new home for The Quartsite Sports, Vacation & RV     Show lasted 10 years and the RV Show grew to a point where the current 3.5 acre show site     could barely hold the number of exhibitors that were now vying for exhibit space at this     popular annual event. In 1997 the ""BIG TENT"", as the show had become known,     moved across the freeway to it's present home, just 1/2 mile South of I-10 on Hwy 95. (     now 700 S. Central) The new 20 acre facility, a former dry campground, was just what the     doctor ordered for the expanding show. At that time in Quartzite, parking was almost     impossible to find, legally. With the new Quartzsite Sports, Vacation & RV Show Show     Grounds, the show was able to offer over 15 acres of public parking and the promoters,     Kenny King and Mal Mallory, made the decision to offer their parking FREE to the public,     while many other of the shows in town were already starting to charge to park. It was     obviously a wise decision as in 1997, their first year at the new site, a major change in     traffic patterns occurred. During the major show days at Quartzsite that year, the     infamous Quartzsite traffic jam that once clogged Main Street from the freeway offramp on     the East end of town, all the way to Four Corners, immediately shifted to the ""South     Side"" of town. Luckily, the new Quartzite Shows Show Grounds had front and rear     access and while the traffic was still terrible, the ability to flow the traffic through     the Quartzsite Shows Show Grounds made it somewhat manageable. The new and permanent home     of the Quartzsite Sports, Vacation & RV Show was a HUGE success!       In 1998 the promoters decided     to add a second show to their calendar and the First Annual  Quartzsite     Hobby, Craft & Gem Show  was born. While the new Craft Show shared the same,     beautiful show facility, it did not attain the instant success that the RV Show had     enjoyed back in 1984. In addition, the new show barely used 50% of the, then, 30,000 sq.     ft., fully carpeted structure. During the inaugural Quartzsite Hobby, Craft & Gem Show     someone made the comment that maybe the promoters should consider bringing in a few hot     rods and classic cars to fill up the unused portion of the huge structure and to attract     more people to the Craft Show. The promoters took the suggestion into consideration,     however they did not make a decision to go forward with the car show until the latter part     of October, 1998. Hoping to attract 50 cars in their first year and with less than 90 days     to get the job done, the promoters and a few volunteers descended on any and every car     show in the Southwest, passing out literature and talking to car owners. They had also     recently uploaded their new web site on the Internet and spent numerous hours e-mailing     car clubs, car magazines and anyone else that was even remotely connected to hot rods,     classic cars or car shows. By opening day they had received over 150 registrations and     more that 120 cars actually attended the inaugural show. Not only did the new  Quartzsite Rock & Roll Classic Car Show  exceed all     expectations, the crowd that showed up each day that weekend exceeded the entire     attendance for the Quartzsite Hobby, Craft & Gem Show held the year prior, and that     was a 9 day event! These beautiful and unique custom cars, hot rods, street rods, muscle     cars and classic cars, combined with the Arts & Crafts, Hobby items, jewelry and gem     displays, makes for a spectacular event and the future looks very bright for both shows.     The promoters are shooting for 250+ cars for their 2008 show and with the huge crowd that     was attracted, due to the popularity of the combined Hobby, Craft & Gem Show and     Classic Car Show, the promoters expect the exhibitor list for the Craft Show to grow     considerably as well. The Craft Show is now being referred to as ""RV SHOW II"" as     the attendees are primarily RVers. If you cannot make the huge RV Show you can see an     awful lots of RV and travel related exhibits plus 100's of hot rods and classics during     the Craft/Car show.       During the summer of 1998 the     promoters finally settled a long and contentious litigation surrounding their purchase of     the land. Once they were able to get free and clear title to their new Show Grounds, they     immediately began upgrading the facility for the 1999 shows. In return for supplying the     major portion of the water necessary to complete the re-paving project of Interstate 10     from the California border to Quartzsite, almost 18 acres of asphalt millings were laid     down on the Quartsite Shows Show Grounds. This was a  major  improvement and nearly     eliminated the number one exhibitor and customer complaint of the past;  "" It's     too dusty !""  Little did the promoters know at the time, but without the     addition of this asphalt, there was no way that they would have been able to attract so     many of the finest and most valuable hot rods, custom and classic cars in the Southwest to     their new Classic Car Show in Quartzsite. Once the car owners heard that their cars would     go inside the ""BIG TENT"" and that the Show Grounds and parking lot were under     asphalt, the ""too dusty"" reputation of Quartzsite was a moot subject. The     promoters also added a sewage treatment area to facilitate better service for the 200+     exhibitor RVs camping on the Quartzsite Shows Show Grounds during the three shows. New and     upgraded electrical service was added to the Northern and Southern borders of the     Quartzsite Shows Show Grounds as well. We're talking about a major electrical upgrade here     or as the head electrician from Trade Show Electric of Los Angeles, CA, who wires the show     stated;  ""They're probably capable of powering up most of Quartzsite in a     pinch!""  Permanent water service was also installed throughout the     Quartzsite Shows Show Grounds for the numerous food concessions and     ""live-aboard"" exhibitors at the three shows. What was, only six months earlier,     a barren piece of desert, is now a facility that is comparable to many fairgrounds across     the country.       Just prior to the 1999 shows, a     foot-traffic gate was opened between the Quartzsite Shows Show Grounds and the 23 acre     facility of  The Tyson Wells Sell-A-Rama,  the     premier Rock, Gem and flea market in Quartzsite. Just like back in the old days when the     RV Show was situated across from the Pow Wow, the Quartzsite Shows and Tyson Wells now     share in the huge amount of traffic that each show attracts by allowing a safer and     shorter route for the public to navigate between these two major venues.        With Tyson's new Craft Show,     Prospector's Panorama and the Car/Craft Show open all at the same time along with the     expansion of the Rice Ranch selling area across Hwy 95, it gives the RVers a reason to     extend their stay in the area. Many of the RV Show exhibitors have realized that the     people that attend the Craft/Car show are also RVers and many have elected to stay on for     the 5 day Hobby, Craft & Gem Show in 2009.        The 2008 shows were definitely     the biggest yet. Don't miss the Quartzsite Shows in 2009.       It's  ALL      Happening Under the BIG TOP!""

With just 60 exhibitors and a small tent, the     ""new show in town"" was still very popular since the majority of the people in     Quartzsite we're RVers. In 1987 the show, now re-named  The Quartzsite     Sports, Vacation & RV Show , moved down the street to the Quartzsite Trailer Park     which was situated directly across from the major attraction in town at that time, the     Quartzsite Pow Wow. For the next several years The Quartzsite Sports, Vacation & RV     Show enjoyed a tremendous run and huge crowds, with the largest crowds of all showing up     during the Quartzsite Pow Wow. This new home for The Quartsite Sports, Vacation & RV     Show lasted 10 years and the RV Show grew to a point where the current 3.5 acre show site     could barely hold the number of exhibitors that were now vying for exhibit space at this     popular annual event. In 1997 the ""BIG TENT"", as the show had become known,     moved across the freeway to it's present home, just 1/2 mile South of I-10 on Hwy 95. (     now 700 S. Central) The new 20 acre facility, a former dry campground, was just what the     doctor ordered for the expanding show. At that time in Quartzite, parking was almost     impossible to find, legally. With the new Quartzsite Sports, Vacation & RV Show Show     Grounds, the show was able to offer over 15 acres of public parking and the promoters,     Kenny King and Mal Mallory, made the decision to offer their parking FREE to the public,     while many other of the shows in town were already starting to charge to park. It was     obviously a wise decision as in 1997, their first year at the new site, a major change in     traffic patterns occurred. During the major show days at Quartzsite that year, the     infamous Quartzsite traffic jam that once clogged Main Street from the freeway offramp on     the East end of town, all the way to Four Corners, immediately shifted to the ""South     Side"" of town. Luckily, the new Quartzite Shows Show Grounds had front and rear     access and while the traffic was still terrible, the ability to flow the traffic through     the Quartzsite Shows Show Grounds made it somewhat manageable. The new and permanent home     of the Quartzsite Sports, Vacation & RV Show was a HUGE success!       In 1998 the promoters decided     to add a second show to their calendar and the First Annual  Quartzsite     Hobby, Craft & Gem Show  was born. While the new Craft Show shared the same,     beautiful show facility, it did not attain the instant success that the RV Show had     enjoyed back in 1984. In addition, the new show barely used 50% of the, then, 30,000 sq.     ft., fully carpeted structure. During the inaugural Quartzsite Hobby, Craft & Gem Show     someone made the comment that maybe the promoters should consider bringing in a few hot     rods and classic cars to fill up the unused portion of the huge structure and to attract     more people to the Craft Show. The promoters took the suggestion into consideration,     however they did not make a decision to go forward with the car show until the latter part     of October, 1998. Hoping to attract 50 cars in their first year and with less than 90 days     to get the job done, the promoters and a few volunteers descended on any and every car     show in the Southwest, passing out literature and talking to car owners. They had also     recently uploaded their new web site on the Internet and spent numerous hours e-mailing     car clubs, car magazines and anyone else that was even remotely connected to hot rods,     classic cars or car shows. By opening day they had received over 150 registrations and     more that 120 cars actually attended the inaugural show. Not only did the new  Quartzsite Rock & Roll Classic Car Show  exceed all     expectations, the crowd that showed up each day that weekend exceeded the entire     attendance for the Quartzsite Hobby, Craft & Gem Show held the year prior, and that     was a 9 day event! These beautiful and unique custom cars, hot rods, street rods, muscle     cars and classic cars, combined with the Arts & Crafts, Hobby items, jewelry and gem     displays, makes for a spectacular event and the future looks very bright for both shows.     The promoters are shooting for 250+ cars for their 2008 show and with the huge crowd that     was attracted, due to the popularity of the combined Hobby, Craft & Gem Show and     Classic Car Show, the promoters expect the exhibitor list for the Craft Show to grow     considerably as well. The Craft Show is now being referred to as ""RV SHOW II"" as     the attendees are primarily RVers. If you cannot make the huge RV Show you can see an     awful lots of RV and travel related exhibits plus 100's of hot rods and classics during     the Craft/Car show.       During the summer of 1998 the     promoters finally settled a long and contentious litigation surrounding their purchase of     the land. Once they were able to get free and clear title to their new Show Grounds, they     immediately began upgrading the facility for the 1999 shows. In return for supplying the     major portion of the water necessary to complete the re-paving project of Interstate 10     from the California border to Quartzsite, almost 18 acres of asphalt millings were laid     down on the Quartsite Shows Show Grounds. This was a  major  improvement and nearly     eliminated the number one exhibitor and customer complaint of the past;  "" It's     too dusty !""  Little did the promoters know at the time, but without the     addition of this asphalt, there was no way that they would have been able to attract so     many of the finest and most valuable hot rods, custom and classic cars in the Southwest to     their new Classic Car Show in Quartzsite. Once the car owners heard that their cars would     go inside the ""BIG TENT"" and that the Show Grounds and parking lot were under     asphalt, the ""too dusty"" reputation of Quartzsite was a moot subject. The     promoters also added a sewage treatment area to facilitate better service for the 200+     exhibitor RVs camping on the Quartzsite Shows Show Grounds during the three shows. New and     upgraded electrical service was added to the Northern and Southern borders of the     Quartzsite Shows Show Grounds as well. We're talking about a major electrical upgrade here     or as the head electrician from Trade Show Electric of Los Angeles, CA, who wires the show     stated;  ""They're probably capable of powering up most of Quartzsite in a     pinch!""  Permanent water service was also installed throughout the     Quartzsite Shows Show Grounds for the numerous food concessions and     ""live-aboard"" exhibitors at the three shows. What was, only six months earlier,     a barren piece of desert, is now a facility that is comparable to many fairgrounds across     the country.       Just prior to the 1999 shows, a     foot-traffic gate was opened between the Quartzsite Shows Show Grounds and the 23 acre     facility of  The Tyson Wells Sell-A-Rama,  the     premier Rock, Gem and flea market in Quartzsite. Just like back in the old days when the     RV Show was situated across from the Pow Wow, the Quartzsite Shows and Tyson Wells now     share in the huge amount of traffic that each show attracts by allowing a safer and     shorter route for the public to navigate between these two major venues.        With Tyson's new Craft Show,     Prospector's Panorama and the Car/Craft Show open all at the same time along with the     expansion of the Rice Ranch selling area across Hwy 95, it gives the RVers a reason to     extend their stay in the area. Many of the RV Show exhibitors have realized that the     people that attend the Craft/Car show are also RVers and many have elected to stay on for     the 5 day Hobby, Craft & Gem Show in 2009.

It was the world's first national park, set aside in 1872 to preserve the vast number of geysers,   hot springs , and other thermal areas, as well as to protect the incredible wildlife and rugged beauty of the area.  The park is principally contained within the  northwest  corner of  Wyoming , but also extends into the states of  Idaho  and  Montana .       The calcite terraces at Mammoth Hot Springs. These springs flourished with water until the late 1970s, but are currently dry.      The Grand Geyser, the largest predictable geyser in Yellowstone, can spout boiling water over 150 feet in the air.   [ edit ]   Understand   Yellowstone is the first and oldest national park in the world and covers 3,472 square miles (8,987 km), mostly in the northwest corner of Wyoming. The park is famous for its various geysers, hot springs, and other geothermal features and is home to grizzly bears and wolves, and free-ranging herds of bison and elk.    [ edit ]   History   Long before any recorded human history in Yellowstone, a massive volcanic eruption spewed an immense volume of ash that covered all of the western U.S., much of the Midwest, northern Mexico and some areas of the eastern Pacific Coast. The eruption dwarfed that of Mt. St. Helens in 1980 and left a huge caldera. Yellowstone typically erupts every 600,000 to 900,000 years with the last event occurring 640,000 years ago. Its eruptions are among the largest known to have ever occurred on Earth, producing drastic climate change in the aftermath. The park was named for the yellow rocks seen in the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone - a deep gash in the Yellowstone Plateau that was formed by floods during previous ice ages and by river erosion from the Yellowstone River.  In 1872, Yellowstone became the first  National Park  reserve declared anywhere in the world, by President Ulysses S. Grant. In 1978 it was designated a  World Heritage Site  by  UNESCO .    [ edit ]   Landscape   Geological characteristics form the foundation of an ecosystem. In Yellowstone, the interplay between volcanic, hydrothermal, and glacial processes and the distribution of flora and fauna are intricate and unique.  The topography of the land from southern Idaho northeast to Yellowstone results from millions of years of hotspot influence. Some scientists believe the Yellowstone Plateau itself is a result of uplift due to hotspot volcanism.    [ edit ]   Flora and fauna   The park is the core of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, one of the largest intact temperate zone ecosystems remaining on the planet.  Black bears, grizzly bears, deer, elk, bison, bighorn sheep and wolves can all be found within the park borders.       Raptors such as Bald Eagles (pictured above), Golden Eagles, and Falcons are commonly seen throughout the park. This Bald Eagle was photographed while hunting for prey near Mammoth Hot Springs, in the northern portion of the park.      It is not at all unusual to see many types of bears, like this black bear, near the roadways or up on the ridges of Yellowstone in the summertime, usually foraging for food.   [ edit ]   Geothermal Features   Geothermal features include geysers, mud pots, hot springs, fumaroles, and others. This is all because of the active volcano that Yellowstone sits on top of. Geothermal features are formed from superheated water heated by the volcano.  The pressure is so intense that it gets released into the air as hundreds of gallons of steaming water, or, when the pressure is not as intense, hot springs or mud pots are formed. Various colors of the pool are due to different types of bacteria growing in different temperatures. A good way to learn about the geothermal features is through the Young Scientist Program.  Please check with a Ranger at the Old Faithful Visitor Center.    [ edit ]   Climate   The weather in Yellowstone National Park can change very rapidly from sunny and warm to cold and rainy, so it's important to bring along extra layers of clothing which can be used as needed.      Summer : Daytime temperatures are often in the 70s (25C) and occasionally in the 80s (30C) in lower elevations. Nights are usually cool and temperatures may drop below freezing at higher elevations. Thunderstorms are common in the afternoons.      Winter : Temperatures often range from zero to 20F(-20C to -5C) throughout the day. Sub-zero temperatures over-night are common. The record low temperature is -66F (-54C). Snowfall is highly variable. While the average is 150 inches per year, it is not uncommon for higher elevations to get twice that amount.      Spring & Fall : Daytime temperatures range from the 30s to the 60s (0 to 20C) with overnight lows in the teens to single digits (-5 to -20C). Snow is common in the Spring and Fall with regular accumulations of 12"" in a 24 hour period. At any time of year, be prepared for sudden changes. Unpredictability, more than anything else, characterizes Yellowstones weather. Always be equipped with a wide range of clothing options. Be sure to bring a warm jacket and rain gear even in the summer.    [ edit ]   Get in      Official map from the National Park Service; in the public domain and not protected by copyright.

Other airports can be found in  West Yellowstone ( IATA :  WYS )  Idaho Falls  ( IATA :  IDA )  [3]  in Idaho;  Billings  ( IATA :  BIL )  [4] ,  Butte  ( IATA :  BTM )  [5] , and  Bozeman  ( IATA :  BZN )  [6] , all in Montana; and  Cody  ( IATA :  COD )  [7]  in Wyoming.   Alternative airports may have less airline service than Jackson Hole.    [ edit ]   By car   The park has 5 entrances. The nearest cities to each entrance are given. Most are within 5 miles of the park boundary.    North  - Accessed from  Gardiner  (which is reached via US Route 89 from  Livingston ) - This entrance leads to the park headquarters at  Mammoth Hot Springs , 5 miles inside the park boundary. This entrance road is open all year.  Northeast  - Accessed from  Silver Gate  and  Cooke City  via US Route 212. This entrance road is open all year, though you cannot use Route 212 in winter.  East  - Accessed from  Cody  via US Route 14/16/20. This entrance is closed in winter (early November to early May).  South  - Accessed from  Grand Teton National Park  via US Route 89/191/287. This entrance is closed in winter (early November to early May).   West  - Accessed from  West Yellowstone  via US Route 20/191/287. This entrance is closed in winter (early November to late April).    [ edit ]   Fees/Permits   All vehicles and individuals entering the park must pay an entrance fee that is valid for seven days. The entrance fee provides entry to both Grand Teton National Park and Yellowstone National Park. Fees are $25 for non-commercial vehicles, $12 for hikers and cyclists, and $20 for motorcycles and snowmobiles.  One year passes are available as an alternative to the seven day fee.  The Park Annual Pass is $50 and provides entrance to Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks.  The Interagency Annual Pass is $80 and provides entrance to most federal recreation sites across the country including Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks.    [ edit ]   Get around   [ edit ]   By car   Most visitors use private vehicles to get around inside Yellowstone National Park. There is no public transportation available within the park.  Roads can become very crowded whenever people stop to view wildlife; use pullouts, and be respectful of other motorists to help avoid  bear-jams .    [ edit ]   By bus   Xanterra Resorts  provides bus tours within the park during the summer season. The Lower Loop Tour departs from locations in the southern part of the Park only. The Upper Loop Tour departs from Lake Hotel, Fishing Bridge RV Park, and Canyon Lodge to tour the northern section of the park only. The Grand Loop Tour departs from Gardiner and Mammoth Hot Springs Hotel to tour the entire park in one day. During the winter season snowcoach tours are provided from various locations. Call (307) 344-7311 for information or reservations.  In addition, during the summer season, commercial businesses offer tours originating from many area towns and cities.  During the winter season, some businesses provide snowcoach tours for most park roads or bus transportation on the Mammoth Hot Springs to Cooke City road.    [ edit ]   By bicycle   Cycling in the park can be a very rewarding experience, but due to the great distances in the park some additional planning to ensure that lodging is available each night.  The park reserves a number of campsites for cyclists, but during the busy summer season it is probably best to reserve sites in advance wherever possible.    [ edit ][ add listing ]   See      Clepsydra geyser at play, Lower Geyser basin.   Yellowstone is world-famous for its natural heritage and beauty - and for the fact that it holds half the world's geothermal features, with more than 10,000 examples. Travelers to Yellowstone can view more than 300 geysers (such as ""Old Faithful""), pools of boiling mud, and an amazing assemblage of wildlife, such as grizzly bears, wolves, bison and elk, all while standing on the surface of the Earth's largest known ""super-volcano"".    [ edit ]   Mammoth     Mammoth Hot Springs . Mineral-laden hot water flows from springs, depositing calcite and other substances in its wake. Over time, these deposits form large terraces and other shapes. Some of the terraces grow several inches per day.    Fort Yellowstone . The historic center of activity during the United States Army's tenure of the park.    Bunsen Peak .  The hike to the top of this 8,564 foot peak takes approximately three hours round trip.  The peak overlooks the old Ft. Yellowstone area and it is only a gradual climb.  Bring water and snacks (and bear bells if you think they'll work).    [ edit ]   Norris     Norris Geyser Basin .  One of the parks many spectacular thermal areas, and home to Steamboat Geyser, the world's largest geyser, which can throw water more than 300 feet into the air when it erupts. The Norris area is the hottest, most acidic, and most changeable in the park.    Roaring Mountain . A collection of steam vents and hot springs which make noises ranging from a nearly inaudible whisper to a roar that can be heard miles away. This thermal feature is right beside the park highway.    Gibbon River .    Virginia Cascades .    [ edit ]   Madison     Artist Paint Pots . A half-mile hike takes you past many colorful hot springs, steam vents and bubbling mud pots.    Monument Geyser Basin .    Gibbon Falls . These 84-foot falls tumble down a staircase-like rock -- easy to see from a pullover area on the park highway.    Madison River . The river creates a canyon with steep, tree-covered rock walls on each side.    Terrace Springs .    Firehole Canyon Drive and Firehole Falls .    National Park Mountain . The mountain where the Madison and Firehole rivers meet. As legend has it, this is where the idea came about to preserve Yellowstone as a National Park.    [ edit ]   Geyser basins, including Old Faithful     Upper Geyser Basin .  The most popular visitor area in the park, the Upper Geyser Basin is home to the largest number of geysers in the park, with over 100 located within a one square mile area.  Boardwalks allow access to the most interesting areas.   Do not leave the trails ; the surface here is thin and unstable and has a real chance of depositing you in a boiling pool of water if you walk where you're not supposed to.  Old Faithful  The world's most famous geyser, with large eruptions occurring an average of about once every hour and a half.  Despite its reputation for having eruptions you can set a watch to, the timing between each eruption has actually been increasing over the past several decades.  Rangers are able to predict the geyser's eruptions to within about 10 minutes, provided the duration of the previous eruption is known.  Other geysers in Upper Geyser Basin that are well enough understood to be predictable (sort of!) are  Grand Geyser  (probably the finest predictable geyser in the park),  Castle Geyser ,  Daisy Geyser , and  Riverside Geyser .  Check at the Old Faithful visitor center for predictions, which will have uncertainties of an hour or so associated with them, sometimes more.      Lower Geyser Basin .  Unlike Upper Basin, most active areas here are accessible by car.   Great Fountain Geyser  is the largest geyser in this group, is easily reached by car, and is well enough understood to be predicted, after a fashion; check at the Old Faithful visitor center, and when you get to the geyser, check the bulletin board again, as its behavior allows periodic updating of the predictions.       The Grand Prismatic Spring, viewed from above. There is a trail that goes around the back of the spring which has a small turn-off that lets intrepid climbers rise about 400 feet above the spring, and capture the entire basin in one view.  For a closer view, there are raised boardwalks around the spring and nearby pools (viewable in the detail of the picture)     Midway Geyser Basin . This geyser basin is on a hill overlooking the Firehole River. The runoff from its thermal features flows into the river, leaving steaming, colorful trails in its wake. Absolutely spectacular!    Grand Prismatic Spring.  Perhaps this geyser basin's most famous feature, this is a mass of sapphire blue hot water with bands of yellow and orange around its edges. This spring is more than 300 feet across.    Excelsior Geyser  once had such violent eruptions that it seems to have blown itself up. This geyser hasn't erupted in years, but it still discharges over 4000 gallons of water per minute into the nearby Firehole River.         Lone Star geyser erupting, Check at Old Faithful Visitor Center for times     Lone Star Geyser Basin .  This and the following are more ""Do"" than ""See,"" as they require some hiking to reach them.  The route takes off from the loop road south of Upper Geyser Basin and follows an old, now-closed road for a total of about 3 miles (5 km).  Bicycles can make it most of the way to Lone Star.  Nice hike for families.    Shoshone Geyser Basin .  Serious hiking is required to reach this remote basin, which is beyond Lone Star and a good 7 miles (12 km) one way from the trailhead.    [ edit ]   Grant Village     West Thumb Geyser Basin . With a little imagination, Yellowstone Lake looks like a left hand reaching southward. This thermal area is along the western thumblike section of the lake. Several geysers and hot springs (even a couple that are just a few inches across!) are in this area, including the following two sights:    Abyss Pool . There is an optical illusion with this brilliant blue hot spring that makes it look bottomless.    Fishing Cone . In the past, people used to catch fish in Yellowstone Lake and then cook the fish by dipping them into this partially submerged hot spring. This stunt is no longer allowed.      Shoshone Lake .    [ edit ]   Lake Area     Yellowstone Lake . This is the largest freshwater lake at an elevation over 8,000 feet in the country. It spreads 20 miles east to west and 30 miles north to south. The Yellowstone River empties out into the lake.    Mud Volcano/Sulphur Cauldron . This area of the park has pools of mud that are constantly seething and boiling.  Mud Volcano  This was once a hilltop thermal feature that would hurl mud into the nearby trees during eruptions. One particularly large eruption blew apart the Mud Volcano, leaving a hot, bubbling mud pool at the base of the hill.  Dragon's Mouth Spring  Steam and hot water surge forth from within an underground cavern, creating waves in the surface mud pool. These surges of water and steam reverberate inside the cavern and make loud thumping or roaring sounds.  Sulphur Cauldron  This vast hot spring is strongly acidic thanks to the action of microorganisms.      Natural Bridge .    [ edit ]   Canyon      Dead trees near the summit of Mt. Washburn. These trees are the victims of a massive forest fire in 1987 that burned through over 30% of the forest running through the park. In a controversial decision, it went unchecked by the National Park Service, but has allowed for new growth to sprout in large parts of the park.     The Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone .  Chemical processes over time have left stripes and patches of different colors in the rock of this canyon. Depths of the canyon reach 800-1200 feet. Trails lead along the north and south rims of the canyon, but while traveling the entire trail in one day is possible, it makes for a long and tiring day.  Best to make it two shorter (~3 hour) day hikes. If you're a photo buff, plan your walks so the sun illuminates the opposite side for great pictures.     Artist point - great spot to view the canyon and the lower falls.      The Upper and Lower Falls of the Yellowstone . These are the two largest waterfalls in the park. The Upper Falls is 109 feet tall and creates a small canyon. The large Lower Falls is about 309 feet tall, and creates the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone.    Hayden Valley . Some people say it's the best place to watch bison in Yellowstone. Hayden Valley is home to a large number of animals, and includes the infamous Mud Volcano.    Mt. Washburn .  One of the best places in the park for spotting bighorn sheep, a trail leads up the mountain to a lookout tower near the 10,243 foot summit.  The altitude may affect some hikers, so it is best to be acclimatized to the higher elevation before attempting this hike.  In addition, bring extra layers, even in the summer, since the top can be windy and cold.    [ edit ]   Tower-Roosevelt     Specimen Ridge .    Petrified Forest . This is home to a large petrified forest. It is accessible along the highway.    Tower Fall . The 100-foot tall waterfall plunges down a rock, creates a thin canyon, and a rapid creek.    Calcite Springs .    [ edit ][ add listing ]   Do   Young Scientist ,  [8] .  Students ages 5 and up can learn about Yellowstone's geothermal features.  Students are given scientist toolkit, including an infrared thermometer, stop watch, magnifying glass and other gear.  Once you've finished it, you have a choice of a patch or key chain.    edit   Jr Ranger Program ,  [9] .  Jr Ranger Program provides an opportunity for children 5 - 12 to earn a Jr Ranger patch.  Ages 5-7 can earn the wolf patch and Ages 8-12 can earn the Bear patch. In order to get a patch, a 12 page activity booklet needs to be answered correctly and checked by a ranger. An activity booklet costs $3.    edit     Many visitors believe they can visit all 2.2  million  acres of Yellowstone in 1-2 days - all the while staying within sight of their car or tour bus.  To truly appreciate this vast park, get off the park roads and paved tourist paths.      Hiking  -- Walking as little as 100 feet away from the camera gangs will give you more of an appreciation for the park.  Taking a few 3-4 hour day hikes on established hiking trails is even better, yet will still allow you the luxury of a hot shower in the morning and prepared dinner in the evening.    Wildlife Viewing  -- There is a lot of wildlife to view within the park limits.  Birds (osprey, bald eagles, and many, many other species,) bison, big cats, deer, wolves, fox, bears, big-horn sheep, elk, and other animals can all be seen within the park over a short period of time.  The more time that you spend in the park, the more wildlife that you will see.  Some animals, such as the wolves, bears, and the big-horn sheep are generally not viewable from the park roads.  The spaces within the park are grand, so make sure to bring binoculars and/or a spotting scope to best view animals safely.    Horseback Riding  -- There are many opporunities to enjoy YNP and the scenery there.  Endulge in horse riding opportunities in YNP and a famous battlefield.    Backpacking     Photography  -- There are literally photo opportunities around every bend in the trail and road.  Herds of large animals roam the park, and there are large birds in several areas because of the large hunting and fishing habitats available to them.  There are unprecedented photo opportunities with natural environments, beautiful hydrothermal features and animals to be found throughout the park.  The colors of the hot springs range from bland white (for the very, very hot) to yellows and blues, greens and oranges.  Some of the features are very large, and the challenge can be finding a way to get them in the frame.  Be creative!  There have been a lot of pictures taken in Yellowstone, and there are a lot more still waiting to be taken.    Fishing     Swimming  --  Swimming is allowed (but not encouraged) at the Firehole Cascades swimming area, a section of the Firehole River that is warmed by hot springs. This area, accessible via the Firehole Canyon Drive, has a toilet but no lifeguard and not much parking.    Interpretive Programs     hot spring in boiling river about 4 miles south of the North entrance. You need to hike down to the river.

Offering an array of hotel-like rooms and cabins for families, this hotel complex provides the basic amenities without some of the flair of the  Old Faithful Inn  but at prices that are a bit lower, and Grant villiage may have greater availability due to the number of rooms available there. There is a post office nearby, as well as a cafeteria, a soda-jerk diner, and a sandwich shop in the complex, as well as a reservations-only restaurant serving local fare. Even if you decide not to eat at the restaurant, do go in to check out the large array of beautiful photographs taken by one of the long-time Yellowstone Maintenance heads, who is also one of the park photographers.    Lake Yellowstone Hotel & Cabins ,  [12] . Located right on Lake Yellowstone (there's a boat pier and a restaurant right on the edge of the lake), the Lake Yellowstone Hotel and Cabins provide a rustic experience that probably won't excite a luxury traveler, but the staff provides the basics - decent rooms, reasonably good food, and breathtaking views of the lake and its surroundings. Watch out for mosquitos especially as you walk near the lake in mornings and afternoons in the summer, they come out in swarms, but DEET or similar mosquito repellant will keep them away.

All of us at Sundance Vacations have quite a bit of wanderlust in us, and we want to help you indulge in your own wanderlust, too! Heres where we want to send you:    Read the rest of this entry »         Posted in   Florida ,   Florida Beaches ,   Poconos, Pennsylvania ,   Property News ,   Travel ,   Travel Advice       2 Comments                   Nov 14, 2007       Great Vacation/So So Accommodations                          We spent a week in October in the beautiful Pocono Mountains and stayed at the  Carriage House Country Club, Pocono Manor, PA .  I must say the Carriage House is not a country club but a dated time-share property. Our first impression was not goodwhen it took a couple of hours to find our reservation. The facilities include a swimming pool, hot tub, and game room.  There is free internet access on a computer in the lobby area, a pricey restaurant on the premises, and a little breakfast caf.  The place is just old and needs to be remodeled.  Our one-bedroom apartment was clean and roomy even though it did not have one comfortable chair  just an uncomfortable loveseat/sofa bed.  The kitchenette was well equipped.  However, noisy banging double doors in the hallway, thin walls, and inadequate plumbing which allowed for cold showers, did not spell comfort.     Rose Mary Jackson   Madison, WI                 Posted in   Poconos, Pennsylvania       2 Comments                   Oct 1, 2007       So Much To Do, So Close To Home                            So, I guess everyone is trying to catch up on those things we promised ourselves months ago and still haven’t gotten to.        My boyfriend, Jeremy, and myself finally got our rear ends out there and kayaked the Delaware River through the Water Gap.    We did a total of eleven miles.  We had been driving through the area and talking about it for long enough and since it was my weekend off and there was nothing on the calendar squares, we decided that now was the time.  We rented equipment  from the Pack Shack   and got a shuttle to Smithfield Beach and rode the river down to Portland, where we got picked up and shuttled back. It was a pretty amazing day.   I sent two pictures from our trip,   one of the river from our take-out point and one of Jeremy in the Gap.   You can see that this is a very calm river. I worked at Pocono Whitewater for a summer a few years ago, being a river guide.They do trips on the Lehigh River, which is a beautiful place, but the river is not always so calm. After a summer of working the Lehigh, I find I prefer lake and calm river kayaking.         On Sunday, a bunch of the gals from work wanted to go down to the Jam On The Dam, in White Haven.  My son, Julian, loves to ride his bike, so we packed the bike in the back of the truck and off we went.  We got a bite to eat at the festival, hung out with the girls for a little bit, and went to explore.  I actually rented a bike of my own so I could go too, after all, why should the kids get to have all the fun?   Pocono Whitewater recently opened another base right in a White Haven, so I went to visit some old friends to get my bike.  We biked between the river and the railroad and took a few breaks by some streams, and small waterfalls.   Julian got out the trail fine but when we turned around to come back to the base, he started complaining that his legs hurt.  I think this was the first time I heard him get exhausted from bike riding.  It was a lot of fun, and we actually won a pass for Pocono Whitewater, so we are planning to go again soon for a whole day.  I sent a picture from the beer tent at the festival where the Sundance Vacations crew was hanging out listening to some live music.  The picture is (left to right) Liz Warne, Karen Cooper, and Sharon Davenport.    Allie Loughridge and Cheryl Zambotti were also there but I didn’t get any good pics.           So, there are definitely a bunch of cool spots right here in our own backyard that could keep us amused for a whole summer.  With the price of gas these day’s, we’d probably be smarter to look into what our own area has to offer and check out some local places we haven’t been to before, or just go back to some of our old favorites.        We spent an entire weekend not traveling more than an hour away, and it was one of the best of the whole summer.  Let me know if anyone else has any suggestions and I will let you all know some more of my favorite’s.                                                                                                                                                       Rochell Zambotti    Hazleton Phone Room             Posted in   Poconos, Pennsylvania       3 Comments                   Sep 8, 2007       A Pocono Whitewater Adventure                        Vacations are supposed to be a time to relax, right?    So I find it funny, that many travelers find the need to fill every minute of their vacation with stuff to do.    Ok, I admit it, sometimes Im one of those people.   I guess I was pretending to be a Pocono tourist this past weekend.    I crammed my weekend full.    After biking for 13 miles on Saturday in the Lehigh Gorge State Park (see my previous post) we did indeed go rafting on Sunday.    For $55 per person my daughters and I spent the day paddling on the Lehigh.    We went with Pocono Whitewater Adventures on Route 903 (1-800-whitewater).    The weather turned chilly overnight after a warm and pleasant day on Saturday.    Asking for two good weather days in a row is apparently out of the question.    We rented full wetsuits.    They stunk like sweat or mold or both.    Mine was, well, wet when I put it on which was unfortunate because although I was quite willing to get wet I would have preferred to do it at the river.      We chose to raft the Gorge section of the river where the rapids are a little more exciting instead of the family float.    Our group was small, just 4 rafts.    We geared up, boarded the bus and were transported to Drakes Creek to launch our rafts.   Launching our rafts was probably the most dangerous part (for broken ankles).    We had to heave our raft through a washed out gully, balancing each step on river rocks. The river guides said a major flood caused the damage.    Thankfully two other adults were added to our raft because my two young daughters and I would have had trouble getting the raft to the water in those conditions.    Finally, we were launched.    Morgan and Madison upfront, two teachers from Bethlehem in the middle and me in the back.    Somehow I got the job of captain. Within 3 minutes of working on the river, we were all hot!    Thats right working.    Were paddling, were steering and were bailing.   I definitely had the wrong image of rafting.    They instructed us back at the rafting center to leave everything in our cars (dry clothes, dry towels, cameras, cell phones, etc).    I did.    I thought that things could get wet, through some splashing etc.    I had no idea that water was going to seep into the bottom of the boat or worse yet, that we were going to hit 45 minute rock and have water fill our entire raft!    Theres no time to bail when your running the rapids and trying to avoid rocks but when we got to flat water, we bailed and bailed and bailed.    At least the heavy water pushed us off 45 minute rock very quickly.    Apparently its called 45 minute rock because itll take 45 minutes to get rescued or freed from the rock.    Although my daughters were disappointed that they didnt get to go for an unexpected swim, Im thankful that they stayed in the raft the entire time.    I got dumped out twice (once when we stopped abruptly, (of course on a rock) and the other time when I was ruddering in the back and just rolled out.   My girls loved the trip.    It was a real life roller coaster.    They loved the class III rapids.    I would not go if the river was any lower, in fact, if we go again were going to watch for special water releases.     I think fall is a good time to go rafting.    The water is still warm and the river is not too low.   In closing, let me say that it is a long day.    We arrived at the rafting center before 9:45 am.    I dont remember what time we actually got on the river (who can check their watch when they are desperately trying not to break their ankle).    We got off the river around 3:30 and were back at our cars at about 4:00 pm.   Every muscle in my upper body hurts (my shoulders, neck, obliques, forearms, pecs, just everything!).    I tried aiming the jets of a Jacuzzi on my shoulders.    I applied BenGay and finally I took an Advil.    Obviously, I tried to muscle the river too hard.    Maybe we should have tried throwing the paddles in the boat and letting the river just take us.    Rafting while on vacation has its advantages; you dont have to use a sick day the day after.  How about you?    Have you ever felt like you needed a vacation after you had a vacation or participated in a ""leisurely"" activity? Let us know…                                                                                                           Tina Dowd              Posted in   Poconos, Pennsylvania       3 Comments                   Aug 16, 2007       Biking in The Lehigh Gorge Park, Poconos, PA                        Although I have lived within 15 minutes of the Lehigh Gorge Park my whole life, I really appreciated its serenity and beauty for the first time today while biking from Rockport to Glen Onoko.                                                                                                                                                                                             I have been planning this ride since May.    OK, not really planning per se.    But its been on my list. A busy summer kept getting in the way.    Free weekend?    I dont even know what that is anymore.    Finally, this past weekend, I put my foot down.    We are biking the Gorge, period.                                                                                                                                                                         My husband innocently tried to tell me that a storm front was moving in faster  than expected and we would probably get wet, but if I was Ok with that, then so was he.    My kids moaned about their various aches and pains.    The only other family member who was excited about our adventure was my 3  year old because she loves to ride in the bike seat (no peddling).                                                                       We dropped a car at Glen Onoko in Jim Thorpe.    From the Poconos take Route 903 South to Jim Thorpe.    As you come down the hill and into Jim Thorpe, youll pass a Sunoco station on your right and Annies Ice Cream on the left, go .8 miles further and turn right.  (Its the right turn after 3 rd  Street.   Watch for the brown signs for Lehigh Gorge State Park.)    Travel .3 miles and turn left into the Park.    There are parking lots carved out on the right, but go all the way to the turn around first (1.7 miles).    You can get a glimpse of the Lehigh River as you cross the bridge and see a huge cave that used to be a railway tunnel.                                                                                                                                       It takes 20-30 minutes by car to drive to Rockport.    Exit the park the way you came in, but after .3 miles, go straight at the stopsign (not right).    Cross the bridge and turn right. Turn right on Route 93 at Izios restaurant.    Travel 5.6 miles to a right turn on Route 4010.    Travel 2.2 miles and make a right turn across the railroad tracks in Weatherly.    The road snakes through the community.    So, make a right on Wilbur, pass the old train station, then left toward White Haven.    Continue on First St.    Again follow toward White Haven.    Make a right on East Main Street.    This road turns into S Lehigh Gorge Drive.    Turn right on Rockport Drive. Again there are well-marked brown signs for the Lehigh Gorge State Park.    (The total distance from when you crossed the railroad tracks to when you turn is 3.6 miles.)    Park at the bottom.    There is a restroom at the trailhead.   Bike downstream (right) to return to Glen Onoko.   The biking portion took us about 2 hours.    The trail is smooth, packed gray gravel.    My 10 year old is very picky about the riding surface. It cant be too rocky or have too many roots or be too sandy.    She thought it was perfect.    There is a 1% downhill grade from Rockport back to Jim Thorpe.    Dont get me wrong- that is flat, flat, flat.     You still have to pedal but at least its not uphill!   There are scenic overlooks and a few picnic tables scattered the length of the park.    There are no garbage cans.    Everything you take in you have to carry back out.                                                                                                                                                                         It was a perfect day.    Surrounded by the sights and sounds of the river on the left and occasional rock cliffs on the right, my family quickly forgot their gripes.    This is so nice.    Whyd you make us wait so long to come here? asks my husband.    Dont worry, hes still alive.   ( He was out of my reach when he said it.  )                                                                                                                                                ~Tina Dowd                                                                                                                                           PS-  Watching the rafters and kayaks maneuver the river gave us the itch to give it a try.    So, next  were going rafting with Pocono Whitewater Adventures (1-800-whitewater).                                                                                                                                                    Posted in   Poconos, Pennsylvania       2 Comments                                                    Navigation     Pages                Archives           January 2009    December 2008    November 2008    October 2008    September 2008    August 2008    July 2008    June 2008    May 2008    April 2008    March 2008    February 2008    January 2008    December 2007    November 2007    October 2007    September 2007    August 2007    July 2007    June 2007    May 2007    April 2007    February 2007    December 2006    November 2006    October 2006         Categories           Announcements      Arizona_      Branson, Missouri      Colorado      Delaware      Florida      Florida Beaches      Food and Drink      giveaway      Hawaiian Islands      Hilton Head, South Carolina      Lake Tahoe, Nevada      Las Vegas      Myrtle Beach, South Carolina      New Jersey Shore      Ocean City, Maryland      Panama City Beach      Poconos, Pennsylvania      Property News      Recent Happenings      Sundance Vacations, Corporate Headquarters      sweepstakes      The Finger Lakes, New York      The Grand Canyon      Travel      Travel Advice      Uncategorized      Universal Studios, Florida_      Virginia Vacations      Wilkes-Barre, Pa      Wisconsin Trips           Meta             Login      Valid  XHTML      XFN      WordPress                                              Home      Our Site                  Copyright Sundance Vacations    All Rights Reserved       Website  Design  By Solid Cactus, Inc.

They're quaint, but they're hardly the only way to keep up with the kids.   A Web site,  www.bunk1.com , keeps a gallery of photos of children at camp that parents can peruse, purchase or pass on. Local camps like Camp Chi near Lake Delton and Camp Interlaken are registered members of bunk1.com, and post photos of local kids communing with nature on a regular basis. For privacy reasons, only registered users approved by camp directors can view pages with information about campers.   While camp life remains its Luddite self - there are no computers at these camps - parents can access online photos, send e-mail (kids will get a mom's request to eat their vegetables via a printout), view online letters, send camp-specific care packages, buy equipment and, after the camp, purchase a CD-ROM yearbook.   The Web site was created by Ari Ackerman, 31, who wanted to take advantage of a growing camp market that generates almost $20 billion a year.

Register parent seeks to modify loan terms Ken Doctor, a newspaper analyst for Outsell Inc. in San Jose, said that because of industrywide financial problems, all newspapers are talking to their bankers including the McClatchy Co., which owns the Sacremento Bee and 29 other papers, and Gannett Co. Inc., whose flagship is USA Today.  You wont see any immediate impact, but you might see more cost-cutting caused by the new agreements with the lenders.           AP: Yahoo launches major upgrade to display ad system Ken Doctor, media analyst for the research firm Outsell Inc., said newspaper Web sites are too small to do much targeting by themselves. Sales through the Yahoo platform, he said, is one of the newspaper industry's top growth potential in 2009.

Fox Business Network: Bad Times for Newspapers What happens in five years if it looks like more of the recruitment is coming through Yahoos Hotjobs, said Outsells Doctor. The company may wonder if it can get a better deal going directly to Yahoo and cutting out the middleman, which in this case would be the newspaper. Thats the huge question in this.  Still Doctor said that given Newspaper companies are skilled at selling advertisements they may be able to prove their worth to the likes of Yahoo by building bigger and better sales forces.  The core strength of a newspaper is its sales staff and its relationship to the advertiser, said Doctor. If they can keep that relationship it doesnt matter what they are selling.                      What's On My Netvibes                 Steve Goldstein Fellow KR alumnus Steve Goldstein understands the research/info needs of end-use enterprise customers, and he's built a company that is helping satisfy them.

Against that backdrop, Scripps'  announcement  that it is ""selling"" the venerable Rocky Mountain News is little surprise. The ""sale"" tag, though, looks more like a close-out, bargain bin last offer, rather than a holiday surprise. Announcing that the paper is for sale on Dec. 4, with a deadline of mid-January makes any sale difficult. The Rocky joins properties in Norfolk, Greensboro, Austin and San Diego -- all once considered great newspaper markets -- on the block, though the credit freeze is pushing their owners to pull them off the marketplace and ""re-list"" later.  If you look at the basic math, you can see the problem, and why such shutdowns may become more numerous. Scripps  reported  that it lost $15 million on the Rocky in 2008. The Rocky would then be one of those 19 top 50 market papers that Dean Singleton told us were unprofitable by mid-year. That number has undoubtedly grown as we reach the end of this seemingly endless year of pain. I have little doubt that now more than half of the top 50 are unprofitable, even with the jaw-dropping cutbacks we are seeing; ad revenue continues to plummet, and the first half of 2009 looks ominous.  It's one thing for these companies to run operations that are close to, or just above the profit line. It's another -- their shareholders and re-financing lenders remind them -- to run one that is requiring subsidy. We can call it investment, but to call it that, you'd have to peg a return to healthy profitability at some point certain -- and no one can do that. So it's a subsidy.  And that's not what public,  profit-seeking  companies are designed to do. The Denver JOA -- JOA, a concept overtaken by marketplace and technological change -- was meant to share profits, not subsidies.  Once that line of profitability is crossed, a descent into chaos begins. That's where we are as we approach 2009. The signals we're seeing today -- the massive Gannett layoffs, the Rocky ""sale"", quickening production and distribution consolidations and cutbacks -- all point to a reality: the industry can't wait for the economic recovery. It's too far off, and uncertain in its impact. ("" Coming: The Newspaper Recovery Classified Stimulus Act of 2009 ""). As an alumnus of the now-Scripps-owned Boulder Daily Camera (1984-1986, aka The Golden Years), I'm not sure where the Rocky plan puts the Camera. Just last month, Scripps announced it was  selling  the Camera building, sitting on the corner of the legendary Boulder mall. The Camera was once picked up by Scripps in its circulation war with the Denver Post, a war that seems like an artifact of some quick-disappearing history now.
