GX019-71-13408228	EM Home  |   Learn About EM  |  History   |   Timeline    |   The 50s                      July 1955      On July 17, 1955, Arco, Idaho became the first U.S. town to be powered by  nuclear energy.   The demonstration lasted for one hour in the 1,350-person  community.  The National Reactor Testing Station, now called the Idaho  National Engineering Laboratory,  supplied the power from its Borax-III  reactor.  It was part of the Atomic Energy Commission's (AEC) Five-Year  Reactor Development Program in the mid-1950's. The AEC tested five types  of experimental reactors.  The Borax-III was an early prototype of a  boiling water reactor, a type of reactor which still produces  electricity for utilities today.

Click on figure for larger image with  caption.                Five boreholes were drilled in the new lava, four in areas that  had been cooled non-uniformly and one in an area which had not been  cooled. The positions of the boreholes are shown in  fig. 16 , and the results of the temperature  measurements in  fig. 17  and  fig. 18 .  Figure 16  also  shows the position of trenches that were dug all along  Helgafellsbraut in order to avoid having vapor [e.g., steam, carbon  dioxide, and other gases] spread any farther [to the west] along  the former surface [contact between the old land surface and new  overlying tephra].                                                      Figure 17. Click on figure for larger image with  caption.                                       On 12 May, a drill was sent to Vestmannaeyjar from Orkustofnun  [National Energy Authority]. The drilling proceeded well, and a  total of five 10-25-m-deep holes were drilled into the lava and  three into the area west of the lava edge    Figure 16 ; one of the holes [borehole V] was 35 m deep. People  from the State Drilling Contractors had the unique opportunity into  drill in red-hot lava. It is only known to have been done once  before in Hawaii [e.g., Alae lava lake, Kilhauea caldera, Hawaii.  See Peck, D.L., 1978, Cooling and vesiculation of Alae lava lake,  Hawaii: U.S. Geological Survey Professional Paper 935-B, 59  p.].      The drilling was started where the lava had been cooled the most  [borehole I], for example, [just up onto the lavas south of]  Fiskiðan hf. [fish-processing company]. The next borehole  [borehole II] was in an area that had been cooled a little less and  the 3rd one [borehole III] in an area where no cooling had been  tried at all  Figure 16 . Borehole IV, which  was close to Vilpa [see  Figure 3  in the  Introduction] showed very similar results as from borehole II, and,  therefore, its temperature profile is not shown.               Back to Top                                                               Figure 18. Click on figure for larger image with  caption.               Borehole V, VI and VII were drilled in the area where lava had  not flowed, [but was covered by a layer of tephra]. These three  boreholes were drilled because of the intense heat that formed in  the soil west of the lava edge. The houses had started to  deteriorate from the heat. [Also, the new hospital was situated  just to the west  Figure 16 .] In boreholes  V and VI  Figure 18 , the temperature of the  soil was 100 ºC. at 10-m depth, but dropped to a near-surface  [ambient] temperature in the next 5 to 10 meters. Borehole VII,  which was south of the new hospital, showed on the other hand, a  temperature of 4 ºC. from the surface to the bottom.      The last borehole, borehole VIII, was drilled into the lava east  of Skans [ Figure 3  in the Introduction],  but that was the only one drilled beyond [northeast of] the former  coastline of the island. Much cooling had been carried out there,  within a relatively small area, when  Sandey  was pumping  [seawater onto the lavas] there; the temperature of the lava was  100 ºC. from the surface to a depth of 13 m.      If a theoretical cooling of a lava field, based on air cooling  only, is studied in order to realize how rapid the cooling is, one  may look at a simple model of a smooth and thick lava field that  originally was a lava flow. In the beginning, the temperature is  the same all through the lava flow; i.e., 1050 ºC. Temperature  measurements performed [by us] support this [theoretical  calculation].                     Back to Top                                                                     Figure 19. Diagram showing the lava surface,  temperature (T) profile, original thickness of molten lava (X),  lava-solidification front (dashed line) migrating downwards over  time, and thickness of solid lava.               The heat-transfer-equation of solidifying rock is:                             If the following value for specific heat at constant pressure  for solidifying rock is used: 4                                one arrives at an answer that is shown in figure 20, where the  depth of the lava in meters is a function of the time in years.                                                 Figure 20. Click on figure for larger image with  caption.                The two plus signs on figure 20 show the temperature in  borehole III, where the lava was not cooled. Theoretical cooling of  the lava is slightly faster than this result of measurements  indicates, because the effect of rainfall was not taken into  consideration. Average rainfall in the Vestmannaeyjar is about 1.5  m a year, which corresponds to the cooling of one meter of lava  down to 100 ºC. a year, if all rainwater vaporizes. If the  effect of the seawater cooling from the holes drilled is studied,  it will be noticed that the cooling was 50-100 times faster in  those areas compared with self-cooled lava.

FOREWORD  DOE TECHNICAL STANDARDS  August 1, 2000  The need for a technical standard is established in accordance with the Department of Energy Technical Standards Program Procedures (DOE TSPPs). If a DOE Technical Standard is needed, the guidance contained in this Style Guide may be helpful for development or maintenance of DOE standards, handbooks, or technical standards lists. A separate style guide will be provided for DOE specifications due to additional paragraph needs. For Technical Qualification Standards, see DOE O 426.1-1, Chapter VIII.  2.

DOCUMENT FORMAT 3.1  Layout. Use the following format layout to structure technical standards:      Cover Title page Table of Contents Foreword Main body (including) * Scope * Purpose * Applicability 1   STYLE GUIDE  DOE TECHNICAL STANDARDS  August 1, 2000      3.2  * References * Definitions (optional) * Text * Tables * Figures Appendixes Index Concluding Material Document Improvement Proposal form (DOE F 1300.3)  Document Identifier. 3.2.1 Full coordination documents. (Note: Refer to DOE Technical Standards Program Procedures [TSPPs] for a complete explanation of full coordination and limited coordination technical standards). Identify fully coordinated DOE Technical Standards by the letters DOE-STD, DOE-HDBK, or DOE-TSL, respectively, followed by a hyphen and Arabic numbers. The document identifier is assigned to the document by the Headquarters Technical Standards Manager of the Preparing Activity. Examples: DOE-STD-1116-2000 DOE-HDBK-2042-2000 3.2.2 Limited coordination documents. Identify limited coordination DOE Technical Standards in a similar manner as fully coordinated documents, except that a two-letter identifier is inserted to show the designation of the Headquarters organization that approved the document. Examples: DOE-DP-STD-3533-2000 3.2.3 DOE-ER-HDBK-6212-2000  Separate volumes. DOE Technical Standards may be issued in volumes when the nature of the contents warrants such handling. Identify all volumes by the same document identifier followed by a backslash and sequential number. Example: DOE-STD-1094/1-2000 DOE-STD-1094/2-2000 DOE-STD-1094/3-2000  Each part may be revised and issued independently of the other parts. Each volume should identify the number of parts comprising the standard and appropriate words placed in parenthesis following the document title. 2   STYLE GUIDE Example: 3.2.4  DOE TECHNICAL STANDARDS (Volume 1 of 3)  August 1, 2000  Identifier location and type. Except for the cover and title pages, center the document identifier 0.5 inch from the top of each page in bold, all capital letters. Use 11-point proportional type (e.g., Arial, Times New Roman, Helvetica, Letter Gothic, or Universal Scalable).  4. 4.1  PAGE FORMAT Layout. Type the body of the document using 11-point proportional type (e.g., Arial, Times New Roman, Helvetica, Letter Gothic, or Universal Scalable) with a line spacing of 1.5, on one side of the paper only. Use 8.5 by 11-inch plain white bond paper (without a watermark). Set a 1 inch margin for the right, left, and bottom of the page, and a 0.5 inch margin for the top of the page if using Microsoft Word. Set a bottom margin of 0.5 inch if using WordPerfect. Place the document identifier as described in section 3.2.4. Center the page number 0.5 inch from the bottom of the page. Page Numbering. Beginning with the first right-hand page after the cover page, identify all pages up to the main body consecutively in the bottom center of the page with lowercase Roman numerals, omitting numbers i and ii (for example, iii, iv, and v). Pages i and ii are the title page and its reverse side. Beginning with the page upon which the main body starts, number all pages consecutively at the bottom center of the page in Arabic numbers. On the back of fold-out pages and other pages which must unavoidably be left blank, number the blank page and insert the words ""INTENTIONALLY BLANK"" on the middle of the page. Appendixes and indexes are also to be numbered for clarity of the document.  4.2  5.  COVER (see Figure 1) [use the format provided on the Tool Kit disk]. Place the security classification (if applicable), title, document identifier, approval date, measurement system identification, the DOE logo, the distribution statement, and the FSC, FSG, or Functional AREA on the cover. Identify drafts of all documents with the following note in the top left corner of the cover page:  This draft, [date], prepared by the [title of Preparing Activity], has not been approved and is subject to modification. Project No. [number from the project registration form].  Remove this note from the camera-ready master after approval and prior to reproduction. 3   STYLE GUIDE 5.1  DOE TECHNICAL STANDARDS  August 1, 2000  Title. Item names in titles should make maximum use of Cataloging Handbook H6. When it is not practical to use Cataloging Handbook H6, the titles for documents are to be selected by the Preparing Activity. In addition to the approved basic or item name, include such modifiers as are necessary to identify the coverage of the document and clearly distinguish between other documents covering similar items. Place the title at the top of the cover immediately below the heading ""DOE STANDARD,"" ""DOE HANDBOOK,"" or ""DOE TECHNICAL STANDARDS LIST,"" as appropriate (see Figure 1).  5.2  Identifier. Place the document identifier in the upper right-hand corner of the cover under the measurement system identification. Examples: DOE-STD-1116-2000 DOE-HDBK-2042-2000 DOE-TSL-3966-2000  5.3  Approval date. Identify the date of approval under the document identifier on the cover only. Examples: DOE-STD-1116-2000 DOE-HDBK-2042-2000 June 2000 May 2000  Drafts do not have an approval date so the word ""PROPOSED"" may be placed in this location. Examples: DOE-STD-XXXX-YR PROPOSED DOE-HDBK-XXXX-YR PROPOSED  5.4  Measurement system identification. Identify metric documents by placing the word ""METRIC"" in a rectangular box above the document identifier on the cover page. Identify inch-pound documents in a similar manner, except use the term ""INCH-POUND."" Similarly, identify those documents that can be used in either the metric or inch-pound systems or contain no measurements with ""NOT MEASUREMENT SENSITIVE."" Identify hybrid documents that include a mixture of metric and inch-pound units with ""INCH-POUND."" Examples: NOT MEASUREMENT SENSITIVE DOE-TSL-XXXX-YR  METRIC DOE-STD-XXXX-YR  INCH-POUND DOE-HDBK-XXXX-YR  4   STYLE GUIDE  DOE TECHNICAL STANDARDS  August 1, 2000  5.5  FSC, FSG, Functional AREA designation. Identify the appropriate FSC, FSG, or Functional AREA designation (first four letters or numbers of the project number) in the lower right hand corner. Use the applicable FSG if more than one FSC is covered. Refer to DOETSL-2, Appendix A for the listing of Functional Area Codes. Distribution statement. Cite the appropriate distribution statement in accordance with DOE O 241.1, Scientific and Technical Information Management. The Preparing Activity should evaluate each document against the criteria in DOE O 241.1 during draft development to determine whether the release of the technical information should be restricted. The distribution statement should appear centered on the line below the FSC, FSG, or Functional AREA designation. Place the distribution statement on all coordination drafts, as well as the camera-ready copy of the document. The statement for unclassified documents will be as follows: ""DISTRIBUTION STATEMENT A. Approved for public release; distribution is unlimited.""  5.6  5.7  Availability statement. Place the following statement on the back of the front cover and title page: This document has been reproduced directly from the best available copy. Available to DOE and DOE contractors from ES&H Technical Information Services, U.S. Department of Energy, (800) 473-4375, fax: (301) 903-9823. Available to the public from the U.S. Department of Commerce, Technology Administration, National Technical Information Service, Springfield, VA 22161; (703) 605-6000.  6.  TITLE PAGE (see Figure 2). Copy the cover for use as the title page. DELETED TABLE OF CONTENTS Place the words ""TABLE OF CONTENTS"" in capital letters at the head of the contents page. Place the headings ""PARAGRAPH"" and ""PAGE"" above the area where numbers and headings for sections and paragraphs and their page numbers are listed. Do not list paragraphs below the first level.g., section 2.1) in the Table of Contents. The contents should also list figures, tables, appendixes, and the index, if these are included.  7. 8.  5   STYLE GUIDE 9.  DOE TECHNICAL STANDARDS  August 1, 2000  FOREWORD (see Figure 3). [use the format provided on the Tool Kit disk for the Style Guide]. Prepare a Foreword that includes an implementation paragraph and a beneficial comments paragraph. Additional numbered statements may be included to explain the reasons or purpose for the new document or give background information in the case of a revised document. The Foreword may also include a brief summary of development history and a statement of reason for a particular format or sequence in the presentation of specific requirements. Also, if desired by the Preparing Activity, the Foreword may include an acknowledgment of or a list of personnel involved in the preparation and review of the document. Place one of the following implementation paragraphs as the first paragraph of the Foreword: This Department of Energy (standard) (handbook) (technical standards list) is approved for use by all DOE Components and their contractors. Use for fully coordinated documents. This Department of Energy (standard) (handbook) (technical standards list) is approved for use by (name of Headquarters organization who prepared the document) and is available for use by all DOE components and their contractors. Use for limited coordination documents. This Department of Energy (standard) (handbook) (technical standards list) is approved for use by (name of Headquarters organization who prepared the document) and is available within the distribution limitations noted on the cover page. Use for documents with restricted distribution. The second paragraph of the Foreword should be as follows: Beneficial comments (recommendations, additions, deletions) and any pertinent data that may improve this document should be sent to: [name and address of Preparing Activity] by letter or by using the self-addressed Document Improvement Proposal (DOE F 1300.3) appearing at the end of this document.  10.  MAIN BODY  10.1 Scope. The scope is a clear, concise statement of the extent or range of the document's technical content. Write the scope to function as an abstract (use NISO Z39.14 as a guide). The abstract will be used to locate the document through electronic keyword searches on the Internet. Figures are not to be included in the scope.  6   STYLE GUIDE  DOE TECHNICAL STANDARDS  August 1, 2000  10.2 Purpose. The purpose states the intent of the document and the reason for its development. 10.3 Applicability. When appropriate, make a statement on the extent of selective application of the provisions of the document. Provide sufficient guidance regarding the phase or phases of program activity for which it is intended; the range of characteristics, processes, or disciplines to which it applies; and the interrelationship between the facets of the subject of the document and the intended use. If misinterpretation of the intent of application is possible, statements of nonapplication may be more appropriate. When more extensive application guidelines are needed than can be readily included in the main body of the document, an appendix should be included to describe the guidelines. Example: Application Guidance. In determining the applicability of the tasks herein and tailoring them to a program, the following principles should be followed: a. Every program is different. b. Every design involves competing desirable characteristics. c. Programs must achieve a balance between operational need, equipment performance, cost, and schedule. d. Maintainability tasks vary in their nature from one project phase to another. Extensive application guidance and detailed rationale for selecting tasks to fit the needs of a particular program should be included in an appendix. When other application guidance is contained later in the text, include the following sentence: For additional information on application, refer to [paragraph number] on application guidance. 10.4 References. List only those documents referenced within the main body of the technical standard. Documents used for information to help prepare the DOE Technical Standard should be listed in an appendix, not in the references section. Government specifications and standards, non-Government standards, international standardization documents, handbooks, drawings, and widely recognized technical publications may be referenced in DOE Technical Standards. Reference Government regulations or codes, such as Operational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulations, Federal Hazardous Substances Labeling Act, Atomic Energy Act, and Department of Transportation regulations where applicable. Take care in referencing non-Government publications. Ensure the availability of copies and obtain prior approval of the copyright owner, if required. Confine references to current documents readily available at the time of issuance of the DOE 7   STYLE GUIDE  DOE TECHNICAL STANDARDS  August 1, 2000  Technical Standard. Figures bound integrally with the referenced document should not be listed unless they are reduced-size copies of drawings provided for information only in the document, and use of the full-size drawings is normally required with the referenced document. 10.4.1 Government documents. List referenced Government standards, handbooks, TSLs, and specifications by document title and identifier excluding revision letters (unless otherwise specified) or suffix (preparing activity symbols). If a document has been modified by a Change Notice, include the version of the Change Notice with the reference (i.e., DOE-STD-1116-93, Change Notice 1). Use the titles shown on the documents rather than from an index. List Federal standards, handbooks, drawings, and publications, as applicable, numerically (except list Federal specifications alphanumerically) under these headings. Government document references should be further subdivided into individual groups, such as DOE documents and other Government documents. Include these listings under the following subparagraphs: DOE Technical Standards, Handbooks, and Technical Standards Lists (TSLs). The following DOE Technical Standards, Handbooks, and TSLs form a part of this document to the extent specified herein. Other Government documents, drawings, and publications. The following other Government documents, drawings, and publications form a part of this document to the extent specified herein. Unless otherwise indicated, the issues of these documents are those cited in the contracting document. 10.4.2 Non-Government documents. List non-Government standards in appropriate order (numerically or alphanumerically) under the headings of the respective nonGovernment standards body. List the document(s) by title and identifier, if applicable. Use the titles shown on the document rather than from an index.  10.5 Definitions (optional). Define all key terms used in sufficient detail for adequate clarity, unless the terminology is generally accepted and not subject to interpretation. Definitions may be included by reference to documents listed in the reference section. 10.6 Text. 10.6.1 Paragraph numbers and titles. Number each paragraph consecutively within each section of the document, using a period to separate the number representing each  8   STYLE GUIDE  DOE TECHNICAL STANDARDS  August 1, 2000  breakdown. For clarity of text, paragraph numbering should be limited to three sublevels, unless additional sublevels are unavoidable. Example for Section 4: Section title First paragraph First subparagraph Second paragraph First subparagraph Second subparagraph First sub-subparagraph  4 4.1 4.1.1 4.2 4.2.1 4.2.2 4.2.2.1  Section No. First level Second level First level Second level Second level Third level  Itemization within a paragraph or subparagraph should be identified by lowercase letters followed by a period to avoid confusion with paragraph numbers. Example for Section 4: First subparagraph First itemization Second itemization First subitemization Second subitemization 10.6.2  4.1.1 a. b. 1. 2.  First sublevel First-level itemization First-level itemization First-level subitemization Second-level subitemization  Underlining. Portions of paragraphs should not be underlined and words or phrases should not be capitalized for the sake of emphasis. Grammar and style. Except where DOE requirements differ, use the GPO Style Manual as a guide for capitalization, spelling, punctuation, compound words, tabular work, and other elements of grammar and style. Abbreviations. Use abbreviations in accordance with the GPO Style Manual where applicable. Abbreviations not covered by the current issue of GPO Style Manual should be in accordance with ASME Y14.38. The first time an abbreviation is used place it in parentheses preceded by the full unabbreviated title. Symbols. Use symbols in equations and tables as defined in IEEE 260.1. Metric symbols need not be spelled out. Symbols may be used for physical quantities (both metric and inch-pounds), often thought of as abbreviations, as defined in IEEE/ASTM SI-10.  10.6.3  10.6.4  10.6.5  9   STYLE GUIDE 10.6.6  DOE TECHNICAL STANDARDS  August 1, 2000  Shall, should, and will statements. Clear distinction should be made between requirements portions and guidance portions of documents. ""Shall"" is used to denote actions that must be performed in order to meet the objectives stated in the document, and ""should"" is used to indicate recommended practices. ""Will"" may be used to express a declaration of purpose, indicating future intent. Decimal usage. Use decimals in documents instead of fractions wherever possible. Metric measures. Metric practices should conform to IEEE/ASTM SI-10. The use of both metric and inch-pound measurements on drawings or other pictorial illustrations in a standard should be avoided. Footnotes and notes. Footnotes and notes may be used to convey additional information that is not properly a part of the text. Place the footnote to the text at the bottom of the page containing the reference to it. Consecutively number footnotes throughout the document with Arabic numerals. Use the Arabic numeral to identify the reference in the text. Footnotes to tables may contain mandatory information that cannot be presented as data within a table. Number footnotes separately for each table as they appear in the table. Use footnote symbols such as ""1/"", ""2/"" and place them immediately following a word and preceding a numeral requiring the footnote. Numbered footnotes are listed in order immediately below the table. Where numerals will lead to ambiguity (for example in connection with a chemical formula), superior letters, daggers, and other symbols may be necessary. Notes to figures are numbered separately from textual footnotes within the document. Drafting or dimensional notes are numbered consecutively and placed below the figure and above the title. Type the word ""NOTES"" in the left margin of the figure, with the explanatory information typed in Arabic number sequence under ""NOTES."" Example: NOTES: 1. Dimensions are in millimeters. 2. Inch-pound equivalents are given for information only.  10.6.7  10.6.8  10.6.9  10.6.10 Foldouts. Avoid the use of foldouts because they require special printing and handling procedures, and delay distribution. When foldouts are required, group them in one place, preferably at the end of the document (in the same location as figures) and include suitable reference to their location in the text. 10   STYLE GUIDE  DOE TECHNICAL STANDARDS  August 1, 2000  10.7 Tables. Use a table when information can be presented more clearly than as text. Make references in the text to the table sufficiently detailed to make the purpose of the table clear. Place the tables immediately following or within the paragraph containing the first reference. If space does not permit, the table may be placed on the following page. If tables are numerous or their locations would interfere with correct sequencing of paragraphs and cause difficulty in understanding or interpretation, place them in numerical order at the end of the document and before any figures, appendix, or index. Information included in tables should not be repeated in the text. 10.7.1 Numbers and titles. Number all tables consecutively throughout the document with Roman numerals in the order of their reference in the text, even if only one table appears in the document. Documents with independent numbered sections, such as test method standards, may number tables consecutively within each section, incorporating the section number as part of the table number, for example, ""TABLE 507-II."" If a document contains such a large number of tables that the use of Roman numerals would be confusing, Arabic numerals may be used. Fully capitalize the word ""TABLE"" ; followed by the table number and a period; followed by the underlined title. Only capitalize the first letter of the title. Center table titles above the table and on the same line with the table number. If the title is too long to be typed on one line, align the second line with the first letter of the title. If a listing or tabulation appears within a paragraph as an integral part of the paragraph and obviously does not require a title, the listing or tabulation need not be titled or numbered. Layout. Box in and rule tables horizontally and vertically as necessary to ensure clarity of the table contents. If a table is of such width that it would be impractical to place it in its normal vertical position, rotate it counterclockwise 90 degrees. If a table is rotated, ensure that the document header and footer remain at the top and bottom of the page--in portrait format. Large tables may be divided and, if possible, printed on facing pages. If a table is continued to additional page(s), do not draw a horizontal line at the end of the page, unless the table is a group or method type that requires a line of separation between the groups. When lengthy group testing is being documented, complete the entire group on one page. When the table is continued to the next page, repeat the title and add an em dash followed by the word ""Continued"" at the end of the title, for example, ""TABLE II. Vector Analysis--Continued."" Repeat the entire heading at the top of the page on which the continuation is presented. Close the table with a horizontal line when all information has been entered.  10.7.2  11   STYLE GUIDE  DOE TECHNICAL STANDARDS  August 1, 2000  10.8 Figures. Place figures immediately following or within the paragraph containing the first reference to the figure. If figures are numerous or their location would interfere with correct sequencing of paragraphs and cause difficulty in understanding or interpretation, place them in numerical order at the end of the document following any tables and before any appendix or index. If the figure is of such width that it would be impracticable to place it in its normal vertical position, rotate it counterclockwise 90 degrees. Use ASME Y14.5M for dimensioning practices on outline drawings. If figures are not in the same software as the rest of the document, ensure that a clear original is provided with the camera-ready copy to be used for printing. 10.8.1 Numbers and titles. Number figures consecutively throughout the document with Arabic numerals in the order of their reference in the text, even if only one figure is referenced in the document. Capitalize the word ""FIGURE""; followed by the Arabic numeral and a period; followed by the title. Capitalize only the first letter of the title. Center figure titles below the graphic and, if possible, on the same line with the figure number. If the title of the figure is too long to be typed on one line, align the second line with the first letter of the title. Large figures may be divided and, if possible, printed on facing pages. When a figure is continued on the next page, repeat the number and title below the figure with an em dash followed by the word ""Continued"" at the end of the title. 11. APPENDIXES and Attachments Appendixes may be added to a DOE Technical Standard for the purpose of including any detailed information that is a necessary part of the document but is too lengthy for inclusion in the main text. For Attachments, provide a cover page labeled as an Attachment (vs. Appendix) with a short summary of the attached document, and state the total pages in the document. Both may be used.  11.1 Numbers and titles. Mark the upper center of each page with the document identifier. On the next line, center the word APPENDIX (followed by an alphabetical identifier, such as A, B, C, etc.). Include the appendix letter in each page number of the appendix. For example, A-1. 11.2 Scope. Indicate the coverage and limitations of the appendix to ensure its proper application and use. 11.3 References. List any references that may be required for the appendix that relate only to the appendix.  12   STYLE GUIDE 12.  DOE TECHNICAL STANDARDS  August 1, 2000  INDEX An alphabetical index may be placed at the end of the document and before the concluding material to permit ready reference to its contents. Use an index only for lengthy documents. If used, the index follows the basic document and any appendix. The pages are numbered continuously following the last page of the basic document or appendix, as applicable. Add the word ""INDEX"" in the upper center of each page. CONCLUDING MATERIAL (see Figure 4) [use the format provided on the Tool Kit disk]. Provide the following information at the end of the document after any tables, figures, appendixes, or indexes and before the form, DOE F 1300.3. Review Activities-- list the acronym of all organizations that were sent copies of the document for coordination. Preparing Activity--show the DOE office symbol of the organization responsible for preparation of the document, e.g., EH-31. Agent--if a subcontractor acted as agent for document preparation, that organization may be listed if desired, e.g., ORNL. Project Number--show the number assigned to the Project Registration and Approval Request, form DOE F 1300.5.  13.  14.  DOCUMENT IMPROVEMENT PROPOSAL FORM (form DOE F 1300.3) Include this form as the last sheet of the document. This form is not required on classified documents; however, if used, security regulations apply. UPDATES TO DOE TECHNICAL STANDARDS  15.  15.1 Change Notices. Change notices (see Figure 5) are issued when changes meet the established criteria in DOE-TSPP-9, Maintenance of DOE Technical Standards. Change notices and the appended pages are noncumulative. Amendments are not issued for DOE Technical Standards. Change notices are used to transmit new pages and page revisions of the document. These changes are accomplished by issuing completely revised replacement pages on which the changes are shown. Prepare revised pages in the same manner as pages of a new document. If an additional page is to be inserted, identify it by the previous page number followed by the letter ""a"", etc. Example: Page 4a follows page 4 as an inserted page. On each additional new page, place the words ""NEW PAGE"" in the lower left-hand corner, 1-inch left margin and 1-inch bottom margin. Place a notice providing direction to 13   STYLE GUIDE  DOE TECHNICAL STANDARDS  August 1, 2000  the user about superseding page number and designation of revision or notice of page being replaced on the bottom of each revised page. Replace complete pages (both sides) so that the old page can be removed and the new page inserted. Note any unchanged page that is being replaced because it is on the opposite side of a page being changed as having been ""REPRINTED WITHOUT CHANGE"". 15.2 Reaffirmed standard. When a standard is reaffirmed, revise the cover page to identify the date of reaffirmation and insert a notice of reaffirmation before the Foreword. 15.3 Inactive for new design standard. When a standard is placed in the inactive for new design category, insert an ""Inactive for New Design Notice"" before the Foreword of the current document. Create a new cover page to be attached to the current document. 15.4 Canceled standard. When a standard is canceled, revise the inside cover page to show the cancellation. Place the word ""Canceled"" and the date below the document number on the cover page and a note below the title of the standard to show that either a replacement document exists or there is no replacement document. 15.5 Reinstated standard. When a standard is reinstated for usage, the document number will remain the same; however, if the reinstatement is for use by a single activity, indicate the activity symbol after the document number. Insert the reinstatement notice before the Foreword. Revise the cover to show the reinstatement information in the upper-right corner. 16. REVISED DOCUMENTS When DOE Technical Standards are revised, replace the original approval date with the date of the revision (month-year). Also change the document identifier: Example: Original Document DOE-STD-XXXX-2000 January 2000 Revised Document DOE-STD-XXXX-2000 April 2000  When documents are revised in the same year as the original approval date, place a capital letter immediately following the two-digit year after the standard number on the cover page. No statement is required in the heading on the ""Contents"" page. Mark the first revision in the same year as the original approval date with the letter ""A"" and succeeding revisions in that year by other letters in alphabetical sequence.

This Department of Energy standard is approved for use by all DOE Components and their contractors.  2.  Beneficial comments (recommendations, additions, deletions) and any pertinent data that may improve this document should be sent to the Office of Nuclear Safety Policy and Standards (EH-31), U.S. Department of Energy, Washington, DC 20585, by letter or by using the self-addressed Document Improvement Proposal form (DOE F 1300.3) appearing at the end of this document.  3.  DOE Technical Standards, such as this standard, do not establish requirements. However, all or part of the provisions in a DOE standard can become requirements under the following circumstances: (a) (b) they are explicitly stated to be requirements in a DOE requirements document; or the organization makes a commitment to meet a standard in a contract or in an implementation plan or program plan required by a DOE requirements document.  Throughout this standard, the word ""shall"" is used to denote actions which must be performed if the objectives of this standard are to be met. If the provisions in this standard are made requirements through one of the two ways discussed above, then the ""shall"" statements would become requirements. It is not appropriate to consider that ""should"" statements would automatically be converted to ""shall"" statements as this action would violate the consensus process used to approve this standard.

GX261-11-15340071	"Environmental Impacts of Transportation  (including cultural resource surveys), conduct consultations with Federal agencies, the State of Nevada, and tribal governments, and perform additional National Environmental Policy Act reviews as a basis for final alignment selection and construction. DOE would address the mitigation of potential impacts to archaeological and historic sites during the identification, evaluation, and treatment planning phases of the cultural resource surveys. For existing highways and mainline railroads, the added traffic would be minimal and shipments of spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste would be unlikely to affect land use, air quality, hydrology, biological resources and soils, cultural resources, socioeconomics, noise and vibration, or aesthetics, except as noted above. The analyses discussed in the preceding sections also determined that impacts to these resource areas from construction and operation of a branch rail line in any of the five potential rail corridors or construction of an intermodal transfer station and upgrading of highways in Nevada would be low. Because the analyses did not identify large impacts for railroad and highway transportation of spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste in Nevada that would constitute credible adverse impacts on populations, workers, or individuals, adverse effects would be unlikely for any specific segment of the population, including minorities, low-income groups, and Native American tribes, except as noted above. Chapter 4, Section 4.1.13.4, contains an environmental justice discussion of a Native American perspective on the Proposed Action.

Click on figure for larger image with  caption.                Five boreholes were drilled in the new lava, four in areas that  had been cooled non-uniformly and one in an area which had not been  cooled. The positions of the boreholes are shown in  fig. 16 , and the results of the temperature  measurements in  fig. 17  and  fig. 18 .  Figure 16  also  shows the position of trenches that were dug all along  Helgafellsbraut in order to avoid having vapor [e.g., steam, carbon  dioxide, and other gases] spread any farther [to the west] along  the former surface [contact between the old land surface and new  overlying tephra].                                                      Figure 17. Click on figure for larger image with  caption.                                       On 12 May, a drill was sent to Vestmannaeyjar from Orkustofnun  [National Energy Authority]. The drilling proceeded well, and a  total of five 10-25-m-deep holes were drilled into the lava and  three into the area west of the lava edge    Figure 16 ; one of the holes [borehole V] was 35 m deep. People  from the State Drilling Contractors had the unique opportunity into  drill in red-hot lava. It is only known to have been done once  before in Hawaii [e.g., Alae lava lake, Kilhauea caldera, Hawaii.  See Peck, D.L., 1978, Cooling and vesiculation of Alae lava lake,  Hawaii: U.S. Geological Survey Professional Paper 935-B, 59  p.].      The drilling was started where the lava had been cooled the most  [borehole I], for example, [just up onto the lavas south of]  Fiskiðan hf. [fish-processing company]. The next borehole  [borehole II] was in an area that had been cooled a little less and  the 3rd one [borehole III] in an area where no cooling had been  tried at all  Figure 16 . Borehole IV, which  was close to Vilpa [see  Figure 3  in the  Introduction] showed very similar results as from borehole II, and,  therefore, its temperature profile is not shown.               Back to Top                                                               Figure 18. Click on figure for larger image with  caption.               Borehole V, VI and VII were drilled in the area where lava had  not flowed, [but was covered by a layer of tephra]. These three  boreholes were drilled because of the intense heat that formed in  the soil west of the lava edge. The houses had started to  deteriorate from the heat. [Also, the new hospital was situated  just to the west  Figure 16 .] In boreholes  V and VI  Figure 18 , the temperature of the  soil was 100 ºC. at 10-m depth, but dropped to a near-surface  [ambient] temperature in the next 5 to 10 meters. Borehole VII,  which was south of the new hospital, showed on the other hand, a  temperature of 4 ºC. from the surface to the bottom.      The last borehole, borehole VIII, was drilled into the lava east  of Skans [ Figure 3  in the Introduction],  but that was the only one drilled beyond [northeast of] the former  coastline of the island. Much cooling had been carried out there,  within a relatively small area, when  Sandey  was pumping  [seawater onto the lavas] there; the temperature of the lava was  100 ºC. from the surface to a depth of 13 m.      If a theoretical cooling of a lava field, based on air cooling  only, is studied in order to realize how rapid the cooling is, one  may look at a simple model of a smooth and thick lava field that  originally was a lava flow. In the beginning, the temperature is  the same all through the lava flow; i.e., 1050 ºC. Temperature  measurements performed [by us] support this [theoretical  calculation].                     Back to Top                                                                     Figure 19.

Figure 20. Click on figure for larger image with  caption.                The two plus signs on figure 20 show the temperature in  borehole III, where the lava was not cooled. Theoretical cooling of  the lava is slightly faster than this result of measurements  indicates, because the effect of rainfall was not taken into  consideration. Average rainfall in the Vestmannaeyjar is about 1.5  m a year, which corresponds to the cooling of one meter of lava  down to 100 ºC. a year, if all rainwater vaporizes. If the  effect of the seawater cooling from the holes drilled is studied,  it will be noticed that the cooling was 50-100 times faster in  those areas compared with self-cooled lava.

GX004-80-4264160	"RESFEN 3.1         SYSTEM     REQUIREMENTS           GET A COPY         TROUBLESHOOTING         FUTURE WORK               Overview       Today's energy-efficient windows can dramatically lower the     heating and cooling costs associated with windows while increasing occupant comfort and     minimizing window surface condensation problems. However, consumers are often confused     about how to pick the most efficient window for a residence. Product information typically     offers window properties: U-factors or R-values, Solar Heat Gain Coefficients or Shading     Coefficients, and air leakage rates. However, the relative importance of these properties     depends on site- and building-specific conditions. Furthermore, these properties are based     on static evaluation conditions that are very different from the real situation a window     will be used in.        A computer tool such as RESFEN can help     consumers and builders pick the most energy-efficient and cost-effective window for a     given application, whether it is a new home, an addition, or a window replacement. It     calculates heating and cooling energy use and associated costs as well as peak heating and     cooling demand for specific window products. Users define a specific ""scenario""     by specifying house type (single-story or two-story), geographic location, orientation,     electricity and gas cost, and building configuration details (such as wall, floor, and     HVAC system type). Users also specify size, shading, and thermal properties of the window     they wish to investigate. The thermal properties that RESFEN requires are: U-factor, Solar     Heat Gain Coefficient, and air leakage rate. RESFEN calculates the energy and cost     implications of the window compared to an insulated wall. The relative energy and cost     impacts of two different windows can be compared.       RESFEN 3.0 was a major improvement over previous versions because it     performs hourly calculations using a version of the DOE 2.1E (LBL 1980, Winkelmann et al.     1993) energy analysis simulation program. RESFEN 3.1 incorporates additional improvements     including input assumptions for the base case buildings taken from the National     Fenestration Rating Council (NFRC) Annual Energy Subcommittee's efforts.        Changes     from RESFEN 3.0       The significant changes that differentiate RESFEN     3.1 from RESFEN 3.0 are listed below. Some of these changes affect program results.     Engineering judgement suggests that the results obtained from RESFEN 3.1 are more accurate     than the results from version 3.0. As a result, it is strongly recommended that all users     switch to version 3.1.                                                 Whole House Results:  RESFEN 3.0 evaluated the         energy impact of windows compared to a windowless insulated wall. In RESFEN 3.1, analysis         results for the whole house (energy consumption from all the envelope components of the         building, including windows on all orientations, walls, roofs, and foundations) are also         presented. Whole house results are calculated during a DOE2 simulation that is         automatically generated by RESFEN when you press either of the calculation buttons.         Results for only windows, by orientation, are still included and are useful for looking at         specific cases where different windows may perform more efficiently depending on the         direction they are facing. See Section 4.7, ""Results"" for more information on         this feature.                                                       NFRC Input Assumptions:  For each set of RESFEN 3.1         results, many input assumptions are made including insulation levels in the building         envelope and HVAC equipment efficiencies. The assumptions in RESFEN 3.1 are the same as         those used in the National Fenestration Rating Council (NFRC) Annual Energy Rating         Subcommittee efforts. These assumptions are documented in Table 6.2.                                                       Building Floor Area:  It is now possible to input the floor         area of the building being modeled, up to 4,000 square feet. Many assumptions, such as         wall area, internal gain, infiltration rates, and internal mass, depend on the floor area,         and the program automatically changes these values when the floor area changes.                                                       Location-based Defaults:  The following values are defaulted         based on location: foundation type, electricity cost, and gas cost. The foundation types         that appear in the Foundation List depend on location, reflecting that common building         practice is different based on geographical areas.                                                       Skylights:  A column has been added in the Window Data         section for skylights. These are modeled as vertical glazing in the roof of the building,         with solar heat gain reduced by 50% to account for skylight-well effects. This correction         factor is a placeholder; research is ongoing to improve the skylight well solar gain         correction.                                                       Toolbar:  A toolbar has been added below the menu for the         most commonly used functions, including  Print  and  Calc . See  Section 4          for a more complete description.                                                                       File Format:  The format and name of the RESFEN input files         has changed from RESFEN 3.0. The extension for RESFEN 3.1 is ""RSF"" rather than         ""BSE"". RESFEN 3.1 can read BSE files but RESFEN 3.0 cannot read the RESFEN 3.1         RSF files. If you open a RESFEN 3.0 BSE file check the input values very carefully because         some of the information may not translate correctly, in particular the Solar Gain         Reduction choices, the electricity and gas costs, the house type, and foundation type.
