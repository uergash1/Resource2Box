Although there are a number of different types of credentials for paralegals, and, therefore, variations in the lengths and types of coursework which one must successfully complete in order to receive his or her credentials, they all have the common purpose of educating the individual to take on an important role in the legal field.  This education gaining the knowledge necessary to do the job, and the skills necessary in order to be able to put it into practical use.  Both aspects of one's education are equally important.      Basic paralegal training generally consists of an overview of the legal system as a whole, specialized areas of practice, and the skills which are applicable to this line of work.  Don't make the mistake of letting this brief description give you the idea that there is anything vague or minimal about paralegal training, however, because the coursework is very complete, and quite intense.  It is also one of the most interesting and enjoyable types of coursework that you can possibly put your time into studying!    After you have completed basic paralegal coursework, you will have learned nearly everything that there is to know about the American courts and justice system.  This includes the history of this system, how it evolved into the way it is today, and details surrounding how the courts and justice system operates both in terms of the laws and the roles of legal representation.  You will also learn the fascinating details about codes, procedure, both the criminal and civil arenas, and how all of these things are applicable to the workings of the courts and justice system as a whole.      During your paralegal training you will also become very well acquainted with specialized areas of law.  Business, family, corporate, tax, family, and other specialties are covered in detail.  Not only will you learn what these areas are about, but you will also be taught everything you will need to do on an everyday basis if you elect to work in any of these areas.  You will not simply learn about the area you may wish to enter, you will be equally prepared for them all.    As working in the paralegal field requires one to be more than competent in a number of essential skills, you will enhance the skills you do have and prepare yourself with the others.  Working with computer programs, math, written and verbal communication skills, are all basic parts of a paralegal's everyday work life.  You will need to know how to conduct interviews, use spreadsheets, operate data bases, and other essentials;  all of these skills and many more will be addressed in your coursework.    Whichever method you choose to begin your studies, whichever specific type of credentials you wish to work toward, the period of time it will take for you to earn your credentials, or the individual school that you elect to study from, you can be completely assured that after you have successfully completed your training you will be well-informed and well-prepared to begin your exciting new career as a paralegal!                                                                                                                                                          Social bookmarking     Use our one click automatic submission service to bookmark this page     with your favorite social bookmarking services!

clueweb09-enwp00-65-13006	"                     Fair Credit Reporting Act          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia        (Redirected from  FCRA )            Jump to:  navigation ,  search          The  Fair Credit Reporting Act  (FCRA) is an  American  federal  law  (codified at  15 U.S.C.    1681  et seq.) that regulates the collection, dissemination, and use of consumer credit information. ( Full Statute  (PDF).)] Along with the  Fair Debt Collection Practices Act  (FDCPA), it forms the base of consumer credit rights in the United States. It was originally passed in 1970, [ 1 ]  and is enforced by the US  Federal Trade Commission .           Contents       1   Consumer reporting agencies   2   Information furnishers   3   Users of the information for credit, insurance, or employment purposes   4   Likelihood of errors on a credit report   5   Civil liability for willful or negligent violations of the FCRA   6   Which companies are regulated by the FCRA?   7   See also   8   External links   9   References               [ edit ]   Consumer reporting agencies   Consumer reporting agencies  (CRAs) are entities that collect and disseminate information about consumers to be used for credit evaluation and certain other purposes. Credit bureaus, a type of consumer reporting agency, hold a consumer's  credit report  in their databases. CRAs have a number of responsibilities under FCRA, including the following:     Provide a consumer with information about him or her in the agency's files and to take steps to verify the accuracy of information disputed by a consumer. Under the  Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act  (FACTA), an amendment to the FCRA passed in 2003, consumers are able to receive one free credit report a year. [ 2 ]  The free report can be requested by telephone, mail, or through the government-authorized website,  annualcreditreport.com . [ 3 ]   If negative information is removed as a result of a consumer's dispute, it may not be reinserted without notifying the consumer within five days, in writing.   CRAs may not retain negative information for an excessive period. The FCRA describes how long negative information, such as late payments,  bankruptcies ,  tax liens  or  judgments  may stay on a consumer's credit report  typically seven years from the date of the delinquency. The exceptions:  bankruptcies  (10 years) and  tax liens  (seven years from the time they are paid).     The three big CRAs   Experian ,  TransUnion , and  Equifax   do not interact with information furnishers directly as a result of consumer disputes. They use a system called  E-Oscar . In some areas of the country, however, there are other credit bureaus. For example, in Texas, if a consumer tries to dispute information with Equifax directly, they must go through CSC Credit Services which is linked to the Equifax database.     [ edit ]   Information furnishers   An information furnisher, as defined by the FCRA, is a company that provides information to consumer reporting agencies. Typically, these are  creditors , with which a consumer has some sort of credit agreement ( credit card  companies,  auto  finance companies and  mortgage banking  institutions, to name a few). However, other examples of information furnishers are collection agencies (third-party collectors), state or municipal  courts  reporting a  judgment  of some kind, past and present employers and bonders. Under the FCRA, these information furnishers may only report to a consumer's credit report under the following guidelines:     They must provide complete and accurate information to the  credit reporting agencies .   The duty to  investigate  disputed information from consumers falls on them, and they must correct an error, or explain why the credit report is correct within 90 days of receipt of notice of a dispute.   They must inform consumers about negative information which has been or is about to be placed on a consumer's credit report within 30 days.     (This notice doesn't have to be sent as a separate notice, but may be placed on a consumer's monthly statement. If sent as part as the monthly statement, it needs to be conspicuous, but need not be in bold type. Required wording (developed by the US Federal Treasury Department):   Notice before negative information is reported :  We may report information about your account to credit bureaus. Late payments, missed payments, or other defaults on your account may be reflected in your credit report.   Notice after negative information is reported :  We have told a credit bureau about a late payment, missed payment or other default on your account. This information may be reflected in your credit report. )     [ edit ]   Users of the information for credit, insurance, or employment purposes   Users of the information for  credit ,  insurance , or employment purposes (including  background checks ) have the following responsibilities under the FCRA:     They must notify the consumer when an adverse action is taken on the basis of such reports.   Users must identify the company that provided the report, so that the accuracy and completeness of the report may be verified or contested by the consumer.       [ edit ]   Likelihood of errors on a credit report   Some fraction of consumer credit reports contain errors. A study released by the U.S.  Public Interest Research Group  in June 2004 found that 79% of the consumer credit reports surveyed contained some kind of error or mistake. [ 4 ]  However, the General Accountability Office released a study disputing US PIRG numbers. [ 5 ]  In 2007, the Consumer Data Industry Association which represents the credit bureaus testified that less than two percent of 52 million credit reports had data deleted because it was in error.  [ 6 ]  Many consumers frequently invoke their rights under the FCRA to review and correct their credit reports.   The  Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act  (""FACTA"") of 2003 has allowed easier access to consumers wishing to view their reports and dispute items.     [ edit ]   Civil liability for willful or negligent violations of the FCRA   Under  616 of the Act, ( 15 U.S.C.    1681n ), a consumer may recover either actual damages or a minimum of $100 and a maximum of $1000 plus punitive damages and reasonable attorney's fees and costs for willful noncompliance with the Act. Under  617 of the Act, ( 15 U.S.C.    1681o ), recovery for a negligent violation is of actual damages, plus attorney's fees. Under  618, a consumer may file suit in state or federal court to enforce the Act, and the statute of limitations is the earlier of 2 years from discovery and 5 years from the violation. ( 15 U.S.C.    1681p .)     [ edit ]   Which companies are regulated by the FCRA?   While putative database companies like  Lexis ,  Westlaw ,  ChoicePoint , and  eFunds  (owner of  ChexSystems ) do  not  create credit reports, they may gather the same types of information and as a result may subject some of their actions to FCRA.   An excerpt of the  1999 FTC advisory opinion  states:     An entity that meets the definitional requirement for a ""consumer reporting agency"" (CRA) in Section 603(f) of the FCRA is covered by the law even if the only information it collects, maintains, and disseminates is obtained from ""public record"" sources.       Section 603(f) defines a ""consumer reporting agency"" as any person ""which, for monetary fees, dues, or on a cooperative nonprofit basis, regularly engages in whole or in part in the practice of assembling or evaluating consumer credit information or other information ... for the purpose of furnishing consumer reports to third parties ..."". In turn, Section 603(d) defines a ""consumer report"" as the communication of ""any information"" by a CRA that bears on a consumer's ""credit worthiness, credit standing, credit capacity, character, general reputation, personal characteristics, or mode of living"" that is ""used or expected to be used or collected in whole or in part"" for the purpose of serving as a factor in establishing eligibility for credit or insurance to be used primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, employment purposes, or any other purpose authorized under Section 604.       If the commercial service you describe regularly provides information for the purposes set forth in the definition of consumer report in Section 603(d), the agency is a consumer reporting agency and the information it collects from public record sources and maintains in its computerized files is subject to the FCRA.

Stan Herring P.C. assist clients in correcting their credit report, going through the dispute process, and with claims under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA).    For information about our services and our commitment to our clients, please visit our  Firm Overview  page.    The Fair Credit Reporting Act    The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) was enacted to regulate the collection, dissemination, and use of consumer credit information, as well as outline the dispute process. According to a Consumer Reports article, approximately 70% of the credit reports contain errors.    Because errors in a credit report can severely impact your credit score and your ability to obtain credit, get an auto or home loan, and, in some cases, insurance or your employability, you need to take the appropriate steps to correct any credit report errors. These steps include notifying the credit reporting agency (Equifax, Experian, and Trans Union) of the discrepancy and proof that the report is wrong.    ""In 1970, Congress created the Fair Credit Reporting Act, a law which gives consumers specific rights in dealing with Consumer Reporting Agencies. The Fair Credit Reporting Act protects you by requiring that Consumer Reporting Agencies furnish correct and complete information to businesses for use in evaluating your application for credit, insurance, or a job.""   Consumer Guide to Credit Reporting.    In many cases, there are errors in credit reports for consumers who have successfully completed their bankruptcy. Please visit our  Incorrect Credit Reporting after Bankruptcy  page for more information on this subject.

Causes of Credit Report Errors    There can be many causes of credit reporting errors.

Fair Credit Reporting Act Claims    Before you can file a claim for inaccurate information on your credit report, you must inform the agency or agencies of the error and send proof of the error in the form of a dispute letter. We can assist you in drafting a dispute letter or you can do it yourself. You must send the letter certified mail so you have a record of the letter being mailed.

We help people who have been victimized by identity theft with their credit issues. We are not credit repair attorneys, but we can help you with your credit issues.

Under the  law, individuals, businesses and governments may not violate a persons civil  rights. If they do so anyway, that person has the right to sue the entity that  violated his or her rights to correct the wrong, and for any financial damages  that result. Civil rights lawyers help victims of civil rights violations file  and pursue these lawsuits.   Civil rights law in the United States is most often  associated with laws protecting certain groups of people from discrimination. However,  everyone -- regardless of race, gender, income or other factors -- has civil  rights.                                                                                    WHAT CIVIL RIGHTS ARE IN THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION?                     The U.S. Constitution outlines civil rights that the  government may not interfere with. The Bill of Rights, which are the first ten amendments  to the Constitution, outlines these basic rights, among others:                         Free       speech, freedom of the press, freedom of religion and freedom of assembly       and association.                       Keep       and use firearms.                       Be       free of unauthorized or unreasonable searches and seizure of property.                       Not be       forced to testify against yourself, not be tried twice for the same crime,       and to have fair compensation if the government takes your property.                       Have a       speedy and public trial by jury if accused of a crime, and be read your       Miranda rights at arrest.                        Have a       trial by jury when sued.                       Be       free of cruel and unusual punishment, and have bail available.                                                               Later Constitutional amendments added the civil rights to:                                           Be       free of enslavement.                       Be       considered a citizen if born in the United States, and be free of       interference in your civil rights by the states.                       Have       the right to vote regardless of color, race or previous status as a slave.                       Have       the right to vote regardless of sex.                       Have       the right to vote regardless of whether you paid a poll tax.                       Have       the right to vote if you are at least 18 years old.                                         There are also implied rights that come from judges interpretation  of the Constitution, such as the right to privacy found in the 1965 Supreme  Court decision in  Griswold v. Connecticut .  Many rights have been provided by courts in this matter.                                                             WHAT ARE SOME OTHER MAJOR FEDERAL CIVIL RIGHTS LAWS?                     Major civil rights legislation passed by Congress includes:                         The       Civil Rights Act of 1964. This landmark bill was intended to help African       Americans become equal citizens, but includes religion, sex and national       origin in the groups it protects from employment discrimination. It prohibits       discrimination by businesses that serve the public; state and local       governments; entities that receive federal money; and employers. It also       authorized the federal government to sue to desegregate public schools,       and required equal application of voter registration requirements.                       The       Voting Rights Act of 1965. This bill ended literacy tests at the polls and       prohibited other devices that could be used to disenfranchise minority       voters.                       The       Equal Pay Act of 1963, which requires employers to give the same pay to       men and women who do the same jobs.                       The       Fair Housing Act, which prohibits discrimination in selling, renting or       financing housing on the basis of race, color, sex, national origin,       religion, family status and disability.                       The       Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, which protects people over       40 from discrimination based on their age.                       The       Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, which requires accommodations for       disabled people in public and at work, and prohibits disability-based       discrimination.                                                                                 DO STATES PROTECT  THEIR CITIZENS CIVIL RIGHTS?                     All states have some form of civil rights legislation, including  civil rights written into state constitutions. Frequently, a state has multiple  laws protecting citizens civil rights. These laws prohibit discrimination in  the same ways that federal anti-discrimination laws do, but often apply to a  broader group of people and organizations. For example, most prohibit  discrimination by state and local governments, which are not included in many  federal civil rights laws.   States can, and sometimes do, give their citizens civil  rights beyond what federal law allows. For example, 17 states prohibit  discrimination based on sexual orientation.                                                              WHAT CIVIL RIGHTS LAWS APPLY TO CRIMINAL CASES?                     If you are accused of a crime, you have the right to:                                                                  Have       your rights read to you. These rights are sometimes called your Miranda       rights, after the court case that made them mandatory.                       Have       non-excessive bail set.                        Have a       grand jury decide whether you should be indicted.                       Be free       of unreasonable searches and seizures of property. That is, law       enforcement must have a warrant.                       Be       free of cruel and unusual punishment. Courts still debate what is       considered cruel and unusual.                       Have a       trial by a jury of fellow citizens.                       Have a       speedy trial in public.                       Not be       compelled to testify against yourself. This is the right to take the       Fifth.                       Not to       be tried twice for the same crime, which is sometimes called double       jeopardy.                       Seek       relief from unlawful imprisonment. You do this with a writ of  habeas corpus .                                                                                                     WHAT SHOULD I DO IF I THINK MY CIVIL RIGHTS WERE VIOLATED?                     If you believe your civil rights were violated, you should  save as much paperwork and other written information as possible thats related  to the incident. If there is a state or federal government agency that can  help, such as the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, you should contact  that agency to discuss your case, and bring the documentation. In some cases,  you can also try complaining directly to the person or organization that  violated your rights. However, this can sometimes lead to illegal retaliation  against you.                                            If you cant find a remedy directly or through an agency,  you should contact a civil rights lawyer. Bring your documentation to show the  civil rights lawyer, and try to answer all of his or her questions as  thoroughly as possible. If the civil rights lawyer agrees to represent you, you  will file a lawsuit against the person or entity that violated your rights. In  a civil rights lawsuit, you can win back any financial losses, reinstatement of  a job or property that was taken and other damages. In a criminal case, winning  a civil rights case can mean freedom even if youve been convicted.                                                                                    PAYMENT                     Civil rights lawyers usually work on contingency. That means  they dont ask for lawyers fees up front; instead, they take a percentage of  clients winnings. You should agree in advance with your civil rights lawyer on  what this percentage will be. If you dont win the case, the civil rights lawyer  doesnt get paid at all. This allows civil rights lawyers to represent  individuals who might not be able to afford to pay a lawyer throughout a long  case.                                            Some civil rights lawyers are public interest lawyers, which  means they work for nonprofit organizations seeking to serve low-income people,  or which seek to advance a point of view. These organizations will not ask for  payment, or ask only for very little payment. However, because they dont have  much money, they must be extremely selective about which cases they take.

Civil Rights Acts       Also found in:  Wikipedia  0.04 sec.         Federal legislation enacted by Congress over the course of a century beginning with the post-Civil War era that implemented and extended the fundamental guarantees of the Constitution to all citizens of the United States, regardless of their race, color, age, or religion.   The Civil Rights Acts of 1866 (14 Stat. 27) and 1870 (16 Stat. 140) were enacted to give newly freed slaves the same rights under federal law as those afforded to non-slaves. Such rights were the rights to sue and be sued, the rights to own real and  Personal Property , and the rights to testify and present evidence in legal proceedings. Serious questions existed, however, as to the constitutionality of the 1866 act and to whether Congress actually had authority to enact such a measure. Subsequent to the passage of the  Fourteenth Amendment  in 1868, Congress reenacted the act pursuant to its power under the amendment to enforce the amendment through appropriate legislation. The Civil Rights Act of 1866 was, therefore, superseded by the  Civil Rights  Act of 1870.   In 1875 Congress passed a third Civil Rights Act (18 Stat. 336) in response to the refusal of many whites who owned public establishments, inns, railroads, and other facilities to make them equally available to blacks. The Civil Rights Act of 1875 prohibited  racial discrimination  in such places and guaranteed ""full and equal enjoyment"" of such places.   Violations of this act abounded and criminal prosecutions ensued. A number of convictions were appealed to the  Supreme Court of the United States  which in 1883 declared the act unconstitutional in the  civil rights cases,  109 U.S. 3, 3 S. Ct. 18, 27 L. Ed. 835. The Court reasoned that the social rights that the act safeguarded were not civil rights and, therefore, Congress was powerless to legislate on the social conduct of private individuals. Following this decision, states began enacting  Segregation  into various laws, the most notorious of which were the  Jim Crow Laws . It took more than eighty years before Congress would again attempt to legislate in this area.   The Civil Rights Acts of 1957 represented congressional recognition that the federal government had to bring about an end to racial discrimination. The  civil rights commission  was established and the laws guaranteed qualified voters the right to vote, regardless of their color. In the years 1964 to 1968 Congress enacted extensive and far-reaching legislation affording blacks equal status under the law, ranging from full and free enjoyment of public accommodations and facilities to the prohibition of racial discrimination in employment as well as transactions affecting housing in the United States.   The Civil Rights Act of 1991 granted to victims of unlawful discrimination the right to seek money damages, jury trials, and back pay.

Most entrants have an associate's degree in paralegal studies,         or a bachelor's degree coupled with a certificate in paralegal         studies.          Employment is projected to grow much faster than average,         as employers try to reduce costs by hiring paralegals to perform         tasks formerly carried out by lawyers.          Competition for jobs should continue; experienced, formally         trained paralegals should have the best employment opportunities.                                                               Nature of the Work                                          Back to Top                             While lawyers assume ultimate responsibility for legal work,       they often delegate many of their tasks to paralegals. In fact,       paralegals—also called legal assistants—are continuing       to assume a growing range of tasks in the Nation's legal offices       and perform many of the same tasks as lawyers. Nevertheless,       they are still explicitly prohibited from carrying out duties       that are considered to be the practice of law, such as setting       legal fees, giving legal advice, and presenting cases in court.          One of a paralegal's most important tasks is helping lawyers       prepare for closings, hearings, trials, and corporate meetings.       Paralegals investigate the facts of cases and ensure that all       relevant information is considered. They also identify appropriate       laws, judicial decisions, legal articles, and other materials       that are relevant to assigned cases. After they analyze and organize       the information, paralegals may prepare written reports that       attorneys use in determining how cases should be handled. Should       attorneys decide to file lawsuits on behalf of clients, paralegals       may help prepare the legal arguments, draft pleadings and motions       to be filed with the court, obtain affidavits, and assist attorneys       during trials. Paralegals also organize and track files of all       important case documents and make them available and easily accessible       to attorneys.          In addition to this preparatory work, paralegals perform a       number of other vital functions. For example, they help draft       contracts, mortgages, separation agreements, and instruments       of trust. They also may assist in preparing tax returns and planning       estates. Some paralegals coordinate the activities of other law       office employees and maintain financial office records. Various       additional tasks may differ, depending on the employer.          Paralegals are found in all types of organizations, but most       are employed by law firms, corporate legal departments, and various       government offices. In these organizations, they can work in       many different areas of the law, including litigation, personal       injury, corporate law, criminal law, employee benefits, intellectual       property, labor law, bankruptcy, immigration, family law, and       real estate. As the law has become more complex, paralegals have       responded by becoming more specialized. Within specialties, functions       often are broken down further so that paralegals may deal with       a specific area. For example, paralegals specializing in labor       law may concentrate exclusively on employee benefits.          The duties of paralegals also differ widely with the type       of organization in which they are employed. Paralegals who work       for corporations often assist attorneys with employee contracts,       shareholder agreements, stock-option plans, and employee benefit       plans. They also may help prepare and file annual financial reports,       maintain corporate minutes' record resolutions, and prepare forms       to secure loans for the corporation. Paralegals often monitor       and review government regulations to ensure that the corporation       is aware of new requirements and is operating within the law.       Increasingly, experienced paralegals are assuming additional       supervisory responsibilities such as overseeing team projects       and serving as a communications link between the team and the       corporation.          The duties of paralegals who work in the public sector usually       vary within each agency. In general, paralegals analyze legal       material for internal use, maintain reference files, conduct       research for attorneys, and collect and analyze evidence for       agency hearings. They may prepare informative or explanatory       material on laws, agency regulations, and agency policy for general       use by the agency and the public. Paralegals employed in community       legal-service projects help the poor, the aged, and others who       are in need of legal assistance. They file forms, conduct research,       prepare documents, and, when authorized by law, may represent       clients at administrative hearings.          Paralegals in small and medium-size law firms usually perform       a variety of duties that require a general knowledge of the law.       For example, they may research judicial decisions on improper       police arrests or help prepare a mortgage contract. Paralegals       employed by large law firms, government agencies, and corporations,       however, are more likely to specialize in one aspect of the law.          Familiarity with computers use and technical knowledge have       become essential to paralegal work. Computer software packages       and the Internet are used to search legal literature stored in       computer databases and on CD-ROM. In litigation involving many       supporting documents, paralegals usually use computer databases       to retrieve, organize, and index various materials. Imaging software       allows paralegals to scan documents directly into a database,       while billing programs help them to track hours billed to clients.       Computer software packages also are used to perform tax computations       and explore the consequences of various tax strategies for clients.                                                        Working Conditions                                          Back to Top                             Paralegals employed by corporations and government usually       work a standard 40-hour week. Although most paralegals work year       round, some are temporarily employed during busy times of the       year and then are released when the workload diminishes. Paralegals       who work for law firms sometimes work very long hours when they       are under pressure to meet deadlines. Some law firms reward such       loyalty with bonuses and additional time off.          These workers handle many routine assignments, particularly       when they are inexperienced. As they gain experience, paralegals       usually assume more varied tasks with additional responsibility.       Paralegals do most of their work at desks in offices and law       libraries. Occasionally, they travel to gather information and       perform other duties.                                                        Training, Other Qualifications,             and Advancement                                          Back to Top                             There are several ways to become a paralegal. The most common       is through a community college paralegal program that leads to       an associate's degree. The other common method of entry, mainly       for those who already have a college degree, is through a program       that leads to a certification in paralegal studies. A small number       of schools also offer bachelor's and master's degrees in paralegal       studies. Some employers train paralegals on the job, hiring college       graduates with no legal experience or promoting experienced legal       secretaries. Other entrants have experience in a technical field       that is useful to law firms, such as a background in tax preparation       for tax and estate practice or in criminal justice, nursing,       or health administration for personal injury practice.          An estimated 1,000 colleges and universities, law schools,       and proprietary schools offer formal paralegal training programs.       Approximately 260 paralegal programs are approved by the American       Bar Association (ABA). Although many programs do not require       such approval, graduation from an ABA-approved program can enhance       one's employment opportunities. The requirements for admission       to these programs vary. Some require certain college courses       or a bachelor's degree, others accept high school graduates or       those with legal experience, and a few schools require standardized       tests and personal interviews.          Paralegal programs include 2-year associate degree's programs,       4-year bachelor's degree programs, and certificate programs that       can take only a few months to complete. Most certificate programs       provide intensive and, in some cases, specialized paralegal training       for individuals who already hold college degrees, while associate's       and bachelor's degree programs usually combine paralegal training       with courses in other academic subjects. The quality of paralegal       training programs varies; the better programs usually include       job placement services. Programs generally offer courses introducing       students to the legal applications of computers, including how       to perform legal research on the Internet. Many paralegal training       programs also offer an internship in which students gain practical       experience by working for several months in a private law firm,       the office of a public defender or attorney general, a bank,       a corporate legal department, a legal aid organization, or a       government agency. Experience gained in internships is an asset       when one is seeking a job after graduation. Prospective students       should examine the experiences of recent graduates before enrolling       in a paralegal program.          Although most employers do not require certification, earning       a voluntary certificate from a professional society may offer       advantages in the labor market. The National Association of Legal       Assistants (NALA), for example, has established standards for       certification requiring various combinations of education and       experience. Paralegals who meet these standards are eligible       to take a 2-day examination, given three times each year at several       regional testing centers. Those who pass this examination may       use the Certified Legal Assistant (CLA) designation. The NALA       also offers an advanced paralegal certification for those who       want to specialize in other areas of the law. In addition, the       Paralegal Advanced Competency Exam, administered through the       National Federation of Paralegal Associations, offers professional       recognition to paralegals with a bachelor's degree and at least       2 years of experience. Those who pass this examination may use       the Registered Paralegal (RP) designation.          Paralegals must be able to document and present their findings       and opinions to their supervising attorney. They need to understand       legal terminology and have good research and investigative skills.       Familiarity with the operation and applications of computers       in legal research and litigation support also is important. Paralegals       should stay informed of new developments in the laws that affect       their area of practice. Participation in continuing legal education       seminars allows paralegals to maintain and expand their knowledge       of the law.          Because paralegals frequently deal with the public, they should       be courteous and uphold the ethical standards of the legal profession.       The National Association of Legal Assistants, the National Federation       of Paralegal Associations, and a few States have established       ethical guidelines for paralegals to follow.          Paralegals usually are given more responsibilities and require       less supervision as they gain work experience. Experienced paralegals       who work in large law firms, corporate legal departments, or       government agencies may supervise and delegate assignments to       other paralegals and clerical staff. Advancement opportunities       also include promotion to managerial and other law-related positions       within the firm or corporate legal department. However, some       paralegals find it easier to move to another law firm when seeking       increased responsibility or advancement.                                                        Employment                                          Back to Top                             Paralegals and legal assistants held about 224,000 jobs in       2004. Private law firms employed 7 out of 10 paralegals and legal       assistants; most of the remainder worked for corporate legal       departments and various levels of government. Within the Federal       Government, the U.S. Department of Justice is the largest employer,       followed by the Social Security Administration and the U.S. Department       of the Treasury. A small number of paralegals own their own businesses       and work as freelance legal assistants, contracting their services       to attorneys or corporate legal departments.                                                        Job Outlook                                          Back to Top                             Employment for paralegals and legal assistants is projected       to grow much faster than average for all occupations through       2014. Employers are trying to reduce costs and increase the availability       and efficiency of legal services by hiring paralegals to perform       tasks formerly carried out by lawyers. Besides new jobs created       by employment growth, additional job openings will arise as people       leave the occupation. Despite projections of rapid employment       growth, competition for jobs should continue as many people seek       to go into this profession; however, experienced, formally trained       paralegals should have the best employment opportunities.          Private law firms will continue to be the largest employers       of paralegals, but a growing array of other organizations, such       as corporate legal departments, insurance companies, real estate       and title insurance firms, and banks hire paralegals. Corporations       in particular are boosting their in-house legal departments to       cut costs. Demand for paralegals also is expected to grow as       an expanding population increasingly requires legal services,       especially in areas such as intellectual property, health care,       international law, elder issues, criminal law, and environmental       law. Paralegals who specialize in areas such as real estate,       bankruptcy, medical malpractice, and product liability should       have ample employment opportunities. The growth of prepaid legal       plans also should contribute to the demand for legal services.       Paralegal employment is expected to increase as organizations       presently employing paralegals assign them a growing range of       tasks and as paralegals are increasingly employed in small and       medium-size establishments. A growing number of experienced paralegals       are expected to establish their own businesses.          Job opportunities for paralegals will expand in the public       sector as well. Community legal-service programs, which provide       assistance to the poor, elderly, minorities, and middle-income       families, will employ additional paralegals to minimize expenses       and serve the most people. Federal, State, and local government       agencies, consumer organizations, and the courts also should       continue to hire paralegals in increasing numbers.          To a limited extent, paralegal jobs are affected by the business       cycle. During recessions, demand declines for some discretionary       legal services, such as planning estates, drafting wills, and       handling real estate transactions. Corporations are less inclined       to initiate certain types of litigation when falling sales and       profits lead to fiscal belt tightening. As a result, full-time       paralegals employed in offices adversely affected by a recession       may be laid off or have their work hours reduced. However, during       recessions, corporations and individuals are more likely to face       other problems that require legal assistance, such as bankruptcies,       foreclosures, and divorces. Paralegals, who provide many of the       same legal services as lawyers at a lower cost, tend to fare       relatively better in difficult economic conditions.                                                        Earnings                                          Back to Top                             Earnings of paralegals and legal assistants vary greatly.       Salaries depend on education, training, experience, the type       and size of employer, and the geographic location of the job.       In general, paralegals who work for large law firms or in large       metropolitan areas earn more than those who work for smaller       firms or in less populated regions. In addition to earning a       salary, many paralegals receive bonuses. In May 2004, full-time       wage and salary paralegals and legal assistants had median annual       earnings, including bonuses, of $39,130. The middle 50 percent       earned between $31,040 and $49,950. The top 10 percent earned       more than $61,390, while the bottom 10 percent earned less than       $25,360. Median annual earnings in the industries employing the       largest numbers of paralegals in May 2004 were as follows:                                Federal Government              $59,370                                  Local government             38,260                                  Legal services              37,870                                  State government             34,910                                               Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics                                                 Back to Main Page

Sign Up Discuss  in my Forum   Paralegal Programs and Education A Guide to Paralegal Programs and Paralegal Education By  Sally Kane , About.com    See More About: paralegal careers paralegal certification paralegal skills lawyer education hot legal jobs                Paralegal educational programs in the United States vary considerably in length and substance. Although regulation is a hot topic nationally, the paralegal profession is presently not regulated (with the exception of the state of California) and individuals using the titles “paralegal” and “legal assistant” are not required to be licensed or to meet any specific educational or experiential qualifications.     Types of Paralegal Programs     According to the American Bar Association, over 1,000 institutions across the United States offer formal paralegal education programs leading to either a degree or certificate.  These programs include:     Home study and on-line paralegal programs (not recommended)  Associates degrees offered by two-year community and junior colleges   Certificate programs offered by business and proprietary schools, ranging from several months to a year in length    Four-year college and university programs offering degrees in paralegal studies  Advanced degree programs offering masters degrees in paralegal studies, legal administration or legal studies      Paralegal Coursework     According to the    American Association for Paralegal Education , quality paralegal education programs assist students in acquiring these essential related competencies:    critical thinking skills (analysis, judgment, research, and problem-solving);   communication skills (oral, written, non-verbal, and interpersonal);   computer skills;   computational skills;   understanding of ethics; and   organizational skills.     Paralegal prgrams should also give paralelegals a basic understanding of American history, business and political systems.    Most paralegal educational programs incorporate an academic curriculum comprised of both substantive legal courses and professional skills that incorporates legal theory with an understanding of practical applications.   Typical substantive legal courses include: Introduction to the Legal System and Paralegalism, Ethics, Civil Litigation, Contracts, Torts, Real Estate Law, and Domestic Law.  Skills courses include Legal Writing, Legal Research and Case Analysis.  Many paralegal programs also require students to complete an internship with a legal employer in exchange for school credit.     ABA-Approval    The American Bar Association has established Guidelines for the Approval of Paralegal Education Programs to promote high standards of quality for the education of paralegals.  To become eligible for ABA approval, a paralegal program must have been in operation for a minimum of two academic years and satisfy all requirements of the ABA guidelines.  Schools that have obtained ABA approval must seek periodic reaccredidation. The ABA maintains a list of   ABA-approved paralegal programs .    Graduates of ABA-approved paralegal programs have a distinct advantage in the paralegal job market over graduates of non-approved programs because many employers use the ABA-approval as a way to select the best qualified candidates.     Your Ticket To Success    Paralegals with the following educational background have the most employment opportunities and the highest earning potential:     a four-year degree in paralegal studies (or related paralegal field);    a bachelors’ degree in any field combined with a paralegal certificate from a program approved by the American Bar Association; OR    a bachelors’ degree in any field combined with a master’s degree in paralegal studies or a related field.      While some paralegals in the legal market possess no formal education or obtained their education through home study or web-based paralegal programs, I would not recommend this path to those who are committed to a career as a paralegal.  As paralegal educational standards increase and employers become more selective, these educational backgrounds (or lack thereof) may seriously limit your employment opportunities and income potential.     If You Have Law School Aspirations    If you have aspirations of going to law school, the paralegal field is a great way to gain first-hand legal experience and insight into law practice.  However, you should note that a paralegal education is not the equivalent of a law school education and graduates of paralegal programs are not qualified or eligible to take the bar examination. Furthermore, academic credit for paralegal courses is not transferable for advanced standing in law school.     Paralegal Specialization     Some paralegal programs allow a paralegal to choose an  area of specialization .  Hot legal specialties for paralegals include complex litigation, corporate law, intellectual property, regulatory compliance and real estate, according to Charles A. Volkert, III, executive director of Robert Half Legal, a leading staffing service specializing in the placement of legal professionals.     Paralegal Certification    Paralegal certification (not to be confused with a paralegal certificate) is a growing national trend that confers special recognition to paralegals who have satisfied certain predetermined qualifications in the paralegal field.  While certification is not mandatory, it demonstrates a commitment to the field and may enhance your professional credibility and employment prospects.

About 7 out of 10 work for law firms; others work for corporate legal departments and government agencies.   Employment is projected to grow much faster than average, as employers try to reduce costs by hiring paralegals to perform tasks once done by lawyers.   Competition for jobs should continue; experienced, formally trained paralegals should have the best employment opportunities.                Nature of the Work     [ About this section ]       Back to Top            While lawyers assume ultimate responsibility for legal work, they often delegate many of their tasks to paralegals.  In fact, paralegals—also called legal assistants—are continuing to assume a growing range of tasks in legal offices and perform many of the same tasks as lawyers.  Nevertheless, they are explicitly prohibited from carrying out duties considered to be the practice of law, such as setting legal fees, giving legal advice, and presenting cases in court.    One of a paralegal’s most important tasks is helping lawyers prepare for closings, hearings, trials, and corporate meetings.  Paralegals might investigate the facts of cases and ensure that all relevant information is considered.  They also identify appropriate laws, judicial decisions, legal articles, and other materials that are relevant to assigned cases.  After they analyze and organize the information, paralegals may prepare written reports that attorneys use in determining how cases should be handled.  If attorneys decide to file lawsuits on behalf of clients, paralegals may help prepare the legal arguments, draft pleadings and motions to be filed with the court, obtain affidavits, and assist attorneys during trials.  Paralegals also organize and track files of all important case documents and make them available and easily accessible to attorneys.    In addition to this preparatory work, paralegals perform a number of other functions.  For example, they help draft contracts, mortgages, and separation agreements.  They also may assist in preparing tax returns, establishing trust funds, and planning estates.  Some paralegals coordinate the activities of other law office employees and maintain financial office records.      Computer software packages and the Internet are used to search legal literature stored in computer databases and on CD-ROM.  In litigation involving many supporting documents, paralegals usually use computer databases to retrieve, organize, and index various materials.  Imaging software allows paralegals to scan documents directly into a database, while billing programs help them to track hours billed to clients.  Computer software packages also are used to perform tax computations and explore the consequences of various tax strategies for clients.    Paralegals are found in all types of organizations, but most are employed by law firms, corporate legal departments, and various government offices.  In these organizations, they can work in many different areas of the law, including litigation, personal injury, corporate law, criminal law, employee benefits, intellectual property, labor law, bankruptcy, immigration, family law, and real estate.  As the law becomes more complex, paralegals become more specialized.  Within specialties, functions are often broken down further.  For example, paralegals specializing in labor law may concentrate exclusively on employee benefits.  In small and medium-size law firms, duties are often more general.    The tasks of paralegals differ widely according to the type of organization for which they work.  A corporate paralegal often assists attorneys with employee contracts, shareholder agreements, stock-option plans, and employee benefit plans.  They also may help prepare and file annual financial reports, maintain corporate minutes’ record resolutions, and prepare forms to secure loans for the corporation.  Corporate paralegals often monitor and review government regulations to ensure that the corporation is aware of new requirements and is operating within the law.  Increasingly, experienced corporate paralegals or paralegal managers are assuming additional supervisory responsibilities such as overseeing team projects.    The duties of paralegals who work in the public sector usually vary by agency.  In general, litigation paralegals analyze legal material for internal use, maintain reference files, conduct research for attorneys, and collect and analyze evidence for agency hearings.  They may prepare informative or explanatory material on laws, agency regulations, and agency policy for general use by the agency and the public.  Paralegals employed in community legal-service projects help the poor, the aged, and others who are in need of legal assistance.  They file forms, conduct research, prepare documents, and, when authorized by law, may represent clients at administrative hearings.    Work environment.  Paralegals handle many routine assignments, particularly when they are inexperienced.  As they gain experience, paralegals usually assume more varied tasks with additional responsibility.  Paralegals do most of their work in offices and law libraries.  Occasionally, they travel to gather information and perform other duties.    Paralegals employed by corporations and government usually work a standard 40-hour week.  Although most paralegals work year round, some are temporarily employed during busy times of the year and then released.  Paralegals who work for law firms sometimes work very long hours when under pressure to meet deadlines.                   Training, Other Qualifications, and Advancement     [ About this section ]       Back to Top            Most entrants have an associate degree in paralegal studies, or a bachelor’s degree coupled with a certificate in paralegal studies.  Some employers train paralegals on the job.    Education and training.  There are several ways to become a paralegal.  The most common is through a community college paralegal program that leads to an associate degree.  Another common method of entry, mainly for those who already have a college degree, is earning a certificate in paralegal studies.  A small number of schools offer a bachelor’s and master’s degree in paralegal studies.  Finally, some employers train paralegals on the job.      Associate and bachelor’s degree programs usually combine paralegal training with courses in other academic subjects.  Certificate programs vary significantly, with some only taking a few months to complete.  Most certificate programs provide intensive paralegal training for individuals who already hold college degrees.    About 1,000 colleges and universities, law schools, and proprietary schools offer formal paralegal training programs.  Approximately 260 paralegal programs are approved by the American Bar Association (ABA).  Although many employers do not require such approval, graduation from an ABA-approved program can enhance employment opportunities.  Admission requirements vary.  Some require certain college courses or a bachelor’s degree, while others accept high school graduates or those with legal experience.  A few schools require standardized tests and personal interviews.    The quality of paralegal training programs varies; some programs may include job placement services.  If possible, prospective students should examine the experiences of recent graduates before enrolling in a paralegal program.  Any training program usually includes courses in legal research and the legal applications of computers.  Many paralegal training programs also offer an internship in which students gain practical experience by working for several months in a private law firm, the office of a public defender or attorney general, a corporate legal department, a legal aid organization, a bank, or a government agency.  Internship experience is an asset when one is seeking a job after graduation.      Some employers train paralegals on the job, hiring college graduates with no legal experience or promoting experienced legal secretaries.  Other entrants have experience in a technical field that is useful to law firms, such as a background in tax preparation or criminal justice.  Nursing or health administration experience is valuable in personal injury law practices.    Certification and other qualifications.  Although most employers do not require certification, earning a voluntary certification from a professional society may offer advantages in the labor market.  The National Association of Legal Assistants (NALA), for example, has established standards for certification requiring various combinations of education and experience.  Paralegals who meet these standards are eligible to take a 2-day examination.  Those who pass the exam may use the Certified Legal Assistant (CLA) or Certified Paralegal (CP) credential.  The NALA also offers the Advanced Paralegal Certification for experienced paralegals who want to specialize.  The Advanced Paralegal Certification program is a curriculum based program offered on the Internet.    The American Alliance of Paralegals, Inc.  offers the American Alliance Certified Paralegal (AACP) credential, a voluntary certification program.  Paralegals seeking the AACP certification must possess at least five years of paralegal experience and meet one of the three educational criteria.  Certification must be renewed every two years, including the completion 18 hours of continuing education.    In addition, the National Federation of Paralegal Association offers the Registered Paralegal (RP) designation to paralegals with a bachelor’s degree and at least 2 years of experience who pass an exam.  To maintain the credential, workers must complete 12 hours of continuing education every 2 years.  The National Association for Legal Professionals offers the Professional Paralegal (PP) certification to those who pass a four-part exam.  Recertification requires 75 hours of continuing education.    Paralegals must be able to document and present their findings and opinions to their supervising attorney.  They need to understand legal terminology and have good research and investigative skills.  Familiarity with the operation and applications of computers in legal research and litigation support also is important.  Paralegals should stay informed of new developments in the laws that affect their area of practice.  Participation in continuing legal education seminars allows paralegals to maintain and expand their knowledge of the law.  In fact, all paralegals in California must complete 4 hours of mandatory continuing education in either general law or in a specialized area of law.    Because paralegals frequently deal with the public, they should be courteous and uphold the ethical standards of the legal profession.  The National Association of Legal Assistants, the National Federation of Paralegal Associations, and a few States have established ethical guidelines for paralegals to follow.    Advancement.  Paralegals usually are given more responsibilities and require less supervision as they gain work experience.  Experienced paralegals who work in large law firms, corporate legal departments, or government agencies may supervise and delegate assignments to other paralegals and clerical staff.  Advancement opportunities also include promotion to managerial and other law-related positions within the firm or corporate legal department.  However, some paralegals find it easier to move to another law firm when seeking increased responsibility or advancement.                 Employment     [ About this section ]       Back to Top            Paralegals and legal assistants held about 238,000 jobs in 2006.  Private law firms employed 7 out of 10 paralegals and legal assistants; most of the remainder worked for corporate legal departments and various levels of government.  Within the Federal Government, the U.S.  Department of Justice is the largest employer, followed by the Social Security Administration and the U.S.  Department of the Treasury.  A small number of paralegals own their own businesses and work as freelance legal assistants, contracting their services to attorneys or corporate legal departments.                 Job Outlook     [ About this section ]       Back to Top            Despite projected rapid employment growth, competition for jobs is expected to continue as many people seek to go into this profession; experienced, formally trained paralegals should have the best employment opportunities.    Employment change.  Employment of paralegals and legal assistants is projected to grow 22 percent between 2006 and 2016,  much  faster than the average  for all occupations.  Employers are trying to reduce costs and increase the availability and efficiency of legal services by hiring paralegals to perform tasks once done by lawyers.  Paralegals are performing a wider variety of duties, making them more useful to businesses.    Demand for paralegals also is expected to grow as an expanding population increasingly requires legal services, especially in areas such as intellectual property, health care, international law, elder issues, criminal law, and environmental law.  The growth of prepaid legal plans also should contribute to the demand for legal services.    Private law firms will continue to be the largest employers of paralegals, but a growing array of other organizations, such as corporate legal departments, insurance companies, real estate and title insurance firms, and banks also hire paralegals.  Corporations in particular are expected to increase their in-house legal departments to cut costs.  In part because of the range of tasks they can perform, paralegals are also increasingly employed in small and medium-size establishments of all types.    Job prospects.  In addition to new jobs created by employment growth, more job openings will arise as people leave the occupation.  There will be demand for paralegals who specialize in areas such as real estate, bankruptcy, medical malpractice, and product liability.  Community legal service programs, which provide assistance to the poor, elderly, minorities, and middle-income families, will employ additional paralegals to minimize expenses and serve the most people.  Job opportunities also are expected in Federal, State, and local government agencies, consumer organizations, and the courts.  However, this occupation attracts many applicants, creating competition for jobs.  Experienced, formally trained paralegals should have the best job prospects.    To a limited extent, paralegal jobs are affected by the business cycle.  During recessions, demand declines for some discretionary legal services, such as planning estates, drafting wills, and handling real estate transactions.  Corporations are less inclined to initiate certain types of litigation when falling sales and profits lead to fiscal belt tightening.  As a result, full-time paralegals employed in offices adversely affected by a recession may be laid off or have their work hours reduced.  However, during recessions, corporations and individuals are more likely to face problems that require legal assistance, such as bankruptcies, foreclosures, and divorces.  Paralegals, who provide many of the same legal services as lawyers at a lower cost, tend to fare relatively better in difficult economic conditions.

Earnings     [ About this section ]       Back to Top            Earnings of paralegals and legal assistants vary greatly.  Salaries depend on education, training, experience, the type and size of employer, and the geographic location of the job.  In general, paralegals who work for large law firms or in large metropolitan areas earn more than those who work for smaller firms or in less populated regions.  In May 2006, full-time wage-and-salary paralegals and legal assistants had median annual earnings, including bonuses, of $43,040.  The middle 50 percent earned between $33,920 and $54,690.  The top 10 percent earned more than $67,540, and the bottom 10 percent earned less than $27,450.  Median annual earnings in the industries employing the largest numbers of paralegals were:                     Federal Government   $56,080        Management of companies and enterprises   52,220        Local government   42,170        Legal services   41,460        State government   38,020                     In addition to earning a salary, many paralegals receive bonuses, in part, to compensate them for sometimes having to work long hours.  Paralegals also receive vacation, paid sick leave, a 401 savings plan, life insurance, personal paid time off, dental insurance, and reimbursement for continuing legal education.

Back to Top            Paralegals, or legal assistants, help lawyers in their work. They perform some of the same tasks as  lawyers. Paralegals do research to make  sure that lawyers know all of the important facts.   Paralegals look up laws and past  cases in books and on computers. Then,  they write reports that lawyers use to help prepare their cases. They also keep track of the documents related  to the case.     What paralegals do depends on where they work. For example, some paralegals help to write  contracts and mortgages. Some help to  prepare income tax returns and other financial documents.   Most paralegals work a typical 40-hour week. Most work year round, but some are only  employed during busy times of the year. In law firms, some paralegals work very  long hours. Most of their work is done  at desks in offices and law libraries.                        How do you get ready?       Back to Top             There are several ways to become a paralegal. Most people go to a community college for a  2-year degree. A few schools offer  bachelor's or master's degrees in paralegal studies. Some people become paralegals after getting a  bachelor’s degree in something other than paralegal studies.     Some people learn on the job. Sometimes,  legal secretaries become paralegals.    Paralegals need good research and writing skills. They should also be able to use computers. Paralegals often deal with the public, so they  should be polite. They also have to be  honest and ethical.    To start getting ready for this job, students can take English classes  to learn how to write and do research. Social  studies classes teach about research and the law. People who want to be paralegals need strong  reading skills.                        How much does this job pay?       Back to Top             The middle half of paralegals and legal  assistants earned between $33,920 and $54,690 in 2006. The lowest-paid 10 percent earned less than $27,450.  The highest-paid 10 percent earned more  than $67,540.    Earnings of paralegals vary greatly. People who work for large firms or  in big cities earn more.

About 7 out of 10 work for law firms; others work for corporate legal departments and government agencies.   Employment is projected to grow much faster than average, as employers try to reduce costs by hiring paralegals to perform tasks once done by lawyers.   Competition for jobs should continue; experienced, formally trained paralegals should have the best employment opportunities.                Nature of the Work     [ About this section ]       Back to Top            While lawyers assume ultimate responsibility for legal work, they often delegate many of their tasks to paralegals.  In fact, paralegals—also called legal assistants—are continuing to assume a growing range of tasks in legal offices and perform many of the same tasks as lawyers.  Nevertheless, they are explicitly prohibited from carrying out duties considered to be the practice of law, such as setting legal fees, giving legal advice, and presenting cases in court.    One of a paralegal’s most important tasks is helping lawyers prepare for closings, hearings, trials, and corporate meetings.  Paralegals might investigate the facts of cases and ensure that all relevant information is considered.  They also identify appropriate laws, judicial decisions, legal articles, and other materials that are relevant to assigned cases.  After they analyze and organize the information, paralegals may prepare written reports that attorneys use in determining how cases should be handled.  If attorneys decide to file lawsuits on behalf of clients, paralegals may help prepare the legal arguments, draft pleadings and motions to be filed with the court, obtain affidavits, and assist attorneys during trials.  Paralegals also organize and track files of all important case documents and make them available and easily accessible to attorneys.    In addition to this preparatory work, paralegals perform a number of other functions.  For example, they help draft contracts, mortgages, and separation agreements.  They also may assist in preparing tax returns, establishing trust funds, and planning estates.  Some paralegals coordinate the activities of other law office employees and maintain financial office records.      Computer software packages and the Internet are used to search legal literature stored in computer databases and on CD-ROM.  In litigation involving many supporting documents, paralegals usually use computer databases to retrieve, organize, and index various materials.  Imaging software allows paralegals to scan documents directly into a database, while billing programs help them to track hours billed to clients.  Computer software packages also are used to perform tax computations and explore the consequences of various tax strategies for clients.    Paralegals are found in all types of organizations, but most are employed by law firms, corporate legal departments, and various government offices.  In these organizations, they can work in many different areas of the law, including litigation, personal injury, corporate law, criminal law, employee benefits, intellectual property, labor law, bankruptcy, immigration, family law, and real estate.  As the law becomes more complex, paralegals become more specialized.  Within specialties, functions are often broken down further.  For example, paralegals specializing in labor law may concentrate exclusively on employee benefits.  In small and medium-size law firms, duties are often more general.    The tasks of paralegals differ widely according to the type of organization for which they work.  A corporate paralegal often assists attorneys with employee contracts, shareholder agreements, stock-option plans, and employee benefit plans.  They also may help prepare and file annual financial reports, maintain corporate minutes’ record resolutions, and prepare forms to secure loans for the corporation.  Corporate paralegals often monitor and review government regulations to ensure that the corporation is aware of new requirements and is operating within the law.  Increasingly, experienced corporate paralegals or paralegal managers are assuming additional supervisory responsibilities such as overseeing team projects.    The duties of paralegals who work in the public sector usually vary by agency.  In general, litigation paralegals analyze legal material for internal use, maintain reference files, conduct research for attorneys, and collect and analyze evidence for agency hearings.  They may prepare informative or explanatory material on laws, agency regulations, and agency policy for general use by the agency and the public.  Paralegals employed in community legal-service projects help the poor, the aged, and others who are in need of legal assistance.  They file forms, conduct research, prepare documents, and, when authorized by law, may represent clients at administrative hearings.    Work environment.  Paralegals handle many routine assignments, particularly when they are inexperienced.  As they gain experience, paralegals usually assume more varied tasks with additional responsibility.  Paralegals do most of their work in offices and law libraries.  Occasionally, they travel to gather information and perform other duties.    Paralegals employed by corporations and government usually work a standard 40-hour week.  Although most paralegals work year round, some are temporarily employed during busy times of the year and then released.  Paralegals who work for law firms sometimes work very long hours when under pressure to meet deadlines.                   Training, Other Qualifications, and Advancement     [ About this section ]       Back to Top            Most entrants have an associate degree in paralegal studies, or a bachelor’s degree coupled with a certificate in paralegal studies.  Some employers train paralegals on the job.    Education and training.  There are several ways to become a paralegal.  The most common is through a community college paralegal program that leads to an associate degree.  Another common method of entry, mainly for those who already have a college degree, is earning a certificate in paralegal studies.  A small number of schools offer a bachelor’s and master’s degree in paralegal studies.  Finally, some employers train paralegals on the job.      Associate and bachelor’s degree programs usually combine paralegal training with courses in other academic subjects.  Certificate programs vary significantly, with some only taking a few months to complete.  Most certificate programs provide intensive paralegal training for individuals who already hold college degrees.    About 1,000 colleges and universities, law schools, and proprietary schools offer formal paralegal training programs.  Approximately 260 paralegal programs are approved by the American Bar Association (ABA).  Although many employers do not require such approval, graduation from an ABA-approved program can enhance employment opportunities.  Admission requirements vary.  Some require certain college courses or a bachelor’s degree, while others accept high school graduates or those with legal experience.  A few schools require standardized tests and personal interviews.    The quality of paralegal training programs varies; some programs may include job placement services.  If possible, prospective students should examine the experiences of recent graduates before enrolling in a paralegal program.  Any training program usually includes courses in legal research and the legal applications of computers.  Many paralegal training programs also offer an internship in which students gain practical experience by working for several months in a private law firm, the office of a public defender or attorney general, a corporate legal department, a legal aid organization, a bank, or a government agency.  Internship experience is an asset when one is seeking a job after graduation.      Some employers train paralegals on the job, hiring college graduates with no legal experience or promoting experienced legal secretaries.  Other entrants have experience in a technical field that is useful to law firms, such as a background in tax preparation or criminal justice.  Nursing or health administration experience is valuable in personal injury law practices.    Certification and other qualifications.  Although most employers do not require certification, earning a voluntary certification from a professional society may offer advantages in the labor market.  The National Association of Legal Assistants (NALA), for example, has established standards for certification requiring various combinations of education and experience.  Paralegals who meet these standards are eligible to take a 2-day examination.  Those who pass the exam may use the Certified Legal Assistant (CLA) or Certified Paralegal (CP) credential.  The NALA also offers the Advanced Paralegal Certification for experienced paralegals who want to specialize.  The Advanced Paralegal Certification program is a curriculum based program offered on the Internet.    The American Alliance of Paralegals, Inc.  offers the American Alliance Certified Paralegal (AACP) credential, a voluntary certification program.  Paralegals seeking the AACP certification must possess at least five years of paralegal experience and meet one of the three educational criteria.  Certification must be renewed every two years, including the completion 18 hours of continuing education.    In addition, the National Federation of Paralegal Association offers the Registered Paralegal (RP) designation to paralegals with a bachelor’s degree and at least 2 years of experience who pass an exam.  To maintain the credential, workers must complete 12 hours of continuing education every 2 years.  The National Association for Legal Professionals offers the Professional Paralegal (PP) certification to those who pass a four-part exam.  Recertification requires 75 hours of continuing education.    Paralegals must be able to document and present their findings and opinions to their supervising attorney.  They need to understand legal terminology and have good research and investigative skills.  Familiarity with the operation and applications of computers in legal research and litigation support also is important.  Paralegals should stay informed of new developments in the laws that affect their area of practice.  Participation in continuing legal education seminars allows paralegals to maintain and expand their knowledge of the law.  In fact, all paralegals in California must complete 4 hours of mandatory continuing education in either general law or in a specialized area of law.    Because paralegals frequently deal with the public, they should be courteous and uphold the ethical standards of the legal profession.  The National Association of Legal Assistants, the National Federation of Paralegal Associations, and a few States have established ethical guidelines for paralegals to follow.    Advancement.  Paralegals usually are given more responsibilities and require less supervision as they gain work experience.  Experienced paralegals who work in large law firms, corporate legal departments, or government agencies may supervise and delegate assignments to other paralegals and clerical staff.  Advancement opportunities also include promotion to managerial and other law-related positions within the firm or corporate legal department.  However, some paralegals find it easier to move to another law firm when seeking increased responsibility or advancement.                 Employment     [ About this section ]       Back to Top            Paralegals and legal assistants held about 238,000 jobs in 2006.  Private law firms employed 7 out of 10 paralegals and legal assistants; most of the remainder worked for corporate legal departments and various levels of government.  Within the Federal Government, the U.S.  Department of Justice is the largest employer, followed by the Social Security Administration and the U.S.  Department of the Treasury.  A small number of paralegals own their own businesses and work as freelance legal assistants, contracting their services to attorneys or corporate legal departments.                 Job Outlook     [ About this section ]       Back to Top            Despite projected rapid employment growth, competition for jobs is expected to continue as many people seek to go into this profession; experienced, formally trained paralegals should have the best employment opportunities.    Employment change.  Employment of paralegals and legal assistants is projected to grow 22 percent between 2006 and 2016,  much  faster than the average  for all occupations.  Employers are trying to reduce costs and increase the availability and efficiency of legal services by hiring paralegals to perform tasks once done by lawyers.  Paralegals are performing a wider variety of duties, making them more useful to businesses.    Demand for paralegals also is expected to grow as an expanding population increasingly requires legal services, especially in areas such as intellectual property, health care, international law, elder issues, criminal law, and environmental law.  The growth of prepaid legal plans also should contribute to the demand for legal services.    Private law firms will continue to be the largest employers of paralegals, but a growing array of other organizations, such as corporate legal departments, insurance companies, real estate and title insurance firms, and banks also hire paralegals.  Corporations in particular are expected to increase their in-house legal departments to cut costs.  In part because of the range of tasks they can perform, paralegals are also increasingly employed in small and medium-size establishments of all types.    Job prospects.  In addition to new jobs created by employment growth, more job openings will arise as people leave the occupation.  There will be demand for paralegals who specialize in areas such as real estate, bankruptcy, medical malpractice, and product liability.  Community legal service programs, which provide assistance to the poor, elderly, minorities, and middle-income families, will employ additional paralegals to minimize expenses and serve the most people.  Job opportunities also are expected in Federal, State, and local government agencies, consumer organizations, and the courts.  However, this occupation attracts many applicants, creating competition for jobs.  Experienced, formally trained paralegals should have the best job prospects.    To a limited extent, paralegal jobs are affected by the business cycle.  During recessions, demand declines for some discretionary legal services, such as planning estates, drafting wills, and handling real estate transactions.  Corporations are less inclined to initiate certain types of litigation when falling sales and profits lead to fiscal belt tightening.  As a result, full-time paralegals employed in offices adversely affected by a recession may be laid off or have their work hours reduced.  However, during recessions, corporations and individuals are more likely to face problems that require legal assistance, such as bankruptcies, foreclosures, and divorces.  Paralegals, who provide many of the same legal services as lawyers at a lower cost, tend to fare relatively better in difficult economic conditions.

Earnings     [ About this section ]       Back to Top            Earnings of paralegals and legal assistants vary greatly.  Salaries depend on education, training, experience, the type and size of employer, and the geographic location of the job.  In general, paralegals who work for large law firms or in large metropolitan areas earn more than those who work for smaller firms or in less populated regions.  In May 2006, full-time wage-and-salary paralegals and legal assistants had median annual earnings, including bonuses, of $43,040.  The middle 50 percent earned between $33,920 and $54,690.  The top 10 percent earned more than $67,540, and the bottom 10 percent earned less than $27,450.  Median annual earnings in the industries employing the largest numbers of paralegals were:                     Federal Government   $56,080        Management of companies and enterprises   52,220        Local government   42,170        Legal services   41,460        State government   38,020                     In addition to earning a salary, many paralegals receive bonuses, in part, to compensate them for sometimes having to work long hours.  Paralegals also receive vacation, paid sick leave, a 401 savings plan, life insurance, personal paid time off, dental insurance, and reimbursement for continuing legal education.

Canyon  College      The Paralegal and Legal Assistant Training Program  (PLAT)    Frequently Asked Questions about this program    Table of Contents    GENERAL QUESTIONS ABOUT PARALEGALS    EMPLOYMENT    CERTIFICATION OF PARALEGALS    PARALEGAL EDUCATION USING THE INTERNET    THE PARALEGAL AND LEGAL ASSISTANT TRAINING INSTITUTE (PLAT)    IN GENERAL    GRADING AND EVALUATION    GENERAL  QUESTIONS ABOUT PARALEGALS   What does a paralegal do?  Paralegals can do much of the work that a lawyer would do. They can do research, prepare  documents, write briefs, and analyze case law. They could gather information to prepare for  trial, such as the analysis of documents or the questioning of clients or witnesses.   Does this mean that paralegals can work on their own?  No paralegal can practice law. While a paralegal can do some of the tasks that a lawyer does,  such as research and writing, no jurisdiction licenses paralegals to engage in the practice of  law on their own. The practice of law includes making appearances as legal representatives for a  client, offering of legal advice, or signing legal documents on the client's behalf.   Any law-related work that a paralegal does has to be supervised and approved by an attorney.   How is a paralegal different from a legal secretary?  Paralegals may also do typing and copying. But because they understand more of the content that  they're dealing with, they can do many of the tasks that a lawyer might do, but more cheaply.   Can paralegals specialize?  They certainly can; in fact, that may enhance their marketability in the marketplace, since the  paralegal has developed a comprehensive understanding of a specific area of the law.   A lawyer who regularly represents buyers or sellers of land may rely upon the paralegal to  prepare those documents necessary for completing the sale. So paralegals could develop expertise  in preparing such documents.    Back to Top    EMPLOYMENT   How much of a demand exists, in the marketplace, for paralegals?  According to the U.S. Department of Labor, paralegals and legal assistants are among the ten  fastest growing occupations, with projected growth in the field, until 2008, increasing by 62%.   What accounts for such an increase in the demand for paralegals?  While the United States has many law schools which graduate excellent candidates for  certification as a lawyer, there is an increasing demand for legal services, especially for low  costs legal services. By relying on paralegals to do some of the work, a single lawyer can offer  lower cost services to more clients.    Back to Top    CERTIFICATION  OF PARALEGALS  Is there a certification test which someone has to pass before being able to work as a paralegal?  No. States don't regulate the activities of paralegals by imposing mandatory certification  requirements.   Why don't states require certification of paralegals before they work in the field of law?  They recognize that paralegals can provide a wide range of services when working with a lawyer  more cheaply than if the lawyer had provided such services.   The states also have recognized that having paralegals pass a certification test would increase  the costs for becoming a paralegal.  If paralegals had to take to complete a set curriculum of classes on specific topics -- so that  the paralegal would have something approaching the breadth and depth of a lawyer's knowledge of  the law -- that would deter some people from becoming paralegals. Learning a specific curriculum  would cost more, thereby discouraging some people from working as a paralegal. Since it would  cost more to complete such a curriculum, there would be fewer paralegals to help attorneys. With  fewer paralegals, the price for their services go up. That would mean that a lawyer might have to  decline an opportunity to represent a client, since having the paralegal do many law-related  tasks would not be so cheap, when compared to having the lawyer doing the work. So, fewer people  would have access to the knowledge and expertise of lawyers and paralegals.   Because states want to encourage the use of paralegals in the law office or government agency,  they have not imposed certification standards which an individual must satisfy before that person  can hold herself or himself out to the world as being a ""paralegal"".   But aren't there certification programs in the field?  Yes.   The National Association of Legal Assistants, Inc. has created national standards and a test  which allows a paralegal to be known as a Certified Legal Assistant.   To qualify to take the test, a test-taker must have done  any one (1)  of the following:     graduated from an American Bar Association-certified legal assistant program;    earned an associate's degree or  a bachelor's degree in legal assistant studies;    earned a bachelor's degree in any field and has worked as a legal assistant for at least one  year;    earned a high school diploma or its equivalent  AND  has worked, under the supervision of  a member of the Bar, at least for seven (7) years  AND  has completed at least twenty (20)  hours of continuing legal education credit within the past two years before the date of the test    [ NOTE:  fifteen (15) semester hours of classes in substantive law is considered to be the  equivalent of a year's work a legal assistant];    completed a post baccalaureate certificate program in legal assistant studies; or    finished of a minimum of sixty (60) semester hours, fifteen (15) of which were in substantive  law.   Over the course of two days, students could have to answers questions on     Analytic skills and abilities   Communications   Employment (specifically, Human Relations)   Federal Law   Federal Procedure   Interviewing   Legal Ethics   Legal Research   Legal Terminology   Professional Judgement   During the test, students will have to complete demonstrate knowledge about substantive law  regarding the American Legal System. They will also get to choose to answer questions in four (4)  of the following substantive law topics:      Bankruptcy   Business Organizations (including corporations)   Contract Law   Criminal Law   Criminal Procedure   Domestic Relations (Family Law)   Real Property (real estate)   Regulatory (Administrative) Law   Wills, Trusts and Estates   The NALA also offers examines in specialized topics of law, for those people who've already  become CLAs.   For more information about NALA, contact them at:   National Association of Legal Assistants  1516 S. Boston, #200  Tulsa, OK 74119  (918) 587-6828   or at  www.nala.org   The National Federation of Paralegal Associations, Inc. offers the Paralegal Advanced Competency  Examination (PACE). This test recognizes the fact that some paralegals do have more expertise in  an area and that set a standard for evaluating that level of competency. It is also offered to  states if they have chosen to regulate paralegals by requiring all paralegals to take this test  if they which to work as a paralegal. This is a voluntary test, which could objectively establish  the advanced competency of a paralegal. It generally seems to be a test designed for individuals  who have already earned a bachelor's degree.   For more information about NFPA's PACE, contact them at:   National Federation of Paralegal Associations  P.O. Box 33108  Kansas City, MO 64114  (816) 941-4000   or at  www.paralegals.org   Again, a prospective paralegal doesn't have to complete such certification programs. National,  professional paralegal organizations such as the NALA and the NFPA have instituted certification  programs. By having passed such a certification process, the paralegal has demonstrated his or  her competency according to the objective standards by these organizations. So, the paralegal can  use the imprimatur of the certification organization to improve upon his or her chances for  finding a job. But not every paralegal requires that depth of knowledge, as she or he may need  only to focus on a particular topic, such as real estate or business law.   Other organizations interested in the topic of paralegal regulation and certification include  the:   American Bar Association  750 N. Lakeshore Drive  Chicago, IL  60611  (312) 988-5000   or at  www.abanet.org   American Association for Paralegal Education  2965 Flowers Road South  Suite 105  Atlanta, GA 30341  (770) 452-9877   or at  www.aafpe.org    Back to Top    PARALEGAL  EDUCATION USING THE INTERNET   What does Internet-based education offer over classroom based education?  On-line education offers the best of classroom teaching without having to go to a classroom. As  offered by the PLAT Institute, students will have a chance to study at their own pace. Motivated,  self-directed learners will take command of the learning process, selecting the times when they  want to learn.   What about having contact with a professor?  Through the use of web-based software, which allows students to meet in a ""virtual classroom"",  students can gain clarification and insight from the instructor on different topics of law. As in  college, the faculty will be available, at posted hours during the week, for consultation.   PLAT students can also contact the instructor via e-mail.   How will students get a sense of how well they've come to understand the material?  With on-line testing, students get quicker feedback than in a classroom, since tests are also  graded on-line.   Why not take such a program at a local institution?  This kind of on-line education cuts costs. There's no need for the creation of a physical campus,  which means a drastic reduction in the expenses incurred to deliver the information. This  accounts for the lower costs of this program as opposed to a program offered at a local  institution.   At a local institution, students would have to take classes, at a fixed period of time over a  specified number of weeks. Adhering to such a schedule often produces scheduling conflicts for  the student. The local institutions will also have to maintain the buildings where the education  takes place. Students usually would also have to spend time commuting to the local institution.   With on-line education, students get the material, work with the material at a pace which they  feel is comfortable for them, and can always engage the instructor, one-on-one or in the ""virtual  classroom"", to get answers to their questions.   Can students communicate with one another in the ""virtual classroom""?  They not only can meet there, but the Institute encourages that they meet to discuss the material  in the courses. Students often improve their learning when teaching one another about the  material. By answering another student's question, a student has to take a different perspective  on the material. The student, in having to present the material, treats the material as something  active (since they need to be able to explain it to another) rather than something passive (only  when the student has to answer questions).   This interactivity among the students reinforces the competency which they develop as they study  a subject, so that students come away from the program with active, instead of passive knowledge.  Their discussions mean that they've learned how to trust their acquired knowledge, so the  practice will prove to be quite useful when using this knowledge when working.   Does this mean that students have to meet in the ""virtual classroom""?  No. The flexibility of on-line education means that students select the approach which feels the  most comfortable and effective for them. Since all discussions in the ""classroom"" take place on- line, students may review the discussions at a later time.    Back to Top   THE PARALEGAL AND LEGAL ASSISTANT TRAINING INSTITUTE (PLAT)    IN  GENERAL   How does the PLAT program differ from a pre-law program at a college or university?  If a university has created a pre-law program, the undergraduates would have to take courses in  writing and analysis, perhaps on topics in political science, history and English. A pre-law  program can prepare an undergraduate to have a more global view of the role of law in our  society. Pre-law programs are designed to prepare the student for the intense level of study  which students do while in law school   This paralegal program also provides a student with a broad understanding of the law. But the  students in this program will focus on the more practical aspects of the law, instead of the  theory that law students focus on.    Back to Top    GRADING  AND EVALUATION   What kind of a testing and grading scheme will the Institute use with its students?  For all classes, students will have to complete an open-book, objective, twenty-question, quizzes  (often, in the form of multiple-choice questions). Each quiz will be on each chapter of the text  for that class.   While students will have to complete written assignments as part of their homework in the Legal  Writing class, they will not need to submit it for review and grading.   Why do students need to take these kinds of tests?  Students need to take tests as a means of reinforcing the knowledge which they've just gained.  Doing these timed exams as open-book exercises mean that students will be able to verify their  answers. Students will also learn that it becomes impractical to expect to answer the questions  within the time frame in which they are offered only by looking up the answers. The tests will  require students to apply their knowledge.   So there's more to the open-book testing than just opening the book and answering the questions?  Yes. Prepare for these quizzes as though you're taking a closed book exam. Review the course  material, paying attention to new terms introduced in the chapter, as well as to the concepts and  topics for that chapter. By preparing in this way, students will have already started to organize  the material. They will be engaging in active, instead of passive, learning.   Then what's the point to having these as open book quizzes?  By having access to the material in the text, students won't feel as though they have to memorize  the material. Instead of just memorizing the material, the quizzes give students a chance to see  how that material fits within a larger context.   How about grading?  Student grades will be issued on a scale of 0-100. With the objective testing, students will need  to get 14 correct out of the twenty questions per chapter.   Does that mean that the quizzes bear some impact on earning the Certificate of Completion from  the PLAT Institute?   Yes. The Institute wants to recognize the efforts of its students by setting minimum standards of  quality. Students will need to average a grade of 70, on all the topics, in each class, before  receiving the certificate. Any student who has less than a 70 average, by the time of completion  of the class, will not get that certificate.   How does a student get that certificate if the student has, overall, an average below 70?  The student will need to retake so many classes as is necessary to bring up the student's average  to a 70. Students may not want to or need to get the certificate of completion. Receipt of the  Institute's certificate of completion occurs only after a student has demonstrated a certain  level of competency about a title.   Back to Top             "

Most require specialized education beyond high school, but the amount of education is dependent upon the career and can range from certificate or diploma programs, to bachelor degree programs and even advanced degree programs. Some of the more popular of these careers are:      Court Reporting  - Court reporters create verbatim transcripts of legal proceedings such as court trials and depositions. To do this, they employ stenotype machines, stenotype machines attached to a computer for real-time court reporting, or audio equipment to record court proceedings. Court reporters are responsible for capturing an accurate, complete, and secure legal record of legal proceedings.   Criminalists/Crime Scene Investigator/Crime Scene Technician/Forensic Technician  - All are different names for an individual who investigates a crime scene collecting, storing, cataloging, and testing and analyzing various forms of physical evidence. They prepare reports to document their findings and the laboratory techniques used. They may also provide information and expert opinions to investigators as well as give testimony as expert witnesses in court proceedings.   Criminal Justice  - Individuals who pursue a criminal justice career path typically work in law enforcement, the courts, and corrections.   Legal Assistant / Paralegal  - Legal assistants or paralegals perform many tasks delegated by lawyers. Tasks performed by paralegals include: assisting attorneys during trials;  drafting pleadings and motions to be filed with the court; helping lawyers prepare for closings, hearings, trials or corporate meetings; identifying laws, judicial decisions, legal articles, and other materials that are relevant to assigned cases; investigating the facts of cases; obtaining affidavits; preparing legal arguments; preparing written reports; and organizing and tracking files. A paralegal, however, is expressly precluded from setting legal fees, giving legal advice, and presenting cases in court.   Legal Secretaries  - Legal secretaries are administrative assistants or secretaries that perform specialized legal work. They may prepare correspondence and legal papers such as summonses, complaints, motions, responses, and subpoenas under the supervision of a lawyer or a legal assistant/paralegal. Legal secretaries may also assist with legal research.      Educational Requirements for Legal Careers    The legal professions listed above differ significantly from each other and, as one might expect, they have different educational requirements.    Court Reporter Educational Requirements    Court reporters must have a high school education or equivalent. Depending on which type of court reporting, educational programs can take any where from a year to 4 years. Programs of study must typically be from state licensed and/or approved programs. These programs are typically offered by postsecondary vocational schools and career schools and colleges.    Criminalists/Crime Scene Investigator/Crime Scene Technician/Forensic Technician Educational Requirements    Typically an individual interested in this career will obtain a bachelor's degree from with a major in criminalistics, chemistry, biology, or forensic science. Some crime labs may require advanced degrees. Lesser degrees such as an associate degree can qualify a person for forensic identification specialist positions.    Criminal Justice Educational Requirements    Educational institutions offer certificate, diploma, undergraduate, and graduate degrees in criminal justice. To maximize prospects for employment, individuals interested in this profession should consider obtaining a bachelor degree in criminal justice. An associate degree may be sufficient for entry level criminal justice positions.    Legal Assistant / Paralegal Educational Requirements    Most legal assistants or paralegals have an associate degree in paralegal studies. Some may have a bachelor's degree along with a certificate in paralegal studies. Education is typically obtained from community colleges, or career schools that offer paralegal training programs.    Legal Secretaries    Legal secretaries typically obtain the skills needed for employment from high school vocational education programs or to 1- or 2-year programs in office administration offered by business schools, vocational-technical schools, community colleges, and career schools.    Evaluating Schools for a Non-Attorney Legal Education    For a detailed description of a process for evaluating schools for legal programs of study, see "" Choosing A Career School "". To summarize the process outlined in that article, when evaluating a career school for a legal program of study, an individual should:      Assess themselves   Assess the legal profession that they are considering   Assess the educational institutions that provide legal programs   Assess the specific legal program of study      It is very important when evaluating the school and program of study to assess the accreditation status of both the institution and the program of study.    Accreditation    Accreditation is a process of peer review by non-governmental agencies to insure the quality of a school and the programs of study that it offers (see: "" Accreditation in the United States "", U.S. Department of Education (USDE), for more information on accreditation). It is very important to obtain a legal education from a school that is accredited to maximize the acceptance of that education by prospective employers. It is also important to obtain one's education from a school that is accredited by an accreditation organization that is recognized by the USDE in order to be able to obtain Federal financial aid if needed (see: "" Overview of Accreditation "", U.S. Department of Education).    Schools that offer legal programs of study may be accredited by regional accrediting agencies, national accrediting agencies, and/or specialized accrediting agencies. Following is a listing of accrediting agencies that may accredited a school that offers legal programs of study:    National Accrediting Agencies      Accrediting Commission of Career Schools and Colleges of Technology  (ACCSCT)   Accrediting Council for Independent Colleges and Schools  (ACICS)   Distance Education and Training Council  (DETC)      Regional Accrediting Agencies      Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools, Commission on Higher Education   Middle States Commission on Secondary Schools   New England Association of Schools and Colleges, Commission on Institutions of Higher Education   New England Association of Schools and Colleges, Commission on Technical and Career Institutions   New York State Board of Regents, and the Commissioner of Education   North Central Association of Colleges and Schools, The Higher Learning Commission   North Central Association Commission on Accreditation and School Improvement, Board of Trustees   Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities   Southern Association of Colleges and Schools, Commission on Colleges   Western Association of Schools and Colleges, Accrediting Commission for Community and Junior Colleges   Western Association of Schools and Colleges, Accrediting Commission for Schools   Western Association of Schools and Colleges, Accrediting Commission for Senior Colleges and Universities      Specialized Accrediting Agencies       American Bar Association Section for Legal Education & Admission to the Bar   Some state bar associations      Licensing and Certification Requirements for Legal Careers    Licensing and certification requirements, if any, vary by chosen legal profession.    Court Reporter Licensing and Certification    Some states that use the voice method of court reporting require voice writers to pass a test to earn licensure. They typically will also accept one of the National Verbatim Reporters Association's national certifications (Certified Verbatim Reporter (CVR), Certificate of Merit (CM), and Real-Time Verbatim Reporter (RVR)) as a substitute for state licensure.    Other states require that court reporters pass a state test to become a Certified Court Reporter (CCR). Some states even require that court reporters become notary publics.    There are also opportunities for court reporters to obtain voluntary certification from the following organizations:      American Association of Electronic Reporters and Transcribers  (AAERT)       Certified Electronic Court Reporter (CER)   Certified Electronic Court Transcriber (CET)   Certified Electronic Court Reporter and Transcriber (CERT)       National Court Reporters Association   (NCRA)       Registered Professional Reporter (RPR) which is an entry-level designation   Registered Merit Reporter (RMR)   Registered Diplomate Reporter (RDR)       United States Court Reporters Association   (USCRA       Federal Certified Realtime Reporter (FCRR) for court reporters who work in Federal courts.          Criminalists/Crime Scene Investigator/Crime Scene Technician/Forensic Technician Licensing and Certification    There are no licensing or certification requirements for these professions.    Criminal Justice Licensing and Certification    There are no licensing or certification requirements for criminal justice professions.    Legal Assistant / Paralegal Licensing and Certification    Licensing and certification is not a requirement to become a paralegal. Most employers do not require voluntary certification, however obtaining certification may enhance a candidates job prospects.

Some paralegals still receive training on the job.   Because law offices will increasingly try to reduce costs by reassigning legal tasks from lawyers to paralegals, opportunities for paralegals are expected to increase in number faster than the average.   Government agencies, private law firms, and businesses employ paralegals who may choose to specialize in a number of legal fields.      Paralegal Career Overview   Lawyers, who are ultimately responsible for legal work, assign many of their tasks to paralegals. Legal assistantss paralegals are also knownre increasingly taking on tasks formally performed by lawyers. Paralegals still cannot legally try cases, set fees, or give legal advicell tasks explicitly delegated to lawyers.    A paralegal primary role is to help a lawyer in his or her preparations for trials, business meetings, and hearings. Paralegals help make certain that all aspects of the case have been considered, and gather information and investigate facts. By performing research, paralegals find relevant laws, statutes, and previous judicial decisions that relate to the case. They may be asked to compile all such information into a written report that aids lawyers in deciding the way in which they should proceed with a case. Paralegals assist with the preparation of arguments and court filings, and may provide assistance during a trial. They may also make readily available to attorneys any legal documents or files that relate to important cases.    Depending on the employer, the tasks paralegals are asked to perform vary. In addition to the support role they play to lawyers during court proceedings, paralegals may help with a number of legal documents, including drafting wills, contracts, applications, and divorce agreements. They may also prepare tax filings and real estate transactions. Other paralegals perform a more administrative role, managing the business activities of others and keeping company financial records.     The majority of paralegals work with government agencies, corporations, and private law firms, though paralegal work is available in all industries. Paralegals, just like lawyers, may center their own employment around different areas of law, including tax, divorce, patent, employment, and immigration law. Paralegals have adapted to more complex laws by specializing. Specialties further subdivide the different areas of legal practiceor example, a paralegal working within the field of intellectual property may specialize and work only in trademarks.     Paralegal tasks vary greatly among different types of organizations. Corporate paralegals help attorneys with items such as benefit packages, human resource issues, employee contracts, or stock-option purchase plans. Other tasks they perform include filing annual reports, taking minutes and recording business resolutions, and preparing corporate financial documents. Corporate paralegals may assist the company in staying current on and complying with government regulations that affect their industry by monitoring legislative or administrative activities.    Paralegals employed with government agencies conduct legal research, compile and manage legal material for in-house use, and collect evidence for agency meetings. They may prepare summaries and explanations of agency policies, regulations, and laws for public consumption. At the community level, paralegals often assist with legal-aid clinics that help poor, elderly, and others gain access to legal assistance. Paralegals do everything from file reports and documents, to conduct research and, when legal, represent clients at agency hearings.     Paralegals employed by a large private law firm or government agency are likely to specialize; however, paralegals who work with small- to medium-sized firms will likely be required to have a general working knowledge of the law. This will include such assignments as researching prior trials concerning improper use of force by police and preparing documents to file in court.    Paralegals are increasingly using computers and other technology to research legal issues. Literature is stored on online databases and CD-ROMs. In addition to research, paralegals also use computer database systems to store, organize, and access supporting legal documents related to complex cases. Documents and evidence is scanned using imagining software. Billable hours are tracked using billing programs. Software is used in tax law to compute implications of tax law, and calculate client tax strategies.    Most paralegals who are employed with government agencies and corporations typically work 40 hours a week. A minority of paralegals are seasonal employees, working only during the busiest times of the year; the majority, however, work year round. When deadlines are looming, paralegals who work with law firms may work long hours; this workload is often rewarded with extra vacation time or bonuses.     Paralegals with little experience are sometimes required to perform some more menial tasks. However, as they accumulate experience they gain responsibility for more important tasks. Though they may on occasion travel to help with investigations, the majority of paralegalstime is spent in an office or library.     Paralegal Training and Job Qualifications   The most common path to becoming a paralegal is earning an  associate's degree  in paralegal studies from a community college. Others earn a certificate in paralegal studies after graduation from college;  bachelor degrees  and  master degrees  are available from some schools as well. Others are promoted from their legal secretary positions or are hired with no formal  paralegal training , receiving training on the job. Those with specialized  training  in a technical field related to the legal practice may also be hired as paralegals. Such fields include nursing, tax preparation, and law enforcement.    Some 600 colleges, universities, and law schools make  paralegal training  programs available. The American Bar Association (ABA) approves nearly 250 paralegal programs. Graduating from one of the programs the ABA approves may increase post-graduate employment opportunities; however, many programs do not seek ABA approval, nor is such approval required. Admissions requirements vary from program to program. A  bachelor degree  or specific college courses are required by some; legal experience or a high school diploma is prerequisites for others; some schools require students to take standardized tests or conduct personal interviews.     Program for paralegal education are available that terminate in a 2-year associate degree, a 4-year bachelor degree, or a certificate, which may take only a few months to complete. Such certificate programs are designed for persons already have a college degree, and the study is very intensive. The associate and bachelor programs combine paralegal studies with other academic fields. The best paralegal programs include job placement at the end. Courses are increasingly being offered to train paralegals on computer technology and online legal searches. Some programs include several months of internship experience where the paralegal gains hands-on knowledge of legal studies by working in a law firm, government agency, State or local prosecutor office, or corporation legal department. The internship experience is a valuable resource when applying for jobs following graduation. Before committing to a program of study, prospective paralegal students should consult with recent graduates of any particular program to find out their experiences.    Holding a professional certificate increases opportunities in the job market, though most firms and agencies do not require a paralegal to hold such certification. Paralegals may certify with the National Association of Legal Assistants and use designation of Certified Legal Assistant (CLA). To certify, professionals must meet established standards with regards to education and experience, then pass a 2-day examination that is given in regional testing centers 3 times annually. The National Federation of Paralegal Associations offers another test, the Paralegal Advanced Competency Exam, to paralegals with a bachelor degree and two years experience. Registered Paralegal (RP) is the professional designation of those who pass this examination.     Not only is it important for paralegals to be able to use technological advancements to conduct legal research, they must also be able to document their research when they present them to their supervising attorney. In order to perform their tasks properly, paralegals must be familiar with legal jargon and be able to conduct effective investigations. Continuing education courses help paralegals stay abreast of developments and changes in their particular area of legal practice, and gain more knowledge of the legal process and system.    People skills are important for paralegals as they often work with the public. Ethical guidelines for paralegals have been established by a number of organizations, namely the National Federation of Paralegal Associations, some States, and the National Association of Legal Assistants.    Paralegal gain more responsibility and are supervised less when they gain more experience on the job. Senior paralegals in private law firms, government agencies, and corporations may serve an administrative role, delegating work to other staff and paralegals. Paralegals can be promoted to managerial and other law-related posts, though some find changing firms or agencies the easiest way to advance and gain more responsibilities.     Paralegal Job and Employment Opportunities   Job growth is expected to be faster than average through 2012 for legal assistants and paralegals. Some of that growth will come as law firms hire more paralegals and assign them responsibilities previously handled by lawyers in order to cut costs and make legal services more available. Most new paralegal opportunities will be with new firms and expanding agencies, though some spots certainly will result from paralegals retiring or leaving the work force. Educated and certified paralegals have a bright employment future, though competition for jobs will be keen due to the large number of persons who will go into this line of work.    Though corporations, banks, insurance companies, and other agencies will all continue to employ paralegals, the largest employer of legal assistants will continue to be private law firms. Corporations will employ a growing number of paralegals as they cut costs in their legal departments. As more people require legal services in specialized areas such as intellectual property, estate planning, environmental law, and housing issues, demand for paralegals will increase. Legal services should also grow because of prepaid legal plans that are gaining popularity. Opportunities for paralegals will also increase as current employers assign their paralegals more responsibilities and small and medium-sized firms and organizations increasingly use paralegal services. It is projected that some experienced paralegals will establish their own businesses.     Public sector employment for paralegals is expected to match growth in the private sector. Agencies at all levels of government will hire paralegals in increasing numbers, and community legal assistance programs that aim to make legal services available to previously disenfranchised personsike the poor, minorities, and the elderlyill increase demand for paralegal services.    Paralegals are sometimes affected by cyclical swings in the economy. Peripheral legal serviceor example, estate planning, will drafting, and real estate transactionsecrease during economic recessions. Businesses are less likely to hire new paralegals when diving profits require cutting costs. Some paralegals who work full time may find their hours reduced or they may even be let go during tough economic times. However, during economic crises, people find themselves more in need of some legal services, like bankruptcy, separation, or bank foreclosure. Paralegals tend to do better during recessions than lawyers do because they offer many of the same legal services at a fraction of the cost.     Historical Earnings Information   Education level, amount of experience, employer type and size, and location all greatly influence the salary a paralegal might earn. Paralegals employed with small firms in rural areas typically earn less than their counterparts working with large firms in urban areas. Bonuses are given frequently in addition to salary. The median earnings were $37,950 including bonuses for wage and salary paralegals working full-time in 2002.

Although there are a number of different types of credentials for paralegals, and, therefore, variations in the lengths and types of coursework which one must successfully complete in order to receive his or her credentials, they all have the common purpose of educating the individual to take on an important role in the legal field.  This education gaining the knowledge necessary to do the job, and the skills necessary in order to be able to put it into practical use.  Both aspects of one's education are equally important.   Basic paralegal training generally consists of an overview of the legal system as a whole, specialized areas of practice, and the skills which are applicable to this line of work.  Don't make the mistake of letting this brief description give you the idea that there is anything vague or minimal about paralegal training, however, because the coursework is very complete, and quite intense.  It is also one of the most interesting and enjoyable types of coursework that you can possibly put your time into studying! After you have completed basic paralegal coursework, you will have learned nearly everything that there is to know about the American courts and justice system.  This includes the history of this system, how it evolved into the way it is today, and details surrounding how the courts and justice system operates both in terms of the laws and the roles of legal representation.  You will also learn the fascinating details about codes, procedure, both the criminal and civil arenas, and how all of these things are applicable to the workings of the courts and justice system as a whole.   During your paralegal training you will also become very well acquainted with specialized areas of law.  Business, family, corporate, tax, family, and other specialties are covered in detail.  Not only will you learn what these areas are about, but you will also be taught everything you will need to do on an everyday basis if you elect to work in any of these areas.  You will not simply learn about the area you may wish to enter, you will be equally prepared for them all. As working in the paralegal field requires one to be more than competent in a number of essential skills, you will enhance the skills you do have and prepare yourself with the others.  Working with computer programs, math, written and verbal communication skills, are all basic parts of a paralegal's everyday work life.  You will need to know how to conduct interviews, use spreadsheets, operate data bases, and other essentials;  all of these skills and many more will be addressed in your coursework.                               Whichever method you choose to begin your studies, whichever specific type of credentials you wish to work toward, the period of time it will take for you to earn your credentials, or the individual school that you elect to study from, you can be completely assured that after you have successfully completed your training you will be well-informed and well-prepared to begin your exciting new career as a paralegal!

They are not allowed to carry out    or practice law but they may in fact do many of the same tasks as a lawyer.    One of the most important things that you would be responsible for would be    to help out prepare for hearings, trials or closings.

The most common way to get into the industry is to attend a college the    specializes in this career. Although most employers do not require    certification, earning a voluntary certificate from a professional society    will offer many advantages once you start shopping for a job. You can check    out the Certified Legal Assistant (CLA). Those who pass the National    Federation of Paralegal Associations test will have a leg up on the rest of    the population entering this field.                              Job growth as a Paralegal                                The growth potential is to grow faster than average through 2012. When a    company hires a paralegal it actually lowers the cost of hiring a full blown    lawyer or law firm. Sometimes an employer just needs information about    something but doesn't need to actually hire a full blow law firm.                               The duties of a paralegal do differ based on the type of    organization where you will find employment. If you are working for    corporations you may often assist attorneys with employee contracts or stock    option plans for employees. Even maintaining corporate minute books.                               What do most Paralegals work                                Most which is 7 out of 10 actually work for private law firms. the remainder    worked for corporate legal departments and different levels of the    government.                               You would be also responsible for drafting contracts,    separation agreements, trust funds and mortgages. You may also assist in    preparing tax returns and even estate planning. As laws have become more and    more complex paralegals have responded by becoming more specialized in their    work. This is great for individuals entering into this field as they can    pick and choose an area that they want to go into.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Paralegal Degree Programs Online                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Kaplan University                           Paralegal Degree program                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Site Map    |        Contact        Us   |   Policy    Home                                       Online Education Program/WSI © 1998 - 2008 Online Education Program.com                                                                     "

This memorandum provides a brief summary of the  final regulations. Soon hereafter we will provide you with more detailed analysis and a listing of meeting  and webinar dates where the Regulations will be discussed more thoroughly.   The following are a few highlights.   1. 403(b) regulations have been published.   2. Written Plan document required – IRS will provide model plan language for public schools to  adopt in advance of effective date of regulations. Each employer must have a plan for the 403(b)  contract to qualify. (Note, the employer may not be the school where the teacher teaches but the  school district.) Plan administration can be by employer and/or other persons. Third Party  Administrator’s are not required.   3. Information sharing by issuers of 403(b) contracts and employers is now a fundamental  requirement. Self-certification by employees for eligibility to make contributions or take  loans/withdrawals will not be allowed.   4. Tax-free transfers can continue but with new rules. Rev. Rule 90-24 revoked, revocation is to be  effective 60 days after formal publication of Regulations (anticipated effective date September   26, 2007), new transfer rules in place. It is unclear when new transfer rules are effective.   5. Rollover to IRA or other eligible retirement plans not affected by rules.   6. 403(b) plans must be universally available to employees including ability to make Roth  contributions.   7. General effective date is January 1, 2009, but several grandfather exceptions.   8. Department of Labor to issue Field Assistance Bulletin regarding ERISA and non-governmental  employees seeking to comply with new 403(b) regulations.   9. Life insurance, endorsement, health or accident, property, casualty or liability policies are  prohibited as Section 403(b) funding vehicles. Annuities may include death benefits if permitted  under the incidental benefit rule.   10. Effect of plan and operational failures are addressed in regulations.1. Effective Date  The final regulations are generally applicable for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2008. Like  the proposed regulations, the final regulations include a number of special transition rules. Of particular  note, transition rules apply with respect to (1) the new withdrawal restrictions on employer contributions  to section 403(b) annuity contracts, (2) the prohibition on life insurance and other non-annuity contracts,  and (3) the new rules for tax-free transfers (each of these provisions is discussed below). Taxpayers  generally can rely upon the final regulations for periods following the date they are published in the  Federal Register (which should be July 26, 2007) and before the applicable effective date. However, such  reliance must be on a ""consistent and reasonable basis,"" and a special rule applies in the case of plan  terminations (requiring all contracts under the plan to comply with the final rules prior to a distribution of  accumulated benefits).2. Plan Document Requirement  The final regulations, like the proposed regulations, require that all 403(b) contracts be issued pursuant  to a written plan, which, in both form and operation, satisfies the requirements of section 403(b). The  final regulations make a number of significant changes to the plan requirement.   Among others, the final regulations confirm that the plan document need not be a single written  instrument and note that the document may incorporate other documents, such as the annuity contract,  by reference. The final regulations also confirm that it is permissible to allocate administrative  responsibilities to issuers, but provide that the plan document must clearly reflect such allocations. The  final regulations also provide that participants may not be tasked with any responsibility for 403(b)  compliance, although presumably compliance responsibility is distinct from providing information that  is relevant to compliance,  employees with respect to loans and hardship distributions will not be allowed.   The preamble to the final regulations confirms that the IRS will soon release model plan language for  governmental 403(b) plans such as school districts. The preamble also suggests that plans generally  must have documents that satisfy the requirements of the final regulations in place by January 1,2009,  subject to any special effective dates.  e.g., participant's age, basis for a hardship distribution. Self certification by  and a s expected, the final regulations generally retain the rule described in the proposed regulations by  revoking Rev. Rule 90-24 and substitute in its place new rules governing ""transfers"" and ""exchanges."" The  rules set forth in the Final Regulations are not as restrictive as those originally proposed. Specifically, the  final regulations provide for three types (situations) where nontaxable transfers of amounts in section  403(b) contracts may occur:   (1) ""a mere change of investment within the same plan (contract exchange);"" – an  exchange of one annuity for another where the teacher/employee has not changed  employers.   (2) a ""plan-to-plan transfer, so that there is another employer plan receiving   the exchange;"" – a exchange of annuity contracts where the employees current  403(b) employer is different than the employer when the first contract was  purchased.   (3) ""a transfer to purchase permissive service credit. .. ""  The final regulations include a number of changes to the rules applicable to exchanges and transfers under  the proposed regulations. With regard to exchanges, unlike the proposed regulations, the final regulations  permit an exchange of one contract for another to constitute a mere change of investment within the same  plan, but only if certain conditions are met, including that the employer must enter into an agreement with  the issuer of the transferee contract for the sharing in the future of certain information. The information  would include information with respect to the participant's employment  occurred) and information with respect to other section 403(b) contracts owned by the participant (to  facilitate compliance with rules such as the loan limits of section 72(p )).  Also with regard to intra-plan exchanges, the final regulations include a limited grandfathering rule  under which the new requirements  a contract received in an exchange that occurred on or before [60 days  after final regulations are published in the Federal Register] if the  exchange (including the contract received in the exchange) satisfies such  rules as the Commissioner has prescribed in guidance of general  applicability at the time of the exchange.   Precisely how this grandfathering rule will be implemented is uncertain. For example, it is not entirely  clear how exchanges that occur after the 60-day transition period but before the final regulations become  effective (January 1, 2009) will be treated, given that the regulations generally are not effective until  2009, and that until then presumably Rev. Rul. 90-24 is not revoked. It also is not entirely clear whether  the grandfathering applies to the contract itself, such that subsequent exchanges likewise would not be  subject to the new rules.  Also with regard to intra-plan exchanges, the final regulations authorize the IRS to issue guidance of  general applicability allowing such exchanges in cases not otherwise described in the final regulations.  The authority is limited to cases in which the IRS determines that sufficient procedures are in place to  share information needed to ensure compliance, such as whether a severance from employment has  occurred for purposes of the distribution restrictions. The preamble to the final regulations states that  procedures that rely on representations from the participant generally will be insufficient.  With regard to ""transfers"" of section 403(b) contracts between different ""plans,"" the final regulations  provide that both plans must provide for transfers and the participant must be an employee or former   employee of the employer that sponsors the receiving plan. Both the ""exchange"" rules and the ""transfer""  rules also require that the ""accumulated benefit"" immediately after the exchange or transfer must at least  e qual the ""accumulated benefit"" of the participant or beneficiary immediately before the exchange or  transfer. There was concern that the final regulations clarify this requirement to make it clear that the net  cash amount that would be payable to a participant upon a liquidation or partial surrender of a section  403(b) contract may be exchanged or transferred to another section 403(b) contract. The final regulations  provide that the ""accumulated benefit"" requirement would be satisfied"" ... if the exchange would satisfy  section 414(1)(1) if the exchange were a transfer of assets.""   The preamble to the final regulations states that DOL has not changed its view, as described by the   Treasury Department in the preamble to the proposed regulations, that tax-exempt employers can comply  with the requirements of section 403(b) and also remain within the DOL's safe harbor exemption for taxsheltered  annuity programs that are funded solely by salary deferrals. However, DOL noted that the final  regulations offer employers ""considerable flexibility"" in shaping the extent and nature of their  involvement in a 403(b) plan, and that in determining whether a tax-sheltered annuity program will be  subject to Title I of ERISA, a case by case analysis should be conducted. In conjunction with the  publication of the final regulations, DOL will also issue a Field Assistance Bulletin that will provide  additional guidance on the interaction of the safe harbor requirements and the final regulations. The Field  Assistance Bulletin will be made available on the DOL website, at www.dol.gov/ebsa. (The bulletin is  not yet available.)  The final regulations generally reflect the statutory rules regarding when distributions can be made  from a section 403(b) contract. Like the proposed regulations, the final regulations also create  distribution restrictions for amounts attributable to employer contributions by importing the rules for  tax-qualified plans. Specifically, the final regulations provide that, where the distribution restrictions  of section 403(b )(11) do not apply, a section 403(b) annuity contract is permitted to distribute  retirement benefits to the participant no earlier than upon the earliest of severance from employment  or upon the prior occurrence of an event, such as after a fixed number of years, the attainment of a  stated age, or disability.   The final regulations adopt the rule that the new withdrawal restrictions do not apply to after-tax  employee contributions or the earnings on such contributions. The final regulations also provide a  grandfathering rule under which the new withdrawal restrictions on employer contributions do not apply  to contracts issued by an insurance company before January 1, 2009.  (e.g., whether a severance had(e.g., information sharing) do not apply    6. Taxation of Distributions and Benefits   Like the proposed regulations, the final regulations include a number of rules regarding the taxation of  distributions and benefits from section 403(b) contracts. These rules generally track the statutory  requirements applicable to such contracts,  distributed, that eligible rollover distributions are not taxed if directly rolled over or ansferred to an  eligible retirement plan, that non-direct rollovers are subject to mandatory withholding, and that the  payor must give proper written notice regarding eligible rollover distributions.  e.g., that section 72 applies to tax only amounts actually   7. Failures to Satisfy Section 403(b)   The final regulations include a new discussion of the effect of 403 (b) plan failures. In this regard, the  final regulations provide that, in the ordinary course, only the contracts to which a defect relates will be  adversely affected by the defect. As a result, operational defects will typically only effect the contracts to  which the defect relates. However, a failure to maintain a plan document, a nondiscrimination failure, or  an employer eligibility failure will affect all contracts under the plan.8. Nondiscrimination Requirement for Employer Contributions  The final regulations generally end a good faith noncompliance standard for 501(c)(3) employers and  the administrative safe harbors that were provided under Notice 89-23. Instead, the final regulations  apply the nondiscrimination rules that apply to 401(k) plans. For this purpose, the final regulations, like  the proposed regulations, provide standards for aggregating affiliated employers.9. Universal Availability  The final regulations include a number of clarifications related to the universal availability requirement.  For the most part, these clarifications track the changes that were suggested under the proposed  regulations. As a result, for example, the final regulations clarify that the universal availability  requirement applies in the case of a 501 (c)(3) entity, on a common law entity basis, and, in the case of a  governmental employer, on a common payroll basis. In addition, the final regulations repeal a number of  the prior law administrative exemptions from the universal availability requirement that were in Notice  89-23, including the exemption of union employees. The final regulations also expand on the exemption  from the universal availability requirement for part time employees. One new issue covered in the final  regulations is a clarification that the right to make Roth salary reduction contributions is subject to the  universal availability requirement. Significantly, the final regulations include a variety of delayed  effective dates for changes related to the universal availability and nondiscrimination requirements.10. Funding, Including Life Insurance   The final regulations retain the requirement in the proposed regulations that contributions to a section  403(b) plan must be transferred to the insurance company issuing the annuity contract ""within a period  that is not longer than is reasonable for the proper administration of the plan.""  addition, the final regulations, like the proposed regulations, provide that a life insurance contract, an  endowment contract, a health or accident insurance contact, or a property, casualty, or liability insurance  contract does not meet the definition of an annuity contract for purposes of section 403(b). potentially  significant new language, the final regulations provide that ""death benefits"" under an annuity contract are  permitted, assuming that they do not cause the contract to fail to satisfy any requirement applicable to  section 403(b) requirements, such as ""the incidental benefit requirement"" of Treas. Reg. section 1.401-1   (b)(1 )(i) and Treas. Reg. section 1.403(b)-6(g). The preamble notes that guidance concerning the  application of the incidental benefit requirement to ""permissible nonretirement benefits such as life,  accident, or health benefits"" is contained in revenue rulings. The extent to which this new provision of the  regulations will require annuity death benefits that are not life insurance under state law or federal tax law  to be limited by the incidental benefit test contained in these revenue rulings is unclear.11. Plan Terminations  The final regulations retain the rule that was included in the proposed regulations officially  acknowledging for the first time that an employer may terminate a section 403(b) arrangement that it  sponsors.12. Required Minimum Distributions  The final regulations, like the proposed regulations, state that a section 403(b) contract must meet the  section 40 1 (a)(9) minimum distribution rules in both form and operation. The provisions in the final  regulations relating to the section 40 1 (a)(9) minimum distribution rules generally are the same as those  set forth in the proposed regulations. However, the final regulations provide that for any section 403(b)  contract that is not part of a governmental plan or church plan, the ""required beginning date"" on which  required minimum distributions must commence under section 401 (a )(9)( C) for a 5-percent owner is  April 1 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the individual attains age 70Yz. Under  the proposed regulations, the required beginning date for a 5-percent owner was defined as the later of (1)  the calendar year in which the individual attains age and (2) the calendar year in which the  individual retires from employment with the employer maintaining the plan.   Like the proposed regulations, the final regulations provide that if an employee is eligible for both the  age 50 catch-up contribution under section 414(v) and the special section 403(b) catch-up contribution  for employees with at least 15 years of service, a catch-up contribution is treated first as a special section  403(b) catch-up contribution up to the extent such contribution is permitted, and then as an amount  contributed as an age 50 catch-up contribution.   The proposed regulations provided that for purposes of the special section 403(b) catch-up contribution  applicable to an employees of a qualified organization, the term ""health and welfare service agency,"" is  defined as either an organization whose primary activity is medical care or a section 501(c)(3)  organization whose primary activity is the prevention of cruelty to individuals or animals, or which  provides substantial personal services to the needy  to needy individuals). The final regulations expand this definition to include an adoption agency and an  agency that provides either home health services or assistance to individuals with substance abuse  problems or that provides help to the disabled.  The final regulations, like the proposed regulations, provide for the use of a separate account to track nonvested  amounts and amounts attributable to contributions that exceed the section 415 limits (""excess  contributions""). For excess contributions, to the extent that a separate account is maintained a participant's  contract will not be adversely affected by the excess contributions, provided that the excess contributions  are reported as taxable income. In both cases, the final regulations, like the proposed regulations, provide  that the separate account will be considered pmt of a separate contract that is a section 403( c) contract,  a non-qualified annuity contract.  (e.g., a tax-exempt organization that provides meals   15. Unresolved Issues   While the Regulations attempted to be complete, please note we are aware of several important but  unresolved issues, including:   a. the manner and form of agreement related to the required information sharing agreement between  vendors and employers; and   b. the applicability of information sharing requirements as to contracts for which the vendor has no  contact with the employer i.e., no flow or no transfer requests.

The division serves the public through its free Web site  search tools , toll-free telephone service and extensive written notices and correspondence. Controller Chiang has sponsored successful reform legislation removing restrictions that previously prevented the division from notifying persons believed to be the owners of unclaimed property already sent to the State, and the division has responded by mailing out nearly 1.6 million notices. The Controller is currently sponsoring additional reforms. Common types of unclaimed properties include bank accounts, safe deposit box contents, and securities.

Industry analysts believe the security industry will grow at double-digit rates over the next few years. Whats more, the industry is expected to grow for at least the next 15 to 20 years. So, how can you be part of this exciting industry growth  and launch a rewarding career?  Jeffrey T. Fowler , program manager for security management at AMU, provides tips and insights for entering and succeeding in the field. Where are the growth areas in the security industry? Principal growth occurs in several key areas: Corporations Critical infrastructure Overseas markets Governmental entities (local, state, and federal) Private Military Companies (PMCs) Corporations continue to turn to technology  and those who have expertise in that technology  to implement first-class security operations. Spending is on the rise as corporations take advantage of new advances in digital video, biometrics and other technologies. Current trends include the move to create a Chief Security Officer (CSO) position at the senior management level as well as the option of combining traditional physical security and information technology security functions. Legislation may provide another boost to the industry. Mandates are either in place or under review regarding additional security for chemical and petroleum facilities and other critical infrastructure sites.  For more information, take a look at one  piece of legislation,  H.R. 5695, Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Act of 2006 . Another major growth area is in countries such as China, India, Korea, and, of course, the Middle East. It is a global marketplace and major companies require security professionals well versed in the rules, regulations, customs and challenges inherent in managing a global security operation and a cross-cultural security force. For those willing to accept the risk of working in dangerous regions, opportunities abound in the field of security contracting in places such as Iraq and Afghanistan. Finally, due to massive force reductions in the uniformed military services of Western nations at the end of the Cold War, the current Global War on Terror has placed many military security responsibilities in the hands of private security contactors. Go to http://www.privatemilitary.org/pmcs.html for more information on these opportunities. Security and military expertise is in high demand with firms such as Triple Canopy, Blackwater USA, DynCorp International, and ArmorGroup International. These companies pay very well for those with the experience, expertise, and the self-discipline necessary to support coalition armed forces and client governments across the globe. What kinds of security positions are in high demand? The principle employment opportunities include training indigenous forces, executive protection services, and general security-related duties formerly associated with uniformed armed forces. There are also opportunities to consult with security and law enforcement agencies in those same areas as well as facility design and construction. There are many sub-specialties as well. For example, if a person is emerging from military service in the Middle East, and is well versed in operations there, he or she may find themselves very marketable to firms such as Blackwater USA, Aegis, or DynCorp International. In the private sector (corporate security), many of the agents and executives come from military or governmental backgrounds such as military police, FBI, and U.S. Secret Service. There are also those who have worked up through the corporate system from the ground level -- although they are not as common. It is important to remember that many lucrative security positions are not formally advertised. They are earned through networking and other contacts. Can you provide information about specific positions in network security? What can I expect to earn? Generally, security management positions offer a good starting salary and opportunities to advance. For example, a security architects salary ranges from about $70,000 to about $150,000, depending on experience, location and other factors. A security architect develops security policy and designs high-end network security solutions. A network intrusion detection specialist can earn between $60,000 to more than $100,000, again depending on experience, location and other factors. This position entails protecting against network security breaches, and addressing those breaches that do occur. An information assurance trainer can earn between $50,000 and $90,000. This position educates network engineers and end-users and integrates security measures and policies into a corporate culture. Keep in mind that many of these positions require at least an undergraduate degree and often require professional certifications. What are the opportunities in the executive protection arena? Executive protection operations are a fertile field for security professionals with the optimal mix of formal education, experience, and networked contacts. Gone are the days of bodyguards.  The modern executive protection professional must be well traveled, well educated, and able to move in the social circles of a society in which most principals (the persons being protected) live and work.  Most modern executive protection professionals have a bachelors degree in a related field and many have a masters degree. The security management masters program at American Military University is among the nations top higher education programs. The program is tailor-made for the security professional. In addition, the networked contacts may prove extremely valuable when seeking a position in executive protection. I would like to reach an executive level position. What qualities can help me earn a chief security officer position? Many chief executive officers look for a CSO with a background that establishes broad security competency, but also allows them to move unobtrusively and easily in the circles of senior management. The CSO should be well educated, conversant in a number of areas such as politics, the arts, sports, etc. You will also have an advantage if you are proficient in a foreign language. Perhaps, most importantly, the CSO must understand business and the vision of the firm in question. How important is having a security clearance? A validated clearance is highly marketable in the security world today. Many firms contract with the government and require personnel with security clearances. Fortunately, security personnel leaving military service already have this vetted security clearance at some level of authorization. Keep in mind that this asset can depreciate, if not used. The validity of a clearance is based on the time elapsed since leaving military service or a position in governmental or contracted service that required a clearance. What if I dont have a security clearance? Whats next? Not all security professionals have a validated security clearance. You can obtain one, however, through a process of extensive background checks and vetting of the prospective employee.  It is an involved process, but achievable. For more information about obtaining a security clearance, take a look at these  FAQs . I am interested in starting my own security firm. How can I prepare to do that? Establishing oneself as a security consultant takes skill, networked contacts, and a slow process of building your reputation. I recommend you read one or more of the following books: Security Consulting for the 21st Century Consultant , by Kelly E. Riddle Security Consulting  by Charles Sennewald These books will help familiarize you with effective use of networking, establishing credibility as you build your client base, effective advertising, and liability concerns. Also, consider the type of firm you would like to establish. Many consultants specialize in sub-specialties, such as security of educational institutions, aviation security, Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED), etc. I also encourage you to become active in professional organizations, such as  ASIS International , the  International Association of Professional Security Consultants , and the  American College of Forensic Examiners International . ASIS International is the premier professional organization for security professionals. It offers well-recognized certification programs, educational opportunities, and an annual national convention. The other organizations offer expertise in terms of security consulting and certification in homeland security specifically. Also, check out industry blogs  such as this  blog  on jobs for those with security clearance -- for networking opportunities. I cannot over-emphasize the importance of networking. Remember, a contact with which you do not occasionally touch base often becomes useless. Stay in touch! How can I be successful, for the long term? Long-term success stems from a combination of factors, such as the correct mix of formal education, experience, networked contacts, and sustained excellent performance.  Success in the 21st century also entails a firm understanding of change as a constant in our lives. The successful security professional also embraces a global philosophy. He or she harnesses the synergy inherent in a cross-cultural security force to achieve organizational vision in a timely and cost-effective manner. Perhaps most importantly, global security professionals understands that they are the keepers of the keys in both the literal and philosophical sense. They do not lose contact with their moral and ethical compass. Jeffrey T. Fowler, CPS, CHS-III, is program manager for   security management  at American Military University.

You will need additional information to title and register a vehicle if you are a  new Virginia resident  or  lease your vehicle .    What You Need to Bring with You     Your vehicle must be  titled  in Virginia prior to registration.     Once titled, complete an Application for Registration  (VSA 14)  and present:       The completed Application for Registration VSA14.   Your  emissions  certificate if your vehicle is garaged in the counties of Arlington, Fairfax, Loudoun, Prince William, or Stafford, or in the cities of Alexandria, Fairfax, Falls Church, Manassas, or Manassas Park.  Motorcycles are not required to have an emissions inspection.    Note:  When you have your vehicle's emissions system inspected, the emissions inspection station will electronically update your DMV vehicle record with the test results immediately. When registering your vehicle, DMV will not ask you for emissions information unless your vehicle failed the test or this information has not been received from the inspection station.   To purchase license plates or decals, you must certify that the vehicle is covered by the minimum insurance requirements or pay the  uninsured motor vehicle fee . Your insurance carrier must be authorized to conduct business in Virginia. Virginia requires the following minimum coverage:       Bodily injury/death of one person $25,000   Bodily injury/death of two or more persons $50,000   Property damage $20,000     Note:  If liability insurance coverage on a vehicle terminates or cancels during the registration period, either reinsure the vehicle, pay the uninsured motor vehicle fee or  surrender the license plates  to DMV.      Fees      Your  registration fee  is determined by the  empty weight or gross weight of your vehicle, the type of license plate you purchase  and if you register for one or two years.  If you register your vehicle for two years,  you will receive a $2 discount.  For convenience and fun, register your  vehicle for two years and purchase one of our   special plates .  Two-year registration  is not available if your vehicle has a gross weight of 55,000 pounds or more, is registered  under the International Registration Plan, or if you have paid the uninsured motor  vehicle fee.     Your License Plates    DMV will issue you two license plates, decals showing the expiration date and a registration card.  Place the decals on the plates.  Place the plates on the front and rear of your vehicle so that they are securely fastened and clearly visible.  If your vehicle is a motorcycle, tractor truck, semitrailer or trailer, DMV will issue you one license plate for the vehicle.  It is illegal to mount colored glass, plastic, or any other type of covering on your license plates that alters or obscures the letters, numbers, decals or the state where the vehicle is registered and when the registration expires. (a href=""http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?000+cod+46.2-716"">46.2-716)  Keep the registration card with you whenever you operate the vehicle.      Registration Renewal    After your first registration, DMV will mail your renewal notice prior to the  expiration date of your registration.  You can renew your registration  by  telephone ,  mail   or renew  online   or at any  DMV Select  or  customer service center .   A new Virginia law, effective July 1, 2008, encourages customers to save money and time by renewing vehicle registrations (decals) online, by telephone, through the mail or a DMV Select.    If you renew in person at a customer service center, you'll pay an additional $5 fee for each vehicle registration renewal transaction.   Here are your service options:      Internet .  Renew online at  www.dmvNOW.com , receive a $1 discount, avoid the $5 fee.    Mail .  Avoid the $5 fee by mailing in the vehicle renewal notice.  Most customers receive their vehicle registration materials within five days, but U.S. mail delivery times vary.  Please allow 15 days to receive your decals before contacting DMV.     Telephone .  Renew by using the DMV automated service (1-888-337-4782) to avoid the $5 fee.    DMV Select .  Visit one of the 50 DMV Select offices in Virginia to avoid the $5 fee.  Visit  www.dmvNOW.com  for a list of DMV Select locations.    Customer Service Centers .  Customers who renew their vehicle registrations in a CSC beginning July 1, 2008 will pay an additional $5.     The fee will not apply if your registration renewal is conducted with another transaction for you, and the second transaction cannot be completed online, by mail, by telephone or at a DMV Select location.    Only a few transactions must be completed at a CSC, such as an application for an original driver's license.        If you renew vehicle registration for two years, you receive a $2 discount.   The discounts for Internet and two-year renewals are not prorated and not refundable if the registration is canceled before it expires.      If you own a vehicle registered in Virginia and are serving, or have served, outside of the United States on active duty military service, the Code of Virginia,  6.2-221.4 , grants you a 90-day grace period, from the date you return to the United States, in which to renew your current registration.  The grace period applies to qualifying vehicles only.  To be eligible for the grace period, the vehicle must:     Be owned or leased by you while you were serving outside of the United States in the armed services of the United States;  Have had valid registration issued by DMV at the time you began service in the armed forces outside of the United States;  Be properly insured;  Display the latest license plates and decals issued by DMV for the vehicle;  AND   Be operated only by you, or another person who qualifies for the grace period, while possessing:   Orders or other military documentation demonstrating that you, or they, are entitled to the grace period;   AND   The latest registration card issued by DMV for the vehicle.        If possible, you may renew your qualifying vehicle registration prior to returning to Virginia.  You do not have to wait until you are in the grace period to renew.   Local Vehicle Registration Program     DMV also collects the local vehicle registration fee for localities that participate in the  Local Vehicle Registration Program .       State Agencies:    Refer to  state-owned vehicles  for additional information.

Compliance Strategies                               What is Franchise Tax Board doing            to address this problem?           What is the Internal Revenue Service            doing to address abusive tax schemes?           What are the Franchise Tax Board and            the Internal Revenue Service doing jointly to address abusive tax schemes?           What are the Franchise Tax Board and other states doing jointly to address abusive tax schemes?           Is the Franchise Tax Board joining            with Internal Revenue Service on their compliance initiatives and offering            taxpayers the same benefits if they provide information or file amended            returns?                   Audit Information                               How does the Franchise Tax Board            identify these abusive tax schemes?           When did the Franchise Tax Board            begin identifying and auditing this new generation of abusive tax schemes?                       Is the Franchise Tax Board auditing            returns or waiting for the Internal Revenue Service to conduct an audit?           Who examines tax returns claiming            abusive tax scheme losses?           Is the Franchise Tax Board auditing            tax return preparers or promoters of abusive tax schemes?           How long do abusive tax scheme audits            take?           What are the documents commonly asked for during an audit?                   Penalties                               Is the Franchise Tax Board assessing            penalties against taxpayers on abusive tax schemes?                   Practices and Procedures                               Will the Franchise Tax Board pursue            criminal investigations or civil injunctions?           Will the Franchise Tax Board issue            subpoenas?                   General Information                       What is an abusive tax scheme?             Generally, an abusive tax scheme has no business              purpose other than reducing taxes and is promoted with:                           The promise of tax benefits.               Predictable tax losses or tax consequences.                No related economic loss experienced with respect to the taxpayer's                income or assets.                         Who invests in abusive tax              schemes?              Individuals and business entities with large, constant              streams of income or with substantial gains from one-time events may              invest in abusive tax schemes.             Why did abusive tax schemes              become so common?             Abusive tax schemes multiplied in the 1990's for              various reasons:                           Taxpayers had large capital gains or other income subject to income                tax.               Internal Revenue Service compliance activity decreased.               Promoters increased the marketing of abusive tax schemes as 'legally                defensible' ways to minimize tax burdens.               Penalties for participating in abusive tax schemes were too small                to have a deterrent effect.               There was no efficient disclosure and reporting system for abusive                tax schemes.                                Fiscal Impact to California             How many tax dollars are lost              in California due to abusive tax schemes?             We estimate California lost between $2.4 and $4 billion              in tax revenue over the last four years.             Who really pays for the tax              dollars lost due to abusive tax schemes?             To the extent that government expenses are static              and investments in abusive tax schemes reduce the tax burden of one              segment of the public, the real cost of abusive tax schemes is borne              by taxpayers who correctly file their returns and pay their fair share              of taxes.             How many cases has the Franchise              Tax Board identified with abusive tax schemes and what is the associated              revenue?              We have identified over 380 taxpayers investing in              abusive tax schemes. We expect that number to grow as we dedicate              more resources to this area. By partnering with the Internal Revenue              Service, we avoid duplicating audit activity and optimize the number              of taxpayers examined. We estimate the potential revenue from those              380 cases at $1 billion. Unfortunately, California will not collect              the tax revenues for several years because the audits and administrative              appeal process take a number of years to resolve.                    Compliance Strategies             What is the Franchise Tax Board              doing to address this problem?             We:                           Exchange information with the Internal Revenue                Service related to audit activity and leads identifying abusive                tax schemes.               Participate in several federal/state taskforce                teams.               Increase our audit focus on these cases.               Refer cases to FTB's Criminal Investigations if                there is potential criminal activity.               Work with the Legislature to create new tools                to combat abusive tax schemes, to provide avenues for taxpayers                to come back into compliance, and to provide clarity for taxpayers                considering abusive tax avoidance investments. These tools include:                  a. A state voluntary compliance initiative.                  b. Stiffer penalties for participating in or marketing abusive                  tax avoidance transactions.                  c. An extended statute of limitations (8 years) for issuing a                deficiency.                            Consider non-legislative remedies to combat abusive                tax schemes and provide methods promoting self-compliance. These                remedies include reviewing the rules and procedures associated with:                  a. Accuracy related penalties.                  b. Claims for refund.                c. Following federal determinations.                               Follow the Internal Revenue Service compliance                initiatives to the extent allowed by California law.               Publicize our audit activity and our working relationship                with the Internal Revenue Service.               Educate both tax practitioners and taxpayers to                the pitfalls of investing in abusive tax schemes.                         What is the Internal Revenue              Service doing to address abusive tax schemes?             The Internal Revenue Service describes their efforts              to address these abusive tax schemes in depth on their websites at:               http://www.irs.gov/businesses/corporations/article/0,,id=97384,00.html                             http ://www.irs.gov/individuals/content/0,,id=97749,00.html                                        What are the Franchise Tax              Board and the Internal Revenue Service doing jointly to address abusive              tax schemes?             Franchise Tax Board and the Internal Revenue Service              Small Business and Self-Employed Division signed a                Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)  on 09/16/2003. The MOU will              streamline the exchange of knowledge and information between the two              agencies and avoid duplication of effort. The MOU will allow us to              share names of those participating in abusive tax schemes, training              materials, and other related information. Benefits of the MOU include:                           Avoiding duplicate audits of the same taxpayer.               Providing a united compliance front to taxpayers                and their representatives.               Enabling both agencies to identify, examine, and                bring more taxpayers into compliance.               Maximizing federal and state resources by working                together, including the development of legal arguments and strategies.               Allowing consistent treatment of taxpayers' transactions                by both agencies.                Sharing more information about the numerous tax                schemes.               Sharing leads, tax returns and other audit information                early in the audit cycle rather than waiting until the examination                is completed.                Coordinating training, marketing efforts, and                educational materials.               Enhancing the Franchise Tax Board's ability to                reduce the outflow of critical California revenues.                         What are the Franchise Tax              Board and other states doing jointly to address abusive tax schemes?             On March 4, 2004, the Franchise Tax Board and 34              other participating states ratified a  Memorandum              of Agreement (MOA)  to share information about abusive tax schemes.              Currently, 11 other states are considering participation. The MOA              streamlines the exchange of knowledge and information between participating              states and avoids duplication of effort. The MOA allows us to share              names of those participating in abusive tax schemes, training materials,              and other related information. The MOA incorporates the Federation              of Tax Administrators Uniform Exchange of Information Agreement of              January 1, 1993. Benefits of the MOA include:                           Promoting efficient use of state resources.               Avoiding duplicate audits of the same taxpayer.               Providing a united compliance front to taxpayers                and their representatives.               Enabling participating states to identify, examine,                and bring more taxpayers into compliance.               Maximizing state resources by working together,                including the development of legal arguments and strategies.               Conducting joint compliance activities to avoid                duplication of efforts and to optimize the use of the states' resources.               Applying consistent treatment of similar transactions.               Sharing more information about specific tax schemes.               Sharing leads, tax returns, and other audit information                early in the audit cycle.               Coordinating training, marketing efforts, and                educational materials.               Enhancing the Franchise Tax Board's ability to                reduce the outflow of critical California revenues.                         Is the Franchise Tax Board              joining with Internal Revenue Service on their compliance initiatives              and offering taxpayers the same benefits if they provide information              or file amended returns?              We evaluate each Internal Revenue Service initiative              to determine if it applies under California tax laws. We issue press              releases to publicize our position and to encourage affected taxpayers              to file amended federal and California returns.             Specifically, we will follow the provisions of the              federal Offshore Voluntary Compliance Initiative program. California              taxpayers participating in the federal program must correctly file              their California amended returns by October 15, 2003               (see Press Release dated March 14, 2003 ). We will work with the              Internal Revenue Service to exchange offshore data, subpoenas and              other summons information when auditing taxpayers who chose not to              participate in the federal program.                    Audit Information             How does the Franchise Tax              Board identify these abusive tax schemes?              We use federal and state data to identify and examine              tax returns for abusive tax schemes. We also get information from              informants, and Franchise Tax Board or Internal Revenue Service audit              activity, that identifies other investors and abusive tax schemes.             When did the Franchise Tax              Board begin identifying and auditing this new generation of abusive              tax schemes?             We began identifying and auditing the new generation              of abusive tax schemes in 1999.             Is the Franchise Tax Board              auditing returns or waiting for the Internal Revenue Service to conduct              an audit?             We audit taxpayers not under Internal Revenue Service              examination. We work closely with the Internal Revenue Service to              identify and develop cases that do not duplicate Internal Revenue              Service audits. In addition to receiving Internal Revenue Service              audit results, we share audit results with the Internal Revenue Service.                         Who examines tax returns claiming              abusive tax scheme losses?             Experienced audit staff examines returns claiming              abusive tax scheme losses. Attorneys, tax practitioners, and promoters              developed abusive tax schemes using sophisticated tax planning schemes,              which intentionally abuse the tax laws’ true purpose and require              intensive examinations. The Internal Revenue Service and the Franchise              Tax Board also use experts including economists, financial consultants,              attorneys and others to examine these abusive tax schemes.             Is the Franchise Tax Board              auditing tax return preparers or promoters of abusive tax schemes?             Yes. We will pursue leads, audits and investigations              of investors, tax return preparers and promoters associated with abusive              tax schemes.              How long do abusive tax scheme              audits take?              The length of the audit depends on the complexity              of the scheme and the amount of available information. Audits may              take up to two years to complete.                    Penalties             Is the Franchise Tax Board              assessing penalties against taxpayers on abusive tax schemes?             Yes. We assess penalties appropriate to the facts              and circumstances of each case. For abusive tax schemes, we assess              the accuracy related penalty unless the taxpayer shows reasonable              cause existed for their position. For non-corporate taxpayers, to              be excused from the accuracy related penalty, the taxpayer must have              a reasonable basis for his or her reporting position or substantial              authority must exist which includes a reasonable belief the tax treatment              is more likely than not the proper treatment. See Treasury Regulations              sections 1.6662-3 and 1.6664 and California Revenue and Taxation Code              section 19164. Generally, Franchise Tax Board and Internal Revenue              Service auditors have found the defenses of substantial authority              or reasonable cause are not relevant. Therefore, assessment of the              accuracy related penalty is frequently appropriate.                    Practices and Procedures             Will the Franchise Tax Board              pursue criminal investigations or civil injunctions?             Yes. We will pursue all available avenues to address              abusive tax schemes.             Will the Franchise Tax Board              issue subpoenas?                Yes. We will issue subpoenas as necessary to address              abusive tax schemes.                                                                                      Back to Top  |  Webmaster               |  Disclaimer  |  Privacy  |  Request Public Information  |  Conditions of Use     Copyright © 2007 State of California

Examples of income tax fraud are:            Failing to report all income received.      Claiming to be a resident of another state while residing in California.      Making false or fraudulent claims for refunds.      Not filing state income tax returns.      Questionable tax practitioner practices.      Opening and closing of new businesses to evade taxes.      Preparing documents, books, and records that understate the true income or overstate the expenses of a business.

clueweb09-enwp01-58-05830	"                     457 plan          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia        (Redirected from  457(b) )            Jump to:  navigation ,  search          The  457 plan  is a type of  tax advantaged  defined contribution  retirement plan  that is available for  governmental  and certain non-governmental employers in the  United States . The employer provides the plan and the employee  defers compensation  into it on a pre- tax  basis. For the most part the plan operates similarly to a  401(k)  or  403(b)  plan most people are familiar with in the US. The key difference is unlike a 401(k) plan, there is no 10% penalty for withdrawal before the age of 59 1/2 (although the withdrawal is subject to  ordinary income  taxation). Another difference is that 457 plan participant cannot make designated Roth contributions as participants in appropriately  ammended 401(k)  and  403(b)  plans can. Also 457 plans (both governmental and non governmental) can allow  independent contractors  to participate in the plan where 401(k) and 403(b) plans cannot. [ 1 ]           Contents       1   Changes with EGTRRA 2001     1.1   Catch-up provisions       2   Governmental and non-governmental plans     2.1   Non-governmental plans     2.1.1   457(f) (ineligible) plans           3   Notes   4   External links and references               [ edit ]   Changes with EGTRRA 2001   The  Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001  (EGTRRA) made a number of changes in how governmental 457 plans are treated, the most notable of which is the coordination of benefits limitation was removed. This allows a person whose employer has a  401(k)  or  403(b)  and a 457 to defer the maximum contribution amounts to  both  plans instead of coordinating the total and only being able to meet a single limit amount. Thus a participant can contribute the maximum $16,500 for 2009 into their 401(k) and also the maximum $16,500 into their 457 plan. If that person is over age 50 they can contribute the additional catch up amount into each plan also, meaning an additional $5,500 into the 401(k) and another $5,500 into their governmental 457 (catch-up contributions are not provided for non-governmental 457 plans). The total would then be $42,000 deferred instead of the $21,500 that would have been allowed if the coordination of benefits provision had not been repealed in regard to the governmental 457 plan. As a result, many governmental employers have now set up 457 and 401(k) plans for their employees, and non-profit employers have set up 403(b) and 457 plans each allowing their employees to invest in both. Some  state universities  and  school districts  have access to all three tax-deferred plans. However, the total combined annual contribution to 401(k) and 403(b) plans is subject to the $16,500 limit and $5,500 catchup limit.   Other notable changes made in the EGTRRA legislation were increasing the maximum deferral amount from the approximately $8,500 that was previously allowed to the same maximum elective deferral amount that 401(k) plans and now 403(b) plans allow, and easing restrictions on some plan rollovers. Governmental 457 plans may be rolled into other types of retirement plans with few restrictions beyond the normal ones for any other type of employer provided plan, which includes separation of service or disability. This includes other 401(k) and 403(b) plans and also  IRA's . IRA's have much greater flexibility in withdrawal and conversion privileges. In contrast, non-governmental 457 plans can only be rolled into another non-governmental 457 plan.     [ edit ]   Catch-up provisions   The 457 plan allows for two types of catch-up provisions. The first is similar to other defined contribution plans and amounts to an additional $5,500 that can be contributed as noted above. The second (only available to governmental 457 plans) is much more complicated and can be elected instead by an employee that is within 3 years of normal  retirement  age (and perhaps eligible retirement at any age). This second catch-up option is equal to the full employee deferral limit or another $16,500 for 2009. Thus, a person over 50 within 3 years of retirement and both a 457 and a 401(k) could defer a total of $52,500 into their retirement plans by utilizing all of their catch-up provisions. The second type of catch-up provision is limited to unused deferral limits from previous years. An employee that had deferred the maximum amount of money into the 457 plan every year they were employed previously would not be able to utilize this extra catch-up.     [ edit ]   Governmental and non-governmental plans   There are two primary types of the plans, governmental and non-governmental. Some governmental plans were under 457(g) but those plans may no longer be created. Most governmental and non-governmental plans are 457(b) plans.     [ edit ]   Non-governmental plans   Non-governmental plans can now be set up by non-profit organizations in addition to their 403(b) plans. They may either be ""eligible"" plans set up under section 457(b) or ""ineligible"" plans set up under section 457(f).  ERISA  legislation has said that non-governmental plans must be limited to some group of higher compensation employees. The level of compensation required is not specified by ERISA, but it must be according to some ascertainable standard that the employer sets. The same highly compensated limit ($100,000 a year for 2006) in place for 401(k) discrimination testing would likely be acceptable, as would restricting the plan to some class of employees such as directors or officers. Because of this limitation to higher-compensation employees, 457(b) plans are often referred to as ""top hat"" plans.   Non-governmental 457 plans have a number of restrictions that governmental ones do not. Money deferred into non-governmental 457 plans may not be rolled into any other type of tax-deferred retirement plan. It may be rolled only into another non-governmental 457 plan. Also, money deferred into non-governmental plans is not set aside in a  trust  for the exclusive benefit of the employee making the deferral. The Internal Revenue Code requires that money in a non-governmental 457 plan remains the property of the employer and is thus available to general  creditors  of the employer in  legal  or  bankruptcy  proceedings.     [ edit ]   457(f) (ineligible) plans   IRS code section 457(f) allows for non-governmental, non-profit organizations to set up a plan that can be tax deferred and exceed the normal defined contribution employee deferral limit. Ineligible 457 plans are made available because non-profit organizations are not allowed to have another kind of non-qualified deferred compensation plan.   Generally, these deferred amounts would be currently taxable under Section 83 of the Code, unless the employee faces a ""substantial risk of forfeiture"" which has been clarified by the IRS to mean that in addition to the money remaining available to general creditors of the organization or subject to not vesting if the employee does not stay with the employer for the full vesting period. When the risk of forfeiture is gone, the value of the property given to the employee ceases to be deferred from taxation and is included in current ordinary gross income.   Another plan design, the  rabbi trust , gives the employee deferred money in a trust and is funded, but must be available to creditors. This is to make the employer junior to general creditors so that the employee can avoid current inclusion into income.   These general deferral of current income conditions of Section 83 (as explained in  Revenue Ruling  60-31 would give the 457(f) plan the deferral of tax desired.   In 2004 Congress passed a tax act which added  Section 409A  to the tax code and applies to deferred nonqualified compensation which also covers some 457(f) plans. This was in response to the executive bonus plans given to key employees at  Enron  which allowed them early access to their deferred compensation if financial conditions of the employer deteriorated (i.e., if Enron got into  trouble ).

clueweb09-enwp00-18-05830	"                     457 plan          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia        (Redirected from  457(b) )            Jump to:  navigation ,  search          The  457 plan  is a type of  tax advantaged  defined contribution  retirement plan  that is available for  governmental  and certain non-governmental employers in the  United States . The employer provides the plan and the employee  defers compensation  into it on a pre- tax  basis. For the most part the plan operates similarly to a  401(k)  or  403(b)  plan most people are familiar with in the US. The key difference is unlike a 401(k) plan, there is no 10% penalty for withdrawal before the age of 59 1/2 (although the withdrawal is subject to  ordinary income  taxation). Another difference is that 457 plan participant cannot make designated Roth contributions as participants in appropriately  ammended 401(k)  and  403(b)  plans can. Also 457 plans (both governmental and non governmental) can allow  independent contractors  to participate in the plan where 401(k) and 403(b) plans cannot. [ 1 ]           Contents       1   Changes with EGTRRA 2001     1.1   Catch-up provisions       2   Governmental and non-governmental plans     2.1   Non-governmental plans     2.1.1   457(f) (ineligible) plans           3   Notes   4   External links and references               [ edit ]   Changes with EGTRRA 2001   The  Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001  (EGTRRA) made a number of changes in how governmental 457 plans are treated, the most notable of which is the coordination of benefits limitation was removed. This allows a person whose employer has a  401(k)  or  403(b)  and a 457 to defer the maximum contribution amounts to  both  plans instead of coordinating the total and only being able to meet a single limit amount. Thus a participant can contribute the maximum $16,500 for 2009 into their 401(k) and also the maximum $16,500 into their 457 plan. If that person is over age 50 they can contribute the additional catch up amount into each plan also, meaning an additional $5,500 into the 401(k) and another $5,500 into their governmental 457 (catch-up contributions are not provided for non-governmental 457 plans). The total would then be $42,000 deferred instead of the $21,500 that would have been allowed if the coordination of benefits provision had not been repealed in regard to the governmental 457 plan. As a result, many governmental employers have now set up 457 and 401(k) plans for their employees, and non-profit employers have set up 403(b) and 457 plans each allowing their employees to invest in both. Some  state universities  and  school districts  have access to all three tax-deferred plans. However, the total combined annual contribution to 401(k) and 403(b) plans is subject to the $16,500 limit and $5,500 catchup limit.   Other notable changes made in the EGTRRA legislation were increasing the maximum deferral amount from the approximately $8,500 that was previously allowed to the same maximum elective deferral amount that 401(k) plans and now 403(b) plans allow, and easing restrictions on some plan rollovers. Governmental 457 plans may be rolled into other types of retirement plans with few restrictions beyond the normal ones for any other type of employer provided plan, which includes separation of service or disability. This includes other 401(k) and 403(b) plans and also  IRA's . IRA's have much greater flexibility in withdrawal and conversion privileges. In contrast, non-governmental 457 plans can only be rolled into another non-governmental 457 plan.     [ edit ]   Catch-up provisions   The 457 plan allows for two types of catch-up provisions. The first is similar to other defined contribution plans and amounts to an additional $5,500 that can be contributed as noted above. The second (only available to governmental 457 plans) is much more complicated and can be elected instead by an employee that is within 3 years of normal  retirement  age (and perhaps eligible retirement at any age). This second catch-up option is equal to the full employee deferral limit or another $16,500 for 2009. Thus, a person over 50 within 3 years of retirement and both a 457 and a 401(k) could defer a total of $52,500 into their retirement plans by utilizing all of their catch-up provisions. The second type of catch-up provision is limited to unused deferral limits from previous years. An employee that had deferred the maximum amount of money into the 457 plan every year they were employed previously would not be able to utilize this extra catch-up.     [ edit ]   Governmental and non-governmental plans   There are two primary types of the plans, governmental and non-governmental. Some governmental plans were under 457(g) but those plans may no longer be created. Most governmental and non-governmental plans are 457(b) plans.     [ edit ]   Non-governmental plans   Non-governmental plans can now be set up by non-profit organizations in addition to their 403(b) plans. They may either be ""eligible"" plans set up under section 457(b) or ""ineligible"" plans set up under section 457(f).  ERISA  legislation has said that non-governmental plans must be limited to some group of higher compensation employees. The level of compensation required is not specified by ERISA, but it must be according to some ascertainable standard that the employer sets. The same highly compensated limit ($100,000 a year for 2006) in place for 401(k) discrimination testing would likely be acceptable, as would restricting the plan to some class of employees such as directors or officers. Because of this limitation to higher-compensation employees, 457(b) plans are often referred to as ""top hat"" plans.   Non-governmental 457 plans have a number of restrictions that governmental ones do not. Money deferred into non-governmental 457 plans may not be rolled into any other type of tax-deferred retirement plan. It may be rolled only into another non-governmental 457 plan. Also, money deferred into non-governmental plans is not set aside in a  trust  for the exclusive benefit of the employee making the deferral. The Internal Revenue Code requires that money in a non-governmental 457 plan remains the property of the employer and is thus available to general  creditors  of the employer in  legal  or  bankruptcy  proceedings.     [ edit ]   457(f) (ineligible) plans   IRS code section 457(f) allows for non-governmental, non-profit organizations to set up a plan that can be tax deferred and exceed the normal defined contribution employee deferral limit. Ineligible 457 plans are made available because non-profit organizations are not allowed to have another kind of non-qualified deferred compensation plan.   Generally, these deferred amounts would be currently taxable under Section 83 of the Code, unless the employee faces a ""substantial risk of forfeiture"" which has been clarified by the IRS to mean that in addition to the money remaining available to general creditors of the organization or subject to not vesting if the employee does not stay with the employer for the full vesting period. When the risk of forfeiture is gone, the value of the property given to the employee ceases to be deferred from taxation and is included in current ordinary gross income.   Another plan design, the  rabbi trust , gives the employee deferred money in a trust and is funded, but must be available to creditors. This is to make the employer junior to general creditors so that the employee can avoid current inclusion into income.   These general deferral of current income conditions of Section 83 (as explained in  Revenue Ruling  60-31 would give the 457(f) plan the deferral of tax desired.   In 2004 Congress passed a tax act which added  Section 409A  to the tax code and applies to deferred nonqualified compensation which also covers some 457(f) plans. This was in response to the executive bonus plans given to key employees at  Enron  which allowed them early access to their deferred compensation if financial conditions of the employer deteriorated (i.e., if Enron got into  trouble ).

clueweb09-enwp00-15-05861	"                     403(b)          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia                 Jump to:  navigation ,  search                    This article  needs additional  citations  for  verification .  Please help  improve this article  by adding  reliable references . Unsourced material may be  challenged  and removed.  (November 2008)       A  403(b)  plan is a  tax -advantaged  retirement  savings plan available for  public education   organizations , some  non-profit  employers (only  US Tax Code  501(c)(3) organizations), and  self-employed   ministers  in the  United States . It has tax treatment similar to a  401(k)  plan, especially after the  Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 . Simply put, employee salary deferrals into a 403(b) plan are made before income tax is paid and allowed to grow tax deferred until the money is taxed as income when withdrawn from the plan. Beginning in 2006, 403(b) and 401(k) plans may also include designated  Roth  contributions, i.e., after-tax contributions, which, if certain requirements are met, will allow tax-free withdrawals. Primarily the designated Roth contributions have to be in the plan for at least five taxable years.             This article's  factual accuracy  may be compromised due to out-of-date information . Please help  improve the article  by updating it. There may be information on the  talk page .       The  Employee Retirement Income Security Act  (ERISA) does not require 403(b) plans to be technically ""qualified"" plans, i.e., plans governed by US Tax Code 401(a), but have the same general appearance as qualified plans. While the option is available it is not known how prevalent or if any 403(b) plan has been started or amended to be ERISA-qualified. This is because the main advantage of ERISA plans for participants has been in the event of  bankruptcy  of the account holder, but that advantage ceased to exist after the October 2005  Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act  extended bankruptcy protection to 403b plans. While they are different in some fundamental ways qualified and unqualified plans appear almost the same to the participant and the options available are very similar. The only important differences for the participant are some additional ways that they can withdraw employer money, not salary-deferral money, before the typical 59 1/2 age restriction, but only if the plan is funded with  annuities  and not  mutual funds . The federal government wants to eliminate this difference in proposed regulations expected to be finalized in 2007.   From a plan administration standpoint, 403(b) plans do not have many of the same technical difficulties that 401(k)s do, such as discrimination testing, especially if the plan is not an ERISA plan. If the plan  is  an ERISA plan (the employer makes contributions to employee accounts) there are additional restrictions and administrative issues applicable to those employer contributions, but not if a plan of a government employer which is not subject to  discrimination testing .   Salary-deferral contributions are not subject to complicated discrimination testing. 403(b) plans are instead subject to universal availability which, briefly and in general, means all employees must be permitted to make salary-deferral contributions. 403(b) plans also have simpler and less costly annual reporting requirements on  Internal Revenue Service  (IRS) Form 5500, including not having the independent auditor requirement applicable to qualified plans with more than 100 plan participants.           Contents       1   Staying Compliant with 403(b)Plans   2   Bankruptcy protection before 2005   3   See also   4   External links               [ edit ]   Staying Compliant with 403(b)Plans   On December 11, 2008 the IRS gave 403(b) plan sponsors a one-year reprieve for adopting a written plan document. A 403(b) plan, also known as a tax-sheltered annuity plan, is a retirement plan for employees of specific tax-exempt organizations such as health care organizations and colleges and universities. While the relief provisions from the IRS give 403(b) a full year to adopt a written plan document, the plans still must operate in compliance with 403(b) plan requirements.     [ edit ]   Bankruptcy protection before 2005   Before the passage of the bankruptcy reform act in 2005, a 403(b) that was not an ERISA plan was not accorded protected status as property that could be claimed as exempt by the debtor under the  U.S. Bankruptcy Code . In  In re Barnes , 264 B.R. 415 (Bankr. E.D. Mich. 2001) Judge Spector held that the fixed income annuity was not such a trust and could be reached by creditors. The variable account was held to fall within 541(c)(2) and was thus protected. Under the revised bankruptcy laws, 403(b) accounts,  IRAs , and other retirement accounts are, in general, protected from  creditors  in bankruptcy.   For this reason, having an ERISA  anti-alienation clause [1]  was protective of pensions before the bankruptcy law revisions, giving those pensions the same protection as a  spendthrift trust . Some critics argued that this is disparate treatment of similar pension schemes and that more consistent protection was called for. The  United States Congress  took this argument to heart in the 2005 bankruptcy reform.
