GX035-74-13307641	"Front Page       Previous Story       Next Story           NIH Holds First Symposium on Human Embryonic Stem Cells    Scientists at the first NIH research symposium on recent progress                and future promise of human embryonic stem cells (hESC) proved                that, as in many things, timing and location are everything.                Understanding the molecular and cellular processes that regulate                normal human embryonic cell differentiation into multiple types of                cells poses many challenges. Other challenges are embedded in                understanding the unique capacity of these fledgling cells to be both                pluripotent and indefinitely self-renewing.                    On June 12, an overflow crowd in Masur Auditorium witnessed, in                person and by webcast, the intriguing possibilities of emerging                knowledge about hESCs and opportunities to interweave and to                share breaking information. Principal investigators representing                laboratories both within NIH and from across the country raised key                questions about molecular signaling that leads to the differentiation                of hESCs into specific cell types.                    Dr. James F. Battey, Jr., director of the National Institute on                Deafness and Other Communication Disorders and chairman of the                NIH stem cell task force, opened the meeting with the hope and                plan that this should be the first of many such symposia. The task                force is a team of leading scientists who meet with and seek advice                from scientific leaders in order to advance the field of stem cell                research.         NINDS' Dr. Ron McKay                               In introducing the first plenary panel devoted to discussion of the                characterization of undifferentiated stem cells, NIEHS's Michael                McClure harkened back to the Yankees' accidental pundit Yogi                Berra's famous observation — ""If you don't know where                you're going, you'll be lost when you get there."" Leading off the                session, Ron McKay, a principal investigator in the NINDS                intramural program, cautioned that in looking at therapeutic                possibilities of hESCs in the future, it is imperative that the hESC                ""makes exactly the right kind of neuron."" Daniella Gerhard from                NCI described her investigation of the transcriptome of a number of                currently available cell lines. Her presentation underscored the                importance of shared resources. Mahendra Rao from NIA is also                developing infrastructure resources for human embryonic stem cell                research, and focused on understanding of developmental                mechanisms that are likely to lead to novel approaches in preventing                and treating neurological disorders of aging. Using a prototype for                the targeted acquisition of desired neuronal phenotypes, Steven                Goldman, an extramural investigator at Weill Medical College of                Cornell University, described the induction and isolation of spinal                motor neurons from hESC.          NIDCD director Dr. James Battey Jr. (foreground) listens to                presentation as part of Masur Auditorium audience.                                     John Thomas from NHLBI introduced the second panel exploring                topics related to differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells. George                Daley from the Whitehead Institute described characterization of                signaling pathways that trigger self-renewal. His team is using                methods of viral gene transduction to accomplish this work. Dan                Kaufman, from the University of Minnesota, focused his discussion                on the role of stromal cell co-culture to promote differentiation into                hematopoietic cells. Timothy Kamp, from the University of                Wisconsin Medical School, described the ability of hESCs to                provide a renewable source of distinct types of human cardiac                myocytes. This ability may have application for pharmacological                testing and possible therapeutic applications. Esmail D. Zanjani from                Sierra Biomedical Research Corp., reported on his work using fetal                sheep. His team's work shows that cells derived from hESCs can                engraft and undergo multilineage differentiation. Gordon Zeller from                the Mt. Sinai School of Medicine focused on ways to promote                differentiation into one of the three developmental lineages:                ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm.        Participating in a panel discussion are (from l) Dr. John                McDonald III, Washington University, St. Louis; Dr. Su-Chun                Zhang, University of Wisconsin-Madison; and Dr. James Huettner,                also of Washington University, St. Louis.                     Thaddeus Golos, University of Wisconsin, presented his findings on                hESC differentiation into placental trophoblast cells and on placental                morphogenesis. James Huettner from Washington University in St.                Louis emphasized in his discussion that ""the development of                successful therapies for neurodegenerative disorders involving hESC                cells will require the functional evaluation of electrical signaling                capability."" Su-Chun Zhang, University of Wisconsin Medical                School, described the neural specification of hESC, noting the                importance of understanding neural induction and patterning in                humans; this can lead to an optimized procedure for generating                enriched or purified neuroepithelia and specialized neural cells. John                McDonald III's group, also at Washington University in St. Louis, is                investigating ultrastructural features of hESC that can lead to novel                strategies of CNS repair in both mouse models and, eventually, in                humans.                    At the conclusion of the plenary session, Dr. Elias Zerhouni, NIH                director, noted, ""There is no better way to assess the state of the                science than to have the best scientists who are really doing it                assembled in one place together."" Observing that the acceleration of                research on hESCs must be built upon a foundation of facts,                Zerhouni added, ""I have a personal commitment and NIH is fully                committed [to move] as fast as we can and provide the resources to                do so...I want the science to drive the agenda.""                Dr. Elias Zerhouni  A noontime poster session of work from six laboratories was                followed by workshops on material transfer agreements and                intellectual property issues of stem cell research; hESC research                training; federal guidelines on stem cell research; NIH                implementation; and culture techniques for hESCs.                  The symposium was developed by a planning committee that                included representatives from 9 institutes and the Office of the                Director, NIH, including NIDCD's Battey, chair; L. Tony Beck,                NCRR; Jill Carrington, NIA; Della Hann, OD; Eleni Kousvelari,                NIDCR; Michael E. McClure, NIEHS; Belinda Seto, OD;                Beth-Anne Sieber, NIMH; Richard J. Tasca, NICHD; John W.                Thomas, NHLBI; Baldwin Wong, NIDCD; and Marion Zatz,                NIGMS.

Cyber-mentoring, or Ementoring         as it's sometimes called, means working with a student interested in         a field with his/her school work, projects and interests. It also         means helping the student explore the possibility of making the field         his/her career. Meetings with the  student are face to face at his/her         high school initially and once a month thereafter but otherwise communication         is primarily by email or by telephone.          The program will serve Santa Fe, Pojoaque and Española high schools.                    Mentoring New Mexico, a non-profit mentoring program, will provide the         necessary training (at the Lab), background checks (as needed) and will       match you with an appropriate student by field.

Updated 1/9/03                         Employees leaving Lab must attend termination presentation         Employees who are leaving the Laboratory or changing to casual status          must attend a benefits termination presentation held by Benefits (HR-B).         The termination presentations are held every Laboratory pay day for University          of California Lab employees. Employees who are retiring aren't required          to attend a presentation, but rather, they should schedule a meeting with          their designated benefits specialist.         The presentations begin at 8:30 a.m. in room P280 on the second floor          of the Otowi Building at Technical Area 3. Pre-registration is required.          Employees should register on line at  http://hrcluster.lanl.gov/TIOCourses/TIOAha.asp?CourseNumber=21013           one to two weeks prior to their last scheduled work day to sign up for          a benefits termination presentation.         Employees also must obtain a departure processing form from Staffing          (HR-S) before the presentation. This form is available at  http://www.hr.lanl.gov/hrstaffing/Terminations/index.stm           online.         At the presentation, employees will receive a packet of information about          their benefits and savings balances. They will learn about options to          continue or convert insurance plans and distribution options for savings          funds.         Employees who require a sign language interpreter should write to  benefits@lanl.gov           by e-mail three days in advance of the presentation they plan to attend.          Or call the benefits office at 5-3842 (TDD).         Because of limited parking, employees should plan to arrive early and/or          make alternative transportation arrangements, such as using Johnson Controls          Northern New Mexico's ride service.

As a result of that effort,    Project XL was initiated in 1985 as a national partnership designed to encourage    proliferation of such programs and to develop new programs and materials which    will promote critical and creative thinking and problem-solving skills for all    children in our Nation's schools.      The INVENTIVE THINKING CURRICULUM PROJECT is one of the many projects included in this national outreach program. It should be used in conjunction with a thinking skills program as a means of applying critical and creative thinking and problem-solving skills through the activity of creating an innovation or invention.     When a student is asked to ""invent"" a solution to a problem, the student must draw upon previous knowledge, skills, and experience. The student also recognizes areas where new learnings must be acquired in order to understand or address the problem. This information must then be applied, analyzed, synthesized, and evaluated. Through critical and creative thinking and problem-solving, ideas become reality as children create inventive solutions, illustrate their ideas, and make models of their inventions. The INVENTIVE THINKING CURRICULUM PROJECT provides children with opportunities to develop and practice higher-order thinking skills.     Throughout the years, many thinking skills models and programs have been generated from among America's finest educators, seeking to describe the essential elements of thinking and/or to develop a systematic approach to teaching thinking skills as part of the school curricula. Three such models/descriptions are illustrated in this introduction. Although each uses different terminology, each model describes similar elements of either critical or creative thinking, or both. A review of the models of BLOOM, TAYLOR, and ISAKSEN and TREFFINGER show how the INVENTIVE THINKING CURRICULUM PROJECT provides an opportunity for students to ""experience"" most of the elements described in these models.       Benjamin Bloom's Model        Perhaps most familiar to educators is ""BLOOM'S taxonomy."" Bloom describes the major areas in the cognitive domain. This information is drawn from the  Taxonomy of Educational Objectives, Handbook 1: Cognitive Domain  (1956). The taxonomy begins by defining KNOWLEDGE as the remembering of previously learned material. Knowledge, according to Bloom, represents the lowest level of learning outcomes in the cognitive domain. Knowledge is followed by COMPREHENSION, the ability to grasp the meaning of material and goes just beyond the knowledge level. Comprehension is the lowest level of understanding. APPLICATION is the next area in the hierarchy and refers to the ability to use learned material in new and concrete principles and theories. Application requires a higher level of understanding than comprehension.     In    ANALYSIS, the next area of the taxonomy, the learning outcomes require an understanding    of both the content and the structural form of material. Next is SYNTHESIS,    which refers to the ability to put parts together to form a new whole. Learning    outcomes at this level stress creative behaviors with a major emphasis on the    formulation of new patterns or structures. The last level of the taxonomy is    EVALUATION. Evaluation is concerned with the ability to judge the value of material    for a given purpose. The judgments are to be based on definite criteria. Learning    outcome s in this area are the highest in the cognitive    hierarchy because they incorporate or contain elements of knowledge, comprehension,    application, analysis, and synthesis. In addition, they contain conscious value    judgments based on clearly defined criteria. The activity of inventing encourages    the four highest levels of learning--application, analysis, synthesis, and evaluation--in    addition to knowledge and comprehension.        Calvin Taylor's Model -- Talents    Unlimited      The second model is introduced by Calvin Taylor in Chapter XI and is discussed in a summary chapter by Carol Schlichter in Joseph Renzulli's book entitled  Systems and Models for Developing Programs for the Gifted and Talented  (1986). The Taylor model describes the talent areas as PRODUCTIVE THINKING, COMMUNICATION, PLANNING, DECISION MAKING, and FORECASTING. This work is best known as TALENTS UNLIMITED, a program of the National Diffusion Network of the U.S. Department of Education. The Taylor model incorporates both the critical and creative elements of thinking. Rather than a taxonomy, this is a thinking skills model that describes the essential elements of thinking, beginning with the academic talent and then incorporating the other talent areas, as described in more detail below.     PRODUCTIVE THINKING promotes creative thinking in the    Taylor model. It suggests thinking of many ideas, varied ideas, unusual ideas,    and adding to those ideas.        COMMUNICATION has six elements which include:      *  give many, varied, single words to describe something;     *  give many, varied, single words to describe feelings;     *  think of many, varied things that are like another thing in a special way;     *  let others know that you understand how they feel;     *  make a network of ideas using many, varied and complete thoughts;     *  tell your feelings and needs without using words.     PLANNING requires that students learn to tell:     *  what they are going to plan;     *  the materials that they will need;     *  the steps that they will need to accomplish the task; and     *  the problems that might occur.     DECISION MAKING teaches the student to:     *  think of the many, varied things that could be done;     *  think more carefully about each alternative;     *  choose one alternative that they think is best; and     *  give many, varied reasons for the choice.     FORECASTING is the last of the five talents and requires students to make many, varied predictions about a situation, examining cause and effect relationships. Every element of the TAYLOR model is used when a child invents.     Creative Problem Solving Model      The third model developed by Scott Isaksen and Donald Treffinger as described in the book  Creative Problem Solving: The Basic Course  (1985) by Isaksen and Treffinger and published in Buffalo, New York, by Bearly Limited, also describes both critical and creative thinking. CREATIVE THINKING is described as making and communicating connections to: think of many possibilities; think and experience in various ways and use different points of view; think of new and unusual possibilities; and guide in generating and selecting alternatives. CRITICAL THINKING is described as analyzing and developing possibilities to: compare and contrast many ideas; improve and refine ideas; make effective decisions and judgments; and provide a sound foundation for effective action. These definitions are used in a six-stage, problem-solving process. A brief description of each of the six stages follows:     1. Mess Finding:  Just what's the mess that needs cleaning up, the situation that demands our attention? We have to identify and acknowledge this first before we can proceed.     2. Data Finding:  Once the general mess is defined, the next stage involves ""taking stock""--unearthing and collecting information, knowledge, facts, feelings, opinions, and thoughts to sort out and clarify your mess more specifically. What do you know about the situation, and what do you still need to know?     3. Problem Finding:  Now that your data is collected, you need to formulate a ""problem statement"" that expresses the ""heart"" of the situation. You must try to put aside the common assumption that you ""already know what the problem is"" and try to state the problem in such a manner as to invite novel perspectives on it.     4. Idea Finding:  This is the state in which you brainstorm as many ideas or alternatives as possible for dealing with your problem statement. Don't evaluate your ideas at this point, merely list them as an idea pool from which you'll draw in putting together a variety of solutions to your problem.      5. Solution Finding:  Now that you have a number of ideas that can serve as possible solutions to your problem, it's time to evaluate them systematically. To do this you have to generate a variety of criteria and select the most important for your problem. Is it cost? expediency? pleasure? time involvement? etc. In this way, you'll be able to identify and evaluate the relative strengths and weaknesses of possible solutions.     6. Acceptance Finding:  Having decided upon a solution, it's time to formulate a plan of action to implement your solution. Determine what kind of help you'll need, what obstacles or difficulties might get in the way, and what specific short- and long-term steps you are going to take to rid yourself of that original mess!     Now that you have reviewed these examples, you will see    the critical and creative thinking and problem-solving skills and talents that    can be applied through the activity of inventing. The INVENTIVE THINKING CURRICULUM    PROJECT that follows can be used across all disciplines and grade levels and    with         all children. It can be integrated with all curricular    areas and used as a means of applying the concepts or elements of any thinking    skills program that may be in use in your school district. Participation in    this project will provide your students with an excellent opportunity to experience    the highest levels of thinking. Activities can be adapted to the developmental    and academic needs of the class.      We hope that you will join Project XL in this national effort, by developing your own program for promoting the teaching of inventive thinking and problem-solving skills. Use the INVENTIVE THINKING CURRICULUM PROJECT as a springboard for capturing the imagination, interest, and creativity that each of us has within our reach. The children of this Nation are our very best investment in tomorrow. Our future will be brighter if we add a big ""T"" for thinking to the basic 3 ""Rs"" of the school curricula.     A special project that provides a unique opportunity for children of all ages to develop their problem-solving and inventive thinking skills in an integrated learning activity can be implemented at your school. Just use the procedures, activities, and guidelines in this booklet to create your own exciting program.     Children of all ages are talented and creative. This project will give them an opportunity to develop their creative potential and synthesize and apply knowledge and skills by creating an invention or innovation to solve a problem, just as a ""real"" inventor would.              ACTIVITIES              Activity #1      INTRODUCING INVENTIVE THINKING      ""Imagination is more important than knowledge, for    imagination embraces the world.""     Albert Einstein      1. Read the stories  in the back of this guide    (p. 27)or copy them for the students to read themselves. Ask students, ""How    did these inventors get their ideas? How did they make their ideas a reality?""    Locate books in your library about inventors, invention, and creativity. Older    students can locate these references themselves.      2. Invite a local inventor  to speak to the class.    Since local inventors are not usually listed in the phone book, you can find    them by calling a local patent attorney or your local intellectual property    law association. Your community may also have a Patent and Trademark Depository    Library or an inventor's society that you may contact. If not, most of your    major companies have a research and development department made up of people    who think inventively for a living.      3. Next, ask the students to look  at the things    in the classroom that are inventions. All the inventions in the classroom that    have a U.S. patent will have a patent number. One such item is probably the    pencil sharpener. Tell them to check out their house for patented items. Let    the students list all of the inventions they discover. What would improve these    inventions?      4. In order to guide your students  through the    inventive process, a few preliminary lessons dealing with creative thinking    will help set the mood. Begin with a brief explanation of brainstorming and    a discussion on the rules of brainstorming (see p. 10).      Brainstorming      Brainstorming is a process of spontaneous thinking used by an individual or by a group of people to generate numerous alternative ideas while deferring judgment. Introduced by Alex Osborn in his book  Applied Imagination,  brainstorming is the crux of each of the stages of all problem-solving methods.     RULES FOR BRAINSTORMING          NO    CRITICISM ALLOWED.  People tend to automatically evaluate each suggested    idea--their own as well as others. Both internal and external criticism are    to be avoided while brainstorming. Neither positive nor negative comments are    allowed. Either type inhibits the free flow of thought and requires time which    interferes with the next rule. Write each spoken idea down as it is given and    move on.           WORK FOR QUANTITY.  Alex Osborn stated that ""Quantity    breeds quality."" People must experience a ""braindrain"" (get all the common responses    out of the way) before the innovative, creative ideas can surface; therefore,    the more ideas, the more likely they are to be quality ideas.           HITCHHIKING WELCOME.  Hitchhiking occurs when one    member's idea produces a similar idea or an enhanced idea in another member.    All ideas should be recorded.           FREEWHEELING ENCOURAGED.  Outrageous, humorous, and    seemingly unimportant ideas should be recorded. It is not uncommon for the most    off-the-wall comment to be one wherein lies the solution for the problem.        Activity #2      PRACTICING THE CREATIVE PART        OF INVENTIVE THINKING     1. Cultivate the following creative thinking processes    described by Paul Torrance and discussed in  The Search for Satori and Creativity     (1979).          FLUENCY the production of a great number of ideas.            FLEXIBILITY the production of ideas or products that    show a variety of possibilities or realms of thought.            ORIGINALITY the production of ideas that are unique    or unusual.          ELABORATION the production of ideas that display intensive detail or enrichment.      For    practice in elaboration, have pairs or small groups of students choose a particular    idea from the brainstorming list and add the flourishes and details that would    develop the idea more fully.      Allow the students to share their innovative and inventive ideas!       2. Once your students have become familiar with the rules    of brainstorming and the creative thinking processes, Bob Eberle's SCAMPER technique    for brainstorming could be introduced.      S UBSTITUTE What else instead? Who else instead? Other ingredients? Other material? Other power? Other place?     C OMBINE How about a blend, an alloy, an ensemble? Combine purposes? Combine appeals?     A DAPT What else is like this? What other idea does this suggest? Does past offer parallel? What could I copy?     M INIFY Order, form, shape? What to add? More time?     M AGNIFY Greater frequency? Higher? Longer? Thicker?     P UT TO OTHER USES New ways to use as is? Other uses I modified? Other places to use? Other people to reach?     E LIMINATE What to subtract? Smaller? Condensed? Miniature? Lower? Shorter? Lighter? Omit? Streamline? Understate?     R EVERSE Interchange components? Other pattern?     R EARRANGE Other layout? Other sequence? Transpose cause and effect? Change pace? Transpose positive and negative? How about opposites? Turn it backward? Turn it upside-down? Reverse roles?     3. Bring in any object or use objects around the classroom to do the following exercise. Ask the students to list many new uses for a familiar object by using the SCAMPER technique with regard to the object. You could use a paper plate to begin with, and see how many new things the students will discover. Make sure to follow the rules for brainstorming in Activity #1.     4. Using literature, ask your students to create a new    ending to a story, change a character or situation within a story, or create    a new beginning for the story that would result in the same ending.      5. Put a list of objects on the chalkboard. Ask your    students to combine them in different ways to create a new product.      Let the students make their own list of objects. Once    they combine several of them, ask them to illustrate the new product and explain    why it might be useful.            Activity #3      PRACTICING INVENTIVE THINKING    WITH THE CLASS     Before your students begin to find their own problems    and create unique inventions or innovations to solve them, you can assist them    by taking them through some of the steps as a group.      1. Finding the Problem.  Let the class list problems in their own classroom that need solving. Use the ""brainstorming"" technique from Activity #1. Perhaps your students never have a pencil ready, as it is either missing or broken when it is time to do an assignment. Select one problem for the class to solve using the following steps:      a. Find several problems. Select one to work on.      b. Analyze the situation.      c. Think of many, varied, and unusual ways of solving the problem.     List the possibilities. Be sure to allow even the silliest possible solution, as creative thinking must have a positive, accepting environment in order to flourish.       2. Finding a Solution.       a. Select one or more possible solutions to work on. You may want to divide into groups if the class elects to work on several of the ideas.      b. Improve and refine the idea(s).      c. Share the class or individual solution(s)/invention(s) for solving the class problem.     Solving a ""class"" problem and creating a ""class"" invention    will help students learn the process and make it easier for them to work on    their own invention projects.              Activity #4      DEVELOPING AN INVENTION IDEA        Now that your students have had an introduction to the inventive process, it is time for them to find a problem and create their own invention to solve it.     1. Begin by asking your students to conduct a survey. Tell them to interview everyone that they can think of to find out what problems need solutions. What kind of invention, tool, game, device, or idea would be helpful at home, work, or during leisure time? (see p. 39)     2. Ask the students to list the problems that need to be solved.     3. Next comes the decision-making process. Using the list of problems, ask the students to think of which problems would be possible for them to work on. They can do this by listing the pros and cons for each possibility. Predict the outcome or possible solution(s) for each problem. Make a decision by selecting one or two problems that provide the best options for an inventive solution. (Duplicate the Planning and Decision-Making Framework p. 41)     4. Begin an Inventor's Log or Journal. A record of your ideas and work will help you develop your invention and protect it when completed. (Sample log sheet on p. 51.)          RULES FOR AUTHENTIC     JOURNAL KEEPING      *  Using a bound    notebook, make notes each day about the things you do and learn while working    on your invention.      *  Record your    idea and how you got it.      *  Write about    problems you have and how you solve them.      *  Write in ink    and do not erase.      *  Add sketches    and drawings to make things clear.      *  List all parts,    sources, and costs of materials.      *  Sign and date    all entries at the time they are made and have them witnessed.             5. To illustrate why record-keeping is important, read the following story about Daniel Drawbaugh who said that he invented the telephone, but didn't have one single paper or record to prove it.        Long before Alexander Graham Bell filed a patent application in 1875, Daniel Drawbaugh claimed to have invented the telephone. But since he had no journal or record, the Supreme Court rejected his claims by four votes to three. Alexander Graham Bell had excellent records and was awarded the patent for the telephone.     Activity #5      BRAINSTORMING FOR CREATIVE    SOLUTIONS           Now that the students have one or two problems to work on, they must take the same steps that they did in solving the class problem in Activity #3. These steps could be listed on the chalkboard or a chart.     1. Analyze the problem(s). Select one to work on.     2. Think of many, varied, and unusual ways of solving the problem. List all of the possibilities. Be non-judgmental. (See Brainstorming in Activity #1 and SCAMPER in Activity #2.)     3. Select one or more possible solutions to work on.     4. Improve and refine your ideas.     Now that your students have some exciting possibilities    for their invention projects, they will need to use their critical thinking    skills to narrow down the possible solutions. They can do this by asking themselves    the following questions about their inventive idea:      Activity #6      PRACTICING THE CRITICAL PARTS    OF     INVENTIVE THINKING            1. Is my idea practical?     2. Can it be made easily?     3. Is it as simple as possible?     4. Is it safe?     5. Will it cost too much to make or use?     6. Is my idea really new?     7. Will it withstand use, or will it break easily?     8. Is my idea similar to something else?     9. Will people really use my invention? (Survey your classmates or the people in your neighborhood to document the need or usefulness of your idea.)       Activity #7      COMPLETING THE INVENTION      When students have an idea that meets most of the above    qualifications, they need to plan how they are going to complete their project.    The following planning technique will save them a great deal of time and effort:      1. Identify the problem and possible solution. Give your invention a name.     2. List the materials needed to illustrate your invention and to make a model of it. You will need paper, pencil, and crayons or markers to draw your invention. You might use cardboard, paper, clay, wood, plastic, yarn, paper clips, and so forth to make a model. You might also want to use an art book or a book on model-making from your school library.     3. List, in order, the steps for completing your invention.     4. Think of the possible problems that might occur. How would you solve them?     5. Complete your invention. Ask your parents and teacher    to help with the model.                                     REMEMBER!            * WHAT  -          describe the problem            * MATERIALS           - list the materials needed            * STEPS  -          list the steps to complete your invention            * PROBLEMS           - predict the problems that could occur.                           Activity #8      NAMING THE INVENTION        An invention can be named in one of the    following ways:    1. Using the inventor'sBraille name          Levi Strauss = LEVI'S ®  jeans            Louis Braille = Alphabet System           2. Using the components or ingredients of the invention           Root Beer         Peanut Butter                  3. With initials or acronyms          IBM ®         S.C.U.B.A. ®           4. Using word combinations (notice repeated consonant sounds and rhyming words).           KIT KAT ®         HULA HOOP ®        PUDDING POPS ®           CAP'N CRUNCH ®           5. Using the product's function           SUPERSEAL ®          DUSTBUSTER ®          vacuum cleaner           hairbrush           earmuffs           Activity #9      OPTIONAL MARKETING ACTIVITIES      Students can be very fluent when it comes to listing ingenious    names of products out on the market. Solicit their suggestions and have them    explain what makes each name effective. Each student should generate names for    his/her own invention.        1. Developing a slogan or jingle      Have the students define the terms ""slogan"" and ""jingle."" Discuss the purpose of   having a slogan.               Sample slogans and jingles:      ""Things go better with Coke.""   ""COKE IS IT! ® ""   ""TRIX ARE FOR KIDS ® ""   ""OH THANK HEAVEN FOR 7-ELEVEN ® ""   ""TWOALLBEEFPATTIES...""   ""GE: WE BRING GOOD THINGS TO LIFE! ® ""      Your students will be able to recall many slogans and jingles! When a slogan is named, discuss the reasons for its effectiveness. Allow time for thought in which the students can create jingles for their inventions.       2. CREATING AN ADVERTISEMENT         For a crash course in advertising, discuss the visual effect created by a television commercial, magazine, or newspaper advertisement. Collect magazine or newspaper ads that are eye-catching--some of the ads might be dominated by words and others by pictures that ""say it all."" Students might enjoy exploring newspapers and magazines for outstanding advertisements. Have students create magazine ads to promote their inventions. (For more advanced students, further lessons on advertising techniques would be appropriate at this point.)       3.    RECORDING A RADIO PROMO       A radio promo could be the icing on a student's advertising campaign! A promo might include facts about the usefulness of the invention, a clever jingle or song, sound effects, humor... the possibilities are endless. Students may choose to tape record their promos for use during the Invention Convention.       4. ADVERTISING ACTIVITY      Collect 5 - 6 objects and give them new uses. For instance, a toy hoop could be a waist reducer, and some strange looking kitchen gadget might be a new type of mosquito catcher. Use your imagination! Search everywhere--from the tools in the garage to the kitchen drawer--for fun objects. Divide the class into small groups, and give each group one of the objects to work with. The group is to give the object a catchy name, write a slogan, draw an ad, and record a radio promo. Stand back and watch the creative juices flow. Variation: Collect magazine ads and have the students create new advertising campaigns using a different marketing angle.       Activity #10      PARENT INVOLVEMENT     Few, if any, projects are successful unless the child    is encouraged by the parents and other caring adults. Once the children have    developed their own, original ideas, they should discuss them with their parents.    Together, they can work to make the child's idea come to life by making a model.    Although the making of a model is not necessary, it makes the project more interesting    and adds another dimension to the project. You can involve parents by simply    sending a letter home to explain the project and let them know how they may    participate. One of your parents may have invented something that they can share    with the class. (See sample parent letter on p. 45.)               Activity #11      YOUNG INVENTORS' DAY      Plan    a Young Inventors' Day so that your students can be recognized for their inventive    thinking. This day should provide opportunities for the children to display    their inventions and tell the story of how they got their idea and how it works.    They can share with other students, their parents, and others.      When a child successfully completes a task, it is important that (s)he be recognized for the effort. All children who participate in the Inventive Thinking Curriculum Project are winners.     The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has prepared a certificate    that can be copied and given to all children who participate and use       their inventive thinking skills to create an invention    or innovation. This award, signed by the Assistant Secretary of Commerce and    Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks, is included on page 47.          Activity #12      ENRICHMENT     The following stories about great thinkers and inventors    will help to motivate your students and enhance their appreciation of the contributions    of inventors to the American way of life.      As students read these stories, they will also realize the ""inventors"" are male, female, old, young, minority, and majority. They are ordinary people who follow through with their creative ideas to make their dreams a reality.     1. GREAT THINKERS AND THEIR INVENTIONS     Earmuffs  ""Baby, Its Cold Outside"" may have been the song running through 13 year old Chester Greenwood's head one cold December day in 1873. To protect his ears while ice skating, he found a piece of wire, and with his grandmother's help, padded the ends. In the beginning, his friends laughed at him. However, when they realized that he was able to stay outside skating long after they had gone inside freezing, they stopped laughing. Instead, they began to ask Chester to make ear covers for them, too. At age 17 Chester applied for a patent. For the next 60 years, Chester's factory made earmuffs, and earmuffs made Chester rich!        BAND-AID ® At the turn of the century,    Mrs. Earl Dickson, an inexperienced cook, often burned and cut herself. Mr.    Dickson, a Johnson and Johnson employee, got plenty of practice in hand bandaging!    Out of concern for his wife's safety, he began to prepare bandages ahead of    time so that his wife could apply them by herself. By combining a piece of surgical    tape and a piece of gauze, he fashioned the first crude adhesive strip bandage!      LIFE-SAVERS ®  Candy  During the hot summer of 1913, Clarence Crane, a chocolate candy manufacturer, found himself facing a dilemma. When he tried to ship his chocolates to candy shops in other cities they melted into gooey blobs. To avoid dealing with the ""mess,"" his customers were deferring their orders until cool weather. In order to retain his customers, Mr. Crane needed to find a substitute for the melted chocolates. He experimented with hard candy which wouldn't melt during shipment. Using a machine designed for making medicine pills, Crane produced small, circular candies with a hole in the middle. The birth of LIFE SAVERS!     FRISBEE ® The    term FRISBEE did not always refer to the familiar plastic disks we visualize    flying through the air. Long ago (over 100 years ago), in Bridgeport, Connecticut,    William Russell Frisbie owned the Frisbie Pie Company and delivered his pies    locally. All of his pies were baked in the same type of 10"" round tin with a    raised edge, wide brim, six small holes in the bottom, and ""Frisbie Pies"" on    the bottom. Playing catch with the tins soon became a popular local sport. However,    the tins were slightly dangerous when a toss was missed. It became the Yale    custom to yell ""Frisbie"" when throwing a pie tin. In the 40's when plastic emerged,    the pie-tin game was recognized as a manufacturable and marketable product.    (Note: FRISBEE ®  is a registered trademark of Wham-O Mfg. Co.)      2. THOMAS EDISON AND OTHER YOUNG INVENTORS          If I were to tell you that  Thomas Alva Edison  had shown signs of inventive genius at an early age, you probably would not be surprised. Mr. Edison achieved enormous fame with his lifelong contributions of volumes of inventive technology. He received the first of his 1,093 U.S. patents by age 22. In the book,  Fire of Genius,  Ernest Heyn reported on a remarkable resourceful young Edison--though some of his earliest tinkering clearly lacked merit.     By the age of six, Thomas Edison's experiments with fire were said to have cost his father a barn. Soon after that, it is reported that young Edison tried to launch the first human balloon by persuading another youth to swallow large quantities of effervescing powders to inflate himself with gas. Of course, the experiments brought quite unexpected results!     Chemistry and electricity held great fascination for this child, Thomas Edison. By his early teens, he had designed and perfected his first real invention, an electrical cockroach control system. He glued parallel strips of tinfoil to a wall and wired the strips to the poles of a powerful battery--quite a shock for the unsuspecting insect.     As a dynamo of creativity, Mr. Edison stood as decidedly unique; but as a child with a curious, problem-solving nature, he was not alone. Here are some more ""inventive children"" we grew to know and appreciate:         At age 14, one schoolboy invented a rotary brush device to remove husks from    wheat in the flour mill run by his friend's father. The young inventor's name?    Alexander Graham Bell.           At 16, another of our junior achievers saved pennies    to buy materials for his chemistry experiments. While still a teenager, he set    his mind on developing a commercially viable aluminum refining process. By age    25, Charles Hall received a patent on his revolutionary electrolytic process.           While only 19 years old, another imaginative young    person designed and built his first helicopter. In the summer of 1909, it very    nearly flew. Years later, Igor Sikorsky perfected his design and saw his early    dreams change aviation history. Silorsky was inducted into the National Inventors    Hall of Fame in 1987.      Scores of childhood problem-solvers abound. Perhaps you've    heard about:      *  Samuel Colt's  childhood experience with underwater explosives;     *  Fourteen-year-old  Robert Fulton's  manually operated paddlewheel; and     *  Guglielmo Marconi's  early mechanical/electrical tinkering.     Even the father of television,  Philo T. Farnsworth,  conceived his optical scanning idea at the tender age of 14.     3. GREAT WOMEN INVENTORS      Inventions tell something about the inventor's place in the society in which (s)he lives, a closeness to certain kinds of problems, and possession of certain skills. It is not surprising that up until the mid 20th Century, women's inventions were often related to childcare, housework, and healthcare, all traditional female occupations. In recent years, with access to specialized training and broader job opportunities, women are applying their creativity to many new kinds of problems, including those requiring high technology.While women have frequently come up with new ways to make their work easier, they have not always received credit for their ideas. Some stories about early women inventors show that women often recognized that they were entering ""a man's world,"" and shielded their work from the public eye by allowing men to patent their inventions.     *  Although Eli Whitney received a patent for a cotton gin,  Catherine Greene  is said to have posed both the problem and the basic idea to Whitney. Furthermore, according to Matilda Gage, ( Women as Inventor,  1883), his first model, fitted with wooden teeth, did not do the work well, and Whitney was about to throw the work aside, when Mrs. Greene proposed the substitution of wire to catch the cotton seeds.     OTHER WOMEN INVENTORS AND THEIR DISCOVERIES      * Margaret Knight,  remembered as ""the female Edison,"" received some 26 patents for such diverse items as a window frame and sash, machinery for cutting shoe soles, and improvements to internal combustion engines. Her most significant patent was for machinery that would automatically fold and glue paper bags to create square bottoms, an invention which dramatically changed shopping habits. Workmen reportedly refused her advice when first installing the equipment because, ""after all, what does a woman know about machines?""     * Sarah Breedlove    Walker,  the daughter of former slaves, was orphaned at seven and widowed    by 20. Madame Walker is credited with inventing hair lotions, creams, and an    improved hair styling hot comb. But her greatest achievement may be the development    of the Walker System, which included a broad offering of cosmetics, licensed    Walker Agents, and Walker Schools, which offered meaningful employment and personal    growth to thousands of Walker Agents, mostly Black women. Sarah Walker was the    first American woman self-made millionaire.           * Bette Graham  hoped    to be an artist, but circumstances led her into secretarial work. Bette, however,    was not an accurate typist. Fortunately, she recalled that artists could correct    their mistakes by painting over them with gesso, so she invented a quick drying    ""paint"" to cover her typing mistakes. Bette first prepared the secret formula    in her kitchen using a hand mixer, and her young son helped to pour the mixture    into little bottles. In 1980, the Liquid Paper Corporation, which Bette Graham    built, was sold for over $47 million.      * Ann Moore,  a Peace Corps volunteer, saw how African women carried babies on their backs by tying cloth around their bodies, leaving both hands free for other work. When she returned to the United States, she designed a carrier which became the popular SNUGLI. Recently Ms. Moore received another patent for a carrier to conveniently transport oxygen cylinders. People needing oxygen for breathing assistance, who were previously confined to stationary oxygen tanks, can now move about more freely. Her company now sells several versions including lightweight backpacks, handbags, shoulder bags, and wheelchair/walker carriers for portable cylinders.     * Stephanie Kwolek,     one of Dupont's leading chemists, discovered the ""miracle fiber,"" Kevlar,    which has five times the strength of steel by weight. Uses for Kevlar are seemingly    endless, including ropes and cables for oil drilling rigs, canoe hulls, boat    sails, automobile bodies and tires, and military and motorcycle helmets. Many    Viet Nam veterans and police officers are alive today because of protection    provided by bullet-proof vests made from Kevlar. Because of its strength and    lightness, Kevlar was chosen as the material for the Gossamer Albatross, a pedal    airplane flown across the English Channel. Kwolek was inducted into the National    Inventors Hall of Fame in 1995.      * Gertrude B. Elion,     1988 Nobel laureate in Medicine, and Scientist Emeritus with Burroughs Wellcome    Company, is credited with the synthesis of two of the first successful drugs    for Leukemia, as well as Imuron, an agent to prevent the rejection of kidney    transplants, and Zovirax, the first selective antiviral agent against herpes    virus infections. Researchers who discovered AZT, a breakthrough treatment for    AIDS, used Elion's protocols. Elion was inducted into the National Inventors    Hall of Fame in 1991, the first woman inductee.           Did you know      *  windshield wipers    were patented by  Mary Anderso   n  in    1903?      *  dandruff shampoo was patented by  Josie Stuart  in 1903?     *  a dishwasher was patented by  Josephine Cochrane  in 1914?     *  the first disposable diaper was patented by  Marion Donovan  in 1951?     *  a compact portable hair dryer was patented by  Harriet J. Stern  in 1962?     *  a dough product for frozen pizza was patented by  Rose Totino  in 1979?     *  the Melitta Automatic Drip Coffee Maker was patented by  Melitta Benz  in Germany in 1908?                 Note: Much of the material in this section was        drawn from the Minnesota Historical Society Exhibit, ""Her Works Praise Her,        Inventions by Women."" For further information on women inventors, you may        contact the Minnesota Historical Society's Traveling Exhibition Department        at 612/297-4497.             4. GREAT MINORITY INVENTORS      Between 1863 and 1913, approximately 1,200 inventions were patented by Black inventors. Many more were unidentified because they hid their race to avoid discrimination. Some sold their inventions to White men. The following stories are about a few of the great minority inventors.     *  Elijah McCoy.     Have you ever heard of the term ""real McCoy?"" That term may apply to a famous    Black inventor by the name of Elijah McCoy. He earned about 50 patents, but    the most famous one was for a metal or glass cup that fed oil to bearings through    a small-bore tube. Machinists and engineers who wanted genuine McCoy lubricators    may have originated the term ""the real McCoy."" Elijah McCoy was born in Ontario,    Canada, in 1843, the son of slaves who had fled Kentucky. He died in Michigan    in 1929.      *     Benjamin Banneker.  Benjamin Banneker created    the first striking clock made of wood in America. He became known as the ""Afro-American    Astronomer."" He published an almanac and with his knowledge of mathematics and    astronomy, he assisted in the surveying and planning of the new city of Washington,    D.C.       *  Granville Woods     had more than 60 patents. Known as the ""Black Edison,"" he improved Bell's    telegraph and created an electrical motor that made the underground subway possible.    He also improved the airbrake.      *  Garrett Morgan     invented the traffic signal that saved thousands of lives when the automobile    became popular. He also invented a safety hood for firefighters.      *  George Washington    Carver  changed the South with his many inventions. He discovered over 300    different products made from the peanut which, until Carver, was considered    a lowly food fit for hogs. He dedicated himself to teaching others, learning    and working with nature. He created over 125 new products with the sweet potato    and taught poor farmers how to rotate crops to i   mprove    their soil and their cotton. George Washington Carver was a great scientist    and inventor who learned to be a careful observer and who was honored throughout    the world for his creation of new things.

Copy Masters         INVENTION IDEA SURVEY        One of the best ways to collect ideas for developing    an innovation or invention is to take a survey. Make sure to survey a variety    of people of all different ages and occupations. The more people you talk to,    the more ideas you will get. The following list of questions may help you:      1. What does not work as well as you would like it to    work?      2. What job(s) would you like to see solved?      3. What problem(s) would you like to see solved?      4.

The Inventive Thinking Curriculum Project is a school activity which promotes analytical and creative thinking and problem solving. Parents can enjoy this project at home with their children by encouraging creative ideas, letting them share ideas with the family, and by assisting them with making models of their inventive ideas.     Our students will be asked to survey you, their friends, and other family members to discover a problem that needs solving. Perhaps the cap is always left off of the toothpaste or your child is always losing sneakers, pencils or mittens. Once the children find problems to solve, they will begin thinking of many ideas that might solve those problems. When they do this, they will be combining many of the skills learned in science, social studies, language, writing, art, library, math, and more.     Each student participating in the Inventive Thinking Curriculum Project will receive a certificate of recognition from the Assistant Secretary and Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks in Washington, D.C., and will share the invention with other students at our school.     Thank you for your support in this special and imaginative    adventure in learning. You will be receiving more information during the school    year.       Teacher  __________________________________   Principal  __________________________________     Certificate of Recognition for Innovative Achievement              POSITIVE COMMENTS          Presenter's Name:________________________________________      What I like most about your invention is:          ""Praise is the best diet for us, after all...""

Every time you write in the log, you should initial and date your entry and also have it signed by a witness. A witness can be anyone who knows what you are working on that day--mom, dad, friend, brother, sister, etc. The list below includes some of the items that might be recorded in your log. You will think of others. Remember, every time you work on your project or just ""think"" about your idea, you should record it in your inventor's log or notebook.

Issued by the General Court of Massachusetts, it protected    his mill for manufacturing scythes. That was the prelude to the U.S. Patent    System which has helped give birth to major industries that have transformed    the way we live.      On April 10, 1790, President George Washington signed the bill which laid the foundations of the modern American patent system. Since that time, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has recorded and protected the electric lamp of Thomas Edison, the telephone of Alexander Graham Bell, the flying machine of the Wright Brothers, and the inventions of hundreds of thousands of other inventors.     The patent system has protected inventors by giving them an opportunity to profit from their labors, and it has benefited society by systematically recording new inventions and releasing them to the public after the inventors' limited rights have expired.     The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office is one of the most unusual branches of the U.S. Government. Its examining staff of about 2,000 is trained in all branches of science and examines thoroughly every application to determine whether a patent may be granted--a task, in these days, involving the most exhaustive research. Not only must the examiners search United States and foreign patents to learn if a similar patent has been issued, but they must study scientific books and publications to discover whether the idea has ever been described. Previous publications, invention, or use prevents a patent being issued.     In addition to issuing patents, the Patent and Trademark Office has, since 1870, been in charge of registering trademarks, the business community's most valuable asset. More than 1,400,000 trademarks have been issued.     In its earlier days, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office had on various occasions the responsibility for administering copyright matters, a task that since 1870 has been administered by the Library of Congress; collecting and publishing agricultural information; and even collecting meteorological data. For some years, it was the custodian not only of the famous old Patent Office models--the delight of every visitor to Washington for many years--but of the Declaration of Independence, and other historical documents and relics.     By publishing and distributing copies of every U.S. patent, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has made available to the public the world's greatest scientific and mechanical library.     Patents in Brief     A patent is a grant issued by the U.S. Government giving inventors the right to exclude all others from making, using, or selling their inventions within the United States, its territories, and possessions.     There are three kinds of patents: (1) utility patents, granted to the inventor or discoverer of any new and useful process, machine, manufacture, composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof; (2) plant patents, granted on any distinct and new variety of asexually reproduced plant; and (3) design patents, granted on any new, original, and ornamental design for an article of manufacture.     Utility and plant patents are granted for a term which begins on the date of the grant and ends 20 years from the date the patent application was first filed, subject to the payment of maintenance fees; design patents are granted for a term of 14 years from the date of the grant. Patents may be extended only by special act of Congress, except for some pharmaceutical patents whose terms may be extended to make up for time lost due to Government-required testing.     If you plan to file an application, you or your representative should make a search of patents previously granted to make sure that your idea has not already been patented. You may do this at the Public Search Room of the Patent and Trademark Office, Crystal Plaza Building No. 3, 2021 South Clark Place, Arlington, Virginia. Hours are 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m., Monday through Friday except holidays. More limited searches may be made at Patent and Trademark Depository Libraries located throughout the country.     The patent application process can be complex, and the Patent and Trademark Office cannot assist in the preparation of application papers. We strongly advise prospective applicants to engage the services of a patent attorney or agent. Although the PTO cannot recommend any particular attorney or agent and does not control their fees, we do maintain a roster of approximately 17,000 patent attorneys and agents registered to practice before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. This roster is available for inspection at Patent and Trademark Depository Libraries, for sale by the Superintendent of Documents at the Government Printing Office, or on the World Wide Web (http://www.uspto.gov).     The basic fee for filing an application for patent ranges from $160 to $770, depending on the type of patent application being filed and whether or not the applicant is entitled to status as a small entity (independent inventor, small business concern, or non-profit organization). Issue fees range from $220 to $1,290. Maintenance fees are due at 3 1 Ž 2 , 7 1 Ž 2 , and 11 1 Ž 2  years from the date the patent is granted. An individual inventor can expect to pay a minimum of $4,000 for a utility patent.     Applications are assigned to examiners who are experts in various fields of technology. The invention must be new, useful, and unobvious to those in that particular field of study. This procedure normally takes about 19 months.     Disclosure Document Program     Under its Disclosure Document Program, the PTO accepts and preserves for a two-year period papers disclosing an invention pending the filing of an application for patent. This disclosure is accepted as evidence of the dates of conception of the invention, but provides no patent protection nor should it be considered a ""grace period"" during which the inventor can wait to file a patent application without possible loss of benefits. A fee of $10 is charged for this service.     Provisional Patent Application     A provisional application establishes a filing date but does not begin the examination process. It provides the inventor with a one-year period to further develop the invention, determine marketability, acquire funding or capital, or seek licensing agreements. To obtain a patent, the inventor must file a nonprovisional application within 12 months of the filing date of the provisional application. The fee is $150 or $75 for a small entity.     Trademarks in Brief     A trademark (or brand name or logo) is a word, name, symbol, design, combination of word and design or slogan used by a manufacturer or merchant to identify its goods or services and distinguish them from those manufactured or sold by others. When it is used for services, it can be called a service mark.     Trademark rights come from using the mark, and marks are protected under common law from the time they are first used. While there is no requirement to do so, owners of marks who have used them or have a bona fide intention to use them in Federally regulated commerce may register them with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. This provides the owners with certain procedural and legal advantages. For intent-to-use applications, actual use of the mark in commerce is a prerequisite to the ultimate issuance of a registration.     Many trademark owners use a  ™  (trademark) or  SM  (service mark) symbol with their mark to indicate that they are claiming rights in it. The  ®  symbol may only be used if the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office issued a Federal registration. To register a mark, the owner must file an application consisting of a written statement in which the owner indicates among other things the goods or services in connection with which the mark is used and the date of first use of the mark in commerce; a drawing of the mark; five specimens showing the mark as it is actually used (labels, tags, packaging, etc.); and the required filing fee of $245 per class.     Each application is reviewed by an examining attorney to determine if the mark is eligible for registration and is compared with other marks to determine if it is likely to cause confusion with those already registered. If a proposed mark passes the examination, it is then published in the  Official Gazette  of the Patent and Trademark Office. Those who believe they will be damaged by registration of the mark then have an opportunity to oppose registration. If no opposition is filed, a registration certificate is issued or a notice of allowance is issued to the applicant in an intent-to-use application. Within six months after the issuance of the notice of allowance, the applicant must file specimens evidencing use of the mark in commerce, a fee of $100, and a verified statement that the mark is in use in commerce before a registration certificate is issued. The registration may be renewed every 10 years as long as the registrant is still using the mark.     Note: Fees mentioned above represent only the minimum required for a patent or trademark application. Additional fees may be due during the prosecution of an application. Fees are current as of October 1996. Fee increases, when necessary, usually take effect on October 1 of any given year. For a complete list of fees or further information, write to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, Center for Patent and Trademark Information, Washington, DC 20231, or call 800-786-9199 or 703-308-HELP(4357).      Copyrights in Brief     The seeds of copyright protection were sown in Gutenberg's development of the printing press that ultimately led to the first printed copyright statute, the English Statute of Anne. Both the printing press and the concept of copyright protection followed the colonists to the new world. The state legislature of 12 of the first states passed copyright laws before Congress enacted the first Federal law. On may 31, 1790, Congress used the power given it in Article 1 Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution to ""promote the progress of science and useful arts by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries"" and enacted the first Federal Copyright Act.      Noah Webster, the compiler of both the first American speller and an early dictionary, played a major role in getting both the state laws and the first Federal statute enacted. He traveled to each legislature and described the authors' plight and their need for copyright protection. Authors have continued to guard the rights granted by the Constitution and to ensure that new technologies permitting copying do not erode these rights.     What is copyright and when does copyright protection arise?  Federal copyright legislation gives an author certain exclusive rights for a limited time: the right to reproduce the copyrighted work, to prepare derivative works, to distribute copies or phonorecords, to perform the work publicly, and to display the work publicly. Congress attempts to create a balance between the rights given to authors and the legitimate needs for society. There are some limitations or exemptions that permit society to make specific uses of copyrighted works.     Copyright subsists in an original work of authorship from the time the work is first created or fixed in any tangible medium of expression, now known or later developed, from which that work can be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated. A work is put in a tangible form, for example, when a literary work is typed or written or a piece of music captured on tape.     Copyright covers the expression of ideas and not the idea itself. Thus, copyright does not cover ""any idea, procedure, process, system, method of operation, concept, principle, or discovery..."" It does not, for example, protect blank checks, standardized material, titles, or government works.     What does copyright protection mean for an author?  Copyright means that no one may appropriate the copyright owner's exclusive right to reproduce, distribute, perform, or display a work without permission from the author unless the right has been transferred to the user or the person who authorizes or licenses this particular use, or an exemption covers the use in question.      What works does copyright protect?  The first law protected maps, charts, and books for a basic term of 14 years; since 1790 the copyright law has evolved to include musical works, dramatic works, photographs, paintings, and other works of art, motion pictures, and sound recordings.     Literary works:  Copyright protects literary works of all types from novels such as  Gone With the Wind  or  The Catcher in the Rye,  to text books and other fact-based accounts, including newspapers. Although copyright covers the expression in non-fiction works, it does not cover the facts themselves. They are uncopyrightable and can be freely used by anyone. Copyright in the literary works also covers printed speeches such as Martin Luther King, Jr.'s famous ""I have a dream"" speech. Today, even computer programs are protected as literary works.     Musical works:  Copyright covers all kinds of music from the songs performed on the radio to the music in television commercials and MTV.     Dramatic works:  Copyright covers every kind of permanently fixed dramatic work from senior plays such as Our Town performed by high schools, to such current Broadway blockbusters as Phantom of the Opera, M. Butterfly, or the latest Neil Simon offering. It covers those plays written especially for the theater like Arthur Miller's classic Death of a Salesman and also those based on other popular works like the adaptation of Kafka's short story Metamorphosis.     Pantomimes and choreographic works:  Copyright protects dance sequences in stage shows like Chorus Line or Cats if they are in tangible form.     Pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works:  Works created by sculptors, photographers, painters, and other graphic artists are protected by copyright. The works covered include not only paintings, photographs, and sculptures, but also advertisements, the artwork on game boards, and the artwork on fabrics or textiles.     Motion pictures and other audiovisual works:  Classics like The Wizard of Oz or the latest Steven Spielberg or Woody Allen film are protectible, as are television programs and ideograms, including the once very popular Pac Man and the currently popular Nintendo games.     Sound recordings:  The copyright law was amended in 1971 to include sound recordings. Copyright now protects the latest recording of your favorite artists in any format--disk (be it 45, 33, or compact disk), tape, or cassette. The copyright authorship protected in a sound recording is two-fold: it covers the contribution of both the performer and the record producer responsible for the recording.     How long is a work protected?  As noted earlier, the 1790 act provided a 14 year term. Mark Twain was one of the authors who persuaded Congress that the term should be longer. In 1909 the term was extended to protect authors for a 28 year term plus a possibility of 28 more years if the author renewed his or her claim in a timely fashion. Then in 1976 the term was extended again to its current length: the life of the author plus 50 years. Special rules apply to works created by employees as part of their jobs such as motion pictures and anonymous or pseudonymous works.     When the term of the protection expires on a particular work, it may be used freely by anyone.     Where is the work protected?  A work copyrighted in the United States is protected here as well as in all of the other countries with whom we have copyright relations by our membership in the two multilateral copyright treaties--the Universal Copyright Convention and the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, by presidential proclamation, or bilateral relations. The United States has copyright relations with over 100 countries.     Note: The filing fee for each application is $20.   The Copyright Office has the authority to adjust fees at five-year intervals.

More than a toy.   selected    toy patents.   5. Rumor has it... that a patent office official    resigned because ""everything that can be invented has been invented.""                  The First Patent Grant in the    United States       The patent grant you see reproduced on the next page    was the first one issued by the United States, to Samuel Hopkins of Pittsford,    Vermont in 1790. Two other patents were granted that year: one for a special    process of making candles and one for improved flour milling machinery. The    Hopkins patent was for an ""Improvement, not known before such Discovery, in    the making of Pot ash and Pearl ash by a new apparatus and Process"", and was    granted for a term of fourteen years.      The name potash refers to several potassium salts, mild    alkalis, which were derived from the ashes of timber or other plants. It was    also known in a caustic form when mixed with lime. In reacting with fats or    oils, potash produced a soft soap. It was an essential ingredient in the manufacture    of glass, alum (salts of aluminum--used chiefly in medicine), and saltpetre    (an important ingredient in gun powder). Potash also played an important role    in bleaching, mining, metallurgy, and other industrial interests. Its many applications    served as an indication of the emerging chemical industry in the nineteenth    century.      In the summer of 1956, the Vermont Historic Sites Commission    erected a marker at the former residence of Samuel Hopkins. The original patent    granted to him still exists in the collections of the Chicago Historical Society.                            Abraham Lincoln is the only U.S. president to receive a    patent. Lincoln was a congressman from Illinois in 1849 when he was issued Patent    No. 6,469 for a ""manner of buoying vessels.""      As a young man, Lincoln took a boatload of merchandise    down the Mississippi River from New Salem to New Orleans. The boat slid onto    a dam and was dislodged only after heroic efforts. A few years later, while    crossing the Great Lakes, Lincoln's ship ran afoul of a sandbar. These two similar    experiences led him to invent a solution to the problem.      The invention consists of a set of bellows attached to    the hull of a ship just below the water line. When a vessel is in danger of    getting stuck in shallow water, the bellows are filled with air, and the vessel,    thus buoyed, floats clear of the obstacle.      Although Lincoln probably never profited from his invention,    he was a strong supporter of the patent system, saying that the patent system    ""added the fuel of interest to the fire of genius, in the discovery and production    of new and useful things.""            ""Well    informed people know it is impossible to transmit the voice over wires, and    that, were it possible to do so, the thing would be of no practical value.""    Boston Post editorial, 1865        Perhaps the most famous of all design patents    is the Statue of Liberty.            Contrary to popular belief, Thomas Alva Edison didn't    ""invent"" the light bulb, but rather he improved upon a 50-year-old idea. In    1879, using lower current, a small carbonized filament, and an improved vacuum    inside the globe, he was able to produce a reliable, long-lasting source of    light. Perhaps more importantly, Edison's invention led to an industry to distribute    electric power creating jobs for many Americans.      Edison was granted his first patent on June 1, 1869,    and averaged one patent application every 11 days between 1869 and 1910. America's    most prolific inventor received 1,093 patents--more than any other person before    or since. While he reveled in and profited from his successes, he lived with    failure every day.       ""Results? Why man, I've gotten a lot of results. I know    several thousand things that won't work.""       Thomas Alva Edison, 1900      In 1973, Edison was the first inventor inducted into    the National Inventors Hall of Fame.            Lewis    Howard Latimer was employed by a Patent Solicitor where he began the study of    drafting. His talent for drafting and his creative genius led him to invent    a method of making carbon filaments for the electric incandescent lamp. Latimer    was the original draftsman for Thomas Edison and the star witness in suits which    infringed upon Edison's patents.                ""Heavier than air flying machines are impossible.""    Lord Kelving, President, Royal Society, c. 1895                         Famous magician Harry Houdini {born Ehrich Weiss in Budapest,    Hungary in 1874} was also an inventor. Houdini began his career as a trapeze    artist and was later renowned as a magician and an escape artist. He astonished    audiences by escaping from handcuffs, straitjackets, and prison cells. Houdini's    invention for a ""diver's suit"" permits divers, in case of danger, to quickly    divest themselves of the suit while submerged and to safely escape and reach    the surface of the water.      In his later years, Houdini put his extensive knowledge    of the occult and magic to public benefit by exposing the tricks of fraudulent    spiritualistic mediums. Houdini left his entire library of magic to the U.S.    Library of Congress.                     ""When you can do the common things in life    in an uncommon way, you will command the attention of the world."" George Washington    Carver         Since 1930, plants have been patentable.    The first plant patent was granted to Henry F. Bosenberg for a climbing or trailing    rose.        An    Wang was born in Shanghai, China. He immigrated to the United States in 1945    and received his Ph.D. in applied physics from Harvard University in 1948. He    founded Wang Laboratories in 1951 to develop specialty electronic devices. Dr.    Wang is responsible for the original development of the basic components and    systems of digital computing machines. He held more than 35 patents, revolutionizing    the information processing industry. Dr. Wang was inducted into the National    Inventors Hall of Fame in 1988.           Phillip J. Stevens holds several patents for innovative    concepts in weaponry. He directed the Minuteman III Weapon System at TRW, Inc.,    and founded Ultrasystems, Inc., a high-technology business enterprise. A former    director of the United Indian Development Association, he received multiple    awards for leadership, innovation, and support of the Native American people.      Stevens with co-inventor, Larry E. Hughes, invented a    new nozzle to control delivery of propellants from rocket motors. The new variable    area throat nozzle was simple in construction, light in weight, efficient in    operation, and relatively inexpensive to manufacture.                   Ysidro M. Martinez' invention of a below-the-knee prosthesis    avoids some of the problems associated with conventional artificial limbs. Martinez,    an amputee himself, took a theoretical approach in his design. He does not attempt    to replicate the natural limb with articulated joints in the ankle or foot which    is seen by Martinez as causing poor gait. His prosthesis has a high center of    mass and is light in weight to facilitate acceleration and deceleration and    reduce friction. The foot is considerably shorter to control acceleration forces,    reducing the friction and pressure.                The mouse that went to Harvard... was the    first animal to be patented in the United States. In the 1980s, Philip Leder    devised a method of introducing specific oncogenes (genes with the potential    to cause other cells to become cancerous) into mice. The transgenic non-human    eukaryotic animal is bred to contract breast cancer for medial research to facilitate    carcinogen testing and development of cancer therapies. As you can imagine,    the patenting of living organisms (nonhuman) has generated controversy and a    lot of public debate on the ethical, religious, economic, and regulatory issues    arising from their use.      More than a toy...       Everyone has a favorite toy--a cuddly bear, a rugged    truck, a special game. But how many of us connect that toy with a multi-billion    dollar industry that thrives on innovation?      America's toy manufacturers and retailers depend heavily    on intellectual property protection. Toy inventors use both utility and design    patents, along with trademarks and copyrights to prevent others from copying    or profiting from their inventions or their trade names. In fact, many toys--especially    video games--take advantage of all three types of intellectual property protection.      Americans did not enter the toy ""business"" until the    1830's, when steamboats and steam trains improved the transportation and distribution    of manufactured goods. Early toymakers used wood, tin, or cast iron to fashion    horses, soldiers, wagons, and other simple toys. Charles Goodyear's method for    ""vulcanizing"" rubber created another medium for manufacturing balls, dolls,    and squeeze toys.      Toys Turn On!       In the early 1970's, Pong, the first patented video game,    hit the market. Nolan Bushnell created it along with a company named Atari.    Pong debuted in arcades, and soon moved on to television screens in living rooms    around the world. Other games followed--Space Invaders, Pac Man, and Tron. As    technology advanced, the dedicated single game machine was replaced by programmable    machines that allowed different games to be played simply by exchanging a cartridge.      Inventions in circuitry and miniaturization in the early    1980's produced handheld games, as Nintendo, a Japanese electronics company,    along with many others, moved into the video game market. As home computers    become more accessible, video games become more versatile, action packed, challenging,    and diverse.      As society has progressed, so has the complexity and    diversity of our amusements. Once, toys simply reflected everyday life and activities.    Today, toys create new ways of living, teach us to adapt to changing technologies,    and inspire us to follow our dreams.      The    Ups and Downs of Yo-Yo's       The Yo-Yo, a weapon used in South Pacific cultures, has    been traced back to the ancient Greeks. First patented in 1866 by James L. Haven    and Charles Hettrich, the Yo-Yo has enjoyed periods of popularity for generations    with kids from 1 - 100.      Donald Duncan was the marketing genius responsible for    the first American Yo-Yo fad of the 1930's. He also invented the Eskimo Pie,    originated the Good Humor Ice Cream truck, and successfully marketed the first    parking meter. At one time, Lego Co. used unsold Yo-Yo's as wheels on toy trucks.    In 1962, the most recent period of popularity, Duncan sold 45 million of the    toy.                                                      Rumor has it...       that a Patent Office official resigned and recommended    that the Patent Office be closed because he thought that everything that could    possibly be invented had already been invented!      While that statement makes good fun of predictions that    do not come to pass, it is none the less just a myth. Researchers have found    no evidence that any official or employee of the U.S. Patent Office had ever    resigned because there was nothing left to invent. A clue to the origin of the    myth may be found in Patent Office Commissioner Henry Ellsworth's 1843 report    to Congress. In it he states, ""The advancement of the arts, from year to year,    taxes our credulity and seems to presage the arrival of that period when human    improvement must end."" But Commissioner Ellsworth was simply using a bit of    rhetorical flourish to emphasize the growing number of patents as presented    in the rest of the report. He even outlined specific areas in which he expected    patent activity to increase in the future.       Taken out of context, such remarks take on a life of    their own and are perpetuated in publication after publication whose authors,    rather than check facts, copy and quote each other. For example, recent publications    have attributed the ""everything that has been invented..."" quote to a later    commissioner, Charles H. Duell, who held that office in 1899. Unlike Ellsworth,    who may have been merely misquoted, there is absolutely no basis to support    Duell's alleged statement. Just the opposite is true. Duell's 1899 report documents    an increase of about 3,000 patents over the previous year, and nearly 60 times    the number granted in 1837. Further, Duell quotes President McKinley's annual    message saying, ""Our future progress and prosperity depend upon our ability    to equal, if not surpass, other nations in the enlargement and advance of science,    industry and commerce. To invention we must turn as one of the most powerful    aids to the accomplishment of such a result."" Duell adds, ""May not our inventors    hopefully look to the Fifty-sixth Congress for aid and effectual encouragement    in improving the American patent system?"" These are unlikely words of someone    who thinks that everything has been invented.      References:      Jeffery, Dr. Eber.  Journal of the Patent Office Society.     July 1940      Sass, Samuel.

Updated 3/28/03                         Travel          records         The Travel Office has just completed an audit conducted by the Inspector          General (IG) and some discrepancies in the record-keeping practices for          domestic travel records have surfaced. Because of these discrepancies,          the process for keeping domestic travel records in the group/division          offices has changed.          The Travel Office requires that copies of the following be sent to the          Travel Office with the actual travel requests/approvals/receipts, etc.,          to avoid inconsistent record-keeping practices throughout the Laboratory.                           1. Copies of justifications for any charges that are above the allowed          government rates, i.e., lodging, etc.          2. Hard copy signature approvals by a manager of any travel if the manager          does not approve on-line, i.e., if manager has delegated on-line approvals          a hard copy signature from the manager is required.           3. Approved copies of any exceptions to the travel policy.         If these copies are not sent to the Travel Office, group/division offices          are required to schedule these records under ADM 9/1.a., Commercial Freight          and Passenger Transportation Files, and must cut off these records at          the end of the fiscal year and retain them for six years. These records          must be kept as long as the Travel Office is required to keep the official          domestic travel records. When retention periods have been met, a request          for approval to destroy must be sent to IM-5 on a Certificate of Records          Destruction, Form 1704.          When group/division offices keep copies of domestic travel records submitted          to the Travel Office, these will remain scheduled under the ADM 23/1,          Office Administrative Files, and need to be cut off at the end of the          fiscal year and retained for two years. When retention periods have been          met, a request for approval to destroy must be sent to IM-5 on a Certificate          of Records Destruction, Form 1704.

The topic for this seminar will be ""Exploring, Discovery and Admissibility          of Electronic Records: A Trial Lawyer's Perspective."" The seminar          speaker will be John J. Isaza, an independent senior consultant responsible          for the Legal and Regulatory Information Services Division of Records          Improvement Institute LLC, of Laguna Beach, Calif. Isaza will discuss          the particular challenges that judges, lawyers and companies face in having          particular types of documents discovered and then admitted in court, including          e-mails, word, excel or power point documents, imaged documents and enterprise          planning systems.          The cost for the seminar will be $75 for ARMA members and $125 for non-ARMA          members. Refreshment and lunch will be included.

The termination presentations are held every Laboratory pay day for University          of California Lab employees. Employees who are retiring aren't required          to attend a presentation, but rather, they should schedule a meeting with          their designated benefits specialist.         The presentations begin at 8:30 a.m. in room P280 on the second floor          of the Otowi Building at Technical Area 3. Pre-registration is required.          Employees should register on line at  http://hrcluster.lanl.gov/TIOCourses/TIOAha.asp?CourseNumber=21013           one to two weeks prior to their last scheduled work day to sign up for          a benefits termination presentation.         Employees also must obtain a departure processing form from Staffing          (HR-S) before the presentation. This form is available at  http://www.hr.lanl.gov/hrstaffing/Terminations/index.stm           online.         At the presentation, employees will receive a packet of information about          their benefits and savings balances. They will learn about options to          continue or convert insurance plans and distribution options for savings          funds.         Employees who require a sign language interpreter should write to  benefits@lanl.gov           by e-mail three days in advance of the presentation they plan to attend.          Or call the benefits office at 5-3842 (TDD).

As a result of that effort,    Project XL was initiated in 1985 as a national partnership designed to encourage    proliferation of such programs and to develop new programs and materials which    will promote critical and creative thinking and problem-solving skills for all    children in our Nation's schools.      The INVENTIVE THINKING CURRICULUM PROJECT is one of the many projects included in this national outreach program. It should be used in conjunction with a thinking skills program as a means of applying critical and creative thinking and problem-solving skills through the activity of creating an innovation or invention.     When a student is asked to ""invent"" a solution to a problem, the student must draw upon previous knowledge, skills, and experience. The student also recognizes areas where new learnings must be acquired in order to understand or address the problem. This information must then be applied, analyzed, synthesized, and evaluated. Through critical and creative thinking and problem-solving, ideas become reality as children create inventive solutions, illustrate their ideas, and make models of their inventions. The INVENTIVE THINKING CURRICULUM PROJECT provides children with opportunities to develop and practice higher-order thinking skills.     Throughout the years, many thinking skills models and programs have been generated from among America's finest educators, seeking to describe the essential elements of thinking and/or to develop a systematic approach to teaching thinking skills as part of the school curricula. Three such models/descriptions are illustrated in this introduction. Although each uses different terminology, each model describes similar elements of either critical or creative thinking, or both. A review of the models of BLOOM, TAYLOR, and ISAKSEN and TREFFINGER show how the INVENTIVE THINKING CURRICULUM PROJECT provides an opportunity for students to ""experience"" most of the elements described in these models.       Benjamin Bloom's Model        Perhaps most familiar to educators is ""BLOOM'S taxonomy."" Bloom describes the major areas in the cognitive domain. This information is drawn from the  Taxonomy of Educational Objectives, Handbook 1: Cognitive Domain  (1956). The taxonomy begins by defining KNOWLEDGE as the remembering of previously learned material. Knowledge, according to Bloom, represents the lowest level of learning outcomes in the cognitive domain. Knowledge is followed by COMPREHENSION, the ability to grasp the meaning of material and goes just beyond the knowledge level. Comprehension is the lowest level of understanding. APPLICATION is the next area in the hierarchy and refers to the ability to use learned material in new and concrete principles and theories. Application requires a higher level of understanding than comprehension.     In    ANALYSIS, the next area of the taxonomy, the learning outcomes require an understanding    of both the content and the structural form of material. Next is SYNTHESIS,    which refers to the ability to put parts together to form a new whole. Learning    outcomes at this level stress creative behaviors with a major emphasis on the    formulation of new patterns or structures. The last level of the taxonomy is    EVALUATION. Evaluation is concerned with the ability to judge the value of material    for a given purpose. The judgments are to be based on definite criteria. Learning    outcome s in this area are the highest in the cognitive    hierarchy because they incorporate or contain elements of knowledge, comprehension,    application, analysis, and synthesis. In addition, they contain conscious value    judgments based on clearly defined criteria. The activity of inventing encourages    the four highest levels of learning--application, analysis, synthesis, and evaluation--in    addition to knowledge and comprehension.        Calvin Taylor's Model -- Talents    Unlimited      The second model is introduced by Calvin Taylor in Chapter XI and is discussed in a summary chapter by Carol Schlichter in Joseph Renzulli's book entitled  Systems and Models for Developing Programs for the Gifted and Talented  (1986). The Taylor model describes the talent areas as PRODUCTIVE THINKING, COMMUNICATION, PLANNING, DECISION MAKING, and FORECASTING. This work is best known as TALENTS UNLIMITED, a program of the National Diffusion Network of the U.S. Department of Education. The Taylor model incorporates both the critical and creative elements of thinking. Rather than a taxonomy, this is a thinking skills model that describes the essential elements of thinking, beginning with the academic talent and then incorporating the other talent areas, as described in more detail below.     PRODUCTIVE THINKING promotes creative thinking in the    Taylor model. It suggests thinking of many ideas, varied ideas, unusual ideas,    and adding to those ideas.        COMMUNICATION has six elements which include:      *  give many, varied, single words to describe something;     *  give many, varied, single words to describe feelings;     *  think of many, varied things that are like another thing in a special way;     *  let others know that you understand how they feel;     *  make a network of ideas using many, varied and complete thoughts;     *  tell your feelings and needs without using words.     PLANNING requires that students learn to tell:     *  what they are going to plan;     *  the materials that they will need;     *  the steps that they will need to accomplish the task; and     *  the problems that might occur.     DECISION MAKING teaches the student to:     *  think of the many, varied things that could be done;     *  think more carefully about each alternative;     *  choose one alternative that they think is best; and     *  give many, varied reasons for the choice.     FORECASTING is the last of the five talents and requires students to make many, varied predictions about a situation, examining cause and effect relationships. Every element of the TAYLOR model is used when a child invents.     Creative Problem Solving Model      The third model developed by Scott Isaksen and Donald Treffinger as described in the book  Creative Problem Solving: The Basic Course  (1985) by Isaksen and Treffinger and published in Buffalo, New York, by Bearly Limited, also describes both critical and creative thinking. CREATIVE THINKING is described as making and communicating connections to: think of many possibilities; think and experience in various ways and use different points of view; think of new and unusual possibilities; and guide in generating and selecting alternatives. CRITICAL THINKING is described as analyzing and developing possibilities to: compare and contrast many ideas; improve and refine ideas; make effective decisions and judgments; and provide a sound foundation for effective action. These definitions are used in a six-stage, problem-solving process. A brief description of each of the six stages follows:     1. Mess Finding:  Just what's the mess that needs cleaning up, the situation that demands our attention? We have to identify and acknowledge this first before we can proceed.     2. Data Finding:  Once the general mess is defined, the next stage involves ""taking stock""--unearthing and collecting information, knowledge, facts, feelings, opinions, and thoughts to sort out and clarify your mess more specifically. What do you know about the situation, and what do you still need to know?     3. Problem Finding:  Now that your data is collected, you need to formulate a ""problem statement"" that expresses the ""heart"" of the situation. You must try to put aside the common assumption that you ""already know what the problem is"" and try to state the problem in such a manner as to invite novel perspectives on it.     4. Idea Finding:  This is the state in which you brainstorm as many ideas or alternatives as possible for dealing with your problem statement. Don't evaluate your ideas at this point, merely list them as an idea pool from which you'll draw in putting together a variety of solutions to your problem.      5. Solution Finding:  Now that you have a number of ideas that can serve as possible solutions to your problem, it's time to evaluate them systematically. To do this you have to generate a variety of criteria and select the most important for your problem. Is it cost? expediency? pleasure? time involvement? etc. In this way, you'll be able to identify and evaluate the relative strengths and weaknesses of possible solutions.     6. Acceptance Finding:  Having decided upon a solution, it's time to formulate a plan of action to implement your solution. Determine what kind of help you'll need, what obstacles or difficulties might get in the way, and what specific short- and long-term steps you are going to take to rid yourself of that original mess!     Now that you have reviewed these examples, you will see    the critical and creative thinking and problem-solving skills and talents that    can be applied through the activity of inventing. The INVENTIVE THINKING CURRICULUM    PROJECT that follows can be used across all disciplines and grade levels and    with         all children. It can be integrated with all curricular    areas and used as a means of applying the concepts or elements of any thinking    skills program that may be in use in your school district. Participation in    this project will provide your students with an excellent opportunity to experience    the highest levels of thinking. Activities can be adapted to the developmental    and academic needs of the class.      We hope that you will join Project XL in this national effort, by developing your own program for promoting the teaching of inventive thinking and problem-solving skills. Use the INVENTIVE THINKING CURRICULUM PROJECT as a springboard for capturing the imagination, interest, and creativity that each of us has within our reach. The children of this Nation are our very best investment in tomorrow. Our future will be brighter if we add a big ""T"" for thinking to the basic 3 ""Rs"" of the school curricula.     A special project that provides a unique opportunity for children of all ages to develop their problem-solving and inventive thinking skills in an integrated learning activity can be implemented at your school. Just use the procedures, activities, and guidelines in this booklet to create your own exciting program.     Children of all ages are talented and creative. This project will give them an opportunity to develop their creative potential and synthesize and apply knowledge and skills by creating an invention or innovation to solve a problem, just as a ""real"" inventor would.              ACTIVITIES              Activity #1      INTRODUCING INVENTIVE THINKING      ""Imagination is more important than knowledge, for    imagination embraces the world.""     Albert Einstein      1. Read the stories  in the back of this guide    (p. 27)or copy them for the students to read themselves. Ask students, ""How    did these inventors get their ideas? How did they make their ideas a reality?""    Locate books in your library about inventors, invention, and creativity. Older    students can locate these references themselves.      2. Invite a local inventor  to speak to the class.    Since local inventors are not usually listed in the phone book, you can find    them by calling a local patent attorney or your local intellectual property    law association. Your community may also have a Patent and Trademark Depository    Library or an inventor's society that you may contact. If not, most of your    major companies have a research and development department made up of people    who think inventively for a living.      3. Next, ask the students to look  at the things    in the classroom that are inventions. All the inventions in the classroom that    have a U.S. patent will have a patent number. One such item is probably the    pencil sharpener. Tell them to check out their house for patented items. Let    the students list all of the inventions they discover. What would improve these    inventions?      4. In order to guide your students  through the    inventive process, a few preliminary lessons dealing with creative thinking    will help set the mood. Begin with a brief explanation of brainstorming and    a discussion on the rules of brainstorming (see p. 10).      Brainstorming      Brainstorming is a process of spontaneous thinking used by an individual or by a group of people to generate numerous alternative ideas while deferring judgment. Introduced by Alex Osborn in his book  Applied Imagination,  brainstorming is the crux of each of the stages of all problem-solving methods.     RULES FOR BRAINSTORMING          NO    CRITICISM ALLOWED.  People tend to automatically evaluate each suggested    idea--their own as well as others. Both internal and external criticism are    to be avoided while brainstorming. Neither positive nor negative comments are    allowed. Either type inhibits the free flow of thought and requires time which    interferes with the next rule. Write each spoken idea down as it is given and    move on.           WORK FOR QUANTITY.  Alex Osborn stated that ""Quantity    breeds quality."" People must experience a ""braindrain"" (get all the common responses    out of the way) before the innovative, creative ideas can surface; therefore,    the more ideas, the more likely they are to be quality ideas.           HITCHHIKING WELCOME.  Hitchhiking occurs when one    member's idea produces a similar idea or an enhanced idea in another member.    All ideas should be recorded.           FREEWHEELING ENCOURAGED.  Outrageous, humorous, and    seemingly unimportant ideas should be recorded. It is not uncommon for the most    off-the-wall comment to be one wherein lies the solution for the problem.        Activity #2      PRACTICING THE CREATIVE PART        OF INVENTIVE THINKING     1. Cultivate the following creative thinking processes    described by Paul Torrance and discussed in  The Search for Satori and Creativity     (1979).          FLUENCY the production of a great number of ideas.            FLEXIBILITY the production of ideas or products that    show a variety of possibilities or realms of thought.            ORIGINALITY the production of ideas that are unique    or unusual.          ELABORATION the production of ideas that display intensive detail or enrichment.      For    practice in elaboration, have pairs or small groups of students choose a particular    idea from the brainstorming list and add the flourishes and details that would    develop the idea more fully.      Allow the students to share their innovative and inventive ideas!       2. Once your students have become familiar with the rules    of brainstorming and the creative thinking processes, Bob Eberle's SCAMPER technique    for brainstorming could be introduced.      S UBSTITUTE What else instead? Who else instead? Other ingredients? Other material? Other power? Other place?     C OMBINE How about a blend, an alloy, an ensemble? Combine purposes? Combine appeals?     A DAPT What else is like this? What other idea does this suggest? Does past offer parallel? What could I copy?     M INIFY Order, form, shape? What to add? More time?     M AGNIFY Greater frequency? Higher? Longer? Thicker?     P UT TO OTHER USES New ways to use as is? Other uses I modified? Other places to use? Other people to reach?     E LIMINATE What to subtract? Smaller? Condensed? Miniature? Lower? Shorter? Lighter? Omit? Streamline? Understate?     R EVERSE Interchange components? Other pattern?     R EARRANGE Other layout? Other sequence? Transpose cause and effect? Change pace? Transpose positive and negative? How about opposites? Turn it backward? Turn it upside-down? Reverse roles?     3. Bring in any object or use objects around the classroom to do the following exercise. Ask the students to list many new uses for a familiar object by using the SCAMPER technique with regard to the object. You could use a paper plate to begin with, and see how many new things the students will discover. Make sure to follow the rules for brainstorming in Activity #1.     4. Using literature, ask your students to create a new    ending to a story, change a character or situation within a story, or create    a new beginning for the story that would result in the same ending.      5. Put a list of objects on the chalkboard. Ask your    students to combine them in different ways to create a new product.      Let the students make their own list of objects. Once    they combine several of them, ask them to illustrate the new product and explain    why it might be useful.            Activity #3      PRACTICING INVENTIVE THINKING    WITH THE CLASS     Before your students begin to find their own problems    and create unique inventions or innovations to solve them, you can assist them    by taking them through some of the steps as a group.      1. Finding the Problem.  Let the class list problems in their own classroom that need solving. Use the ""brainstorming"" technique from Activity #1. Perhaps your students never have a pencil ready, as it is either missing or broken when it is time to do an assignment. Select one problem for the class to solve using the following steps:      a. Find several problems. Select one to work on.      b. Analyze the situation.      c. Think of many, varied, and unusual ways of solving the problem.     List the possibilities. Be sure to allow even the silliest possible solution, as creative thinking must have a positive, accepting environment in order to flourish.       2. Finding a Solution.       a. Select one or more possible solutions to work on. You may want to divide into groups if the class elects to work on several of the ideas.      b. Improve and refine the idea(s).      c. Share the class or individual solution(s)/invention(s) for solving the class problem.     Solving a ""class"" problem and creating a ""class"" invention    will help students learn the process and make it easier for them to work on    their own invention projects.              Activity #4      DEVELOPING AN INVENTION IDEA        Now that your students have had an introduction to the inventive process, it is time for them to find a problem and create their own invention to solve it.     1. Begin by asking your students to conduct a survey. Tell them to interview everyone that they can think of to find out what problems need solutions. What kind of invention, tool, game, device, or idea would be helpful at home, work, or during leisure time? (see p. 39)     2. Ask the students to list the problems that need to be solved.     3. Next comes the decision-making process. Using the list of problems, ask the students to think of which problems would be possible for them to work on. They can do this by listing the pros and cons for each possibility. Predict the outcome or possible solution(s) for each problem. Make a decision by selecting one or two problems that provide the best options for an inventive solution. (Duplicate the Planning and Decision-Making Framework p. 41)     4. Begin an Inventor's Log or Journal. A record of your ideas and work will help you develop your invention and protect it when completed. (Sample log sheet on p. 51.)          RULES FOR AUTHENTIC     JOURNAL KEEPING      *  Using a bound    notebook, make notes each day about the things you do and learn while working    on your invention.      *  Record your    idea and how you got it.      *  Write about    problems you have and how you solve them.      *  Write in ink    and do not erase.      *  Add sketches    and drawings to make things clear.      *  List all parts,    sources, and costs of materials.      *  Sign and date    all entries at the time they are made and have them witnessed.             5. To illustrate why record-keeping is important, read the following story about Daniel Drawbaugh who said that he invented the telephone, but didn't have one single paper or record to prove it.        Long before Alexander Graham Bell filed a patent application in 1875, Daniel Drawbaugh claimed to have invented the telephone. But since he had no journal or record, the Supreme Court rejected his claims by four votes to three. Alexander Graham Bell had excellent records and was awarded the patent for the telephone.     Activity #5      BRAINSTORMING FOR CREATIVE    SOLUTIONS           Now that the students have one or two problems to work on, they must take the same steps that they did in solving the class problem in Activity #3. These steps could be listed on the chalkboard or a chart.     1. Analyze the problem(s). Select one to work on.     2. Think of many, varied, and unusual ways of solving the problem. List all of the possibilities. Be non-judgmental. (See Brainstorming in Activity #1 and SCAMPER in Activity #2.)     3. Select one or more possible solutions to work on.     4. Improve and refine your ideas.     Now that your students have some exciting possibilities    for their invention projects, they will need to use their critical thinking    skills to narrow down the possible solutions. They can do this by asking themselves    the following questions about their inventive idea:      Activity #6      PRACTICING THE CRITICAL PARTS    OF     INVENTIVE THINKING            1. Is my idea practical?     2. Can it be made easily?     3. Is it as simple as possible?     4. Is it safe?     5. Will it cost too much to make or use?     6. Is my idea really new?     7. Will it withstand use, or will it break easily?     8. Is my idea similar to something else?     9. Will people really use my invention? (Survey your classmates or the people in your neighborhood to document the need or usefulness of your idea.)       Activity #7      COMPLETING THE INVENTION      When students have an idea that meets most of the above    qualifications, they need to plan how they are going to complete their project.    The following planning technique will save them a great deal of time and effort:      1. Identify the problem and possible solution. Give your invention a name.     2. List the materials needed to illustrate your invention and to make a model of it. You will need paper, pencil, and crayons or markers to draw your invention. You might use cardboard, paper, clay, wood, plastic, yarn, paper clips, and so forth to make a model. You might also want to use an art book or a book on model-making from your school library.     3. List, in order, the steps for completing your invention.     4. Think of the possible problems that might occur. How would you solve them?     5. Complete your invention. Ask your parents and teacher    to help with the model.                                     REMEMBER!            * WHAT  -          describe the problem            * MATERIALS           - list the materials needed            * STEPS  -          list the steps to complete your invention            * PROBLEMS           - predict the problems that could occur.                           Activity #8      NAMING THE INVENTION        An invention can be named in one of the    following ways:    1. Using the inventor'sBraille name          Levi Strauss = LEVI'S ®  jeans            Louis Braille = Alphabet System           2. Using the components or ingredients of the invention           Root Beer         Peanut Butter                  3. With initials or acronyms          IBM ®         S.C.U.B.A. ®           4. Using word combinations (notice repeated consonant sounds and rhyming words).           KIT KAT ®         HULA HOOP ®        PUDDING POPS ®           CAP'N CRUNCH ®           5. Using the product's function           SUPERSEAL ®          DUSTBUSTER ®          vacuum cleaner           hairbrush           earmuffs           Activity #9      OPTIONAL MARKETING ACTIVITIES      Students can be very fluent when it comes to listing ingenious    names of products out on the market. Solicit their suggestions and have them    explain what makes each name effective. Each student should generate names for    his/her own invention.        1. Developing a slogan or jingle      Have the students define the terms ""slogan"" and ""jingle."" Discuss the purpose of   having a slogan.               Sample slogans and jingles:      ""Things go better with Coke.""   ""COKE IS IT! ® ""   ""TRIX ARE FOR KIDS ® ""   ""OH THANK HEAVEN FOR 7-ELEVEN ® ""   ""TWOALLBEEFPATTIES...""   ""GE: WE BRING GOOD THINGS TO LIFE! ® ""      Your students will be able to recall many slogans and jingles! When a slogan is named, discuss the reasons for its effectiveness. Allow time for thought in which the students can create jingles for their inventions.       2. CREATING AN ADVERTISEMENT         For a crash course in advertising, discuss the visual effect created by a television commercial, magazine, or newspaper advertisement. Collect magazine or newspaper ads that are eye-catching--some of the ads might be dominated by words and others by pictures that ""say it all."" Students might enjoy exploring newspapers and magazines for outstanding advertisements. Have students create magazine ads to promote their inventions. (For more advanced students, further lessons on advertising techniques would be appropriate at this point.)       3.    RECORDING A RADIO PROMO       A radio promo could be the icing on a student's advertising campaign! A promo might include facts about the usefulness of the invention, a clever jingle or song, sound effects, humor... the possibilities are endless. Students may choose to tape record their promos for use during the Invention Convention.       4. ADVERTISING ACTIVITY      Collect 5 - 6 objects and give them new uses. For instance, a toy hoop could be a waist reducer, and some strange looking kitchen gadget might be a new type of mosquito catcher. Use your imagination! Search everywhere--from the tools in the garage to the kitchen drawer--for fun objects. Divide the class into small groups, and give each group one of the objects to work with. The group is to give the object a catchy name, write a slogan, draw an ad, and record a radio promo. Stand back and watch the creative juices flow. Variation: Collect magazine ads and have the students create new advertising campaigns using a different marketing angle.       Activity #10      PARENT INVOLVEMENT     Few, if any, projects are successful unless the child    is encouraged by the parents and other caring adults. Once the children have    developed their own, original ideas, they should discuss them with their parents.    Together, they can work to make the child's idea come to life by making a model.    Although the making of a model is not necessary, it makes the project more interesting    and adds another dimension to the project. You can involve parents by simply    sending a letter home to explain the project and let them know how they may    participate. One of your parents may have invented something that they can share    with the class. (See sample parent letter on p. 45.)               Activity #11      YOUNG INVENTORS' DAY      Plan    a Young Inventors' Day so that your students can be recognized for their inventive    thinking. This day should provide opportunities for the children to display    their inventions and tell the story of how they got their idea and how it works.    They can share with other students, their parents, and others.      When a child successfully completes a task, it is important that (s)he be recognized for the effort. All children who participate in the Inventive Thinking Curriculum Project are winners.     The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has prepared a certificate    that can be copied and given to all children who participate and use       their inventive thinking skills to create an invention    or innovation. This award, signed by the Assistant Secretary of Commerce and    Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks, is included on page 47.          Activity #12      ENRICHMENT     The following stories about great thinkers and inventors    will help to motivate your students and enhance their appreciation of the contributions    of inventors to the American way of life.      As students read these stories, they will also realize the ""inventors"" are male, female, old, young, minority, and majority. They are ordinary people who follow through with their creative ideas to make their dreams a reality.     1. GREAT THINKERS AND THEIR INVENTIONS     Earmuffs  ""Baby, Its Cold Outside"" may have been the song running through 13 year old Chester Greenwood's head one cold December day in 1873. To protect his ears while ice skating, he found a piece of wire, and with his grandmother's help, padded the ends. In the beginning, his friends laughed at him. However, when they realized that he was able to stay outside skating long after they had gone inside freezing, they stopped laughing. Instead, they began to ask Chester to make ear covers for them, too. At age 17 Chester applied for a patent. For the next 60 years, Chester's factory made earmuffs, and earmuffs made Chester rich!        BAND-AID ® At the turn of the century,    Mrs. Earl Dickson, an inexperienced cook, often burned and cut herself. Mr.    Dickson, a Johnson and Johnson employee, got plenty of practice in hand bandaging!    Out of concern for his wife's safety, he began to prepare bandages ahead of    time so that his wife could apply them by herself. By combining a piece of surgical    tape and a piece of gauze, he fashioned the first crude adhesive strip bandage!      LIFE-SAVERS ®  Candy  During the hot summer of 1913, Clarence Crane, a chocolate candy manufacturer, found himself facing a dilemma. When he tried to ship his chocolates to candy shops in other cities they melted into gooey blobs. To avoid dealing with the ""mess,"" his customers were deferring their orders until cool weather. In order to retain his customers, Mr. Crane needed to find a substitute for the melted chocolates. He experimented with hard candy which wouldn't melt during shipment. Using a machine designed for making medicine pills, Crane produced small, circular candies with a hole in the middle. The birth of LIFE SAVERS!     FRISBEE ® The    term FRISBEE did not always refer to the familiar plastic disks we visualize    flying through the air. Long ago (over 100 years ago), in Bridgeport, Connecticut,    William Russell Frisbie owned the Frisbie Pie Company and delivered his pies    locally. All of his pies were baked in the same type of 10"" round tin with a    raised edge, wide brim, six small holes in the bottom, and ""Frisbie Pies"" on    the bottom. Playing catch with the tins soon became a popular local sport. However,    the tins were slightly dangerous when a toss was missed. It became the Yale    custom to yell ""Frisbie"" when throwing a pie tin. In the 40's when plastic emerged,    the pie-tin game was recognized as a manufacturable and marketable product.    (Note: FRISBEE ®  is a registered trademark of Wham-O Mfg. Co.)      2. THOMAS EDISON AND OTHER YOUNG INVENTORS          If I were to tell you that  Thomas Alva Edison  had shown signs of inventive genius at an early age, you probably would not be surprised. Mr. Edison achieved enormous fame with his lifelong contributions of volumes of inventive technology. He received the first of his 1,093 U.S. patents by age 22. In the book,  Fire of Genius,  Ernest Heyn reported on a remarkable resourceful young Edison--though some of his earliest tinkering clearly lacked merit.     By the age of six, Thomas Edison's experiments with fire were said to have cost his father a barn. Soon after that, it is reported that young Edison tried to launch the first human balloon by persuading another youth to swallow large quantities of effervescing powders to inflate himself with gas. Of course, the experiments brought quite unexpected results!     Chemistry and electricity held great fascination for this child, Thomas Edison. By his early teens, he had designed and perfected his first real invention, an electrical cockroach control system. He glued parallel strips of tinfoil to a wall and wired the strips to the poles of a powerful battery--quite a shock for the unsuspecting insect.     As a dynamo of creativity, Mr. Edison stood as decidedly unique; but as a child with a curious, problem-solving nature, he was not alone. Here are some more ""inventive children"" we grew to know and appreciate:         At age 14, one schoolboy invented a rotary brush device to remove husks from    wheat in the flour mill run by his friend's father. The young inventor's name?    Alexander Graham Bell.           At 16, another of our junior achievers saved pennies    to buy materials for his chemistry experiments. While still a teenager, he set    his mind on developing a commercially viable aluminum refining process. By age    25, Charles Hall received a patent on his revolutionary electrolytic process.           While only 19 years old, another imaginative young    person designed and built his first helicopter. In the summer of 1909, it very    nearly flew. Years later, Igor Sikorsky perfected his design and saw his early    dreams change aviation history. Silorsky was inducted into the National Inventors    Hall of Fame in 1987.      Scores of childhood problem-solvers abound. Perhaps you've    heard about:      *  Samuel Colt's  childhood experience with underwater explosives;     *  Fourteen-year-old  Robert Fulton's  manually operated paddlewheel; and     *  Guglielmo Marconi's  early mechanical/electrical tinkering.     Even the father of television,  Philo T. Farnsworth,  conceived his optical scanning idea at the tender age of 14.     3. GREAT WOMEN INVENTORS      Inventions tell something about the inventor's place in the society in which (s)he lives, a closeness to certain kinds of problems, and possession of certain skills. It is not surprising that up until the mid 20th Century, women's inventions were often related to childcare, housework, and healthcare, all traditional female occupations. In recent years, with access to specialized training and broader job opportunities, women are applying their creativity to many new kinds of problems, including those requiring high technology.While women have frequently come up with new ways to make their work easier, they have not always received credit for their ideas. Some stories about early women inventors show that women often recognized that they were entering ""a man's world,"" and shielded their work from the public eye by allowing men to patent their inventions.     *  Although Eli Whitney received a patent for a cotton gin,  Catherine Greene  is said to have posed both the problem and the basic idea to Whitney. Furthermore, according to Matilda Gage, ( Women as Inventor,  1883), his first model, fitted with wooden teeth, did not do the work well, and Whitney was about to throw the work aside, when Mrs. Greene proposed the substitution of wire to catch the cotton seeds.     OTHER WOMEN INVENTORS AND THEIR DISCOVERIES      * Margaret Knight,  remembered as ""the female Edison,"" received some 26 patents for such diverse items as a window frame and sash, machinery for cutting shoe soles, and improvements to internal combustion engines. Her most significant patent was for machinery that would automatically fold and glue paper bags to create square bottoms, an invention which dramatically changed shopping habits. Workmen reportedly refused her advice when first installing the equipment because, ""after all, what does a woman know about machines?""     * Sarah Breedlove    Walker,  the daughter of former slaves, was orphaned at seven and widowed    by 20. Madame Walker is credited with inventing hair lotions, creams, and an    improved hair styling hot comb. But her greatest achievement may be the development    of the Walker System, which included a broad offering of cosmetics, licensed    Walker Agents, and Walker Schools, which offered meaningful employment and personal    growth to thousands of Walker Agents, mostly Black women. Sarah Walker was the    first American woman self-made millionaire.           * Bette Graham  hoped    to be an artist, but circumstances led her into secretarial work. Bette, however,    was not an accurate typist. Fortunately, she recalled that artists could correct    their mistakes by painting over them with gesso, so she invented a quick drying    ""paint"" to cover her typing mistakes. Bette first prepared the secret formula    in her kitchen using a hand mixer, and her young son helped to pour the mixture    into little bottles. In 1980, the Liquid Paper Corporation, which Bette Graham    built, was sold for over $47 million.      * Ann Moore,  a Peace Corps volunteer, saw how African women carried babies on their backs by tying cloth around their bodies, leaving both hands free for other work. When she returned to the United States, she designed a carrier which became the popular SNUGLI. Recently Ms. Moore received another patent for a carrier to conveniently transport oxygen cylinders. People needing oxygen for breathing assistance, who were previously confined to stationary oxygen tanks, can now move about more freely. Her company now sells several versions including lightweight backpacks, handbags, shoulder bags, and wheelchair/walker carriers for portable cylinders.     * Stephanie Kwolek,     one of Dupont's leading chemists, discovered the ""miracle fiber,"" Kevlar,    which has five times the strength of steel by weight. Uses for Kevlar are seemingly    endless, including ropes and cables for oil drilling rigs, canoe hulls, boat    sails, automobile bodies and tires, and military and motorcycle helmets. Many    Viet Nam veterans and police officers are alive today because of protection    provided by bullet-proof vests made from Kevlar. Because of its strength and    lightness, Kevlar was chosen as the material for the Gossamer Albatross, a pedal    airplane flown across the English Channel. Kwolek was inducted into the National    Inventors Hall of Fame in 1995.      * Gertrude B. Elion,     1988 Nobel laureate in Medicine, and Scientist Emeritus with Burroughs Wellcome    Company, is credited with the synthesis of two of the first successful drugs    for Leukemia, as well as Imuron, an agent to prevent the rejection of kidney    transplants, and Zovirax, the first selective antiviral agent against herpes    virus infections. Researchers who discovered AZT, a breakthrough treatment for    AIDS, used Elion's protocols. Elion was inducted into the National Inventors    Hall of Fame in 1991, the first woman inductee.           Did you know      *  windshield wipers    were patented by  Mary Anderso   n  in    1903?      *  dandruff shampoo was patented by  Josie Stuart  in 1903?     *  a dishwasher was patented by  Josephine Cochrane  in 1914?     *  the first disposable diaper was patented by  Marion Donovan  in 1951?     *  a compact portable hair dryer was patented by  Harriet J. Stern  in 1962?     *  a dough product for frozen pizza was patented by  Rose Totino  in 1979?     *  the Melitta Automatic Drip Coffee Maker was patented by  Melitta Benz  in Germany in 1908?                 Note: Much of the material in this section was        drawn from the Minnesota Historical Society Exhibit, ""Her Works Praise Her,        Inventions by Women.""

GREAT MINORITY INVENTORS      Between 1863 and 1913, approximately 1,200 inventions were patented by Black inventors. Many more were unidentified because they hid their race to avoid discrimination. Some sold their inventions to White men. The following stories are about a few of the great minority inventors.     *  Elijah McCoy.     Have you ever heard of the term ""real McCoy?"" That term may apply to a famous    Black inventor by the name of Elijah McCoy. He earned about 50 patents, but    the most famous one was for a metal or glass cup that fed oil to bearings through    a small-bore tube. Machinists and engineers who wanted genuine McCoy lubricators    may have originated the term ""the real McCoy."" Elijah McCoy was born in Ontario,    Canada, in 1843, the son of slaves who had fled Kentucky. He died in Michigan    in 1929.      *     Benjamin Banneker.  Benjamin Banneker created    the first striking clock made of wood in America. He became known as the ""Afro-American    Astronomer."" He published an almanac and with his knowledge of mathematics and    astronomy, he assisted in the surveying and planning of the new city of Washington,    D.C.       *  Granville Woods     had more than 60 patents. Known as the ""Black Edison,"" he improved Bell's    telegraph and created an electrical motor that made the underground subway possible.    He also improved the airbrake.      *  Garrett Morgan     invented the traffic signal that saved thousands of lives when the automobile    became popular. He also invented a safety hood for firefighters.      *  George Washington    Carver  changed the South with his many inventions. He discovered over 300    different products made from the peanut which, until Carver, was considered    a lowly food fit for hogs. He dedicated himself to teaching others, learning    and working with nature. He created over 125 new products with the sweet potato    and taught poor farmers how to rotate crops to i   mprove    their soil and their cotton. George Washington Carver was a great scientist    and inventor who learned to be a careful observer and who was honored throughout    the world for his creation of new things.

Copy Masters         INVENTION IDEA SURVEY        One of the best ways to collect ideas for developing    an innovation or invention is to take a survey. Make sure to survey a variety    of people of all different ages and occupations. The more people you talk to,    the more ideas you will get. The following list of questions may help you:      1. What does not work as well as you would like it to    work?      2. What job(s) would you like to see solved?      3. What problem(s) would you like to see solved?      4.

The Inventive Thinking Curriculum Project is a school activity which promotes analytical and creative thinking and problem solving. Parents can enjoy this project at home with their children by encouraging creative ideas, letting them share ideas with the family, and by assisting them with making models of their inventive ideas.     Our students will be asked to survey you, their friends, and other family members to discover a problem that needs solving. Perhaps the cap is always left off of the toothpaste or your child is always losing sneakers, pencils or mittens. Once the children find problems to solve, they will begin thinking of many ideas that might solve those problems. When they do this, they will be combining many of the skills learned in science, social studies, language, writing, art, library, math, and more.     Each student participating in the Inventive Thinking Curriculum Project will receive a certificate of recognition from the Assistant Secretary and Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks in Washington, D.C., and will share the invention with other students at our school.     Thank you for your support in this special and imaginative    adventure in learning. You will be receiving more information during the school    year.       Teacher  __________________________________   Principal  __________________________________     Certificate of Recognition for Innovative Achievement              POSITIVE COMMENTS          Presenter's Name:________________________________________      What I like most about your invention is:          ""Praise is the best diet for us, after all...""

Every time you write in the log, you should initial and date your entry and also have it signed by a witness. A witness can be anyone who knows what you are working on that day--mom, dad, friend, brother, sister, etc. The list below includes some of the items that might be recorded in your log. You will think of others. Remember, every time you work on your project or just ""think"" about your idea, you should record it in your inventor's log or notebook.

People     Drawings of Possible Solutions:       Results of Interviews:       Results of Surveys:       Other       A PATENT, TRADEMARK,    AND COPYRIGHT PRIMER     On March 6, 1646, Joseph Jenkes received the first mechanical    patent in North America. Issued by the General Court of Massachusetts, it protected    his mill for manufacturing scythes. That was the prelude to the U.S. Patent    System which has helped give birth to major industries that have transformed    the way we live.      On April 10, 1790, President George Washington signed the bill which laid the foundations of the modern American patent system. Since that time, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has recorded and protected the electric lamp of Thomas Edison, the telephone of Alexander Graham Bell, the flying machine of the Wright Brothers, and the inventions of hundreds of thousands of other inventors.     The patent system has protected inventors by giving them an opportunity to profit from their labors, and it has benefited society by systematically recording new inventions and releasing them to the public after the inventors' limited rights have expired.     The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office is one of the most unusual branches of the U.S. Government. Its examining staff of about 2,000 is trained in all branches of science and examines thoroughly every application to determine whether a patent may be granted--a task, in these days, involving the most exhaustive research. Not only must the examiners search United States and foreign patents to learn if a similar patent has been issued, but they must study scientific books and publications to discover whether the idea has ever been described. Previous publications, invention, or use prevents a patent being issued.     In addition to issuing patents, the Patent and Trademark Office has, since 1870, been in charge of registering trademarks, the business community's most valuable asset. More than 1,400,000 trademarks have been issued.     In its earlier days, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office had on various occasions the responsibility for administering copyright matters, a task that since 1870 has been administered by the Library of Congress; collecting and publishing agricultural information; and even collecting meteorological data. For some years, it was the custodian not only of the famous old Patent Office models--the delight of every visitor to Washington for many years--but of the Declaration of Independence, and other historical documents and relics.     By publishing and distributing copies of every U.S. patent, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has made available to the public the world's greatest scientific and mechanical library.     Patents in Brief     A patent is a grant issued by the U.S. Government giving inventors the right to exclude all others from making, using, or selling their inventions within the United States, its territories, and possessions.     There are three kinds of patents: (1) utility patents, granted to the inventor or discoverer of any new and useful process, machine, manufacture, composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof; (2) plant patents, granted on any distinct and new variety of asexually reproduced plant; and (3) design patents, granted on any new, original, and ornamental design for an article of manufacture.     Utility and plant patents are granted for a term which begins on the date of the grant and ends 20 years from the date the patent application was first filed, subject to the payment of maintenance fees; design patents are granted for a term of 14 years from the date of the grant. Patents may be extended only by special act of Congress, except for some pharmaceutical patents whose terms may be extended to make up for time lost due to Government-required testing.     If you plan to file an application, you or your representative should make a search of patents previously granted to make sure that your idea has not already been patented. You may do this at the Public Search Room of the Patent and Trademark Office, Crystal Plaza Building No. 3, 2021 South Clark Place, Arlington, Virginia. Hours are 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m., Monday through Friday except holidays. More limited searches may be made at Patent and Trademark Depository Libraries located throughout the country.     The patent application process can be complex, and the Patent and Trademark Office cannot assist in the preparation of application papers. We strongly advise prospective applicants to engage the services of a patent attorney or agent. Although the PTO cannot recommend any particular attorney or agent and does not control their fees, we do maintain a roster of approximately 17,000 patent attorneys and agents registered to practice before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. This roster is available for inspection at Patent and Trademark Depository Libraries, for sale by the Superintendent of Documents at the Government Printing Office, or on the World Wide Web (http://www.uspto.gov).     The basic fee for filing an application for patent ranges from $160 to $770, depending on the type of patent application being filed and whether or not the applicant is entitled to status as a small entity (independent inventor, small business concern, or non-profit organization). Issue fees range from $220 to $1,290. Maintenance fees are due at 3 1 Ž 2 , 7 1 Ž 2 , and 11 1 Ž 2  years from the date the patent is granted. An individual inventor can expect to pay a minimum of $4,000 for a utility patent.     Applications are assigned to examiners who are experts in various fields of technology. The invention must be new, useful, and unobvious to those in that particular field of study. This procedure normally takes about 19 months.     Disclosure Document Program     Under its Disclosure Document Program, the PTO accepts and preserves for a two-year period papers disclosing an invention pending the filing of an application for patent. This disclosure is accepted as evidence of the dates of conception of the invention, but provides no patent protection nor should it be considered a ""grace period"" during which the inventor can wait to file a patent application without possible loss of benefits. A fee of $10 is charged for this service.     Provisional Patent Application     A provisional application establishes a filing date but does not begin the examination process. It provides the inventor with a one-year period to further develop the invention, determine marketability, acquire funding or capital, or seek licensing agreements. To obtain a patent, the inventor must file a nonprovisional application within 12 months of the filing date of the provisional application. The fee is $150 or $75 for a small entity.     Trademarks in Brief     A trademark (or brand name or logo) is a word, name, symbol, design, combination of word and design or slogan used by a manufacturer or merchant to identify its goods or services and distinguish them from those manufactured or sold by others. When it is used for services, it can be called a service mark.     Trademark rights come from using the mark, and marks are protected under common law from the time they are first used. While there is no requirement to do so, owners of marks who have used them or have a bona fide intention to use them in Federally regulated commerce may register them with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. This provides the owners with certain procedural and legal advantages. For intent-to-use applications, actual use of the mark in commerce is a prerequisite to the ultimate issuance of a registration.     Many trademark owners use a  ™  (trademark) or  SM  (service mark) symbol with their mark to indicate that they are claiming rights in it. The  ®  symbol may only be used if the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office issued a Federal registration. To register a mark, the owner must file an application consisting of a written statement in which the owner indicates among other things the goods or services in connection with which the mark is used and the date of first use of the mark in commerce; a drawing of the mark; five specimens showing the mark as it is actually used (labels, tags, packaging, etc.); and the required filing fee of $245 per class.     Each application is reviewed by an examining attorney to determine if the mark is eligible for registration and is compared with other marks to determine if it is likely to cause confusion with those already registered. If a proposed mark passes the examination, it is then published in the  Official Gazette  of the Patent and Trademark Office. Those who believe they will be damaged by registration of the mark then have an opportunity to oppose registration. If no opposition is filed, a registration certificate is issued or a notice of allowance is issued to the applicant in an intent-to-use application. Within six months after the issuance of the notice of allowance, the applicant must file specimens evidencing use of the mark in commerce, a fee of $100, and a verified statement that the mark is in use in commerce before a registration certificate is issued. The registration may be renewed every 10 years as long as the registrant is still using the mark.     Note: Fees mentioned above represent only the minimum required for a patent or trademark application. Additional fees may be due during the prosecution of an application. Fees are current as of October 1996. Fee increases, when necessary, usually take effect on October 1 of any given year. For a complete list of fees or further information, write to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, Center for Patent and Trademark Information, Washington, DC 20231, or call 800-786-9199 or 703-308-HELP(4357).      Copyrights in Brief     The seeds of copyright protection were sown in Gutenberg's development of the printing press that ultimately led to the first printed copyright statute, the English Statute of Anne. Both the printing press and the concept of copyright protection followed the colonists to the new world. The state legislature of 12 of the first states passed copyright laws before Congress enacted the first Federal law. On may 31, 1790, Congress used the power given it in Article 1 Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution to ""promote the progress of science and useful arts by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries"" and enacted the first Federal Copyright Act.      Noah Webster, the compiler of both the first American speller and an early dictionary, played a major role in getting both the state laws and the first Federal statute enacted. He traveled to each legislature and described the authors' plight and their need for copyright protection. Authors have continued to guard the rights granted by the Constitution and to ensure that new technologies permitting copying do not erode these rights.     What is copyright and when does copyright protection arise?  Federal copyright legislation gives an author certain exclusive rights for a limited time: the right to reproduce the copyrighted work, to prepare derivative works, to distribute copies or phonorecords, to perform the work publicly, and to display the work publicly. Congress attempts to create a balance between the rights given to authors and the legitimate needs for society. There are some limitations or exemptions that permit society to make specific uses of copyrighted works.     Copyright subsists in an original work of authorship from the time the work is first created or fixed in any tangible medium of expression, now known or later developed, from which that work can be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated. A work is put in a tangible form, for example, when a literary work is typed or written or a piece of music captured on tape.     Copyright covers the expression of ideas and not the idea itself. Thus, copyright does not cover ""any idea, procedure, process, system, method of operation, concept, principle, or discovery..."" It does not, for example, protect blank checks, standardized material, titles, or government works.     What does copyright protection mean for an author?  Copyright means that no one may appropriate the copyright owner's exclusive right to reproduce, distribute, perform, or display a work without permission from the author unless the right has been transferred to the user or the person who authorizes or licenses this particular use, or an exemption covers the use in question.      What works does copyright protect?  The first law protected maps, charts, and books for a basic term of 14 years; since 1790 the copyright law has evolved to include musical works, dramatic works, photographs, paintings, and other works of art, motion pictures, and sound recordings.     Literary works:  Copyright protects literary works of all types from novels such as  Gone With the Wind  or  The Catcher in the Rye,  to text books and other fact-based accounts, including newspapers. Although copyright covers the expression in non-fiction works, it does not cover the facts themselves. They are uncopyrightable and can be freely used by anyone. Copyright in the literary works also covers printed speeches such as Martin Luther King, Jr.'s famous ""I have a dream"" speech. Today, even computer programs are protected as literary works.     Musical works:  Copyright covers all kinds of music from the songs performed on the radio to the music in television commercials and MTV.     Dramatic works:  Copyright covers every kind of permanently fixed dramatic work from senior plays such as Our Town performed by high schools, to such current Broadway blockbusters as Phantom of the Opera, M. Butterfly, or the latest Neil Simon offering. It covers those plays written especially for the theater like Arthur Miller's classic Death of a Salesman and also those based on other popular works like the adaptation of Kafka's short story Metamorphosis.     Pantomimes and choreographic works:  Copyright protects dance sequences in stage shows like Chorus Line or Cats if they are in tangible form.     Pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works:  Works created by sculptors, photographers, painters, and other graphic artists are protected by copyright. The works covered include not only paintings, photographs, and sculptures, but also advertisements, the artwork on game boards, and the artwork on fabrics or textiles.     Motion pictures and other audiovisual works:  Classics like The Wizard of Oz or the latest Steven Spielberg or Woody Allen film are protectible, as are television programs and ideograms, including the once very popular Pac Man and the currently popular Nintendo games.     Sound recordings:  The copyright law was amended in 1971 to include sound recordings. Copyright now protects the latest recording of your favorite artists in any format--disk (be it 45, 33, or compact disk), tape, or cassette. The copyright authorship protected in a sound recording is two-fold: it covers the contribution of both the performer and the record producer responsible for the recording.     How long is a work protected?  As noted earlier, the 1790 act provided a 14 year term. Mark Twain was one of the authors who persuaded Congress that the term should be longer. In 1909 the term was extended to protect authors for a 28 year term plus a possibility of 28 more years if the author renewed his or her claim in a timely fashion. Then in 1976 the term was extended again to its current length: the life of the author plus 50 years. Special rules apply to works created by employees as part of their jobs such as motion pictures and anonymous or pseudonymous works.     When the term of the protection expires on a particular work, it may be used freely by anyone.     Where is the work protected?  A work copyrighted in the United States is protected here as well as in all of the other countries with whom we have copyright relations by our membership in the two multilateral copyright treaties--the Universal Copyright Convention and the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, by presidential proclamation, or bilateral relations. The United States has copyright relations with over 100 countries.     Note: The filing fee for each application is $20.   The Copyright Office has the authority to adjust fees at five-year intervals.

More than a toy.   selected    toy patents.   5. Rumor has it... that a patent office official    resigned because ""everything that can be invented has been invented.""                  The First Patent Grant in the    United States       The patent grant you see reproduced on the next page    was the first one issued by the United States, to Samuel Hopkins of Pittsford,    Vermont in 1790. Two other patents were granted that year: one for a special    process of making candles and one for improved flour milling machinery. The    Hopkins patent was for an ""Improvement, not known before such Discovery, in    the making of Pot ash and Pearl ash by a new apparatus and Process"", and was    granted for a term of fourteen years.      The name potash refers to several potassium salts, mild    alkalis, which were derived from the ashes of timber or other plants. It was    also known in a caustic form when mixed with lime. In reacting with fats or    oils, potash produced a soft soap. It was an essential ingredient in the manufacture    of glass, alum (salts of aluminum--used chiefly in medicine), and saltpetre    (an important ingredient in gun powder). Potash also played an important role    in bleaching, mining, metallurgy, and other industrial interests. Its many applications    served as an indication of the emerging chemical industry in the nineteenth    century.      In the summer of 1956, the Vermont Historic Sites Commission    erected a marker at the former residence of Samuel Hopkins. The original patent    granted to him still exists in the collections of the Chicago Historical Society.                            Abraham Lincoln is the only U.S. president to receive a    patent. Lincoln was a congressman from Illinois in 1849 when he was issued Patent    No. 6,469 for a ""manner of buoying vessels.""      As a young man, Lincoln took a boatload of merchandise    down the Mississippi River from New Salem to New Orleans. The boat slid onto    a dam and was dislodged only after heroic efforts. A few years later, while    crossing the Great Lakes, Lincoln's ship ran afoul of a sandbar. These two similar    experiences led him to invent a solution to the problem.      The invention consists of a set of bellows attached to    the hull of a ship just below the water line. When a vessel is in danger of    getting stuck in shallow water, the bellows are filled with air, and the vessel,    thus buoyed, floats clear of the obstacle.      Although Lincoln probably never profited from his invention,    he was a strong supporter of the patent system, saying that the patent system    ""added the fuel of interest to the fire of genius, in the discovery and production    of new and useful things.""            ""Well    informed people know it is impossible to transmit the voice over wires, and    that, were it possible to do so, the thing would be of no practical value.""    Boston Post editorial, 1865        Perhaps the most famous of all design patents    is the Statue of Liberty.            Contrary to popular belief, Thomas Alva Edison didn't    ""invent"" the light bulb, but rather he improved upon a 50-year-old idea. In    1879, using lower current, a small carbonized filament, and an improved vacuum    inside the globe, he was able to produce a reliable, long-lasting source of    light. Perhaps more importantly, Edison's invention led to an industry to distribute    electric power creating jobs for many Americans.      Edison was granted his first patent on June 1, 1869,    and averaged one patent application every 11 days between 1869 and 1910. America's    most prolific inventor received 1,093 patents--more than any other person before    or since. While he reveled in and profited from his successes, he lived with    failure every day.       ""Results? Why man, I've gotten a lot of results. I know    several thousand things that won't work.""       Thomas Alva Edison, 1900      In 1973, Edison was the first inventor inducted into    the National Inventors Hall of Fame.            Lewis    Howard Latimer was employed by a Patent Solicitor where he began the study of    drafting. His talent for drafting and his creative genius led him to invent    a method of making carbon filaments for the electric incandescent lamp. Latimer    was the original draftsman for Thomas Edison and the star witness in suits which    infringed upon Edison's patents.                ""Heavier than air flying machines are impossible.""    Lord Kelving, President, Royal Society, c. 1895                         Famous magician Harry Houdini {born Ehrich Weiss in Budapest,    Hungary in 1874} was also an inventor. Houdini began his career as a trapeze    artist and was later renowned as a magician and an escape artist. He astonished    audiences by escaping from handcuffs, straitjackets, and prison cells. Houdini's    invention for a ""diver's suit"" permits divers, in case of danger, to quickly    divest themselves of the suit while submerged and to safely escape and reach    the surface of the water.      In his later years, Houdini put his extensive knowledge    of the occult and magic to public benefit by exposing the tricks of fraudulent    spiritualistic mediums. Houdini left his entire library of magic to the U.S.    Library of Congress.                     ""When you can do the common things in life    in an uncommon way, you will command the attention of the world."" George Washington    Carver         Since 1930, plants have been patentable.    The first plant patent was granted to Henry F. Bosenberg for a climbing or trailing    rose.        An    Wang was born in Shanghai, China. He immigrated to the United States in 1945    and received his Ph.D. in applied physics from Harvard University in 1948. He    founded Wang Laboratories in 1951 to develop specialty electronic devices. Dr.    Wang is responsible for the original development of the basic components and    systems of digital computing machines. He held more than 35 patents, revolutionizing    the information processing industry. Dr. Wang was inducted into the National    Inventors Hall of Fame in 1988.           Phillip J. Stevens holds several patents for innovative    concepts in weaponry. He directed the Minuteman III Weapon System at TRW, Inc.,    and founded Ultrasystems, Inc., a high-technology business enterprise. A former    director of the United Indian Development Association, he received multiple    awards for leadership, innovation, and support of the Native American people.      Stevens with co-inventor, Larry E. Hughes, invented a    new nozzle to control delivery of propellants from rocket motors. The new variable    area throat nozzle was simple in construction, light in weight, efficient in    operation, and relatively inexpensive to manufacture.                   Ysidro M. Martinez' invention of a below-the-knee prosthesis    avoids some of the problems associated with conventional artificial limbs. Martinez,    an amputee himself, took a theoretical approach in his design. He does not attempt    to replicate the natural limb with articulated joints in the ankle or foot which    is seen by Martinez as causing poor gait. His prosthesis has a high center of    mass and is light in weight to facilitate acceleration and deceleration and    reduce friction. The foot is considerably shorter to control acceleration forces,    reducing the friction and pressure.                The mouse that went to Harvard... was the    first animal to be patented in the United States. In the 1980s, Philip Leder    devised a method of introducing specific oncogenes (genes with the potential    to cause other cells to become cancerous) into mice. The transgenic non-human    eukaryotic animal is bred to contract breast cancer for medial research to facilitate    carcinogen testing and development of cancer therapies. As you can imagine,    the patenting of living organisms (nonhuman) has generated controversy and a    lot of public debate on the ethical, religious, economic, and regulatory issues    arising from their use.      More than a toy...       Everyone has a favorite toy--a cuddly bear, a rugged    truck, a special game. But how many of us connect that toy with a multi-billion    dollar industry that thrives on innovation?      America's toy manufacturers and retailers depend heavily    on intellectual property protection. Toy inventors use both utility and design    patents, along with trademarks and copyrights to prevent others from copying    or profiting from their inventions or their trade names. In fact, many toys--especially    video games--take advantage of all three types of intellectual property protection.      Americans did not enter the toy ""business"" until the    1830's, when steamboats and steam trains improved the transportation and distribution    of manufactured goods. Early toymakers used wood, tin, or cast iron to fashion    horses, soldiers, wagons, and other simple toys. Charles Goodyear's method for    ""vulcanizing"" rubber created another medium for manufacturing balls, dolls,    and squeeze toys.      Toys Turn On!       In the early 1970's, Pong, the first patented video game,    hit the market. Nolan Bushnell created it along with a company named Atari.    Pong debuted in arcades, and soon moved on to television screens in living rooms    around the world. Other games followed--Space Invaders, Pac Man, and Tron. As    technology advanced, the dedicated single game machine was replaced by programmable    machines that allowed different games to be played simply by exchanging a cartridge.      Inventions in circuitry and miniaturization in the early    1980's produced handheld games, as Nintendo, a Japanese electronics company,    along with many others, moved into the video game market. As home computers    become more accessible, video games become more versatile, action packed, challenging,    and diverse.      As society has progressed, so has the complexity and    diversity of our amusements. Once, toys simply reflected everyday life and activities.    Today, toys create new ways of living, teach us to adapt to changing technologies,    and inspire us to follow our dreams.      The    Ups and Downs of Yo-Yo's       The Yo-Yo, a weapon used in South Pacific cultures, has    been traced back to the ancient Greeks. First patented in 1866 by James L. Haven    and Charles Hettrich, the Yo-Yo has enjoyed periods of popularity for generations    with kids from 1 - 100.      Donald Duncan was the marketing genius responsible for    the first American Yo-Yo fad of the 1930's. He also invented the Eskimo Pie,    originated the Good Humor Ice Cream truck, and successfully marketed the first    parking meter. At one time, Lego Co. used unsold Yo-Yo's as wheels on toy trucks.    In 1962, the most recent period of popularity, Duncan sold 45 million of the    toy.                                                      Rumor has it...       that a Patent Office official resigned and recommended    that the Patent Office be closed because he thought that everything that could    possibly be invented had already been invented!      While that statement makes good fun of predictions that    do not come to pass, it is none the less just a myth. Researchers have found    no evidence that any official or employee of the U.S. Patent Office had ever    resigned because there was nothing left to invent. A clue to the origin of the    myth may be found in Patent Office Commissioner Henry Ellsworth's 1843 report    to Congress. In it he states, ""The advancement of the arts, from year to year,    taxes our credulity and seems to presage the arrival of that period when human    improvement must end."" But Commissioner Ellsworth was simply using a bit of    rhetorical flourish to emphasize the growing number of patents as presented    in the rest of the report. He even outlined specific areas in which he expected    patent activity to increase in the future.       Taken out of context, such remarks take on a life of    their own and are perpetuated in publication after publication whose authors,    rather than check facts, copy and quote each other. For example, recent publications    have attributed the ""everything that has been invented..."" quote to a later    commissioner, Charles H. Duell, who held that office in 1899. Unlike Ellsworth,    who may have been merely misquoted, there is absolutely no basis to support    Duell's alleged statement. Just the opposite is true. Duell's 1899 report documents    an increase of about 3,000 patents over the previous year, and nearly 60 times    the number granted in 1837. Further, Duell quotes President McKinley's annual    message saying, ""Our future progress and prosperity depend upon our ability    to equal, if not surpass, other nations in the enlargement and advance of science,    industry and commerce. To invention we must turn as one of the most powerful    aids to the accomplishment of such a result."" Duell adds, ""May not our inventors    hopefully look to the Fifty-sixth Congress for aid and effectual encouragement    in improving the American patent system?"" These are unlikely words of someone    who thinks that everything has been invented.      References:      Jeffery, Dr. Eber.  Journal of the Patent Office Society.     July 1940      Sass, Samuel.

FIFTH MEETING  Thursday, July 11, 2002     Session 3: Stem Cells 4: NIH Funding of Stem Cell Research (Implementation)      Dr. Wendy Baldwin, Office of Extramural Research    National Institutes of Health        CHAIRMAN KASS:  On the record.  Thank you very much.  I think we should start.  We have a couple of stragglers, Dr. Baldwin.  There are always a couple of stragglers.  I think since your schedule is tight we should get moving.   It's a great pleasure to welcome Dr. Wendy Baldwin who is the Deputy Director for Extramural Research in the Office of the Director of NIH.  And who after President Bush announced his decision on stem cell research, he was finished and she was not.  She has come to talk to us about the implementation of the President's policy on stem cell research.  We've been looking forward to learning exactly what's happening.  It's very good of you to come and join us and educate us this afternoon.  Thank you.   DR. BALDWIN:  Thank you, Dr. Kass.  I'm very happy to be here and to tell you how I've been keeping myself busy in implementing this policy.  Let me go through a little bit.  I don't have handouts of the overheads, but I'd be happy to leave the overheads if you'd like.  I don't think I have to go into much detail with this group certainly about what the embryonic stem cells are, their unique properties, their ability to proliferate, and the capability of forming other kinds of cells.  So that has importance for basic science understanding of what cells do as well as our anticipation of clinical application as well.   There are many areas that we feel are major questions for us to think about where stem cells are going to influence how biology is done and what the importance will be.  Our major activity right now has been to implement the policy that was put in place last August 9th.  So the criteria for allowing research with federal funding on human ES cells is shown on this slide.  I think we're probably all familiar with this.   They had to have been derived from a blastocyst that was initiated prior to the President announcing his policy.  The embryo had to have been created for reproductive purposes and no longer needed which means it came basically from IVF clinics.  There had to be informed consent from the donors to use these cells with no financial inducement for the donation.   The way we're implementing this is that having established these criteria our first job was to complete the documentation and ensure that we had documentation, that the available lines met these criteria, and then to post a registry.  Once we did that then an investigator could go to the registry and identify a line that they wanted to use knowing that it met the President's policy.  So this is front-loading if you will that review process.   On November 7, 2001, we published the NIH Registry.  I've given you minimal handouts.  You must have 150 pounds of paper to carry back with you.  Your handout from me is one single sheet of paper, two-sided.  On the front, it shows you the registry.  On the back, it shows the stem cell site on the NIH website that has every conceivable document.  People are looking around like they don't have it.  Do they have it?   CHAIRMAN KASS:  I'm afraid there's been a slip up.   DR. BALDWIN:  We will get it to you.   CHAIRMAN KASS:  Does anyone have these?   DR. BALDWIN:  It's a page.   CHAIRMAN KASS:  They're coming right now.   DR. BALDWIN:  Once you go to the stem cell section of the NIH website, basically all of our documentation, information, et cetera is there and is updated regularly.  It took us a little while to get the registry up.  We wanted to be sure that we had developed it in a way that would be user-friendly and that we had unique codes for the different stem cell lines.  It went up November 7th.  Then what we did was we started to put in place the things that would be needed for investigators to make use of the registry and actually obtain funding to do this research.   The first thing we did was to realize that we had amissed the posting of the registry so that people could come in for our October 1 receipt date.  NIH has three rounds of application receipts.  So what we did is extended that receipt date so that anyone who was sitting there poised to do this research still had an opportunity to get an application in.   We then moved on to issue and announcement for Infrastructure Awards so that we could reach out to the sources so we could help them be sure they were actually going to be able to provide stem cells for the researchers who wanted them.  We moved on to Administrative Supplements.  I'll go into these in a little more detail, but it shows you how almost week by week we were putting in place one or another element that was necessary for us to actually fully implement this policy and make it a reality for the research community.   So Administrative Supplements, Training Potential, all of these pieces.  The implementation job was really taking the policy and then saying what are all of the different steps that have to happen to make this actually really work.  Let me go back to that one in a minute.   The last one on there is we announced the procedures for how you could use the process that's in place for having research done on human embryonic germ cells.  In May 20th, we had the first review of such an application.  That's the companion to the embryonic stem cell activities.   As of July 5th when the slide was done, we had made five of these Infrastructure Awards, 13 Administrative Supplements, and one Grant Award.  That I think people can look at and say one award.  How can this be?  But there actually is a fair amount of time that takes place between submitting an application to us, going to scientific review, going to an advisory council, and an actual funding decision made, and an award made.   What you're hearing here is our taking that policy and mainstreaming it in to how NIH does business.  We have very sound principles as to how we do business of transparency and peer review.  We're bringing stem cell research into that process.  At the same time where we've identified what might be a gap or a hurdle or an impediment, we're trying to reach out to that as well whether it's a need for training or a need for infrastructure support.   A few features of this registry.  We are listing all of the cells that meet these criteria.  You may be interested to know that we've added lines since the President's statement because we found six additional lines that met these criteria.  The registry serves two very important functions.  It provides a code for each of these and provides the contact information because an investigator that wants to do this research goes to the registry, identifies a line, and then gets in touch with them.   This is the content of the registry.  When you go to each one, this is what it looks like if you go to it on the web.  You can't read that on the screen.  When you click on any one of these sources, you go to a slash screen that's for that particular source.  This one happens to be WARF.  You'll see that it gives you contact information, e-mail information, their website, and the information about the cell lines that are on there.  That is information we're asking the sources to keep up and keep current because it is their information.   What have we found to be the issues for researchers?  Well, first is the simple access to the line.  Are there intellectual property issues, IRB issues, administrative ones, and ones relative to how they're going to actually get the skills to work with these lines?  Let me take these one at a time.   There have been questions as to whether these cell lines are actually available.  I think it's important to realize that human embryonic stem cell work is relatively new.  Because this was not an area available for federal funding prior to the President's statement, they are largely in foreign sources or commercial entities.  So many of these groups were not at the outset thinking about supplying the scientific community.  That's why we put infrastructure support out there, so that each of the sources can come to us and apply for funding to help them scale up, better characterize their cells, and make them available.   These are the awards that we've already made. (Indicating.) It's on a rolling receipt date though.  It's something that we'll continue to do as long as we have sources that need infrastructure support in order to make their lines available.   There are of course many things that can affect easy access to these lines.  In some cases, we have international issues.  There's been a change in terms of whether biologic material can be shipped on a passenger airplane.  I can't sit here and tell you that it's all simple.  This is not Amazon.com where you can just click on it and it comes by FedEx the next day.  There are things your investigators have to do in order to get access.  They're not qualitatively different from other fields, but they are important in this case.   All of these lines have intellectual property issues associated with them.  As I said by enlarge they are either commercial sources or they are foreign sources.  There is a U.S. patent on the derivation method.  In fact, the sources have to work out their intellectual property agreements in order to make them available.   NIH did something that's a little unusual here.  We of course would have to negotiate a memo of understanding for our investigators to have access to these lines.  We did the first one with Wisconsin with WARF.  What they said was not only would these terms be available to the NIH investigators but they would make them available to other investigators.    That's important to realize because the NIH doesn't get involved in the negotiations between a source and a user.  That's their responsibility.  But what this has done is made it much easier.  In fact, you can go to the website.  Those memos of understanding are all on the website.  An investigator can just download that, click on it, read it, take it to their tech transfer office, and if they can accept the terms which are pretty straight forward, they're ready.  They don't have to negotiate this from the ground up as it were.   We now have four of the MOUs that are available on the website.  I'm walking you through each of these steps because I think it's important to understand the different pieces of this puzzle that had to be put in place so that this whole area of research would actually take off.  Some of these sources may initially want to start out doing collaborative arrangements, and others are further along in their development and are more ready to make them just generally available.  That was clear at the outset that we would have that kind of variability.   This is the flip side of the handout which is the stem cell information site which is absolutely essential if you're interested in this area of research.  On it, you will see all of the MOUs are there.  We run a Frequently Asked Questions section.  We update that as soon as we have anything new to put out there.  Background reports, background material, anything a potential investigator or a funded investigator would want to know.  We're trying to make it one stop shopping so that it is all out there and pretty easily accessible.   In terms of IRB issues, all of these lines had documented informed consent for the donation of the embryo.  One of the follow-on issues though was do any of these lines include identifiable information or not or are they completely anonymized.  We worked with the Office of Human Research Protections to clarify the guidance about when IRB review is needed if there is identifiable information anywhere.  In fact, this document which of course again is on the website clarifies that there can be a firewall, either it's anonymized or the person receiving the line has no potential to get access to any identifying information then that streamlines what they would have to do within their own institution.  OHRP, we would not be requiring IRB review of the use of that line.  Grantee institutions may of course have some additional requirements.   There were questions raised about administrative issues in terms of how to think about the facilities and administrative costs if there were eligible research and ineligible research going on to the same institution.  Again, we felt that there are already very strong and existing policies about unallowable research.  The institutions know how to handle financially unallowable research.  Basically this just clarified for them how to do that, again to mainstream how this issue is handled relative to other areas of unallowable activity.   We have this as an administrative issue.  I'm not sure that it is.  Most research when it comes in it goes through peer review.  Reviewers are really looking for preliminary data.  In a new field, that's particularly challenging.  If it's a brand new field, you may not have preliminary data.    We've taken two tacks there.  One is to now just have Administrative Supplements available, but to really go a little further step to advertise their availability.  What that means is if you're already a funded investigator and let's say you're working on mouse ES cells and within the basic scope of the research you could add on some work in human ES cells, you can come to the NIH for an Administrative Supplement.  They're modest in dollar support, about $50,000.  They're handled administratively.  But it is a way for probably our most promising cadre of investigators to get started in this field and be able to help develop some preliminary data.  We've also tried to deal with that at the stage of review in terms of reminding people that this is an area where it's much more difficult to have preliminary data when you first come in.   One of the difficult issues for us is these are not necessarily easy cells to work with.  We've looked at what the need is there.  Everyone who has worked with human ES cells has pointed out the need for very careful, meticulous laboratory work and that there's a high degree of variability across labs and culture conditions.  So again, we've looked at what would be the tools that we could put out there to help investigators develop those skills.   In some cases, they will get them through the acquisition process.  So a source might package some training along with acquiring the cells from them.  If you go to them in return for the price of getting the cells, you would also get a couple of days of on-site training for maybe your Senior Lab Technician.  But we're trying to look broadly at that.  We have an announcement so that an individual investigator who really wants to specialize in this area could come in and apply for funding or an institution that wants to focus on doing some short term training activities that they would make available to others could apply to us for support.   Again, this is really taking the tools that we already have.  We already know how to work with a community to build skills when it's necessary.  We're just focusing them and applying them to this particular area of science.   The information has been very widely disseminated.  Now, we think it's been widely disseminated.  Just because we think it's widely disseminated doesn't necessarily mean that it is.  I get 350,000 or 400,000 hits a month on my website where this is located.  We get more on the NIH website.  You can access it right from the nih.gov site.   We know some professional associations have been pulling up those Frequently Asked Questions and sending them back out to their constituencies.  One of the things you can certainly help me with is if you can think of any other strategies that we might use to make this information widely available.  That appears to do it.  I wanted to go through that fairly quickly so that you would have a chance in my time here to ask questions.  If anything that I've gone through was either too quick or didn't make sense, please ask me now.   CHAIRMAN KASS:  Dan Foster and then Janet.   DR.  FOSTER:   I don't work on stem cells.  One of questions I think fairly broadly asked in the scientific community regarding the research is given now the 80 cell lines, how many of those are in some sense adequately characterized to be useful in research.  You know much better than I do, there's been considerable skepticism about the adequacy of these cell lines for the research that we want to do.   DR. BALDWIN:  Well, it's a little difficult to give an exact number.  It's certainly in excess of two dozen on there and are pretty well characterized and we know they're available.  I understand the question.  I understand the concern.   I think that we're equally concerned to see that investigators do get started working with the lines that are available.  That's going to be the best test of how good those lines are.  We won't know until people use them and test them and compare two lines from different laboratories.   There's a tremendous amount of basic work that simply has not been done.  While that's certainly an interesting issue to pursue, I'm at the implementation side.  I'm asking are the grant applications coming in.  Are we funding it?  Are we building up a base of knowledge about those lines?  I think we really have to do that.   DR.  FOSTER:  Well, I think that's probably the only answer you have.  We oftentimes say the only way you can answer these questions is to do the experiments.  We had been talking about that earlier today.   DR. BALDWIN:  Exactly.   DR.  FOSTER:  I think just myself that you've done a wonderful job on this infrastructure so far.   CHAIRMAN KASS:  Janet, would you like to begin?   DR.  ROWLEY:  Well, I'd like to carry on with the first question that Dr. Foster asked you.  Backing up just a bit.  Have you or have you in conjunction with the sources come up with a set of standardized procedures that you're going to do to characterize these lines?  Is everybody karyotyping their lines and doing some molecular analysis of them and what kind of studies have they done for longevity of the lines, et cetera?   DR. BALDWIN:  First off, the next enhancement if you will of the registry is to encourage our sources to provide additional data.  The sources vary as to how much information they have and how much they're posting on those websites.  To encourage them to go ahead and site either their published articles or the research that's being done with their lines, that's the area of enhancement that I'm looking for next.   The next area I think will be for us to bring those sources together.  They really form a very unique network.  It will be bringing them together really as a group that I think would be most valuable, for them to share their experiences as to the most valuable information or where their information appears to be discordant.  We've just made those awards within the last 60 days, so it's just a little early for that.  That would be the approach that I'd be inclined to pursue.   DR.  ROWLEY:   In terms of the Infrastructure Awards that you have made to individuals, you indicated in your very brief overview that you are asking or providing financial support to the sources to do some things.   DR. BALDWIN:  Exactly.   DR.  ROWLEY:   I guess the question is in your infrastructure grants is there some commonality of information that you are hoping that they will use that support for to provide answers to some of these questions.  Or is it just you have X number of cell lines and it costs X amount to do something.   DR. BALDWIN:   No.  It's not that.  But the first way that you phrased it, I think it would leave the impression that we're saying here's a list of things we want to see, do each of these with each line.  We really haven't done that.  They have come forward, not just give us money and we'll do more, but to say what they will do and that goes through peer review to say is that an appropriate strategy and are they going to be useful tests.   I guess my experience has been especially in a new field bringing those investigators together so that four or five of them sit down and say here's the way I'm going to do this and here's the information that would be valuable.  Having them talk that out to drive it toward some common sense of what is the most appropriate or the useful measures is usually preferable to us saying at the outset the specific ones we want to see.    I know that's a taste in preference.  Some people like a little harder edge at the outset.  I guess my experience has been I prefer to draw some of that out of our sources as opposed to imposing it on the outset.  But I understand your question.   DR.  ROWLEY:  You're aware of the article in Nature suggesting it be some of the cell lines.  Presumably all of these are grown on mouse feeder cell layers or virtually, a number of the cell lines are grown on --   DR. BALDWIN:  Many, yes.   DR.  ROWLEY:   So that the possibility that there are mouse-human hybrids is real.  Those would obviously have limited or no usefulness for the kinds of investigations that many people are interested in.  I guess I'm a cytogeneticist, so the first thing we do for cell lines is karyotype them.   DR. BALDWIN:  Yes.   DR.  ROWLEY:  I would have thought that it would be an important early parameter for the study section to have required that each one of the grantees do.   DR. BALDWIN:  It is.  I think what you're raising to me may be one of the things that we could do would be to extract from those Infrastructure Awards a little more of the vision of what the sources are proposing to do even in advance of them having the results and having the data to post.  Obviously the abstracts are available.  But we haven't thought about doing that as an extract to see where that common sense of the group as to the most useful activities would be.    They have latitude under a grant application.  It isn't that they're locked into doing one thing.  If six months from now it's clear there's something valuable to do, they could add that to it.  That would be a very useful suggestion for this.  I think I see something to go back and do.   DR.  ROWLEY:  Okay.  Let me just pursue two other aspects of this.  I think it's marvelous that in your dealings with the sources that you have made arrangements for other investigators to get some of the same kinds of expedited access to the lines under the memorandum of understanding.  I think that's marvelous because certainly these material transfer agreements can be painful and to do each one for private investigators is difficult.   You raised the question of cost.  I wonder is there a fair variability.  It seemed to me that as we were approaching WARF it was several thousand dollars to get a single cell line.   DR. BALDWIN:  Because of the network of agreements really, I think that's going to be pretty standardized, the $5,000 for access.  I'm talking about academic researchers not anyone who is accessing for commercial purposes.  Then you can't just download an MOU and go to work.  That's very different if you're setting out to develop them for a commercial activity.  My interest is here, what we can do for the basic research community.   DR.  ROWLEY:   Now, also in dealing with WARF, the MTA did include statements that any discoveries we make with those cell lines the intellectual property reverts to WARF.  I don't know whether in more recent memorandum of understanding whether that's --   DR. BALDWIN:   (Off the microphone.)   DR.  ROWLEY:  Okay.   DR. BALDWIN:   I don't think so.  I could have brought you a whole notebook of this material.  But I don't think that's the case for the academic researcher.  Again, the MOU is downloadable.   CHAIRMAN KASS:  Could I just ask a question because this is an important question to lots of people?  Could I have Janet ask the question again and could I hear the answer again so I know what we've just had?   DR.  ROWLEY:  Well, I was raising the question that it was my impression that as we approached the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation that were we to buy the cell line --   CHAIRMAN KASS:  Right.   DR.  ROWLEY:  Which is $5,000 and we did research with it, any intellectual discoveries that we made then became the property of WARF, not of us.  There are a lot of these MTAs that have what are called pass-throughs.  This was the question.  Whether I was mis-remembering or whether possibly your memorandum of understanding is maybe a bit different than I recall from maybe four or five months ago because I haven't paid attention to this recently.   DR. BALDWIN:  I don't think that has changed in that time.  I do have a copy and I'd be happy to leave it with you.  I think you may be thinking of when you're obtaining the cell lines for a commercial development.   DR.  ROWLEY:  No, because this is strictly university research.  That's an important issues as to whether as you are making new discoveries they're your intellectual property or reverts in some way to the source of the cell lines.  The fact that's not part of this is I think excellent.  I assume that as people come in with R01s that the cost of the cell lines and things can be included as costs within the grant.   DR. BALDWIN:   Oh, absolutely.   CHAIRMAN KASS:  Again, just for my clarification.  I gather the answer to that question is that reversion applies only if these things are sold to commercial organizations and not to university researchers.  Is that right?   DR. BALDWIN:  Yes.   CHAIRMAN KASS:   Okay.  Thank you.  Janet, are you complete for now?   DR.  ROWLEY:  Yes.   CHAIRMAN KASS:  Thank you.  Rebecca Dresser.   PROF. DRESSER:  I wanted to ask about a couple of things.  First, I was interested in how you decided about whether the informed consent requirement had been made in some countries far away.  Did you ask for just some documentation or how did you approach that?   DR. BALDWIN:  We had documentation from all of the sources.  We also had visits to a number of the sources.  All of the sources at the time the registry first posted had come and visited at the NIH, so we had discussed these things with them specifically.  We also have had visits to many of these other labs.  So it's not just a paper review.  It's primarily a case of them presenting the documentation which is always the case.  That's the heart of it.  But we have gone further than that.   PROF. DRESSER:  Right.  I understand.  The other thing I wanted to ask about is a little bit off the track but I understand that Dr. Gearhart recently got an award to work on stem cells from fetal tissue.   DR. BALDWIN:  Right.   PROF. DRESSER:   And that it went through a review process under the earlier NIH guidelines for stem cells which applied to both embryonic stem cells as well as fetal stem cells.   DR. BALDWIN:  Yes.   PROF. DRESSER:  So I understand that it went through a review process, and all the very detailed requirements were met.  I wondered if that was the same review group that reviewed that protocol as the one that was earlier put up during the prior Administration, the group the Janet Rowley mentioned this morning.   DR. BALDWIN:  You mean the composition of that review group.   PROF. DRESSER:  Right.   DR. BALDWIN:  No.   PROF. DRESSER:  How did that work?   DR. BALDWIN:  Let me explain what happened there.  We had these guidelines that covered both derivation from germ cells, from fetal tissue to generate the embryonic germ cell lines and also for embryos.  So the expectation had always been there would be more interest in the embryonic research at that point.  A group had been put together, but it had never actually met and functioned.   So when the President's policy came along that really superseded this whole section on embryo research.  So we rescinded that portion of the guidelines.  But the only rescinded that portion of the guidelines.  We left in place prohibited.  We left in place the fetal tissue side of it.  Now we had a very different creature because we knew the scope of that would be much narrower than was originally construed.   So we basically went back and rebuilt that process.  I mean, we didn't change any of the elements of review.  We didn't change any of the rigor.  But we did make that an internal NIH review.  Obviously dealing with appropriate conflicts of interest so that there was actually someone who would be on that group who would have been from the funding institute.  We had them absented from that review because of potential conflict.   But we took that group which was very mixed in terms of their science background, ethics background, et cetera, to review that proposal and to align it with the guidelines that were in place.  They did meet.  That was a public meeting.  We announced that in the Federal Register.  We did approve that project.   That process only begins when there is an application ready to be funded.  So someone comes in, we knew the Diabetes Institute was ready to make an award through their Beta Cell Consortium.  That's what prompted that meeting.  It happens in conjunction with the Center for Scientific Review Advisory Council meeting.   PROF. DRESSER:  So is the group all then NIH employees?   DR. BALDWIN:  Yes.   PROF. DRESSER:  I mean, one of the things we're interested in is if you're going to have review of some of these kinds of things who should be on the group.  I was just curious about that.  So you see this group more as going down the requirements and checking off to make sure everything was done as opposed to making some sort of ethical judgement about whether it's good enough to go forward.   DR. BALDWIN:  Well, they're explicitly not to review the science again.   PROF. DRESSER:  I understand that.   DR. BALDWIN:  The science is reviewed on a separate track.   PROF. DRESSER:  Right.  So what is their role?   DR. BALDWIN:   Their role is to in fact look at the requirements which have many different components and to see whether the documentation that's presented to us is consistent with the requirements that we've put out there.  If you go back to your first question, it's really not terribly different from the review that we've done now on the materials submitted on the embryonic stem cells where we basically had the President's policy and it was our job which was in fact an NIH staff-level review as to whether the documentation was appropriate.   PROF. DRESSER:  Right.   DR. BALDWIN:   We were trying to look for some parallelism there.   PROF. DRESSER:  But the initial proposal when this was going to cover both kinds of stem cells, I just know some people who I believe might have been put on the earlier group.  I know it wasn't all NIH.  It was more diverse.   DR. BALDWIN:  Oh, no.  Right.   PROF. DRESSER:  So was that group seen more as making conceptual, ethical judgements more than this one is?   DR. BALDWIN:  That group really had a much larger task because that was where we were envisioning prospective establishment of embryonic stem cell lines.   PROF. DRESSER:  Right.   DR. BALDWIN:   So they were going to really be reviewing the proposals or the strategies for developing those lines.  With the President's statement, that decision was made.  No prospective work, only retrospective.  It's only those lines that meet these criteria fixed in time and space.  I think we felt from the beginning that was going to be the much more challenging area and likely to be the volume of work would come in from the embryonic side.  But that was a judgement call on our part to bring that a little more in parallelism with what we were doing on the embryonic side.   PROF. DRESSER:  Thank you.   CHAIRMAN KASS:  Bill Hurlbut.   DR. HURLBUT:  Apropos of that question in a slightly different perspective.  Are there provisions in the way things run now for opening to new apparent embryonic-type pluripotent stem cells that aren't from embryo sources?  For example, suppose that something like Catherine Verfaillie cells are shown to be truly pluripotent or maybe even totipotent.  Are there possible ways to review that which would allow new lines to be admitted if they didn't come from embryonic sources, either from above or below in the sense that by de-differentiating something that was differentiated or producing something that was slightly differentiated from below?  Do you see what I'm saying?   DR. BALDWIN:   But de-differentiating from an adult cell is not covered by this at all.  Maybe I'm not understanding your question.   DR. HURLBUT:   One of the hopes is that you'll be able to take an adult stem cell or maybe a somatic cell using the proper cytoplasmic factors and bring it down to pluripotency.   DR. BALDWIN:  But you could do that.  That would not be covered by this because you're not starting with an embryonic or a fetal line.   DR. HURLBUT:  My point is there are going to be some potential ethical questions around that, and they will be the equivalent of embryonic stem cells in a certain sense.  I know that they're sources not embryos, but they're potential is what's also in question.  Isn't it?   DR. BALDWIN:   Well, that's --   DR. HURLBUT:  I mean, you or the current policies would not approve for example the artificial creation of a zygote from above if you will.  You could add the cytoplasmic factors.   DR. BALDWIN:   I understood your question as to whether there would be specific requirements to generate an apparently pluripotent stem cell line starting from an adult cell.  We would not have coverage over that.  I think you're probably really asking other questions about what you would do with that cell after you got it, perhaps.   DR. HURLBUT:  Yes.  I'm trying to get at the moral question of whether the current provision has possibilities for reviewing new creations that are being worked on at this time.   CHAIRMAN KASS:  Bill, I think if I understand what is here being implemented is something that is tied specifically to these authorized embryonic stem cell lines.   DR. BALDWIN:   Right.   CHAIRMAN KASS:  And that while there might be other things coming along that give rise to all kinds of myriad questions, that's not the bailiwick of this body.  Am I misunderstanding?   DR. BALDWIN:  No, you're absolutely correct.   DR. HURLBUT:  So they were not principles put in place.  It was the cell lines only.   CHAIRMAN KASS:  Yes.  Here was for the first time authorization, permission to go ahead with these lines.  Nothing was in place to make that possible.  The NIH has had the pleasure and burden of making this happened as expeditiously as possible.  That's not without its difficulties and bugs.  That's  partly what we are learning about I think.  What happens with other things that come along, that would require different kinds of structures or might already belong to different kinds of places.  But that seems to be not the issue before us here.    Could I ask a question.  It's probably too early to tell because the number of proposals is still few.  But what are you hearing from the investigators who want to get up and running, granting that there might be the usual kinds of impatience between researchers and funding and assistant sources?  But with respect to the procedure, with respect to the obstacles, what are you hearing from the investigators who say at last?  Are there certain chronic obstacles at the moment?  If so, what are they?   DR. BALDWIN:  Well, I'd say the obstacles are not big obstacles, but they are certainly issues to deal with.  They are really the ones that I've mentioned.  You do have to deal with the intellectual property issues.  I mean, this is something and that's true for many products that are out there in research that you do have to deal with and MOU.  You do have to think about the intellectual property issues.   I haven't heard any particular concerns other than the anxiety around how much emphasis we'll place on preliminary data in a field that's going to be a little hard for them to develop preliminary data.  When we know that there are more lines being shipped then we're seeing applications for, it says to me that probably what is happening or what I am speculating is happening is that some investigators are going ahead, getting the lines, lines they know will be eligible for our funding, but working on them some before they apply to us for funding.  That's not anything we're imposing on anyone.   Most researchers like to put the best application forward that they can and knowing the difficulty in working with these lines, knowing that it's not simple may want to buffer themselves with some time before they actually come in with an application that goes into peer review.  That's really my speculation from bits and pieces that we've heard.   I think we have six intramural labs that have now received cells.  This is all really very new.  I mean, I don't know how people's cosmic time sense here is but for me this is very fast for this much of a roll-out of a very new, exciting, difficult, and high profile area of science.  I've been asked 100 times am I satisfied with the flow of applications, do I think there should more.  You always want to see more good applications.  Always.  It's not been a flood.  But given the circumstances, I'm not really all that surprised.   CHAIRMAN KASS:   Could I ask a follow-up?  To pick up on Dr. Rowley's question before on the question of the characterization of many of these lines and also on the -- Well, it really goes to the question of the purity of these lines as well.  Is there anything further that can be done through NIH, either on that or on the access questions?  Are you being asked by the investigators to lend a hand there?  Is there a hand to be lent?   DR. BALDWIN:  Well, we're only partway through this implementation.  I mean, we haven't stopped the helping hand out there to work with these sources or to put funding out there for training activities.  This is certainly a high profile issue for us because we know that we're doing things that almost sound contradictory.  Somehow, I don't think they are.   One is we want to mainstream the process so the we stay connected to our fundamental principles and strategies of how we do business and use the tools.  Applications still have to go through peer review.  These things don't happen overnight.  On the other hand because it is such an exciting area of science, there really has been a concerted effort.  We have a contact group with all of the institutes involved.  We're working very closely with them to use every tool that we do have.    So we're trying to balance those two things.  I guess our instinct is that's the right strategy, but we have to keep the pressure on and we have to keep it a high profile issue for the NIH.  And we are.   CHAIRMAN KASS:  Thank you.  Janet and then Frank.   DR. ROWLEY:  I'd like to follow on with two questions.  One of which relates to your earlier answer to me that there are about two dozen cell lines that have been characterized and again, how you would define characterization.   DR. BALDWIN:  Well, I think part of the problem is I don't think there is that clear of a definition.   DR. ROWLEY:  Okay.   DR. BALDWIN:   There's not tab six that is the clear definition of what everybody would accept as characterized.  That's the figure that we've been using of the ones where there is considerable information about the characteristics of the lines.   DR. ROWLEY:  But it's different probably for each one of the six.   DR. BALDWIN:  It is a little.   DR. ROWLEY:  So that there isn't a standard.   DR. BALDWIN:  But you're now challenging me to go back and see the extent to which we could line up some of that information and even use that network that we'll create with those sources as a way to drive it towards certainly some basic understanding.  But I don't think that exists right now.  I don't think we can say here are the six things you definitely should have done.   I think the field is moving pretty fast.  It's important for us not to foreclose anything.  I think when you're working in a new field one of the riskiest things for us to do as funders is to inadvertently foreclose or tighten it down too soon.   DR. ROWLEY:  I certainly agree with that.  As you say, it's as investigators use the lines they may also through their use find either additional features or additional problems that hadn't been appreciated before.  So all of that is going to be important information.  You indicated you were probably going to get at least some or all of the sources together to discuss these.  What kind of timeframe do you see for that?   DR. BALDWIN:  I really don't have a timeframe on that.  We've only made five of the Infrastructure Awards.  We still have more to deal with.  The new sources are very new to us.  It's just too early for me to say.   DR. ROWLEY:   So it would be more like a year from now rather than say six months.   DR. BALDWIN:  Probably in between that.   DR. ROWLEY:  Okay.   DR. BALDWIN:  If you had prompted me, I probably would have said maybe nine months.  But we do not have a specific date on that.   DR. ROWLEY:  Okay.  I'd like to change gears if I can but also take advantage of your long association to senior level at NIH.  If you could help and I think this is related to the question that Rebecca was asking, we are aware that when Harold Varmus was Director of NIH he had a working group under Shirley Tillman looking at pluripotent human stem cells and reviewing some of the procedures to use that.  I think when you said that the focus of the present is narrowed down obviously the focus of that larger group under Shirley did include some derivation of embryo research using IVF.   One of the concerns of this group as well as others is how you would see a somewhat broader group either of the pluripotent stem cell review group for example that was envisioned in 1998 to 2000 that group was composed of ethicists and lawyers as well as scientists.  At least that's my impression.  I believe the membership was appointed by the Secretary of HHS.  I'm not positive about that, but that was my impression.  Whether such a review group would be an appropriate regulatory body to actually give responsibility to if for implementing and reviewing certain aspects or setting certain guidelines for embryonic stem cell research.   DR. BALDWIN:  What kind of guidelines do you have in mind?  Do you mean for areas of science that would be instituted?   DR. ROWLEY:   Well, my impression is that the working group under Dr. Tillman came up with a series of guidelines, some of which you've already incorporated or were incorporated into the embryonic stem cell lines that they had to be derived with donor consent and things of that sort.  The guidelines also have prohibited areas of research.   DR. BALDWIN:  They're still in place.  We did not rescind the prohibited areas of research.   DR. ROWLEY:  And our discussions here and the evolution of science in the last few years has really suggested that some of those prohibitions might be removed.  Then whether a review body of such as a broadly constituted body would look at the prohibited areas.  For example, the prohibition says no somatic cell nuclear transfer.  That's now an area that's been supported by the report from the National Academy of Sciences amongst other things.  Is that up to NIH and the Secretary to remove that prohibition or would there be a broader constituted group that might look at that?   The other thing that's prohibited is actually developing embryos specifically for research.  This is an issue that we've discussed back and forth.  At least some individuals, members of our Council, believe that it should be allowed under certain circumstances and with certain guidelines.   DR. BALDWIN:  Well, you have certainly outlined a very difficult and evolving area of science and ethics.  The current group, the human pluripotent stem cell review group is definitely not envisioned as a group that would be taking on issues such as you described.  That is a group that is really there to address the adequacy of any plans to use fetal tissue.  The prohibitions that were in place in the original guidelines are still prohibitions that are compatible with administration policy.   So what we might do in the future is really not something that I could comment on here.  I can say that's not the kind of issue that would be remanded to that advisory group.  But we always have the capacity of putting in place other advisory groups if it's warranted.  We don't have any specific plans at this time.   Dr. Zahuni (PH) the current NIH Director certainly views this as a very important area of science and one that requires our due diligence and careful attention to what our steps should be.  So it's certainly not something that's going to get any less attention.  But I wouldn't be able to comment further than that.   CHAIRMAN KASS:  Frank Fukuyama.   PROF. FUKUYAMA:   A brief question.  Is there any possibility of these approved lines any of them dying out as a result of mistakes and handling or inexperience?  You said that they are very hard to keep going.   DR. BALDWIN:  That's very speculative.  I don't know.  Of all of the things I worry about in this line --   PROF. FUKUYAMA:  That's not it.   DR. BALDWIN:   That's not on my worry list.  Maybe you gave me something new to worry about.   CHAIRMAN KASS:  Robby George.   PROF. GEORGE:  Just very quickly.  A point of clarification.  In reply to Dr. Rowley's last question about who would have authority to lift or alter the prohibitions that she discussed such as somatic cell nuclear transfer, can you tell us again who's authority would be exercised there?  My understanding is that would require an action by the President or the Congress, not any advisory body.  Am I wrong about that?   DR. BALDWIN:  No.  You're not wrong.   PROF. GEORGE:  I'm right about that.   DR. BALDWIN:  Yes.  Anytime an issue is up for discussion there's frequently a desire to have an advisory group's comment on them.   PROF. GEORGE:   Absolutely.   DR. BALDWIN:  And we don't have a group in place that is doing that.  I'm not anticipating any changes in that.   PROF. GEORGE:   Right.  But apart from discussion or advise the policy --   DR. BALDWIN:  That's why I said those prohibitions are compatible with Administration, with our current policy.  So I'm not envisioning any changes.   PROF. GEORGE:  Is that your understanding as well, Dr. Kass?   CHAIRMAN KASS:  Yes.  That's my understanding.  This is perhaps a strange question to put to you.  This group as you know has been asked by the President to monitor stem cell research and to think about offering guidelines for it.  We have spent a fair amount of our time on human cloning as you probably know.  But we have had presentations from Dr. Gearhart and Dr. Verfaillie.  We are trying as best we can to keep up with what is going on through the NIH.   From the point of view of your activities and what you hear from the researchers in-house and extramurally, are there things that you would like brought to this body that might deserve our special attention?  We've been trying to learn really about the implementation policy and finding out how easily and well are things moving.  Apart from the request that the President should become more liberal and allow more lines to flourish which I understand would be a perfectly natural opinion of the scientific community, within the policy as now stated or in relation to that policy that we would have to consider, are there not so much advise but questions and concerns that we would be remiss in not attending to from the point of view of the people that you speak with and the research that you're trying to help develop?   DR. BALDWIN:  I don't know whether this is a direct answer to your question.  I think what I see most need for right now is scientists just getting down to work with the lines that are available.  There are many questions that need an informed debate.  I think that debate will be better informed if it can come from not a speculation about what might happen and whether this is a good enough line or those work are enough but really more concrete, empirical evidence as to what happens when researchers get in there and work with these lines.   There are very different views out there as to are they enough, they're not enough, they're good enough, they're not good enough.  But they're a little hypothetical for my taste right now.  If they could be better grounded in experience we may find that people have terrible problems working with these lines.  We may find all kinds of terrible problems.  On the other hand, we may not.   Certainly if you look at the mouse ES experience, it started out with a lot of lines and it shook out to where there were a few that seemed to be the most valuable, most useful.  Will it be the same way in the human lines?  I don't know.  We won't know unless we get investigators willing to get in there and in the trenches and starting the work with them.   We're trying to put every conceivable mechanism out there to help that move along, but we still have to get the applications in from the research community.  I guess if you say what's the one thing that I most want to see happen, I think that's it because I just think it will just make the discussions the we could have six months, nine months, ten months, and 12 months from now so much more empirically grounded.  That would be my issue right now.   CHAIRMAN KASS:  Well, thank you.  Just a tiny addendum.  We are also trying to plan our own agenda for the remaining 17 or 18 months of our existence under the existing Executive Order.  I know there's no real answer to this question.  But order of magnitude.  If we wanted to be good monitors of this and of the research and how it's going along, do you think a year from now there would be stuff to monitor?   I mean, are we going to be able to do what we're supposed to do or are we at the end of this time say let the research go forward, we'd like to know what's happening?  And I'm not going to hold you to the answer.  But it matters to us I think in thinking about how to plan our own agenda what kind of time table we ought to be expecting to have some kind of data coming in.  I know it's absolutely unpredictable.   DR. BALDWIN:  Several things I do know.  One is this all takes longer than anyone thinks it does at the outset.   CHAIRMAN KASS:  Right.  Rowley's Law.   DR. BALDWIN:  If you had said anything less than 12 months to tap back in and see how implementation was going I would say I really think that's too soon.  I mean, if you look at a timeline from when these agreements are in places or when we've actually started to move money to a source for infrastructure support, we're measuring things in matters of weeks and months here.  Science just takes time.   In a year's time I think we'll certainly  have a better sense of the rate of applications.  We'll have a better sense of some people's early experiences in working with these lines.  But I would not want to over promise as to how definitive that will be.  Less than a year, I wouldn't do it.  In a year's time, I think it would be a fair question to say come back in a year or send someone back in a year and say how has it progressed and how many more investigators, what's the experience from those.   We'll have 13 Admin. Supplements.  Those are going to be experienced investigators who are probably our bellwether, our leading edge.  In a year's time, I think we'll have a much better feel for how difficult this has been for them or how quickly the sources given infrastructure support have gotten more common information available about their lines and whether in fact we have any lines that turn out just to not appear to work at all.  In a year's time, I think that would be a reasonable question to put to us.  I would hope I have some answers for you.   CHAIRMAN KASS:   Well, thank you.  Would you allow me one more?   DR. BALDWIN:  Sure.   CHAIRMAN KASS:  In connection with your own heavy responsibilities to this activity, is there someone as part of this project also keeping up with what is being done in the private sector on this activity to the extent to which that information is forthcoming?  In other words, if one wanted to say is there somebody at NIH who sits really in command of --   DR. BALDWIN:  Asking the private sector to tell us about what they're doing with their own money and not ours?  No.   CHAIRMAN KASS:  I don't mean that.  But there are things that are published too.   DR. BALDWIN:   Yes, certainly.  We have been attentive to the meetings that occur.  We have staff at any of the national meetings or regional meetings, et cetera who are staying apprised of where the interesting work appears to be done.  I just have to draw that little line.  There's always work that's going on in the not federally funded sector that we don't always know about.   CHAIRMAN KASS:  Of course.   DR. BALDWIN:  There's nothing new about that.  But no.  We are definitely staying on top of where the developments are to the extent that we can.   CHAIRMAN KASS:  Thank you.  Alfonso Gómez-Lobo.   PROF. GÓMEZ-LOBO:  This is an information question.  Maybe it's out of your domain.  I know that at NIH quite a bit is being done on adult stem cell research.  Right?   DR. BALDWIN:  Yes.   PROF. GÓMEZ-LOBO:  Now, is there any way of comparing volumes?  I mean, is there a lot more being done in adult stem cell research?   DR. BALDWIN:  Oh, yes.  That's a much more established field, yes.   PROF. GÓMEZ-LOBO:  Okay.  Thank you.   CHAIRMAN KASS:  Well, it looks like you have answered our questions for now very forthrightly, very fully, and very helpfully.  We're very glad.   DR. BALDWIN:   I'm happy to take any other questions that you would like to probably channel them to me.  E-mail them to me and I will try to get an answer for you if there is anything that I have not gone over.  Again, virtually every piece of information that we have put out there, every announcement, every piece of guidance, every helpful hint all is accessible on the website.  If you would prefer to receive that as hard copy, I'd be happy to pull together a briefing book and send it to you if the Members would like that.   CHAIRMAN KASS:   Well, we thank you very much.  Dr. Lee Zwanziger, would you stand please?  Lee is a research director on the staff and the person most interested in the stem cell aspect of our work.  I'd like at least you and she to say hello.  We can keep a communication open in that direction.   DR. ROWLEY:  I mean, I think that would be very helpful particularly to the extent that we would have some understanding of the cell lines that have been reasonably well characterized.  For example, are most of them derived in the U.S.?  Are most of them derived elsewhere?  Issues like that would certainly be helpful.   DR. BALDWIN:  You sort of challenged me to do an update on that.  So it gives me something to do.   CHAIRMAN KASS:  Thank you.   DR. BALDWIN:  Thank you.   CHAIRMAN KASS:  We are finished a little early.  Thank you very much, Dr. Baldwin.  Is Ted Friedman here?  If we started a little earlier, people could finish a little earlier.  I don't want people who are coming from out of town just to hear you talk miss the beginning.  But we are now ten after.  What if we reconvened at 2:30 p.m.?  Then we just finished a little earlier.  Would that be all right?  We'll take a break until 2:30 p.m.  Off the record.   (Whereupon, the foregoing matter went off the record at 2:09 p.m. and went back on the record at 2:36 p.m.)                                                                                      Home   Site          Map   Disclaimers            Privacy Notice            Accessibility            Contact Us           NBAC            HHS            FOIA"

GX006-38-0081351	Federal CIO Council     XML Working Group         Wednesday, August 20, 2003 Meeting Minutes         State Plaza Hotel    2117 E Street, N.W    Washington DC 20037         Please send all comments or corrections to these minutes to Glenn Little at glittle@lmi.org.         Mr. Owen Ambur:           I think we better get started. I’ve been assured that a projector will show up shortly. I’m sure Ken [Sall] will appreciate it. I appreciate Ken being here. He’s here partly as filler, because Bob Haycock can’t get here until about 9:30. I appreciate Ken coming and giving us his presentation on Scalable Vector Graphics [SVG].          We usually start with introductions, and we give everyone an opportunity to introduce themselves and tell us a little about their interest in XML. I’m Owen Ambur of the [US] Fish and Wildlife Service, and I co-founded this Working Group in 2000.         [Introductions]         [Editor’s note: The meeting room was not supplied with a working projector. The speakers spoke from their slides, but were unable to project them for the audience. The speakers tailored their talks accordingly, thus the discussion does not necessarily follow the slide order.]          Mr. Ambur::    Ken still doesn’t have a projector, so I guess he’ll give do a little song and dance, and hopefully the projector will show up in time to show us what SVG looks like.              Ken Sall    SiloSmashers    Scalable Vector Graphics         Slide 1    [Title slide]:    As you  can’t  see, the presentation is entitled ‘Capabilities of Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG). I’d like to stick with the presentation, so I’ll do all the text-based slides first, then hopefully show you the visual material all at once. It’s not the way I would have preferred, but it’ll do.         Slide 2    [What is SVG?]:    This is not a tutorial on SVG. It’s just about its capabilities—what you can do, and why it’s important. SVG is a non-proprietary format. In some sense, it’s a replacement for bitmapped graphics. It’s arguably the replacement for [Macromedia] Flash [ http://www.macromedia.com/ ]. It occupies a different niche. It’s capable of 2-D resolution and media-independent graphics in a text-based format. Because it’s XML, it integrates with major XML specifications and Cascading Stylesheets [CSS], and scripting and animation are capabilities with SVG.          SVG consist of three types of objects:     1.        SVG shapes (anything defined by a path; straight lines or curves, and geometric shapes.)       Text      3.        Images.         Slide 3    [What is SVG? (continued)]:    So, because it’s text-based and XML-based, the SVG can be generated on the fly, from a database or an application. It’s really powerful. When you think about it, it means that GIS [Geographic Information Systems] applications can generate it as they are doing their processing. The [Open] GIS Consortium [ http://www.opengis.org/ ] and GML [Geography Markup Language,  http://opengis.net/gml/ ] are doing things on the fly.         Because it’s text within SVG, as opposed to XML tags, it’s not bitmapped. It’s searchable, indexable, selectable, copyable, and accessible (which gets at Section 508 considerations [Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act,  http://www.access-board.gov/sec508/508standards.htm ]). It integrates well with server-side technology. It can be transformed, translated, styled, and reused. By “reused,” I mean that you can define it once and reference it in multiple locations.         Some of the popular features are things like filter effects, alpha masks, and template objects—things that graphics people are familiar with. In terms of vendor support, I’ll read the list. SVG supports: Adobe, BitFlash, Canon, Corel, CSIRO, Ericsson, Hewlett Packard, ILOG, KDDI, Nokia, Openwave, Schema Software, Sharp, Sun Microsystems, Texas Instruments, and Zoomon. Missing from that list is two big companies that start with “M,” and one that starts with “I”.         Mr. Ambur:    I’d like to mention that the folks on the teleconference have an advantage over those of us here in the conference room, because Ken’s presentation is available on the [XML.gov] website and they can view it there.         Mr. Sall :         Slide 4    [General Vector Graphics Advantages]:    There are two advantages of SVG: one is the kind of advantage you get from it being vector graphics, period; the other is one that relates to it being XML. Let’s talk a little about that first group—vector versus bitmap. An SVG file is a small file, so it downloads faster. It’s a description of how to draw something, as opposed to the actual bits. It’s device-independent. It targets more devices; has better printing capabilities; can pan; can zoom in on details that aren’t initially visible; you don’t get the pixilation that you get on JPEG; it has a grouping capability; layering; hierarchy; and dynamic generation.         The good new is that most big vendors of graphics editors already have an export capability for SVG built in. Corel does that, right?         Mr. J.D. Sylvestri:    Yes. Corel has done it since [Wordperfect] Version 11.         Slide 6    [XML Family of Specifications: Advantages for SVG]:    Now I’ll talk about the advantages based on XML. We have validation. At first you might think that it doesn’t make much sense, but there arc cases where it might. Integration with Web pages: because you can integrate with XHTML [Extensible Hypertext Markup Language, [ http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/ ], you can use a document model to script events, so it has an interactive capability. It has text labels and descriptions; it’s directly searchable; it can be indexed by a search engine. It’s very powerful. You don’t want to rely on pictures you can store in a database. You’d have to rely on a file name. Now you have a whole format that’s wide open. You have the image and the metadata. It’s all in there, and directly searchable.          There’s a title tag. That’s perfect for 508 compliance, because any graphic can have a title. Much like XHTML, where you have an attribute, this is an element. You can link from any part of an image, based on XLink [ http://www.w3.org/XML/Linking ] and XSLT. And, you can reference bitmap graphics. You can do complex animations and transformations, and SMIL [Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language,  http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-smil-19980615/ ] gives you the capability for better timing in your animations.         CSS you can use to change the look of SVG:    ·           at run-time, or    ·           by a new Stylesheet.         The other thing is fonts. It’s not limited to what the device has. You can define fonts in the SVG.          I’m going to skip the graphic, skip the code sample, and skip “Apache.” [slides 7-14].          Slide 15    [SVG Converter Applications]:    Thinking of what you want to get, and what you can do with it—there are converter applications where you can convert to or from SVG. I’ll go over those, and see what you can do with this.         You can extract text out of SVG with XSLT [XSL Transformations, [ http://www.w3.org/Style/XSL/ ]    Apache [ http://www.apache.org/ ] has components that support SVG-to-PDF [Portable Document Format,  http://www.adobe.com/ ]. There are also a Perl [ http://www.perl.org/ ] script and a Python [ http://www.python.org/ ] script that do SVG inside of PDF. I’m not sure how it works. I haven’t tried it. PDF-to-SVG is going in the opposite direction , with something called Free SVG. On the slide, all the bullets have links to information about it.         Then there’s SVGmaker, which allows one to take [Microsoft] Office files and convert directly to SVG. You can do [Microsoft] PowerPoint, SVG, [Microsoft] Word, etc.          Mr. Rick Rogers:    The underlying system of Windows is SVG, so you can do anything with SVG that you can print in Windows.         Mr. Sall:    I didn’t know that. Theirs works so smoothly, it’s great.          Ms. Theresa Yee:    Can you please repeat the statement?         Mr. Sall:    Rick said the native Operating System of Windows has SVG capability, so any application can do what I said the SVGmaker can do.         On the XML.gov website, next to the PowerPoint presentation, is the SVG version of the same talk, produced by SVGmaker. You can see that it’s visually identical to PowerPoint. For some reason it doesn’t preserve links. I’m not sure why it does that.         You can also go from SVG to bitmap graphics like PNG and JPEG. Sun [Microsystems,  http://www.sun.com/ ] has software for an SVG slide toolkit from about two years ago. The idea is, you can think of SVG as a graphical user interface to your XML data.         I thought we’d talk about, not what’s in the picture, but about XSLT. Say you    have XML sales data or any numeric or text data, and you want a bar or pie chart or any graphic that represents the information. You can use XSLT to transform the XML data to SVG. Now you have a visual display.         [A projector was provided, but it would not illuminate the signal.]         So in terms of XSLT, it can do transformations to SVG, because we know it can swap in a new XSLT stylesheet, and can get many different views of the data. They can also do DOM [Document Object Model] scripting, which is a run-time proposition (as opposed to a transformation, which isn’t). There are a number of editors that natively support SVG, and some that output to it.         Slide 17    [Recent (2003) SVG Applications]:    There’s one in particular, which I’ve not looked at, other than to know it’s out there, called SALT [Speech Application Language Tags,  http://www.saltforum.org/ - About%20SALT ]. It gives you an interactive speech interface to the graphics. Imagine a speech interface to graphics!         Mr. Matthew McKennirey:    Do you have any examples of how it’s used currently?         Mr. Sall:    That’s actually where I was going. Some of the converters gave us an idea. I mentioned the GIS Consortium use with GML. Many map applications want to show one called “Smart Map.” Picture an application that has animation, with a toolkit that pops up.         There are interesting chess applications; not the level of application you’re thinking of, but it gives you an idea of what can be done. There are three kinds of chess applications: There’s one that can move the pieces, but has no knowledge of chess. There’s one that’s animated. You can go through a sequence of moves, and show how the game was played. There’s one that does rules-checking. If you make an incorrect move, it knows what to do.         Mr. McKennirey:    I was thinking more in terms of applications in federal agencies.         Mr. Sall:    Rick, you used it in the Census?          Mr. Rogers:    Ken, you said SVG allows you to tie into other XML applications. You can also try to use it as a user interface. One way is using SVG as an interface.          Mr. Sall:    Rick mentioned that XForms [ http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/Forms/ ] and SVG are a good mix because each complements the other.         [Mr. Sall worked on resolving the no-image issue with the projector.]         Mr. Ambur:    Why don’t we go to Bob [Haycock], and get to the projector presentations later? You mentioned voice or speech interface. Obviously, that has great implications for accessibility.          Hopefully we’ll get back to Ken’s presentation later. Ken, I appreciate your taking the time to brief us on SVG. Now let’s get to Bob Haycock of the FEAPMO [Federal Enterprise Architecture Program Management Office]. Bob’s going to brief us on the status of the Data and Information Reference Model [DRM,  http://www.feapmo.gov/feaDrm.asp ].         Mr. Bob Haycock    FEAPMO    Data and Information Reference Model          One thing I’ve learned in this gig of the last 14 months is, be prepared for anything, I’m thinking, while watching Ken, that one unrecognized skill set is the ability to switch in a presentation seamlessly. I’m quite impressed         I didn’t bring a file to put on the overhead,. I wasn’t sure of the facilities. I brought hardcopy. Hopefully there’ll be enough. I’ll send Owen the file. I can only stay for about half an hour, and I apologize for that.         First of all, thanks for having me. We tried to do this a month ago, but the schedule didn’t work out. I recognize some faces here from previous meetings. I’m Bob Haycock, with the FEAPMO. I’ve met some of you. I’ve been working on the FEA for about 16-17 months. We’ve just about got all the reference models done and out, as you’re aware. We released the second version of the Business Reference Model [ BRM,  http://www.feapmo.gov/feabrm2.asp ] a couple months ago, and the first version of the Service Component [ http://www.feapmo.gov/feaSrm2.asp ] and Technical Reference [ http://www.feapmo.gov/feaTrm2.asp ] Models at the same time. We have a 99.99% complete draft of the Performance Reference Model [ http://www.feapmo.gov/feaPrm2.asp ] in agency hands now. It’s not published, because it hasn’t been approved and signed by the director of OMB. What will go out publicly, though, is in agency hands now. The last model, the Data and Information Reference Model, is a work in progress now.          What I’m going to talk about today is where we stand at this point in time. It’s been a long road. We started in January to think about it seriously. We put together some offsite meetings to brainstorm through this. Brand [Niemann] was there too. We had about three of those meetings, and ended up to where we were a month and a half ago. We provided that to the AIC [Architecture and Infrastructure Committee of the CIO Council] in June for their review and comment and feedback to us. We’ve since received it, and we’re working with the AIC in that process as well. The Industry Advisory Council [IAC,  http://www.iaconline.org/ ] has done one white paper on the DRM [ http://www.iaconline.org/documents_presentations/2003/030528_IAC_EA_SIG_Information_and_Data_Reference_Model_Body.pdf ], and a lot of that is in there as well. We’re not there yet. Today it’s a work in progress, showing what the current thinking is now. I have about 20 slides. I’ll skim through a few, and focus on a few. I apologize to the phone folks for any inability to track along with my talk.         Slide 3:    Slide 3 shows the FEA. I won’t go into it. I’m sure you’ve seen it ad nauseum.          Slide 4:    Slide 4 forms the basis for why we’re doing this; what’s the purpose for a DRM? The situation in the federal government cries out for something like a DRM. How do we do that? How do we think about a data architecture across the entire federal government, and make something useful and viable and effective? That’s what we’ve been struggling through. Hopefully, we’re getting there. The primary issues and barriers are:    1.        No common framework to describe data and information across multiple agencies. The purpose of the DRM is data sharing across lines of business, the lines being major functional categories that encompass many agencies.    2.        There’s no definition for the handshake, or partnering of information exchange and sharing. How do we set that up?    3.        The next one is, that diffused content is very difficult to manage, get one’s arms around.    4.        Information is not classified well. If there’s a bottom-line objective for the DRM, it’s to describe the information in a consistent way that can be used across multiple agencies.    5.        Without a common reference, data is easier to duplicate than integrate. That’s one issue that Mark Forman [OMB Associate Director for E-Government] had; we create too much duplication, because there’s no place to find out what’s out there, so we create it again and again. That’s why the ability to interoperate and share is the key. That’s where we started with this. The result of that is pictorially laid out in Slide 5.         Slide 5:    While there’s some data-sharing going on (and there is in specific functions, either between federal or star agencies), at a working level, people find a way around it. They always have. It exacerbates the problem of needing an efficient way to get at this, so that people can just get the data and focus on the systems they’re developing.         Slide 6:    This is where we’re at now. It’s different from what we showed at the agency briefing in June. We’re still thinking through this construct. The changes we made in the model are the direct result of feedback from agencies in the June briefing. The contributions were excellent. There were thoughtful things that people submitted. Essentially, we’ve organized the DRM into two major categories: one is the description, and one is the data itself. One puts the business context on the data, so then you can call it (our term) an “information package,” associated with a business process or activity. That’s the link we didn’t have before.          The DRM provides:    1.        A framework for vertical and horizontal information sharing,    2.        A framework that lets agencies build and integrate systems that leverage data from within or outside the agency domain, and     3.        A framework that allows sharing opportunities for better decisions.         Mr. Sall:    Data Super-Type [from slide]. What is that?         Mr. Haycock:    I’ll get into it in a little bit—in two or three slides.         Slide 7:    I think we’re finally at the point where we can understand how the DRM integrates with the other four reference models; how they work together. Let me mention a couple other items to give you a sense of what we’re thinking. What’s going on is, we also initiated, through the AIC of the CIO Council, an initiative to look at bringing down the granularity of the BRM to lower levels. If you’re familiar with the BRM, it’s pretty broad. It’s talking about things like National Defense or law enforcement. Sub-functions are more granular, but still broad. It’s difficult to do anything other than bucket things. It’s good for OMB, but it doesn’t tell us whether people have the same process. At that level, we get into arguments about “my process is different.” We know nothing unless we get to a lower level of granularity, so we need to think about how to approach it across the federal government. We’re looking at coming up with another “model” for the attributes used to describe processes at different levels, down to an IDEF {Intermediate Data Exchange Format] Level 0 process. Start to define those processes in similar ways, and compare the process. Hopefully we’ll begin to tie data and information packages to those processes and places in the process. We’re trying to put meat on the bones a little.          The second piece is a security profile for the FEA: how should we think about security for those five models? It tracks closely to those business processes: what are the risks with those activities? Then you can judge the risk and security needs at that point. You can look at the vulnerability of the data, and identify your security mechanism across the models, the security patterns for different businesses in the process. That’s the direction we’re going in. Let’s turn to Slide 8.         Slide 8:    This is the framework. We need a different name. If you know one or can think of one…that’s why the security profile is called a profile. Right now, we’re calling it the DRM Framework. Essentially, it’s the structure of the DRM. As Brand remembers, we debated this a whole bunch. We decided that the main thing is to describe data in a standard, consistent way. That’s the bottom line. It’s based primarily on [International Standards Organization] ISO 11179. We also played with ebXML [Electronic Business using eXtensible Markup Language,  http://www.ebxml.org/ ]. We want to describe it in a consistent way across the federal government at a certain level (not necessarily at the data element level), then put business context around it—what happens at the top, like “Subject Area” and Super-Type. The subject in this case is public health. It’s based on that. We can put context on those packages that we can put together in the business exchange. We can put a process together of what goes into it, then we can have a consistent process, relate it to the business process, and we can move forward.         So that’s the bottom line, where we’re at right now. This is the key slide. Everything flows from that.         Mr. James Feagans:    We’ve gotten through putting together an Enterprise Architecture plan. We’re right in synch with this. As a matter of fact, as I was saying to Owen this morning, the “train is leaving” October 1. We’re perfect with this. We really need to do that.         Mr. Haycock:    We’re right there, right now.         Mr. Feagans:    We’re using the FEA, so we’re right there.         Mr. Arie Brish:    The time element of the data—one agency may change something, and another agency might need something from the first. There might be some time delay between the change and the usage. Is there something in the model that relates to it?         Mr. Haycock:    Not in the model, but in the implementation of the model. That’s the key issue. How do you govern it?          Unknown participant:    There has to be a steward, a…         Mr. Haycock:    That’s the hard part. The IAC paper on the DRM (I don’t see Michael Lang here), that’s what he’s getting into—how do you govern around a federated process?         Mr. Brand Niemann:    In the pilot, we did differentiated between design time and run time. What you do at a moment, and what you do at run time. The metamatrix and the XML Collaborator [ http://www.blueoxide.com/Pages/xmlcollaborator.html ] added to what Michael had done with the XML schema, not only for integrating, but for exchanging data in a real world situation.         Mr. Haycock:    Brand’s been out front. I think we’re beginning to catch up, where we have a model, and we’re going to pilot it over time. I would not think we’re going to go out to agencies in the 2006 process and say, “Give us all your data.”         Mr. Feagans:    We’re approaching it with a revolutionary process. We use COPs [Communities of Practice] for the department to begin with.         Mr. Haycock:    I talk about it in here. We have a conceptual approach. We begin with COPs. One of the lines of business that fell out of last year’s budget process is health. Martha Chapman of HHS [Department of Health and Human Services,  http://www.hhs.gov/ ] is working on it.    I have four or five here that we can work with.         Mr. Ambur:    You commented that people’s eyes are glazing over but, to the contrary, I think you’re making good connections here. People  are  with you.         Mr. Haycock:    My head was spinning at first, but it’s starting to clear. We had a lot of heads in this.          Slide 9:    This talks about the Community of Practice approach—how we’re attacking this. We want to work off of the good work of others, leverage as much as we can. We’ve had a lot of others’ thinking in here.         Slide 11:    We touched on that [DRM Implementation Strategy]. I won’t get into it. We hope to have something that begins to intersect data across multiple agencies for specific business aspects, to put metrics on it, performance service aspects.         Mr. Ambur:    Your 12 th  slide depicts boxes delineating portions of the DRM attributable to HHS, USDA, DOI and DOE, with overlaps among them.    I think of the boxes as being XML schema for each agency, with the overlaps depicting data elements that are common across more than one agency.         Mr. Haycock:    I think I’ll leave it there in your hands…leave it as how we get to the interaction layer and schema. We’re going to run out of time here. We can talk about next steps here. I’ll talk a little about Slide 17.         Slide 17:    We talked about problems, issues and challenges. Slide 17 talks about the benefits of the approach, good stuff. We’ve been working on the release document for this model. The goal is to release it in draft form by October 6. We’re driving to that date right now. We may have even three documents, or two (with one having two parts). First would be the model. Second would be how you use it. We’re talking from a business standpoint, not from a technical standpoint. For the business owner or program manager, what’s in for them, what they get out of it. We’re thinking of the same package for the other four reference models also. If I’m an Assistant Secretary [of a federal Department], and government-wide we’re putting a billion dollars into the FEA, what do I get out of it? So it’s the business benefits and technical benefits. Clearly there are technical benefits. Everyone knows that, but there are a lot of business benefits also. One is, it’s difficult (if not impossible) to secure data if you don’t know where it is. If it’s all over government, you might not know where all of it [a complete set] is. If we can manage it in a consistent way, then we can start the security on it. I think that’s a major benefit. It supports electronic interoperability of information. When you get in the development world, you have all these interfaces. You’re trying to move data, and you have to find out what’s changing everywhere else. Hopefully this will facilitate that, so we don’t end up with a lot of XML schema. It provides clear data ownership and stewardship…Who’s responsible for managing and maintaining it? It’ll make sure it’s up to date.         Mr. Ambur:    You used the word “stewardship” and I want to comment favorably on the use of that term.    One of my pet peeves is the misuse of the word “ownership.” When we’re talking about federal resources, the owners are the taxpayers. By contrast, when bureaucrats think they own something, they don’t seem to feel the need to consult with or listen to anyone else. Thus, I strongly encourage the word “stewardship” – since it more accurately reflects the fact that we, the people of government, are merely temporarily entrusted with problems and opportunities on behalf of “We the People of the United States of America.”         Mr. Haycock:    I agree. I’m a federal and state steward.         Mr. Ambur:    We’re only here a short time. We’re stewards of the citizens’ trust.         Mr. Haycock:    Then the technical benefits are: a common vocabulary and data standardization, and it facilitates the use of electronic registries and repositories. We have to have them at some time. I was hoping that Marion [Royal] was here. We’ve been talking about bringing together all the registries; essentially have a one-registry concept, probably a federation of registries in consistent way to manage.         Mr. Ambur:    Regarding registries, Marion gave me some bad news recently. He said Congress cut funding for the XML registry from GSA’s budget.         Mr. Haycock:    Just the House [U.S. House of Representatives].         Mr. Lew Sanford:    We’re working to get it restored.         Mr. Ambur:    I’m pleased to hear that.         Mr. Haycock:    The last slides talk about people we’ve been working with over the last seven or eight months, and talk about the next steps in the process. By this Friday, we are finalizing revisions in the slide deck we presented to agencies in June. We’ll put that back out to the AIC committees for another look. We’re working on a subject area analysis. We’ve requested agencies, through the AIC, to provide us with the major subject areas in their agencies. In the week of September 5, we’ll finalize the release documents, release them to agencies for their review, and probably have another “all hands” briefing at the White House Conference Center. Actually, we’ll probably have another on October 5. We’re looking to release the first version by early October. Probably in the same time frame, we’ll talk to agencies about pilot efforts, and say, “Do them between January and February of next year.”         Mr. Mike Lubash:    Have you ever considered the use of the term “concept” for the steward? I argue that “concept” is something people can agree to when I try to mediate standards. You can plug in a mediation routine that allows you to plug-and-play the standards, so you can mediate irrespective of the standards.         Mr. Haycock:    I absolutely would consider it. I encourage you to contact me. That is an issue: where do you stop? Clearly, we won’t get down to the data level. We need to reconcile that at some level. We need to determine where.         Mr. Ambur:    I wouldn’t suggest that it is exactly what we need in this context, but there’s a precursor to the subject area analysis of the DRM.    The government Blue Pages are supposed to provide an overview of all of the functions of government, in terms that are commonly understood by the public.    Since the focus of the Blue Pages is the local, printed telephone directories, it may not be as comprehensive as it should be in the context of an online directory of all of the functions of government.    However, with respect to the potential to share data and the need to avoid reinventing the wheel, the list of functions identified in the Blue Pages should be considered for reuise as the DRM is being specified.         Mr. Brish:    Is industry participating through the Industry Advisory Council?         Mr. Haycock:    The CIO Council has a good relationship with them. They’ve turned out lot of good work working with and through the CIO Council’s Architecture and Infrastructure Committee (AIC). The IAC is helping on governance component, architecture, and emerging technology. At this point, it’s a very productive relationship.          And that’s about it. Thank you for having me.         Mr. Ambur:    Thank you, Bob. We’re a little ahead of schedule. Let’s take a look at where we’re at with the projector. [inquiries as to working projector]         The projector is still not projecting, so let’s go ahead and take a  break.          Break         Mr. Ambur:    I might mention again that there’s an attendance roster circulating. It’s on the table in front of Arie. Arie, if you would hold it up?    If you haven’t already signed in and would like your presence noted, either initial it or add you name to the list. I think we had a few people who came in after we introduced ourselves this morning, so if you’d like to introduce yourself and indicate your interest in XML, now would be an appropriate time.         [Introductions]         Our next speakers are Susie Adams and Carolyn Brubaker from Microsoft. They’re here not in a Microsoft capacity, but as advisors to OMB on the OMB Exhibit 300, which used to be the Capital Asset Plan and Budget Justifiation but is now known at the Capital Asset Plan and Business Case.    It is the document all agencies are required to submit in the budget process to get funding for any capital investment included in the President’s budget request.    So it’s a very important document. Last month, we had a presentation on [OMB] Exhibit 53, which is a subset of the Exhibit 300 data focusin solely on major IT investments (as opposed to other kinds of capital investments made by federal agencies). Exhibit 300 is related to the FEA, in the sense that all IT investments should be consistent with the FEA.    So those are the linkages, and when I think about linkages, I think about the potentials of XPath, XPointer, XLink, and related XML standards.              Susie Adams & Carolyn Brubaker    Microsoft    Revised/Updated XML Schema for [OMB] Exhibit 300    XFDL Overview         Ms. Brubaker:    I’m going to talk about the business need and how we got into the program, and Susie will talk about the technical detail of the schema.         We were approached by OMB. They had a business need to collect all the data for the IT process from the OMB 300 for submission in XML format. For Fiscal Year ‘05 planning, they wanted it all in XML format. Some agencies are not doing that, and some Departments have not been doing it, so there was a flurry of activity in finding out how to do it. They asked us to come up with a technology that could collect, organize, and disseminate data in XML format. Susie will talk about why she chose what she chose.         We did a survey and an assessment. We worked closely with OMB staff to come up with the right, simple solution. It’s been a learning process because of the short time. We created a document, or solution, that will be posted to a website today, for small and midsized agencies to use. That’s the history. The key thing is that there was a defined business need, and we worked closely with OMB to make sure the business processes were covered, on a tight timeline.         Mr. Niemann:    What will be posted? The schema, or document, or what?         Ms. Adams:    I’ll talk about that. I’ll go back to the history, and last year, because there are a lot of things involved.         Ms. Brubaker:    I don’t want this to be a Microsoft thing, but I’m with the EGov group within Microsoft Federal. We’re trying to look broadly across government and the EGov initiatives and reusing technology, and trying to identify how Microsoft solutions can complement the initiatives and the FEA. Just tracking, staying knowledgeable, communicating out the word.         Mr. Ambur:    As I said, they’re here in a role supporting OMB, but on September 29, Betty Harvey of the DC Area XML User’s Group [ http://www.eccnet.com/xmlug/ ] and I are coordinating an XML authoring/editing tool forum. The purpose of that event is to give vendors an opportunity to show users – particularly government folks and Betty’s stakeholders – how they are making it as easy as possible to author and edit valid XML instance documents.    That would be appropriate for forum in which for Microsoft to demonstrate its XML authoring/editing software and the Exhibit 300 would be a good to document to use in such a presentation.         Mr. Niemann:    The Intelligence Community Metadata Working Group [ http://www.xml.saic.com/icml/ ] is embarking on a year-long effort to do that. They’re going to produce a lab test and some kind of report. They’re working on the Harris Watch List schema. I’ll provide it to you as suggested content for September 29, to position that and move on with this other activity, so I’ll post some information on that and encourage these other vendors to participate.         Ms. Adams:    A little history: last year we were working with OMB, in a pro bono type of effort. They came to us early-on in the process, and said they’d like to automate submission of the OMB 300 and 53 process. They didn’t know whether they wanted XML, so we sat down with them and white-boarded, and said they should put it in XML. They tried to make a schema, to replicate the data in a schema. They hired Booz to help them implement. Working with folks like Marion, we stopped and went down the XBRL [eXtensible Business Reporting Language,  http://www.xbrl.org/ ] path, because the thought was that XBRL was a good grammar to replicate. We ran into several speed bumps at the end, because XBRL is not the most appropriate grammar for the data we were trying to collect.         Mr. Lubash:    Is this document anywhere? Because it’s an issue that’s growing: should we use base XML or XBRL, because is there a marketing effort taking place? We want to make an educated decision.         Ms. Adams:    We don’t care. If it’s valid, that’s all we want. We’re not trying to get into the grammar space. We actively support the standards, so we can build products that support either. We use XBRL, but do we recommend it? Not really.          Unknown participant:    XBRL serves an important niche. For repurposing, it’s probably a good choice, but if you’re the creator and it has to be embedded in your applications, it’s not necessarily a good choice.         Mr. Sylvestri:    Can we have part of this for the September 29 meeting?          Mr. Ambur:    It’s wide open.         Ms. Adams:    We looked at it fairly late, and in one day we had to create a schema. It’s difficult, because only ITIPS [Information Technology Investment Portfolio System,  http://www.usace.army.mil/itips/ ] folks are going to be able to submit. So we’re working with Booz to construct and submit, then parse and get it into a database. Prior to this, there were truckloads of paper, with people sitting and keying it in.         Was the first one reusable? Pretty? Did it have data types? No, but it was good for the first effort. To OMB, it was light years better than anything they’d seen, and to agencies, to let them accept and put it into the database, the time saved on their end was huge from prior years. They came back to us this year late in the game (there was no kick-off meeting until late June), to construct the schema. We ran into a number of roadblocks. We had some assumptions. By September 8, their back-end systems had to be able to process and accept this data, so we had a real-world business problem to solve, but we also wanted to improve the schema. So the assumptions we made were:    ·           Valid XSD,    ·           Make some modifications, and clean up the schema without reinventing the wheel, and    ·           Put data types in there as best we could, and put some constraints in there—make it more restrictive.    Before, we had no valid data types. It also didn’t support HTML in the last version, so people were cutting from Word documents and putting it into HTML. It’s the same this year. We focused on cleaning it up from last year, and keeping it simple, because not every agency has an XML guru. We’re getting calls from almost every agency on how to get their documents into XML. The second approach was, we used    InfoPath [ http://www.microsoft.com/office/preview/infopath/default.asp ] to put a free tool out there mainly to make our job easy, because if it’s not there, we and OMB are not going to get valid XML, so that’s the main reason why we put it out there. So if you’re in a bind, you can use it, because you know it generates valid information.         The [OMB Circular,  http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/circulars/a11/03toc.html ] A-11 guide and the related guidance are not ready. We had some people helping us with that.         Unknown participant:    How many data elements?         Ms. Adams:    I don’t know.         Mr. Sall:    At least 389.         Ms. Adams:    If you look at the A-11 guidance, it’s not always clear. Lots of folks can construct valid documents based on many of these standards, but you have to merge that with what OMB wants to see. They don’t understand XML or data types. They’re used to Corel. What do you do? Give a “string?” If the string is 500 elements, it blows up. It’s very complicated. We took a lot of issues. OMB gave us time, but it takes a lot of time to make it simple enough to be usable if you’re not an XML guru.         I have my bullet-proof vest on today, because the schema has changed multiple times. OPM [Office of Personnel Management] looked at it through their information platform. Booz Allen has had the schema for a month now. The problem is, there’s no data, because the guidance won’t be finished until the end. They’re just beginning to go through this process, and again, not being a subject matter expert, and OMB not being XML experts, it’s hard to find every single issue. We’ve found some. Ken Sall found some. Others are more about style. Should the OMB schema conform to the [IAC] white paper, and the Developer’s Guide published by the XML Working Group? In a perfect world, yes. Our goal was to put some restrictions on it, and given the time and our task, we have to help these agencies get the data to them. We don’t anticipate it to be easy. Our job is to make it as simple as possible. I’d love to get the schema out to everyone in this room and talk about it for months. We’re going to recommend that to OMB, but in the current process, as-is today, it’s frustrating, because we can’t get everyone involved. As Bob [Haycock] said, it’s still evolving. Everyone has great ideas, but when we have to have a working system by September 8, we have to say, “This is where we go” and move forward. That’s why it’s the way it is today. We have to start and go ahead, and let it evolve.         Mr. Sall:    The InfoPath tool—it’s good news, but I’m wondering whether people have to have Office 2003 to use it?         Ms. Adams:    As it stands today, the beta version of Office is freely available on the Web. Do you have to install InfoPath? Yes, but you can install it separately.         Mr. Sall:  So agencies will be allowed to use InfoPath software?         Ms. Adams:    It’s officially shipped in October.         Mr. Sall:    You said September 8th is the initial submission date. The timing is a little off.         Ms. Adams:    That’s the current state of where everything is. We’re diligently working with OMB to finalize the schema. I apologize, but it’s not yet final. We’re still working, and we hope to have some something by about the end of the week         Mr. Rogers:    Could you talk about lessons learned on your integrating a new   XML stream into an existing legacy system?         Ms. Adams:    Our existing system from last year was a server page, but because the database was outdated, we had to rebuild it this year. The format and the way the relationships were represented prior to now has changed so much that we decided to go with a new structure. It’s more elegant than last year’s. It’s not complicated, because there are only 360 data elements. It doesn’t take much time for developers to get them into their database or architect the database.         I wouldn’t call it a business process. They’re scoring, but they won’t let us go there yet. Right now, we’re focusing on the data analytics of it. We want the data in the right format, so we can slice and dice it without needing a developer to run the queries. We’re trying to throw it into a multi-dimensional database, to be able to look at the information. They get the information, slice and dice it, and present it to Congress. Our job is to help them do that. Next year, we hope the changes will not be as radical; we hope to map from the new to the old schema, and have the data go in. We have a product on the back end called BizTalk Server [ http://www.microsoft.com/biztalk/ ] that lets us do that, so we can take the XSLT and map it to last year’s. We didn’t do it this year, because the data need to be scrubbed.         Mr. Ambur:    I think the data changes won’t be as radical from year to year in the future, but there will always be changes to the guidance. That will entail changes to the database, so we need to make the system readily supportive of change.         Ms. Adams:    Everyone thinks XML is the silver bullet. We set it up to receive any XML document and hopefully map it, and look at information from the State to the federal government. The federal government says, “You have to give us the data ‘somehow.’    With the Department of Education, we got flat form files and all kinds of formats. So the idea is, you define the schema and allow people to map to it. Whatever schema you want to base your exchange on. You’ll never get everyone to exchange the same way. If you allow them to choose, you get more data. If you demand one way, you make it harder for them. We’re probably light years away from one format, because it would have to be a mandate. In the real world, you need the production system today, and you get as much data as possible.         Unknown participant:    Can you talk about data sharing? The IRS is in the process of developing schemas for tax returns as mandated by Congress. A committee under [ANSI, American National Standards Institute Accredited Standards Committee,  http://www.x12.org/x12org/index.cfm ] X12 made up of revenue partners from States and others can negotiate schemas, because States need the data from the IRS, and they need to send them to the IRS, so they’re negotiating what’s done, so the IRS can use what’s done by the States, and developers have a common schema to work from to provide for the taxpayers.          Ms. Adams:    That’s great, but it’s hard to get everyone to use it. If you can mandate it, great, but the federal government can’t mandate to States.         Mr. Ambur:    What we should be aiming for is a good forum for that negotiation to take place to achieve the required degrees of consensus.         Unknown participant:    The Tigris Committee [ http://www.tigris.org/ ] is meeting on that next month. Sometimes the IRS accommodates it, and some times not, but it’s worked out.         Mr. Kevin Williams:    Something you’re saying brought something to mind: with respect to XML registries, the idea of one place for everything is sci-fi stuff, but there are smaller Communities of Interest (COIs) for exchange. Over time, they will roll up to be more centralized, but it  needs to be  more centralized. The thinking is right, but as Bob said, it needs governance. The main point is, you mentioned earlier how it’ll accept the data. Are you planning on moving to a Web Services interface, or a SOAP [Simple Object Access Protocol,  http://www.w3.org/TR/soap12-part1/ ] interface…          Ms. Adams:    We’d love to. We tried last year to get Web Services implemented. It’s not a technical problem; it’s already constructed. The problem is hosting it. Theoretically, the technology is in front of the policy right now in most agencies. If you ask them to put it on an outward-facing server, whether it’s Apache (it doesn’t have to be Microsoft—there are Sun servers) in most situations, you can construct Web Services inside the firewall, but as soon as you want to go outside and pass information inside, it’s not supported. It’s a huge policy issue.         Mr. Williams:    It boggles my mind that you can send it as an email attachment, but not as Web Services.         Ms. Adams:    We’d love to stand up Web Services, but folks are not ready to get there. In fact, we have to pull the data. There are a lot of reasons independent of the platform. We were working to create an Apache platform, but we couldn’t do it.         Mr. Williams:    Is it the security aspects?         Ms. Adams:    It’s more a policy thing. There are ways to do it. It’s just a matter of educating folks out there.         Unknown participant:    Another issue is the metadata in there. You should have a security application associated with each one, so you can’t look at it as a single solution. It’s a pluralistic society. We have to come together. The way you describe the OMB 300, it always gets trumped by what you need today. I believe, as Kevin submitted, the COIs are the first step.         Ms. Adams:    If we had a year to work on it, that would be great, but the problem is guidance. It’s not complete, there’s a short time frame, and we’re restricted on what we can do, but I agree.         Unknown participant:    Two years ago we went to OMB…         Ms. Adams:    All kinds of things are missing: documentation on the schema; it goes on and on. We can’t create the document by ourselves. The business centers have to give us the document, which means they have to know why the schema’s implemented. I think you’ll see them hire an XML person who can bridge the gap to make the job easier. If you’re technical, you tell me the data and I can make it work.         Unknown participant:    I see an imbalance between the maturity of the parts (non-technical and technical parts). You can swap out the technical part. We should drive to that; a business side and a technical side.          Ms. Adams:    When you try to do things like that, there are all kinds of policy issues that drive it. Our technology is way ahead of the steps they can take.         Mr. Ambur:    That relates to one of my questions—whether the technology is enabling the folks at OMB to see the potential to conduct their business in new and better ways.         Ms. Adams:    I think it is. They’re like any other business. They have to see it, and improve when time allows. It’s a “it worked last year, we’ll be fine, keep going” kind of thing. You have to set your priorities…unless this is going to break, this other stuff comes down to the end.         If anyone has comments on the schema, we’d love them, so we can give them to OMB. Owen made great comments on their information collection—stuff we should make visible to other folks. We do have a system up now: “FEAMS” [FEA Management System,  http://feapmo.gov/feams.asp ]. We want to make this information available to people on an as-needed basis. We have it now, all in XML.         Mr. Ambur:    Following up on Bob’s presentation, it’s one thing to tell agencies that all IT investments should align with the FEA, but just saying it doesn’t make it happen – no matter how hard agencies may try to comply.    Having access to the information provided by other agencies in their Exhibit 300 submissions would help facilitate the necessary coordination.         Ms. Adams:    And they’re evolving their process. Last year, they didn’t have it in XML. This year they did.         Mr. Ambur:    I’m a great advocate of the bottom-up approach, together with good documentation that is widely and readily shared.    I hope we can enable folks all across government to readily share their XML schemas so they don’t all have to reinvent the process of sharing their data elements.    That’s the sense in which I’m looking at the registry as a tool to facilitate collaboration among communities of practice.    It’s one thing for agencies to put their schemas on their own website and that is certainly better than nothing, but I hope we do better than that.    Incidentally, in the registry meeting this afternoon, Ken Gill is going to brief us on the Justice Department’s global justice information sharing XML registry requirements.    Anything else, Roy [Morgan]?         Mr. Roy Morgan:    We’ll at least talk about the products we have to play with. Please come this afternoon, if you’d like to participate.         Mr. Ambur:    There’s a link in today’s agenda [http://xml.gov/agenda/20030820.htm] for the revised XSD for Exhibit 300.          Ms. Adams:    There will be another one.         Mr. Ambur:    Should I change the link?         Ms. Adams :    It should be the same.         Mr. Sall:    There should be a different version in it, so it should change.         Ms. Adams:    Look for more information in it.         Mr. Niemann:    Can you answer my question as to what forms are available (because they were originally done on a spreadsheet)?          Ms. Adams:    The OMB 53 was. The 300 is hard to do on a spreadsheet. Last year, people tried to copy into Excel. It has limits.         Mr. Niemann:    So it’s only in a schema, not in a spreadsheet?         Ms. Adams:    Correct. The order maps directly to the A-11, because we couldn’t figure out any other way. One way was to take the work document and just go right down in the same order for people unfamiliar with XML.         Mr. Niemann:    Was there any attention to the metadata?         Ms. Adams:    No.         Unknown participant:    If you create a vocabulary or a UID, it eliminates the problem of text itself. The fact that it’s business-friendly means it can be technology-friendly if a UID is attached.         Ms. Adams:    I completely agree. We have limited funds and resources to help OMB do it. Most folks don’t know what the XML document is, or how to create it. They have questions like, “Do we need to hire a developer?” and “ What’s the tool use?” Big agencies, yes, they might hire a developer. Small agencies, no.         Mr. Sall:    Where can we get the free tool?         Ms. Brubaker:    It’ll be posted to a URL [Universal Resource Locator]. We should have it by the end of today.         Mr. Ambur:    I’d like to establish a link on the [XML.gov] website.         Mr. Sall:    There’s nothing about the schema or process to prevent someone from using a different tool to input the information they need?         Ms. Adams:    Yes.          Mr. Sall:    Providing a forms interface from the GUI [Graphical User Interface]?         Ms. Adams:    Basically like going from Word over. The question was, do we have a tool that allows you to enter it in, and go back and forth from Word? Yes, because Office 11 supports mapping to XSD schema. We did not create that. OMB looked at it briefly. All the testing is just agencies looking at it. We anticipated needing a tool. This was the easiest way. They didn’t pay us to do this.         Mr. Sall:    The best way to get people outside Microsoft in is by creating a solution to this?         Ms. Adams:    Schema, or solution.      Mr. Sall:    The guidelines…         Ms. Adams:    Convincing OMB that the guidelines are what they want to implement. Our hands are tied.         Mr. Ambur:    If you’re talking about the guidance in the [Federal XML] Developer’s Guide, this group could recommend that they be elevated through the Emerging Technologies Subcommittee [of the AIC] to the Governance Subcommittee, which could in turn elevate it to OMB.    EPA and the Department of the Navy are ahead of the government as a whole for their own internal requirements, but their best thinking needs to be rolled up for the benefit of the government as a whole. This is a voluntary group, but we could make that recommendation to the ET subcommittee.         Mr. Sall:    My concern is that the FEA is coming out with all these documents. The DRM talks about ISO 11179, and other conventions…ebXML, UBL [Universal Business Language,  http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=ubl ], ways of defining elements. I completely understand that you’re focused on getting it out and retrofitting later, and the BizTalk Server XSLT, and mapping this year’s to next year’s, but my fear is that if something is on the FEAPMO site and people from agencies (who aren’t familiar with how it’s developed)…I’d say it’s the old “eating your own dog food,” and with international…         Unknown participant:    That’s OMB’s discussion.         Ms. Adams:    It would be a task on the list of stuff OMB wants us to do. It would cost them money. They need to be convinced that there’s some value.         Mr. Ambur:    Let me reiterate what I said earlier. This is a voluntary group. We have no authority to tell anyone to do anything, but we can make recommendations. GSA [General Services Administration] is also working on it. If there’s a strong will in this group to elevate it to the governance subcommittee, I could do that.         Ms. Adams:    We can make it simple first, then complex. I think people are going to go the simple path at first. To have an XSD document, that’s pretty complex for those ones who aren’t familiar with it. This process is huge, so the next one (simple to complex) isn’t as hard.         Mr. Niemann:    This is a tip of the iceberg. Booz Allen suggested asking us how to address the problem. Some agencies are already using advanced tools. OMB has a back-end system trying to move to XML, for receiving part of the information agencies have. Both groups wanted to go their own way. We suggested that they need to work out the protocols between them. The EAs [Enterprise Architects] will tell you this has to be a living process, and work throughout the year as part of the planning process, not just September 8. We really need interactive Web Services—a living system where people are working both ends—and do pilots.         The other point is the need for more than a schema. We need to move up in the ontology world, like RDF [Rich Data Format], because this is like a collaborative business case, where you discuss it with others who are doing it, and bring about the consolidation that OMB wants, so it takes on another dimension like ontology markup, so people can discuss it with one another.          Ms. Adams:    That’s what FEAMS is there for. I agree it should be an evolutionary process, and not wait until the end of the year. That’s tough for them. As you know, they’re not really done. They have a second submission at the beginning of this next year. About the June time frame, they’ll bring us in again. For them, it’s great feedback. I encourage you to give it.         Unknown participant:    That ontology is the way the business communicates to taxonomies and business patterns. That’s the part we’re missing. Those two work in synch. The business people have to map the abstractions. That’s the real power. The business communication.  Not  understanding the ontology.         Ms. Adams:    They don’t understand the business value.         Unknown participant:    And that’s the way they approach the project—short-sighted, immediate goals. The business process is the way it’s evolved over the last 20 years. The XML group should say, “Let’s start building these things to level the playing field.”         Mr. Ambur:    I’m not sure people will ever understand ontologies, for example, but they can understand results. Bob’s presentation about the DRM plays into it. Ken’s comment about eating our own dog food is also noteworthy; OMB should be eating its own dog food with respect to the DRM.    Susie’s comments that simple wins over complex is also very well taken, and we should move forward every day, in any small ways that we can, rather than expecting the “big bang” to solve all our problems.         Ms. Adams:    It takes time, re-architecting the ways agencies do business. “Data” sometimes is a four-letter word, because data have power. I don’t necessarily want to give you my data. People look at Web Services, and say, “No way, I don’t want you to see my data,” so people have to be comfortable sharing their data. Now people email and say, “You can look at it.” With that, Bob can go look at it.         Mr. Ambur:    It reminds me of another question. I understand OMB intends at some point to make the data from agency Exhibit 300 submissions public. Is that your understanding?         Ms. Adams:    I think once the FEAMS is done, that’s the intent.         Mr. Niemann :    One or two ITIPS records managers will be given access.         Mr. Ambur:    So your understanding is that it’s not public yet?         Mr. Niemann :    No, they’re still piloting. I think the feeling is, if they give one person at each agency access, they can figure out how to share. They want to control it so we don’t see 300s show up in the press and other places.         Mr. Ambur:    I suspect if the XML instance documents were made available, a number of vendors could show some great stuff.         Mr. Niemann :    At our September conference, we have about 10 vendors who are going to show what they’ve done. There is already an impressive number of ontology applications in the industry itself. We can show that it’s more than just talk.          Mr. Ambur:    Are there any other questions or comments for Susie and Carolyn? We’re a little ahead of schedule. There’s nothing wrong with adjourning early—I’m sure you can all use the time.         The ET subcommittee is charged with developing a process where the IT lifecycle can be managed. That’s a fancy way of saying that the CIOs can’t effectively respond to all the vendors who are trying to communicate with them. We need a better way to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of such communications.    In my view, the end of the ET process is submission and approval of a fully completed Exhibit 300. I’m interested in Susie’s comments about the order of the elements of the XSD following the order of the elements of the guidance itself.    In the early stages of the ET process, it may not use exactly the same elements of the 300 Exhibit, but I believe the data gathered in the ET process should map into Exhibit 300, and whenever possible, the data itself should be reused in the A-11 process.          I’m thinking of using our next meeting, on September 10, to discuss the elements of the XML schema for the first stage of the ET process, with the aim of delivering a strawman schema to the ET subcommittee at its next meeting.         If there are no other questions or comments, I thank you all.              End meeting.         Attendees:                          Last Name                First Name                Organization                        Adams             Susie             Microsoft                   Altner             Bruce             NASA/SAIC                   Ambur             Owen             FWS                   Bennett             Daniel                                 Billups             Prince             DISA                   Brish             Arie             Conformative Systems                   Cox             Bruce             USPTO                   Derrick             John             Conformative Systems                   Feagans             James             DOJ                   Fong             Elizabeth             NIST                   Gorman             Will             PureEdge                   Hassam             Amin             I411                   Haycock             Bob             FEAPMO                   Kantor             Bohdan             Library of Congress                   Lubash             Mike             DFAS                   McKennirey             Matthew             Conclusive                   Morgan             Roy             NIST                   O’Connell             Greg             PureEdge                   Rogers             Rick             Fenestra                   Safran             Sol             IRS EPMO                   Sall             Ken             SiloSmashers                   Sylvestri             JD             Corel                   Turnbull             Susan             GSA                   Todd              Vincent             GSU XMLlegal                   Williams             Kevin             BlueOxide                   Yee             Theresa             LMI                   Yenchi             Greg             VA

FIFTH MEETING  Thursday, July 11, 2002     Session 3: Stem Cells 4: NIH Funding of Stem Cell Research (Implementation)      Dr. Wendy Baldwin, Office of Extramural Research    National Institutes of Health        CHAIRMAN KASS:  On the record.  Thank you very much.  I think we should start.  We have a couple of stragglers, Dr. Baldwin.  There are always a couple of stragglers.  I think since your schedule is tight we should get moving.   It's a great pleasure to welcome Dr. Wendy Baldwin who is the Deputy Director for Extramural Research in the Office of the Director of NIH.  And who after President Bush announced his decision on stem cell research, he was finished and she was not.  She has come to talk to us about the implementation of the President's policy on stem cell research.  We've been looking forward to learning exactly what's happening.  It's very good of you to come and join us and educate us this afternoon.  Thank you.   DR. BALDWIN:  Thank you, Dr. Kass.  I'm very happy to be here and to tell you how I've been keeping myself busy in implementing this policy.  Let me go through a little bit.  I don't have handouts of the overheads, but I'd be happy to leave the overheads if you'd like.  I don't think I have to go into much detail with this group certainly about what the embryonic stem cells are, their unique properties, their ability to proliferate, and the capability of forming other kinds of cells.  So that has importance for basic science understanding of what cells do as well as our anticipation of clinical application as well.   There are many areas that we feel are major questions for us to think about where stem cells are going to influence how biology is done and what the importance will be.  Our major activity right now has been to implement the policy that was put in place last August 9th.  So the criteria for allowing research with federal funding on human ES cells is shown on this slide.  I think we're probably all familiar with this.   They had to have been derived from a blastocyst that was initiated prior to the President announcing his policy.  The embryo had to have been created for reproductive purposes and no longer needed which means it came basically from IVF clinics.  There had to be informed consent from the donors to use these cells with no financial inducement for the donation.   The way we're implementing this is that having established these criteria our first job was to complete the documentation and ensure that we had documentation, that the available lines met these criteria, and then to post a registry.  Once we did that then an investigator could go to the registry and identify a line that they wanted to use knowing that it met the President's policy.  So this is front-loading if you will that review process.   On November 7, 2001, we published the NIH Registry.  I've given you minimal handouts.  You must have 150 pounds of paper to carry back with you.  Your handout from me is one single sheet of paper, two-sided.  On the front, it shows you the registry.  On the back, it shows the stem cell site on the NIH website that has every conceivable document.  People are looking around like they don't have it.  Do they have it?   CHAIRMAN KASS:  I'm afraid there's been a slip up.   DR. BALDWIN:  We will get it to you.   CHAIRMAN KASS:  Does anyone have these?   DR. BALDWIN:  It's a page.   CHAIRMAN KASS:  They're coming right now.   DR. BALDWIN:  Once you go to the stem cell section of the NIH website, basically all of our documentation, information, et cetera is there and is updated regularly.  It took us a little while to get the registry up.  We wanted to be sure that we had developed it in a way that would be user-friendly and that we had unique codes for the different stem cell lines.  It went up November 7th.  Then what we did was we started to put in place the things that would be needed for investigators to make use of the registry and actually obtain funding to do this research.   The first thing we did was to realize that we had amissed the posting of the registry so that people could come in for our October 1 receipt date.  NIH has three rounds of application receipts.  So what we did is extended that receipt date so that anyone who was sitting there poised to do this research still had an opportunity to get an application in.   We then moved on to issue and announcement for Infrastructure Awards so that we could reach out to the sources so we could help them be sure they were actually going to be able to provide stem cells for the researchers who wanted them.  We moved on to Administrative Supplements.  I'll go into these in a little more detail, but it shows you how almost week by week we were putting in place one or another element that was necessary for us to actually fully implement this policy and make it a reality for the research community.   So Administrative Supplements, Training Potential, all of these pieces.  The implementation job was really taking the policy and then saying what are all of the different steps that have to happen to make this actually really work.  Let me go back to that one in a minute.   The last one on there is we announced the procedures for how you could use the process that's in place for having research done on human embryonic germ cells.  In May 20th, we had the first review of such an application.  That's the companion to the embryonic stem cell activities.   As of July 5th when the slide was done, we had made five of these Infrastructure Awards, 13 Administrative Supplements, and one Grant Award.  That I think people can look at and say one award.  How can this be?  But there actually is a fair amount of time that takes place between submitting an application to us, going to scientific review, going to an advisory council, and an actual funding decision made, and an award made.   What you're hearing here is our taking that policy and mainstreaming it in to how NIH does business.  We have very sound principles as to how we do business of transparency and peer review.  We're bringing stem cell research into that process.  At the same time where we've identified what might be a gap or a hurdle or an impediment, we're trying to reach out to that as well whether it's a need for training or a need for infrastructure support.   A few features of this registry.  We are listing all of the cells that meet these criteria.  You may be interested to know that we've added lines since the President's statement because we found six additional lines that met these criteria.  The registry serves two very important functions.  It provides a code for each of these and provides the contact information because an investigator that wants to do this research goes to the registry, identifies a line, and then gets in touch with them.   This is the content of the registry.  When you go to each one, this is what it looks like if you go to it on the web.  You can't read that on the screen.  When you click on any one of these sources, you go to a slash screen that's for that particular source.  This one happens to be WARF.  You'll see that it gives you contact information, e-mail information, their website, and the information about the cell lines that are on there.  That is information we're asking the sources to keep up and keep current because it is their information.   What have we found to be the issues for researchers?  Well, first is the simple access to the line.  Are there intellectual property issues, IRB issues, administrative ones, and ones relative to how they're going to actually get the skills to work with these lines?  Let me take these one at a time.   There have been questions as to whether these cell lines are actually available.  I think it's important to realize that human embryonic stem cell work is relatively new.  Because this was not an area available for federal funding prior to the President's statement, they are largely in foreign sources or commercial entities.  So many of these groups were not at the outset thinking about supplying the scientific community.  That's why we put infrastructure support out there, so that each of the sources can come to us and apply for funding to help them scale up, better characterize their cells, and make them available.   These are the awards that we've already made. (Indicating.) It's on a rolling receipt date though.  It's something that we'll continue to do as long as we have sources that need infrastructure support in order to make their lines available.   There are of course many things that can affect easy access to these lines.  In some cases, we have international issues.  There's been a change in terms of whether biologic material can be shipped on a passenger airplane.  I can't sit here and tell you that it's all simple.  This is not Amazon.com where you can just click on it and it comes by FedEx the next day.  There are things your investigators have to do in order to get access.  They're not qualitatively different from other fields, but they are important in this case.   All of these lines have intellectual property issues associated with them.  As I said by enlarge they are either commercial sources or they are foreign sources.  There is a U.S. patent on the derivation method.  In fact, the sources have to work out their intellectual property agreements in order to make them available.   NIH did something that's a little unusual here.  We of course would have to negotiate a memo of understanding for our investigators to have access to these lines.  We did the first one with Wisconsin with WARF.  What they said was not only would these terms be available to the NIH investigators but they would make them available to other investigators.    That's important to realize because the NIH doesn't get involved in the negotiations between a source and a user.  That's their responsibility.  But what this has done is made it much easier.  In fact, you can go to the website.  Those memos of understanding are all on the website.  An investigator can just download that, click on it, read it, take it to their tech transfer office, and if they can accept the terms which are pretty straight forward, they're ready.  They don't have to negotiate this from the ground up as it were.   We now have four of the MOUs that are available on the website.  I'm walking you through each of these steps because I think it's important to understand the different pieces of this puzzle that had to be put in place so that this whole area of research would actually take off.  Some of these sources may initially want to start out doing collaborative arrangements, and others are further along in their development and are more ready to make them just generally available.  That was clear at the outset that we would have that kind of variability.   This is the flip side of the handout which is the stem cell information site which is absolutely essential if you're interested in this area of research.  On it, you will see all of the MOUs are there.  We run a Frequently Asked Questions section.  We update that as soon as we have anything new to put out there.  Background reports, background material, anything a potential investigator or a funded investigator would want to know.  We're trying to make it one stop shopping so that it is all out there and pretty easily accessible.   In terms of IRB issues, all of these lines had documented informed consent for the donation of the embryo.  One of the follow-on issues though was do any of these lines include identifiable information or not or are they completely anonymized.  We worked with the Office of Human Research Protections to clarify the guidance about when IRB review is needed if there is identifiable information anywhere.  In fact, this document which of course again is on the website clarifies that there can be a firewall, either it's anonymized or the person receiving the line has no potential to get access to any identifying information then that streamlines what they would have to do within their own institution.  OHRP, we would not be requiring IRB review of the use of that line.  Grantee institutions may of course have some additional requirements.   There were questions raised about administrative issues in terms of how to think about the facilities and administrative costs if there were eligible research and ineligible research going on to the same institution.  Again, we felt that there are already very strong and existing policies about unallowable research.  The institutions know how to handle financially unallowable research.  Basically this just clarified for them how to do that, again to mainstream how this issue is handled relative to other areas of unallowable activity.   We have this as an administrative issue.  I'm not sure that it is.  Most research when it comes in it goes through peer review.  Reviewers are really looking for preliminary data.  In a new field, that's particularly challenging.  If it's a brand new field, you may not have preliminary data.    We've taken two tacks there.  One is to now just have Administrative Supplements available, but to really go a little further step to advertise their availability.  What that means is if you're already a funded investigator and let's say you're working on mouse ES cells and within the basic scope of the research you could add on some work in human ES cells, you can come to the NIH for an Administrative Supplement.  They're modest in dollar support, about $50,000.  They're handled administratively.  But it is a way for probably our most promising cadre of investigators to get started in this field and be able to help develop some preliminary data.  We've also tried to deal with that at the stage of review in terms of reminding people that this is an area where it's much more difficult to have preliminary data when you first come in.   One of the difficult issues for us is these are not necessarily easy cells to work with.  We've looked at what the need is there.  Everyone who has worked with human ES cells has pointed out the need for very careful, meticulous laboratory work and that there's a high degree of variability across labs and culture conditions.  So again, we've looked at what would be the tools that we could put out there to help investigators develop those skills.   In some cases, they will get them through the acquisition process.  So a source might package some training along with acquiring the cells from them.  If you go to them in return for the price of getting the cells, you would also get a couple of days of on-site training for maybe your Senior Lab Technician.  But we're trying to look broadly at that.  We have an announcement so that an individual investigator who really wants to specialize in this area could come in and apply for funding or an institution that wants to focus on doing some short term training activities that they would make available to others could apply to us for support.   Again, this is really taking the tools that we already have.  We already know how to work with a community to build skills when it's necessary.  We're just focusing them and applying them to this particular area of science.   The information has been very widely disseminated.  Now, we think it's been widely disseminated.  Just because we think it's widely disseminated doesn't necessarily mean that it is.  I get 350,000 or 400,000 hits a month on my website where this is located.  We get more on the NIH website.  You can access it right from the nih.gov site.   We know some professional associations have been pulling up those Frequently Asked Questions and sending them back out to their constituencies.  One of the things you can certainly help me with is if you can think of any other strategies that we might use to make this information widely available.  That appears to do it.  I wanted to go through that fairly quickly so that you would have a chance in my time here to ask questions.  If anything that I've gone through was either too quick or didn't make sense, please ask me now.   CHAIRMAN KASS:  Dan Foster and then Janet.   DR.  FOSTER:   I don't work on stem cells.  One of questions I think fairly broadly asked in the scientific community regarding the research is given now the 80 cell lines, how many of those are in some sense adequately characterized to be useful in research.  You know much better than I do, there's been considerable skepticism about the adequacy of these cell lines for the research that we want to do.   DR. BALDWIN:  Well, it's a little difficult to give an exact number.  It's certainly in excess of two dozen on there and are pretty well characterized and we know they're available.  I understand the question.  I understand the concern.   I think that we're equally concerned to see that investigators do get started working with the lines that are available.  That's going to be the best test of how good those lines are.  We won't know until people use them and test them and compare two lines from different laboratories.   There's a tremendous amount of basic work that simply has not been done.  While that's certainly an interesting issue to pursue, I'm at the implementation side.  I'm asking are the grant applications coming in.  Are we funding it?  Are we building up a base of knowledge about those lines?  I think we really have to do that.   DR.  FOSTER:  Well, I think that's probably the only answer you have.  We oftentimes say the only way you can answer these questions is to do the experiments.  We had been talking about that earlier today.   DR. BALDWIN:  Exactly.   DR.  FOSTER:  I think just myself that you've done a wonderful job on this infrastructure so far.   CHAIRMAN KASS:  Janet, would you like to begin?   DR.  ROWLEY:  Well, I'd like to carry on with the first question that Dr. Foster asked you.  Backing up just a bit.  Have you or have you in conjunction with the sources come up with a set of standardized procedures that you're going to do to characterize these lines?  Is everybody karyotyping their lines and doing some molecular analysis of them and what kind of studies have they done for longevity of the lines, et cetera?   DR. BALDWIN:  First off, the next enhancement if you will of the registry is to encourage our sources to provide additional data.  The sources vary as to how much information they have and how much they're posting on those websites.  To encourage them to go ahead and site either their published articles or the research that's being done with their lines, that's the area of enhancement that I'm looking for next.   The next area I think will be for us to bring those sources together.  They really form a very unique network.  It will be bringing them together really as a group that I think would be most valuable, for them to share their experiences as to the most valuable information or where their information appears to be discordant.  We've just made those awards within the last 60 days, so it's just a little early for that.  That would be the approach that I'd be inclined to pursue.   DR.  ROWLEY:   In terms of the Infrastructure Awards that you have made to individuals, you indicated in your very brief overview that you are asking or providing financial support to the sources to do some things.   DR. BALDWIN:  Exactly.   DR.  ROWLEY:   I guess the question is in your infrastructure grants is there some commonality of information that you are hoping that they will use that support for to provide answers to some of these questions.  Or is it just you have X number of cell lines and it costs X amount to do something.   DR. BALDWIN:   No.  It's not that.  But the first way that you phrased it, I think it would leave the impression that we're saying here's a list of things we want to see, do each of these with each line.  We really haven't done that.  They have come forward, not just give us money and we'll do more, but to say what they will do and that goes through peer review to say is that an appropriate strategy and are they going to be useful tests.   I guess my experience has been especially in a new field bringing those investigators together so that four or five of them sit down and say here's the way I'm going to do this and here's the information that would be valuable.  Having them talk that out to drive it toward some common sense of what is the most appropriate or the useful measures is usually preferable to us saying at the outset the specific ones we want to see.    I know that's a taste in preference.  Some people like a little harder edge at the outset.  I guess my experience has been I prefer to draw some of that out of our sources as opposed to imposing it on the outset.  But I understand your question.   DR.  ROWLEY:  You're aware of the article in Nature suggesting it be some of the cell lines.  Presumably all of these are grown on mouse feeder cell layers or virtually, a number of the cell lines are grown on --   DR. BALDWIN:  Many, yes.   DR.  ROWLEY:   So that the possibility that there are mouse-human hybrids is real.  Those would obviously have limited or no usefulness for the kinds of investigations that many people are interested in.  I guess I'm a cytogeneticist, so the first thing we do for cell lines is karyotype them.   DR. BALDWIN:  Yes.   DR.  ROWLEY:  I would have thought that it would be an important early parameter for the study section to have required that each one of the grantees do.   DR. BALDWIN:  It is.  I think what you're raising to me may be one of the things that we could do would be to extract from those Infrastructure Awards a little more of the vision of what the sources are proposing to do even in advance of them having the results and having the data to post.  Obviously the abstracts are available.  But we haven't thought about doing that as an extract to see where that common sense of the group as to the most useful activities would be.    They have latitude under a grant application.  It isn't that they're locked into doing one thing.  If six months from now it's clear there's something valuable to do, they could add that to it.  That would be a very useful suggestion for this.  I think I see something to go back and do.   DR.  ROWLEY:  Okay.  Let me just pursue two other aspects of this.  I think it's marvelous that in your dealings with the sources that you have made arrangements for other investigators to get some of the same kinds of expedited access to the lines under the memorandum of understanding.  I think that's marvelous because certainly these material transfer agreements can be painful and to do each one for private investigators is difficult.   You raised the question of cost.  I wonder is there a fair variability.  It seemed to me that as we were approaching WARF it was several thousand dollars to get a single cell line.   DR. BALDWIN:  Because of the network of agreements really, I think that's going to be pretty standardized, the $5,000 for access.  I'm talking about academic researchers not anyone who is accessing for commercial purposes.  Then you can't just download an MOU and go to work.  That's very different if you're setting out to develop them for a commercial activity.  My interest is here, what we can do for the basic research community.   DR.  ROWLEY:   Now, also in dealing with WARF, the MTA did include statements that any discoveries we make with those cell lines the intellectual property reverts to WARF.  I don't know whether in more recent memorandum of understanding whether that's --   DR. BALDWIN:   (Off the microphone.)   DR.  ROWLEY:  Okay.   DR. BALDWIN:   I don't think so.  I could have brought you a whole notebook of this material.  But I don't think that's the case for the academic researcher.  Again, the MOU is downloadable.   CHAIRMAN KASS:  Could I just ask a question because this is an important question to lots of people?  Could I have Janet ask the question again and could I hear the answer again so I know what we've just had?   DR.  ROWLEY:  Well, I was raising the question that it was my impression that as we approached the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation that were we to buy the cell line --   CHAIRMAN KASS:  Right.   DR.  ROWLEY:  Which is $5,000 and we did research with it, any intellectual discoveries that we made then became the property of WARF, not of us.  There are a lot of these MTAs that have what are called pass-throughs.  This was the question.  Whether I was mis-remembering or whether possibly your memorandum of understanding is maybe a bit different than I recall from maybe four or five months ago because I haven't paid attention to this recently.   DR. BALDWIN:  I don't think that has changed in that time.  I do have a copy and I'd be happy to leave it with you.  I think you may be thinking of when you're obtaining the cell lines for a commercial development.   DR.  ROWLEY:  No, because this is strictly university research.  That's an important issues as to whether as you are making new discoveries they're your intellectual property or reverts in some way to the source of the cell lines.  The fact that's not part of this is I think excellent.  I assume that as people come in with R01s that the cost of the cell lines and things can be included as costs within the grant.   DR. BALDWIN:   Oh, absolutely.   CHAIRMAN KASS:  Again, just for my clarification.  I gather the answer to that question is that reversion applies only if these things are sold to commercial organizations and not to university researchers.  Is that right?   DR. BALDWIN:  Yes.   CHAIRMAN KASS:   Okay.  Thank you.  Janet, are you complete for now?   DR.  ROWLEY:  Yes.   CHAIRMAN KASS:  Thank you.  Rebecca Dresser.   PROF. DRESSER:  I wanted to ask about a couple of things.  First, I was interested in how you decided about whether the informed consent requirement had been made in some countries far away.  Did you ask for just some documentation or how did you approach that?   DR. BALDWIN:  We had documentation from all of the sources.  We also had visits to a number of the sources.  All of the sources at the time the registry first posted had come and visited at the NIH, so we had discussed these things with them specifically.  We also have had visits to many of these other labs.  So it's not just a paper review.  It's primarily a case of them presenting the documentation which is always the case.  That's the heart of it.  But we have gone further than that.   PROF. DRESSER:  Right.  I understand.  The other thing I wanted to ask about is a little bit off the track but I understand that Dr. Gearhart recently got an award to work on stem cells from fetal tissue.   DR. BALDWIN:  Right.   PROF. DRESSER:   And that it went through a review process under the earlier NIH guidelines for stem cells which applied to both embryonic stem cells as well as fetal stem cells.   DR. BALDWIN:  Yes.   PROF. DRESSER:  So I understand that it went through a review process, and all the very detailed requirements were met.  I wondered if that was the same review group that reviewed that protocol as the one that was earlier put up during the prior Administration, the group the Janet Rowley mentioned this morning.   DR. BALDWIN:  You mean the composition of that review group.   PROF. DRESSER:  Right.   DR. BALDWIN:  No.   PROF. DRESSER:  How did that work?   DR. BALDWIN:  Let me explain what happened there.  We had these guidelines that covered both derivation from germ cells, from fetal tissue to generate the embryonic germ cell lines and also for embryos.  So the expectation had always been there would be more interest in the embryonic research at that point.  A group had been put together, but it had never actually met and functioned.   So when the President's policy came along that really superseded this whole section on embryo research.  So we rescinded that portion of the guidelines.  But the only rescinded that portion of the guidelines.  We left in place prohibited.  We left in place the fetal tissue side of it.  Now we had a very different creature because we knew the scope of that would be much narrower than was originally construed.   So we basically went back and rebuilt that process.  I mean, we didn't change any of the elements of review.  We didn't change any of the rigor.  But we did make that an internal NIH review.  Obviously dealing with appropriate conflicts of interest so that there was actually someone who would be on that group who would have been from the funding institute.  We had them absented from that review because of potential conflict.   But we took that group which was very mixed in terms of their science background, ethics background, et cetera, to review that proposal and to align it with the guidelines that were in place.  They did meet.  That was a public meeting.  We announced that in the Federal Register.  We did approve that project.   That process only begins when there is an application ready to be funded.  So someone comes in, we knew the Diabetes Institute was ready to make an award through their Beta Cell Consortium.  That's what prompted that meeting.  It happens in conjunction with the Center for Scientific Review Advisory Council meeting.   PROF. DRESSER:  So is the group all then NIH employees?   DR. BALDWIN:  Yes.   PROF. DRESSER:  I mean, one of the things we're interested in is if you're going to have review of some of these kinds of things who should be on the group.  I was just curious about that.  So you see this group more as going down the requirements and checking off to make sure everything was done as opposed to making some sort of ethical judgement about whether it's good enough to go forward.   DR. BALDWIN:  Well, they're explicitly not to review the science again.   PROF. DRESSER:  I understand that.   DR. BALDWIN:  The science is reviewed on a separate track.   PROF. DRESSER:  Right.  So what is their role?   DR. BALDWIN:   Their role is to in fact look at the requirements which have many different components and to see whether the documentation that's presented to us is consistent with the requirements that we've put out there.  If you go back to your first question, it's really not terribly different from the review that we've done now on the materials submitted on the embryonic stem cells where we basically had the President's policy and it was our job which was in fact an NIH staff-level review as to whether the documentation was appropriate.   PROF. DRESSER:  Right.   DR. BALDWIN:   We were trying to look for some parallelism there.   PROF. DRESSER:  But the initial proposal when this was going to cover both kinds of stem cells, I just know some people who I believe might have been put on the earlier group.  I know it wasn't all NIH.  It was more diverse.   DR. BALDWIN:  Oh, no.  Right.   PROF. DRESSER:  So was that group seen more as making conceptual, ethical judgements more than this one is?   DR. BALDWIN:  That group really had a much larger task because that was where we were envisioning prospective establishment of embryonic stem cell lines.   PROF. DRESSER:  Right.   DR. BALDWIN:   So they were going to really be reviewing the proposals or the strategies for developing those lines.  With the President's statement, that decision was made.  No prospective work, only retrospective.  It's only those lines that meet these criteria fixed in time and space.  I think we felt from the beginning that was going to be the much more challenging area and likely to be the volume of work would come in from the embryonic side.  But that was a judgement call on our part to bring that a little more in parallelism with what we were doing on the embryonic side.   PROF. DRESSER:  Thank you.   CHAIRMAN KASS:  Bill Hurlbut.   DR. HURLBUT:  Apropos of that question in a slightly different perspective.  Are there provisions in the way things run now for opening to new apparent embryonic-type pluripotent stem cells that aren't from embryo sources?  For example, suppose that something like Catherine Verfaillie cells are shown to be truly pluripotent or maybe even totipotent.  Are there possible ways to review that which would allow new lines to be admitted if they didn't come from embryonic sources, either from above or below in the sense that by de-differentiating something that was differentiated or producing something that was slightly differentiated from below?  Do you see what I'm saying?   DR. BALDWIN:   But de-differentiating from an adult cell is not covered by this at all.  Maybe I'm not understanding your question.   DR. HURLBUT:   One of the hopes is that you'll be able to take an adult stem cell or maybe a somatic cell using the proper cytoplasmic factors and bring it down to pluripotency.   DR. BALDWIN:  But you could do that.  That would not be covered by this because you're not starting with an embryonic or a fetal line.   DR. HURLBUT:  My point is there are going to be some potential ethical questions around that, and they will be the equivalent of embryonic stem cells in a certain sense.  I know that they're sources not embryos, but they're potential is what's also in question.  Isn't it?   DR. BALDWIN:   Well, that's --   DR. HURLBUT:  I mean, you or the current policies would not approve for example the artificial creation of a zygote from above if you will.  You could add the cytoplasmic factors.   DR. BALDWIN:   I understood your question as to whether there would be specific requirements to generate an apparently pluripotent stem cell line starting from an adult cell.  We would not have coverage over that.  I think you're probably really asking other questions about what you would do with that cell after you got it, perhaps.   DR. HURLBUT:  Yes.  I'm trying to get at the moral question of whether the current provision has possibilities for reviewing new creations that are being worked on at this time.   CHAIRMAN KASS:  Bill, I think if I understand what is here being implemented is something that is tied specifically to these authorized embryonic stem cell lines.   DR. BALDWIN:   Right.   CHAIRMAN KASS:  And that while there might be other things coming along that give rise to all kinds of myriad questions, that's not the bailiwick of this body.  Am I misunderstanding?   DR. BALDWIN:  No, you're absolutely correct.   DR. HURLBUT:  So they were not principles put in place.  It was the cell lines only.   CHAIRMAN KASS:  Yes.  Here was for the first time authorization, permission to go ahead with these lines.  Nothing was in place to make that possible.  The NIH has had the pleasure and burden of making this happened as expeditiously as possible.  That's not without its difficulties and bugs.  That's  partly what we are learning about I think.  What happens with other things that come along, that would require different kinds of structures or might already belong to different kinds of places.  But that seems to be not the issue before us here.    Could I ask a question.  It's probably too early to tell because the number of proposals is still few.  But what are you hearing from the investigators who want to get up and running, granting that there might be the usual kinds of impatience between researchers and funding and assistant sources?  But with respect to the procedure, with respect to the obstacles, what are you hearing from the investigators who say at last?  Are there certain chronic obstacles at the moment?  If so, what are they?   DR. BALDWIN:  Well, I'd say the obstacles are not big obstacles, but they are certainly issues to deal with.  They are really the ones that I've mentioned.  You do have to deal with the intellectual property issues.  I mean, this is something and that's true for many products that are out there in research that you do have to deal with and MOU.  You do have to think about the intellectual property issues.   I haven't heard any particular concerns other than the anxiety around how much emphasis we'll place on preliminary data in a field that's going to be a little hard for them to develop preliminary data.  When we know that there are more lines being shipped then we're seeing applications for, it says to me that probably what is happening or what I am speculating is happening is that some investigators are going ahead, getting the lines, lines they know will be eligible for our funding, but working on them some before they apply to us for funding.  That's not anything we're imposing on anyone.   Most researchers like to put the best application forward that they can and knowing the difficulty in working with these lines, knowing that it's not simple may want to buffer themselves with some time before they actually come in with an application that goes into peer review.  That's really my speculation from bits and pieces that we've heard.   I think we have six intramural labs that have now received cells.  This is all really very new.  I mean, I don't know how people's cosmic time sense here is but for me this is very fast for this much of a roll-out of a very new, exciting, difficult, and high profile area of science.  I've been asked 100 times am I satisfied with the flow of applications, do I think there should more.  You always want to see more good applications.  Always.  It's not been a flood.  But given the circumstances, I'm not really all that surprised.   CHAIRMAN KASS:   Could I ask a follow-up?  To pick up on Dr. Rowley's question before on the question of the characterization of many of these lines and also on the -- Well, it really goes to the question of the purity of these lines as well.  Is there anything further that can be done through NIH, either on that or on the access questions?  Are you being asked by the investigators to lend a hand there?  Is there a hand to be lent?   DR. BALDWIN:  Well, we're only partway through this implementation.  I mean, we haven't stopped the helping hand out there to work with these sources or to put funding out there for training activities.  This is certainly a high profile issue for us because we know that we're doing things that almost sound contradictory.  Somehow, I don't think they are.   One is we want to mainstream the process so the we stay connected to our fundamental principles and strategies of how we do business and use the tools.  Applications still have to go through peer review.  These things don't happen overnight.  On the other hand because it is such an exciting area of science, there really has been a concerted effort.  We have a contact group with all of the institutes involved.  We're working very closely with them to use every tool that we do have.    So we're trying to balance those two things.  I guess our instinct is that's the right strategy, but we have to keep the pressure on and we have to keep it a high profile issue for the NIH.  And we are.   CHAIRMAN KASS:  Thank you.  Janet and then Frank.   DR. ROWLEY:  I'd like to follow on with two questions.  One of which relates to your earlier answer to me that there are about two dozen cell lines that have been characterized and again, how you would define characterization.   DR. BALDWIN:  Well, I think part of the problem is I don't think there is that clear of a definition.   DR. ROWLEY:  Okay.   DR. BALDWIN:   There's not tab six that is the clear definition of what everybody would accept as characterized.  That's the figure that we've been using of the ones where there is considerable information about the characteristics of the lines.   DR. ROWLEY:  But it's different probably for each one of the six.   DR. BALDWIN:  It is a little.   DR. ROWLEY:  So that there isn't a standard.   DR. BALDWIN:  But you're now challenging me to go back and see the extent to which we could line up some of that information and even use that network that we'll create with those sources as a way to drive it towards certainly some basic understanding.  But I don't think that exists right now.  I don't think we can say here are the six things you definitely should have done.   I think the field is moving pretty fast.  It's important for us not to foreclose anything.  I think when you're working in a new field one of the riskiest things for us to do as funders is to inadvertently foreclose or tighten it down too soon.   DR. ROWLEY:  I certainly agree with that.  As you say, it's as investigators use the lines they may also through their use find either additional features or additional problems that hadn't been appreciated before.  So all of that is going to be important information.  You indicated you were probably going to get at least some or all of the sources together to discuss these.  What kind of timeframe do you see for that?   DR. BALDWIN:  I really don't have a timeframe on that.  We've only made five of the Infrastructure Awards.  We still have more to deal with.  The new sources are very new to us.  It's just too early for me to say.   DR. ROWLEY:   So it would be more like a year from now rather than say six months.   DR. BALDWIN:  Probably in between that.   DR. ROWLEY:  Okay.   DR. BALDWIN:  If you had prompted me, I probably would have said maybe nine months.  But we do not have a specific date on that.   DR. ROWLEY:  Okay.  I'd like to change gears if I can but also take advantage of your long association to senior level at NIH.  If you could help and I think this is related to the question that Rebecca was asking, we are aware that when Harold Varmus was Director of NIH he had a working group under Shirley Tillman looking at pluripotent human stem cells and reviewing some of the procedures to use that.  I think when you said that the focus of the present is narrowed down obviously the focus of that larger group under Shirley did include some derivation of embryo research using IVF.   One of the concerns of this group as well as others is how you would see a somewhat broader group either of the pluripotent stem cell review group for example that was envisioned in 1998 to 2000 that group was composed of ethicists and lawyers as well as scientists.  At least that's my impression.  I believe the membership was appointed by the Secretary of HHS.  I'm not positive about that, but that was my impression.  Whether such a review group would be an appropriate regulatory body to actually give responsibility to if for implementing and reviewing certain aspects or setting certain guidelines for embryonic stem cell research.   DR. BALDWIN:  What kind of guidelines do you have in mind?  Do you mean for areas of science that would be instituted?   DR. ROWLEY:   Well, my impression is that the working group under Dr. Tillman came up with a series of guidelines, some of which you've already incorporated or were incorporated into the embryonic stem cell lines that they had to be derived with donor consent and things of that sort.  The guidelines also have prohibited areas of research.   DR. BALDWIN:  They're still in place.  We did not rescind the prohibited areas of research.   DR. ROWLEY:  And our discussions here and the evolution of science in the last few years has really suggested that some of those prohibitions might be removed.  Then whether a review body of such as a broadly constituted body would look at the prohibited areas.  For example, the prohibition says no somatic cell nuclear transfer.  That's now an area that's been supported by the report from the National Academy of Sciences amongst other things.  Is that up to NIH and the Secretary to remove that prohibition or would there be a broader constituted group that might look at that?   The other thing that's prohibited is actually developing embryos specifically for research.  This is an issue that we've discussed back and forth.  At least some individuals, members of our Council, believe that it should be allowed under certain circumstances and with certain guidelines.   DR. BALDWIN:  Well, you have certainly outlined a very difficult and evolving area of science and ethics.  The current group, the human pluripotent stem cell review group is definitely not envisioned as a group that would be taking on issues such as you described.  That is a group that is really there to address the adequacy of any plans to use fetal tissue.  The prohibitions that were in place in the original guidelines are still prohibitions that are compatible with administration policy.   So what we might do in the future is really not something that I could comment on here.  I can say that's not the kind of issue that would be remanded to that advisory group.  But we always have the capacity of putting in place other advisory groups if it's warranted.  We don't have any specific plans at this time.   Dr. Zahuni (PH) the current NIH Director certainly views this as a very important area of science and one that requires our due diligence and careful attention to what our steps should be.  So it's certainly not something that's going to get any less attention.  But I wouldn't be able to comment further than that.   CHAIRMAN KASS:  Frank Fukuyama.   PROF. FUKUYAMA:   A brief question.  Is there any possibility of these approved lines any of them dying out as a result of mistakes and handling or inexperience?  You said that they are very hard to keep going.   DR. BALDWIN:  That's very speculative.  I don't know.  Of all of the things I worry about in this line --   PROF. FUKUYAMA:  That's not it.   DR. BALDWIN:   That's not on my worry list.  Maybe you gave me something new to worry about.   CHAIRMAN KASS:  Robby George.   PROF. GEORGE:  Just very quickly.  A point of clarification.  In reply to Dr. Rowley's last question about who would have authority to lift or alter the prohibitions that she discussed such as somatic cell nuclear transfer, can you tell us again who's authority would be exercised there?  My understanding is that would require an action by the President or the Congress, not any advisory body.  Am I wrong about that?   DR. BALDWIN:  No.  You're not wrong.   PROF. GEORGE:  I'm right about that.   DR. BALDWIN:  Yes.  Anytime an issue is up for discussion there's frequently a desire to have an advisory group's comment on them.   PROF. GEORGE:   Absolutely.   DR. BALDWIN:  And we don't have a group in place that is doing that.  I'm not anticipating any changes in that.   PROF. GEORGE:   Right.  But apart from discussion or advise the policy --   DR. BALDWIN:  That's why I said those prohibitions are compatible with Administration, with our current policy.  So I'm not envisioning any changes.   PROF. GEORGE:  Is that your understanding as well, Dr. Kass?   CHAIRMAN KASS:  Yes.  That's my understanding.  This is perhaps a strange question to put to you.  This group as you know has been asked by the President to monitor stem cell research and to think about offering guidelines for it.  We have spent a fair amount of our time on human cloning as you probably know.  But we have had presentations from Dr. Gearhart and Dr. Verfaillie.  We are trying as best we can to keep up with what is going on through the NIH.   From the point of view of your activities and what you hear from the researchers in-house and extramurally, are there things that you would like brought to this body that might deserve our special attention?  We've been trying to learn really about the implementation policy and finding out how easily and well are things moving.  Apart from the request that the President should become more liberal and allow more lines to flourish which I understand would be a perfectly natural opinion of the scientific community, within the policy as now stated or in relation to that policy that we would have to consider, are there not so much advise but questions and concerns that we would be remiss in not attending to from the point of view of the people that you speak with and the research that you're trying to help develop?   DR. BALDWIN:  I don't know whether this is a direct answer to your question.  I think what I see most need for right now is scientists just getting down to work with the lines that are available.  There are many questions that need an informed debate.  I think that debate will be better informed if it can come from not a speculation about what might happen and whether this is a good enough line or those work are enough but really more concrete, empirical evidence as to what happens when researchers get in there and work with these lines.   There are very different views out there as to are they enough, they're not enough, they're good enough, they're not good enough.  But they're a little hypothetical for my taste right now.  If they could be better grounded in experience we may find that people have terrible problems working with these lines.  We may find all kinds of terrible problems.  On the other hand, we may not.   Certainly if you look at the mouse ES experience, it started out with a lot of lines and it shook out to where there were a few that seemed to be the most valuable, most useful.  Will it be the same way in the human lines?  I don't know.  We won't know unless we get investigators willing to get in there and in the trenches and starting the work with them.   We're trying to put every conceivable mechanism out there to help that move along, but we still have to get the applications in from the research community.  I guess if you say what's the one thing that I most want to see happen, I think that's it because I just think it will just make the discussions the we could have six months, nine months, ten months, and 12 months from now so much more empirically grounded.  That would be my issue right now.   CHAIRMAN KASS:  Well, thank you.  Just a tiny addendum.  We are also trying to plan our own agenda for the remaining 17 or 18 months of our existence under the existing Executive Order.  I know there's no real answer to this question.  But order of magnitude.  If we wanted to be good monitors of this and of the research and how it's going along, do you think a year from now there would be stuff to monitor?   I mean, are we going to be able to do what we're supposed to do or are we at the end of this time say let the research go forward, we'd like to know what's happening?  And I'm not going to hold you to the answer.  But it matters to us I think in thinking about how to plan our own agenda what kind of time table we ought to be expecting to have some kind of data coming in.  I know it's absolutely unpredictable.   DR. BALDWIN:  Several things I do know.  One is this all takes longer than anyone thinks it does at the outset.   CHAIRMAN KASS:  Right.  Rowley's Law.   DR. BALDWIN:  If you had said anything less than 12 months to tap back in and see how implementation was going I would say I really think that's too soon.  I mean, if you look at a timeline from when these agreements are in places or when we've actually started to move money to a source for infrastructure support, we're measuring things in matters of weeks and months here.  Science just takes time.   In a year's time I think we'll certainly  have a better sense of the rate of applications.  We'll have a better sense of some people's early experiences in working with these lines.  But I would not want to over promise as to how definitive that will be.  Less than a year, I wouldn't do it.  In a year's time, I think it would be a fair question to say come back in a year or send someone back in a year and say how has it progressed and how many more investigators, what's the experience from those.   We'll have 13 Admin. Supplements.  Those are going to be experienced investigators who are probably our bellwether, our leading edge.  In a year's time, I think we'll have a much better feel for how difficult this has been for them or how quickly the sources given infrastructure support have gotten more common information available about their lines and whether in fact we have any lines that turn out just to not appear to work at all.  In a year's time, I think that would be a reasonable question to put to us.  I would hope I have some answers for you.   CHAIRMAN KASS:   Well, thank you.  Would you allow me one more?   DR. BALDWIN:  Sure.   CHAIRMAN KASS:  In connection with your own heavy responsibilities to this activity, is there someone as part of this project also keeping up with what is being done in the private sector on this activity to the extent to which that information is forthcoming?  In other words, if one wanted to say is there somebody at NIH who sits really in command of --   DR. BALDWIN:  Asking the private sector to tell us about what they're doing with their own money and not ours?  No.   CHAIRMAN KASS:  I don't mean that.  But there are things that are published too.   DR. BALDWIN:   Yes, certainly.  We have been attentive to the meetings that occur.  We have staff at any of the national meetings or regional meetings, et cetera who are staying apprised of where the interesting work appears to be done.  I just have to draw that little line.  There's always work that's going on in the not federally funded sector that we don't always know about.   CHAIRMAN KASS:  Of course.   DR. BALDWIN:  There's nothing new about that.  But no.  We are definitely staying on top of where the developments are to the extent that we can.   CHAIRMAN KASS:  Thank you.  Alfonso Gómez-Lobo.   PROF. GÓMEZ-LOBO:  This is an information question.  Maybe it's out of your domain.  I know that at NIH quite a bit is being done on adult stem cell research.  Right?   DR. BALDWIN:  Yes.   PROF. GÓMEZ-LOBO:  Now, is there any way of comparing volumes?  I mean, is there a lot more being done in adult stem cell research?   DR. BALDWIN:  Oh, yes.  That's a much more established field, yes.   PROF. GÓMEZ-LOBO:  Okay.  Thank you.   CHAIRMAN KASS:  Well, it looks like you have answered our questions for now very forthrightly, very fully, and very helpfully.  We're very glad.   DR. BALDWIN:   I'm happy to take any other questions that you would like to probably channel them to me.  E-mail them to me and I will try to get an answer for you if there is anything that I have not gone over.  Again, virtually every piece of information that we have put out there, every announcement, every piece of guidance, every helpful hint all is accessible on the website.  If you would prefer to receive that as hard copy, I'd be happy to pull together a briefing book and send it to you if the Members would like that.   CHAIRMAN KASS:   Well, we thank you very much.  Dr. Lee Zwanziger, would you stand please?  Lee is a research director on the staff and the person most interested in the stem cell aspect of our work.  I'd like at least you and she to say hello.  We can keep a communication open in that direction.   DR. ROWLEY:  I mean, I think that would be very helpful particularly to the extent that we would have some understanding of the cell lines that have been reasonably well characterized.  For example, are most of them derived in the U.S.?  Are most of them derived elsewhere?  Issues like that would certainly be helpful.   DR. BALDWIN:  You sort of challenged me to do an update on that.  So it gives me something to do.   CHAIRMAN KASS:  Thank you.   DR. BALDWIN:  Thank you.   CHAIRMAN KASS:  We are finished a little early.  Thank you very much, Dr. Baldwin.  Is Ted Friedman here?  If we started a little earlier, people could finish a little earlier.  I don't want people who are coming from out of town just to hear you talk miss the beginning.  But we are now ten after.  What if we reconvened at 2:30 p.m.?  Then we just finished a little earlier.  Would that be all right?  We'll take a break until 2:30 p.m.  Off the record.   (Whereupon, the foregoing matter went off the record at 2:09 p.m. and went back on the record at 2:36 p.m.)"

The two types are embryonic stem cells and the other is pluripotent stem cells.  I do not know what the difference between the two are. ------------------------------------------------ The pluri-potent stem cell is simply a cell that gives rise to many other types of cells.  They are found in all stages of an animal.  You have them in your bone marrow. Embryonic stem cells are also pluri-potent but are typically derived from embryos. They both hold promise for generating all sorts of cells. Peter Faletra Ph.D. Assistant Director Science Education Office of Science Department of Energy ======================================================== Elaine, You are going to hate me, because I am going to add a few more terms to the mix :) Embryonic stem cells are cells that are in embryos (obviously) that have the capacity to develop into many different types of cells (nerve, muscle, etc.). In the beginning, they have virtually unlimited opportunities to develop into almost any type of cell. Historically, they were said to be ""totipotent."" As development continues, their options begin to narrow a bit; they can develop into say, a few different types of cells, depending on how they are influenced. At this point, they have historically been termed ""pluripotent."" Eventually, they are ""determined"" to be a certain specific type of cell. They may not look like the final cell type yet, but the dye has been cast, so to speak. Even later, they ""differentiate,"" meaning they develop to where they actually look and act like the type of cell they were determined to be earlier in development.  Each of these stages is influenced by the molecules present in the embryo. Some of these molecules (usually proteins) were made by the mother and packaged into the unfertilized egg, and others were made by the young embryo itself.  The problem these days is that terms are bandied about in the popular press that may not be totally accurate. From your question, I think it is safe to say that you are reading about embryonic stem cells that are pluripotent.

GX259-52-3464899	"Vol. 50 - No. 29  July 26, 1996  BROOKHAVEN NATIONAL LABORATORY  BNL Responds to TWA Flight 800 Crash With Mutual Aid and More After a TWA 747 jetliner bound for Paris, France, with 229 people on board plummeted into the Atlantic Ocean off the Moriches Inlet around 8:40 p.m. last Wednesday, July 17, the Laboratory and its employees once again responded to community need, this time lending personnel and support to the ongoing recovery effort. As the Bulletin went to press, BNL's greatest involvement had been on the part of the Fire/Rescue Group of the Safety & Environmental Protection Division: As a result of an agreement with Brookhaven Town to provide mutual aid in response to situations involving hazardous materials (haz-mat), the Lab's Fire/Rescue Group has responded to two haz-mat calls within the Town, since the Town's own hazmat group is involved in decontaminating divers searching for the victims and remains of TWA flight 800. In addition, many Brookhaven employees who either live near, were traveling by or were visiting the area witnessed the plane's in-air explosion. Recalls BNL Fire Chief James Roesler, who happened that night to be facing south on Roanoke and Sound Avenues in Riverhead, ""I saw a white flash out of the corner of my right eye, then a banner of flames fall from the sky and black smoke afterwards."" After returning home, Roesler was told by his daughter that it was a plane crash. ""I knew, given what I had seen, no one could be alive,"" concludes Roesler, who has given a witness statement to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). No employees on official business were on that flight, and the Bulletin knows of no employee who had been heading for vacation on that plane. Answering the Call On their own time, many BNLers have answered the call for assistance as part of their local fire companies. Others were called upon in other official capacities: For instance, as part of the Coast Guard Reserve Station Shinnecock, Patrol Officer Brian McCarrick of BNL's Police Group in the Safeguards & Security Division served for four days as a crew member of a Coast Guard boat that recovered bodies, plane parts and the victims' personal belongings. And, since the evening of Thursday, July 18, the Housing Office in the Navy divers, members of the U.S. Coast Guard and FBI agents. Providing Mutual Aid Ironically, the day before TWA flight 800 crashed, the Town of Brookhaven and the Laboratory entered into the haz-mat agreement. So, the Fire/Rescue Group was first called by Brookhaven Town's Fire Marshal's office at 2:45 a.m. on Thursday, July 18. Because of the Town's haz-mat response to the ""signal 27"" airplane crash, the Lab was informed that its Fire/Rescue Group is now on standby to cover Brookhaven Town in case of another situation involving hazardous materials, or to provide relief to the Town's haz-mat workers. Earlier, at 11:45 p.m. on Wednesday, Suffolk County's Fire, Rescue & Emergency Services had called BNL's Fire/Rescue, requesting special gloves for handling biohazards. The group complied with 300 pairs. Later, at 7:50 a.m. on Thursday, Roesler offered Chief Fire Marshal Joseph Sauerwein whatever haz-mat mitigation supplies the Lab has to spare. On Sunday, July 21, Roesler offered Sauerwein whatever other resources could be helpful in the recovery and could be temporarily loaned by the Lab. In the meantime, Fire/Rescue rechecked its haz-mat trailer, which holds boots, suits, absorbents, containers, etc., to ensure its readiness, and the trailer was hooked up to a truck provided by the Plant Engineering Division. The Lab's first haz-mat mutual aid response came on Sunday, July 21, at 3:45 p.m., when Deputy Chief Michael Carroll, Lieutenant Antonino Realmuto and Firefighter Paul Larsen were called to the Sands Pit Marina in Patchogue, to plug the gas tank of a 1989 Monte Carlo with New Jersey plates that had leaked ten gallons of fuel in the parking lot. The second call came on Tuesday, July 23, at 7:30 p.m., which sent Captain William Leigh-Manuell, Acting Lieutenant Richard Richards, Firefighter Kevin Cosgrove, Safety Officer John Searing and Industrial Hygienist Robert Selvey to Stony Brook: A home owner had been overcome by vapors as a result of an accidental sulfuric acid spill in the basement during an incorrect attempt to unclog a cesspool. Roesler anticipates that BNL may be called upon to relieve the Town's decontamination workers when more of the fuselage of the plane is found, and more bodies and plane parts are brought to shore. In that case, states Roesler, ""We would call in off-duty people, so we can maintain our staffing here, yet fulfill our mutual-aid agreement."" -- Marsha Belford  Roger Stoutenburgh  Standing by BNL's haz-mat trailer are some of the Fire/Rescue Group staff who have provided mutual aid to Brookhaven Town: (from left) Fire Chief James Roesler, Lieutenant Antonino Realmuto, Firefighter Paul Larsen and Captain William Leigh-Manuell.

Many members of the team working on the muon g-2 experiment, E821 at the Alternating Gradient Synchrotron, gathered on the storage ring, the world's largest superconducting ring magnet.  Roger Stoutenburgh  July 29, 1996, marks the 36th anniversary of the Alternating Gradient Synchrotron's (AGS) first reaching its design energy. With about 800 experiments under its belt -- three of them Nobel Prize winners -- the AGS continues to provide scientists with a fertile field for ground-breaking research. This is the last in a series of stories that the Brookhaven Bulletin has run this month highlighting research at the AGS. For most people at BNL on June 27 at 3:30 p.m., it was business as usual. But at Experiment 821 at the Alternating Gradient Synchrotron (AGS), everyone was on top of the world: Their magnet -- the world's largest superconducting ring magnet -- had just reached its full field strength of 1.5 teslas. The magnet, which is 14 meters in diameter, will be used to refine one of the world's smallest measurements, a part of the muon particle's magnetism known as g-2. The team had two other good reasons to celebrate: In Japan, the inflector magnet -- the superconducting magnet built with no iron that will be used to inject beams of muons into the vast storage ring -- had just been successfully tested. A third high point had been  achieved earlier this spring, when the BNL team had brought beam from the AGS all the way down the 220-meter beam line to the storage ring. ""These are three key milestones,"" said Gerry Bunce, E821's Project Manager. ""Construction started in 1989, and the major R&D aspects of the experiment are now done, thanks to a great team who worked together very closely. It was good timing to have the inflector test go well more-or-less simultaneously with the storage ring."" The inflector magnet, which will sit within the circle of the storage ring, was designed by Frank Krienen of Boston University, one of E821's 14 collaborating institutions, and Wuzheng Meng, AGS. It was built in Japan, with Akira Yamamoto, of the Koh Energie Ken (KEK) Laboratory, as project manager. ""Bringing beam to the ring was another good moment,"" recalled Bunce. ""Hugh Brown [AGS] designed the optics and Charlie Pearson [AGS] led the construction effort. After so much preparation, it is all coming together."" For E821, the proton beam from the AGS will be directed onto a target to make pion particles. Pions decay into muons, which will be collected in the storage ring.  This past January, the storage ring magnet was turned on for the first time and worked well at half-field strength, but there was some movement in the coil at higher fields, preventing its reaching full magnetic field. So the team studied the coil. ""This was quite a sleuthing effort,"" Bunce remarked. ""At one point Sergey Redin [Yale University and Novosibirsk, Russia] showed us data we all immediately rejected. But his data were key to understanding the problem. Bill Morse [Physics] put the clues together, with models of the forces made by Chien Pai [AGS] and Francis Farley [Yale]. We even installed windows in the box that holds the coil to watch for movement. By the time we powered for the second time, in June, we were ready for another surprise. Fortunately, none came. We went to full field nervously, but uneventfully!"" The design of the magnet dates from a meeting convened by Vernon Hughes of Yale in 1984, at which researchers agreed that the expected intensity of the AGS beam was ideal for a new, ultraprecise measurement of muon magnetism. Gordon Danby and John Jackson, both AGS, designed the magnetic cir(continued on page 2)  Coming Up Ziping Chen, a physicist in the Physics Department, will present this year's Sambamurti Memorial Lecture, on Monday, July 29.

Every day at lunch, John Keane, an electrical engineer at the National Synchrotron Light Source, practices his bagpipe on the baseball field. Keane taps his toes and marches around while the eerie sound of the organ-like harmonies pours over the soaked grass. Keane plays in the ballpark for the acoustics -- it simulates the kind of places where competitions and performances are played, namely the outdoors. ""The neighbors also appreciate it,"" Keane jokes. Keane began playing the bagpipe over 25 years ago, after following a pipe band in the St. Patrick's Day Parade in New York City. ""I liked it. It felt good,"" said Keane. Keane plays with the Safron Kilt Irish Pipe Band in Babylon, which has 35 pipers, 15 drums and five color guards. On July 6, his band traveled to Kilkenny, Ireland, and competed in the All Ireland Bagpipe Championship. ""We played well,"" said Keane, even though the band didn't place very well in the competition. Over 70 pipe bands played in front of 10,000 spectators.  Keane's pipe band plays in at least ten competitions and 20 parades a year, as well as on other special occasions. In March, they play a minimum of eight St. Patrick's Day engagements. The band has also played at Radio City Music Hall and the White House. ""The bagpipe is a hard instrument to play,"" Keane stressed. ""You have to breathe and have fast fingers"" and march all at the same time. This instrument has four pipes and a Gor-Tex bag full of air. The bag acts as a reservoir of air, and only one of the four pipes is ""played."" The other three pipes are two tenors and a bass that harmonize with the main melody. The bagpipe evolved over 2,000 years ago in Greece from an instrument that looked like a pair of pipes held in the mouth, blown simultaneously, and played with each hand. The bagpipe's bag was invented to allow more air to be available with less work. The bagpipe has basically been the same for the last 600 years. Keane plays the bagpipe to relax and keep some of his heritage alive. ""I've had a whole bunch of fun times,"" Keane said. ""It's a good hobby."" -- Sarah Gilbert  John Keane plays his bagpipe at BNL's baseball field.  Roger Stoutenburgh  Muon g-2 Experiment  (cont'd.)  forces into the theoretical structure.

(To be continued on August 2.)   Brookhaven Bulletin  July 26, 1996  Letter to the Editor On the evening of July 15, I attended a presentation at the Lab on BNL's Reactors. Its purpose was to provide the general public and BNL employees with an opportunity to become more knowledgeable about the High Flux Beam Reactor and the Brookhaven Medical Research Reactor. Unfortunately, there were only about 30 attendees, the majority of whom were BNL employees. So many people missed a perfect opportunity to acquaint themselves with an area of BNL's scientific endeavors that are presently misunderstood by some of the general public. Of greater concern to me, however was an incident that occurred at the coffee break. A non-BNL attendee approached John Axe [Head of BNL's Center for Neutron Science] and implied that BNL was not telling the truth. The individual was quite distraught and not receptive to discussion. Later that evening, as I drove home, it saddened me to recall this incident. I envisioned this young man, probably with a young family, who has become convinced that the activity at BNL is a threat to his life and the lives of those he loves. As those of us who have given even the slightest attention to BNL's scientific activity and accomplishments know, nothing could be further from the truth. If anyone who works at BNL doubts this, please make it your responsibility to acquaint yourself sufficiently with the facts and draw your own conclusions. From some of the irresponsible reporting by some local media, I can understand why there are caring individuals in our neighboring communities who are alarmed -- and BNLers should feel alarm regarding the public's attitude toward BNL. Everyone working at BNL should recognize that each of us has the potential of relating an image of BNL to our friends and associates outside the Lab, so we have an obligation to be certain that our projections to the public are accurate. One way to do this to attend presentations when the Laboratory offers them. Another way is to take one of the Sunday tours the Lab is offering this summer -- and encourage a neighboring family, unfamiliar with BNL, to accompany you. If we all give some of our time to become better informed and, subsequently, use this enhanced knowledge in our normal interactions with the community around us, we could significantly complement the efforts of our colleagues who are working hard to correct the misinformation that exists. Employees know that BNL is a special community. And if we take the extra effort to help our neighbors understand the Lab as we do, then BNL will be an even more pleasant place to work. -- John Dabrowski Dabrowski, a computer analyst in the National Synchrotron Light Source Department, has been at the Lab for over 35 years. i  American Nuclear Society Awards HFBR's Excellence On the balcony overlooking the experimental floor of the High Flux Beam Reactor ( HFBR), Robert McNair, Program Development Group Leader for the Reactor Division (left), and David Rorer, Head of the Reactor Division, display the American Nuclear Society's (ANS) award for ""Excellence in Nuclear Operations"" presented to the HFBR. The HFBR competed against power reactors and other research reactors for the honor, which commends performance for nuclear operations in 1995. McNair, who initially suggested that the Reactor Division apply for the award, accepted it on behalf of the HFBR at the ANS annual meeting in Reno, Nevada, this June. Rorer commented, ""It is not a trivial task to keep the reactor running since almost any deviation from normal will shut the machine down for safety's sake. It was not just a matter of luck that the Reactor Division was able to achieve such an outstanding operating record: It was the result of everyone in the division's paying careful attention to detail while performing their job.'' The 30-megawatt HFBR is about 100 times smaller than the typical power reactor. About 250 researchers from all over the world perform experiments at the reactor each year in physics, chemistry, materials science, medicine and biology. -- Diane Greenberg  Site Security Increased In light of recent events worldwide, Brookhaven, like many other federal installations, has instituted some changes in security. While some of these may be obvious to BNL employees, others will not be. But all are intended to ensure the continued safety of employees and visitors to the Laboratory. ""Our protection of security-interest areas has always been good, and security has not been breached,"" said Russel Reaver, Manager of the Safeguards & Security Division. ""But, unfortunately, we and the rest of the world are going through times that call for us to be even more sensitive to security issues. So the Laboratory is reacting appropriately, and we appreciate everyone's cooperation.""

People have increased the use of air, water, and other natural resources by a factor of 10 in the last 200 years. This activity has in turn affected the atmosphere, the water cycle, and the climate, and has altered ecological systems. Scientists have begun to monitor these effects both from the ground and from space, to identify problems, as well as to predict the future health of the planet.   Earth is surrounded by a delicate envelope of air, part and product of life on the planet. Human beings have changed the composition of this atmosphere. Tons of carbon dioxide and methane, among other compounds, are added annually to the atmosphere from the burning of fossil fuels. These and other chemical pollutants raise concerns about the effects a changing atmosphere may have on life.   Most life on Earth owes its existence, directly or indirectly, to photosynthesis, the ""greening"" process by which plants convert sunlight, carbon dioxide, and soil nutrients to energy. Green plants cover much of Earth's land area, and microscopic plants known as phytoplankton inhabit its waters. More than 35 percent of the planet's surface is used, at least indirectly, for harvesting food and other materials.   Grazing, agriculture, and timber harvesting disturb topsoil, increasing soil erosion. More than 75 million tons of soil are blown or washed into the oceans each year. Natural ecosystems shrink in the face of society's need to use land. Fragmentation of many ecosystems has created a series of ecological ""islands."" Some species, unable to survive in such reduced areas, become extinct.   Life requires water. On land, the amount and frequency of rainfall determine the success of crops, as well as the survival of natural ecosystems. It takes about 10 days, on average, for a drop of water that becomes airborne vapor in one place to return to Earth's surface as rain or snow in another. Precipitation varies by both season and geographic area. As one result, highly specialized ecosystems have developed, from deserts to rain forests.   In the event of global warming, regional rainfall patterns may shift. Similarly, the removal of forest cover may alter rainfall distribution because of reduced evaporation of water from plants. Changes in patterns of precipitation could have dramatic effects, positive or negative, on all life on Earth.   Throughout most of the Earth's history, Earth's systems have functioned unmonitored, but not unrecorded. Climate records can be found in the types of pollen in lake-bottom sediments; in the patterns of tree-ring growth; in air bubbles frozen in glaciers; in the growth rings of coral; and in many other places.   These records indicate that significant environmental changes have occurred throughout Earth's history. Even moderate changes in global temperature can freeze or melt significant amounts of fresh water, building or shrinking glaciers and the polar ice caps. This affects sea levels.   Inasmuch as 50 percent of the world's people live within 50 kilometers of the sea, the effects of even a moderate rise in sea levels, on the order of a meter or less, would be significant. This is one reason why understanding past climate changes, and their effects on plant and animal life, is crucial. Studies of past climates, then, can help determine what processes may have caused changes, giving us some clues as to which human activities might induce similar changes.   The environments surrounding marshes, dunes, and reefs can be unbalanced by many human activities such as fishing, building, highway construction, and the use of chemical fertilizers. Ecosystems weakened by such activity may not withstand major storms. Although occupying just 8 percent of the Earth's surface, these coastal environments produce 90 percent of the world's seafood.   Global environmental change concerns us all. Scientists are using instruments borne on satellites to gain new perspectives on previously unknown linkages between the Earth's land, air, and water. Monitoring, however, can only show that changes are taking place. Halting or reversing changes, if necessary, will test the will and the ingenuity of humankind.

GX073-92-9950468	"Jay Coogan Frisoli Youth Center Title:  Stop-Action-Frieze Date:   1998  Materials:   Powder coated aluminum  Dimensions:   22 figures, each 3 ft. high Location:  Frisoli Youth Center   Even the title of Jay Coogan's sculptural installation suggests movement and rhythm. Full of dynamic motion, Coogan's band of exuberant figures enlivens the Frisoli Youth Center.  Stop-Action-Frieze  is a play on words, since it also refers to the style of the piece. A ""frieze"" is a band of decoration along a wall.   What do the figures tell you about the activities that take place at the Youth Center? Can you find examples of how the piece challenges conventional stereotypes?   How do you think the artist created such a joyful sense of energy? Rhythm is born out of movement. How do you think Coogan's piece would sound? Snap your fingers or clap your hands to create a beat inspired by the figures in the piece.   Color contributes to the overall feeling. If the figures were black or grey, how would the piece feel?   The figures have been captured in mid-action. What do you think would happen if the figures ""un-froze""?     What you will need:  Sidewalk chalk.   Lie down on the pavement adjacent to the Youth Center. Assume a dynamic (although flat) pose. Have a friend trace your body with the chalk. See how many different shapes you can create with your body. Now trace your friend's body. When you have finished, look at your drawings. Do they remind you of Coogan's artwork?    What you will need:  20 -25 index cards, metal clips, pens or pencils. Coogan's piece is action-packed, with figures busily engaged in playing a game. Use one of Coogan's game players as the basis for a flipbook. Pick your favorite figure and draw it on one index card. On the next index card, slightly adjust your figure's pose. Trace from the first card by placing the second card on top it and hold the pair up to a window. As you trace, move the figure's leg or arm just a tiny bit, no more than an eighth of an inch. Make 20 more sketches in the same way, changing your character's position bit by bit. Clip the stack of cards. Flip the cards from back to front. The figure will come to life! If the movement seems jerky, add drawings that make the changes more gradual.     Make other books, experimenting with different materials and shapes.    What you will need:  Energy and imagination.   Transform yourself into a work of art by playing ""Stop-Action-Freize,"" a fun spin on charades. You'll need at least two more people to play. Decide who will go first. That person chooses a favorite activity or an activity from Coogan's piece. He or she then silently acts out their activity (like in charades).     When someone thinks they know the activity, they yell, ""Freeze!"" The performer must halt in mid-motion - becoming a living frieze figure! The ""guesser"" must say what he or she thinks the performer is doing. If the guesser is correct, then it is that person's turn. If not, the performer resumes the activity until someone gets it right. Play until everyone has a turn.     Keep the game going. Ask one of your friends to assume the ""freeze"" pose that you liked best. Now sketch your friend or model them in clay. Or make an abstract sculpture inspired by the pose out of found objects, cardboard, etc. Turn the game into a life-study art project!"

See Exemption to Prohibition on Circumvention of Copyright Protection Systems for Access Control Technologies, Fed. Reg. Volume 67, Number 199, Page 63578-63582 (2002). We also respond here to certain comments received in the first round of this proceeding. The companies submitting joint comments all manufacture Internet filtering software. Simply defined, Internet filtering software is software that is designed to enable organizations or individuals to block access to specific types of web content, which may be deemed inappropriate for a user or group of users.

The reason for this is very simple: the filtering software companies were unaware of the proceedings, and had no idea that important copyright protections extended to other software companies were in jeopardy for filtering software. It is unfortunate that the Copyright Office was not presented with all the facts regarding the accessibility of Internet filtering software databases. A number of the comments submitted in favor of the filtering software exemption contained serious inaccuracies and misrepresentations of filtering software databases that went unrefuted. As the Copyright Office is now reconsidering the exemption for filtering software databases, the filtering software industry is pleased to offer a response to those commenters who are seeking a renewal of the filtering software exemption. The widespread availablitlity of filtering software today imparts considerable public benefits, not just in the United States but around the world. Most importantly, filtering software protects millions of children from the damaging and salacious content available on the Internet. Additionally, filtering helps companies and government agencies to protect their employees from liability, as well as conserve valuable bandwidth and enhance productivity. The circumvention of copyright protection for filtering software databases conveys no such discernable public benefits. Rather, such circumventions have in the past, and will in the future, cause harm to the filtering industry, and the ability of parents, schools, and libraries to protect children. For these reasons, the request for exemption should be denied.  5    Summary of Argument in Opposition to the Proposed Exemption This comment will demonstrate that circumvention of filtering software should not be permitted because it will adversely affect the filtering industry that is essential for the growth and promotion of the Internet. If filtering companies cannot control access to their databases, it will be difficult for filtering companies to profit from their databases. Fewer filtering databases will be available for use, and parents will be robbed of vital tools for protecting their children. Moreover, circumvention is not necessary for any reasoned analysis of filtering software because of existing methods that do not involve circumvention. Courts have drawn conclusions of fact and of law related to filters, government commissions have evaluated filters and issued findings, and journalists have investigated filters without research derived from the circumvention of copyright protection measures. In contrast, research derived from the decryption of filtering software has played no meaningful role in court cases, journalism, legislation, independent laboratory research, or other examinations by government bodies. Thus, commenters will demonstrate that exempting filtering software from the prohibition on circumvention of technological measures would damage both the public and the filtering industry with no corresponding benefit to any element of society.  6    About Filtering Databases Simply defined, Internet filtering software is software that is designed to enable organizations or individuals to block access to specific types of web content, which may be deemed inappropriate for a user or group of users. There are multiple ways to accomplish content filtering, such as blocking web pages based on the appearance of certain words and phrases, or allowing access only to a ""white list"" of approved sites. Of interest to the Copyright Office are those filtering products that use databases of URLs. A filtering database, in its most simple form, consists of a file of records. Each record or entry in the database contains two fields or elements: a field containing a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) of a web page or an Internet Protocol (IP) address and a field containing one or more subject categorizations. Below are some sample entries from a filtering database: URL Field www.playboy.com 209.247.228.201 news.yahoo.com sports.yahoo.com Category Field Nudity, Pornography Nudity, Pornography News Sports  In testimony given before the U.S. Congress, Chris Ophus, president of the filtering company FamilyConnect, described how filtering databases are created: URL Filtering This is the most common, and most effective form of filtering, and involves the filtering of a site based on its URL (i.e. its address). It provides more fine-grained control than packet filtering, since a URL can specify a particular page within a large site, rather than specifying the IP address of the computer that hosts the Content. S4F Technologies adds an average of 5,000  7,000 new URL's to its database each week. Computer spiders scour the Internet using a sophisticated search mechanism that collects potential sites for human review. Spidering computers run programs that systematically read through the World Wide Web and collect URL's (Uniform Resource Locators) that match a particular set of criteria established [by] a filtering department. These computer [programs] can run 24 hours a day and collect potential candidates to be added to the database. However, spiders are not perfect, and using spiders alone as the mechanism for fortifying a blocked site database would result in overblocking. That is why human review must be used when accurately building a blocked database. During the human review process, using custom browsers, sites can be positively identified and properly added to the database. As soon as a site is added, it is active in the blocked list for all to use. If a site is inadvertently blocked, it is reviewed and a decision is made within 24 at the most. If the site contains Child Pornography it is automatically forwarded to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.  7    One of the challenges facing filtering departments is managing the constant change of the Internet. When a website is reviewed, it may not contain obscene material, but at some later point, the author of the website may change the content that now would be considered inappropriate. Conversely, a site with content that may have at one time been considered pornographic or illegal could change and be perfectly acceptable. So, in addition to keeping up new sites that come online daily, filtering departments must constantly review those sites that are already categorized. Considering the ongoing task of Internet content data management, coupled with the constant change in the Internet snapshot, filtering companies do an amazing job of keeping up.5  Filtering companies do not attempt to hide the structure of their databases, or the criteria they use to create them. Rather, filtering companies usually consider the structure of their databases to be an important marketing tool. 8e6 Technologies provides a 4-page document describing the company's 38-category database. 6 FamilyConnect contains a 2 page document describing the company's 15-category database. 7 N2H2 provides a 7 page document describing the company's 42-category database. 8 Secure Computing provides a 9-page document describing the company's 30-category database. 9 SurfControl provides a 6-page document describing the company's 130-category database. 10 Websense provides an 8-page document describing the company's 80 category database. 11 Categories are typically safety and liability related, such as ""Pornography"", ""Gambling,"" and ""Hacking;"" or productivity and appropriate use related, such as ""Sports,"" ""Entertainment,"" and ""Shopping."" Most filtering software databases are delivered by software that offers a high degree of flexibility, allowing organizations to select one or more of dozens of categories for blocking, monitoring, or warning. An example is the SmartFilter program, which offers ""30 individual categories of Web sites"" with the ability to ""Deny, allow, coach (warn, but allow), delay, or report only.""12 A screen shot of the administrative interface that allows this functionality is shown below:  8    The Social Benefits of Filtering Software Driving the rapid growth of the filtering industry are the social benefits that result from the use of filtering software in homes, schools, and organizations. Congress recognized the benefits of promoting a vigorous filtering industry in 1996 when it enacted ""Good Samaritan"" immunity from ""private blocking and screening of offensive material"" in the Telecommunications Act of 1996. The text of act states: `( b) POLICY- It is the policy of the United States- `(1) to promote the continued development of the Internet and other interactive computer services and other interactive media; `(2) to preserve the vibrant and competitive free market that presently exists for the Internet and other interactive computer services, unfettered by Federal or State regulation; `(3) to encourage the development of technologies which maximize user control over what information is received by individuals, families, and schools who use the Internet and other interactive computer services; `(4) to remove disincentives for the development and utilization of blocking and filtering technologies that empower parents to restrict their children's access to objectionable or inappropriate online material 13  The industry analyst Frost & Sullivan in 2001 identified six market drivers of the filtering industry. It is not coincidental that these market drivers are heavily related to social benefits:14       Key drivers for the U.S. content filtering market are: Lack of Internet Regulation Limit Legal Liability Prevention of Exposure of Adult Material to Children Legislative Action Preservation of Corporate Bandwidth Increase Employee Productivity  As the Frost & Sullivan report points out, ""lack of Internet regulation"" and the desire for the ""prevention of exposure of adult material to children"" are the most obvious social benefits of filtering software. The threat posed to children by Internet pornography and other Internet dangers is not imaginary. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, 70% of teens have accidentally stumbled across pornography online. 15 These accidental exposures occur because, among other reasons, the Internet if full of misleading pornography websites that lure children. The research firm Cyveillance documented over 19,000 examples of pornographers disguising their sites with common brand names, including Disney, Barbie, ESPN, etc., which can entrap children. 16 The harm done to children by these exposures was documented in a report by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, which found that of children accidentally exposed to online pornography, ""23% were very or extremely upset by the exposure."" 17  9    These disturbing statistics have led to the widespread adoption of filters in homes and schools, and surveys show that educators, parents, and the teenagers themselves all strongly support the use of filters. According to the Digital Media Forum, ""92% of all Americans said pornography should be blocked on school computers.""18 A survey by the Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development found that ""90% of educators surveyed favored the installation of blocking software on school computers to prevent student access to potentially inappropriate or offensive Web sites.""19 Finally, the Kaiser Family Foundation found that ""63% of 15-to 17- year olds say they favor the use of filters in their schools."" 20 Beyond protecting children, the social benefits of filtering software extend to the workplace as well. As the Frost & Sullivan report shows, the desire for organizations to ""limit legal liability,"" ""increase employee productivity,"" and the ""preservation of corporate bandwidth"" are all desired social benefits that drive the adoption of filtering software. 21 Again, research documents the problem. According to the Center for Internet Studies, more than 60% of companies have disciplined  and more than 30% have terminated  employees for inappropriate use of the Internet. 22 According to the American Management Association, 27% of Fortune 500 companies have battled sexual harassment claims stemming from employee misuse and abuse of corporate e-mail and Internet systems. 23  10    The Evolution of Filtering Industry Markets Internet filtering software appeared in 1995 after a series of articles, including a cover story in Time Magazine 24 documented the widespread availability of Internet pornography, and in particular the danger posed to children with Internet access. During the summer of 1995, a filtering software industry appeared with the release of products designed for parents such as CyberSitter 25 , Cyber Patrol26 , and SurfWatch27 . The new filtering industry received a significant boost in 1997, when the United States Supreme Court struck down the Communications Decency Act (CDA) as unconstitutional. The CDA required Internet sites to block ""indecent"" material, and the Court pointed to filtering software as a less restrictive means for controlling access to pornography on the Internet. 28 The years since that 1997 decision have led to steady growth in the use of software filters. According to the latest research, in the year 2001, 74% of public schools 29 , 43% of public libraries 30 , 40% of major U.S. corporations 31 , and 41% of Internet-enabled homes with children32 have adopted filtering software. The adoption of filtering software in the U.S. has followed a similar pattern in businesses, schools, homes, and libraries. Industry analysts predict that the global filtering market, valued at $270 million in 2002, will grow to $729 million by 2006 33 Schools The most dramatic growth has occurred in public schools. In May 1998, Quality Education Data surveyed school districts with Internet access and found that for the 1998 school year, 19% of schools were using filters. 34 Just one year later, QED found that the use of filters had increased to 52.5%. 35 The most recent data on school filter use comes from a May 2001 study by the National Center for Education Studies, which found 74% of public schools are now using filtering software. 36 Use of Filtering in U.S. Public Schools Sources: QED, National Cen. for Ed.

There are three reasons for this; filtering databases are considered proprietary, filtering companies want to protect their investment, and filtering companies want to protect children. Filtering databases are considered proprietary. Filtering databases are, like many other databases, considered proprietary because of the original content and arrangement created for the databases. The Copyright Office acknowledged that databases are entitled to copyright protection under the DMCA in the 2000 Exemption to Prohibition on Circumvention of Copyright Protection Systems for Access Control Technologies, when the Copyright Office rejected arguments to grant an exemption to circumvent the copyright protection measures for ""thin copyright"" databases : Most often this argument is made in the context of databases that contain a significant amount of uncopyrightable material. These databases may nonetheless be covered by copyright protection by virtue of the selection, coordination and arrangement of the materials. They may also incorporate copyrightable works or elements, such as a search engine, headnotes, explanatory texts or other contributions that represent original, creative authorship.45  Filtering databases, consisting of uncopyrightable material (publicly available URLs), selected and arranged with copyrightable material (subject classification schemes), fit neatly into the ""thin copyright"" category. The practice of not allowing full access to the entire database has long been standard among many database providers. Like filtering database companies, other large vendors of databases and search engines also recognize the economic necessity of copyright controls, and forbid access except through query interfaces. The ""General Terms and Conditions for use of the LexisNexis Services"" forbids use of the database other than through the querying interface: ... you are prohibited from downloading, storing, reproducing, transmitting, displaying, copying, distributing, or using Materials retrieved from the Online Services. You may not print or download Materials without using the printing or downloading commands of the Online Services.46  The license agreement for large database vendor Dialog is even more explicit in forbidding circumventions: Subscriber will not modify, adapt, translate, reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble or otherwise attempt to discover the source code of the Profound Software used to access the Profound Service via the internet.47  Filtering companies want to protect their investments As is clear from the labor-intensive process described by Mr. Ophus in the section on page 7, ""About Filtering Databases"", the compilation of filter databases is extraordinarily expensive and labor intensive. The databases of the larger filtering companies contain  13    millions of entries. N2H2's database contains four million entries 48 , SurfControl's database contains 5 million entries 49 , and 8e6's database contains 2.8 million entries. Websense estimates they have invested ""40 man-years of classification""51 to build a database of 4 million entries. 52  50  In addition to the enormous labor costs, there are considerable requirements to create the technology infrastructure required to create and maintain such databases. The total ""ramp up"" cost of creating a top-quality filtering database of millions of entries is in the tens of millions of dollars. If such databases were published, the loss would be enormous. A start-up ""parasite company"" could steal this valuable data, and immediately launch its own filtering product without having to spend these ""ramp up"" costs. These ""parasite companies"" would be at a huge economic advantage, as they would not incur the staggering costs of database creation. One measure of the value filtering companies place on their databases is the direct correlation between filtering database size and the use of copyright protection measures. All of the filtering companies that use URL databases employ copyright protection to protect their databases from economic parasitism, with the exception of Net Nanny, which publishes its database 53 . All of these same filtering companies have databases with hundreds of thousands or millions of entries, with the exception of Net Nanny, which has a database of just 2,000 websites. 54 With a database so small -- less than 1% of the size of the databases used by Websense, Surfcontrol, N2H2, and 8e6 Technologies, it is clear that Net Nanny has little intellectual property to protect. It is not surprising that Net Nanny recently declared bankruptcy. 55 Another indication of how valued filtering databases are is the fact that many of the filtering companies build marketing campaigns around the quality of their databases, and the studies which show a filtering company's database to be superior to others are highly prized as marketing tools. In 2002, Websense launched a ""Why Quality Matters"" marketing campaign based on a study by eTesting Labs that found the Websense database superior to several competitors. 56 N2H2 has issued two press releases based on favorable study results, including a test by eTesting Labs 57 and another test by the Kaiser Family Foundation. 58 At this writing, the nation's two largest Internet service providers, American Online (AOL) and the Microsoft Network (MSN), are engaged in a fierce competition for home Internet subscribers. Each is spending millions of dollars on television ad campaigns that focus on the filtering databases used in the companies' parental controls. From a November 12, 2002 story in The Washington Post: America Online and Microsoft understand, too, which is why the giant Internet service providers are locked in a battle to attract parents concerned about online security. In recent weeks, each has started hawking new sets of parental controls -- AOL 8 and MSN 8, respectively -- to ease the minds of parents who want their children to have access to the infinite world of the Internet but not its infinite dangers. Of 59 course, each company is hoping to win subscribers in the process.  14    Again, in the 2000 Exemption to Prohibition on Circumvention of Copyright Protection Systems for Access Control Technologies, the Copyright Office recognized this basic economic fact, and acknowledged the potential devastation to database publishers, when the Copyright Office refused to grant an exemption for ""thin copyright"" databases: Access controls provide an increased incentive for database producers to create and maintain databases. Often, the most valuable commodity of a database producer is access to the database itself. If a database producer could not control access, it would be difficult to profit from exploitation of the database. Fewer databases would be created, resulting in diminished availability for use.60  Filtering companies want to protect children Lastly, there is a huge potential for damage to children by the publication of filtering databases. A child with access to a filtering database would have ready access to a huge list of pornographic and other harmful websites. This situation is not hypothetical. Net Nanny, the lone filtering company that publishes its database, suffered a disastrous marketing experience that needlessly exposed countless children to pornography as a result of publishing its database. From a June 22, 2000 news story published in The London Telegraph: BURGER KING has been forced to withdraw a CD-Rom given away with children's meals this week after complaints that the disc contained internet addresses for more than 2,000 pornographic websites. The restaurant chain, which has 630 stores in the UK, acted after customers complained that their children could have easily accessed the addresses, which include sex-related internet discussion groups and hardcore pornographic websites. More than one million CDs had been given away before the promotion was pulled on Monday, according to Burger King. Anyone purchasing a children's meal since the offer began more than two weeks ago would have received a CD supplied to Burger King by the internet service provider  , which offers secure internet usage for children. The CD includes software called Net Nanny, designed to provide parents with a filtering mechanism to block certain websites. Unfortunately, once installed from the CD, it only takes a couple of mouse clicks to view the global list of pornographic web addresses.61  The filtering companies that employ copyright protection for their databases have much larger lists of pornographic websites. Surfcontrol's database has ""more than 600,000 containing sexually explicit content.""62 Were such a list to be made readily available to children, the damage to children could be significant. The violation of copyright protection for filtering databases involves not simply the loss of intellectual property and the diminished availability of a valuable resource, but the safety of children around the world. Therefore, the reasons for refusing an exemption to filtering databases are even more compelling than they are for databases such as LexisNexis and Silver Platter, which the Copyright Office has denied requests for exemption to allow the circumvention of copyright protection measures.  15    Filtering Companies Provide Free Access to their Databases Through Querying Interfaces and Trial Copies Because of the compelling social and economic reasons described above, filtering companies do not provide unlimited public access to their databases. However, this has not prevented researchers from evaluating and criticizing filtering databases. Nearly all filtering companies allow anyone to download a trial copy of the filtering software and accompanying database for a 30-day evaluation. 63 In most cases, a trial version of a filtering product allows full access to the software's functionality, and allows the user to test if specific websites or groups of websites are categorized by the filtering database. In most filtering software programs, a user attempts to access a website. If the website is blocked, the software returns a message stating the URL of the blocked website, and the category that caused the website to be blocked. The example below is from the Websense program:  Using this method, a user can assemble a sample of URLs, test them, and record the results. A researcher with basic knowledge of any one of a number of ""scripting languages"" can configure the software to test a file of website and automatically record the results, thus making the testing of large numbers of URLs relatively easy. Research and evaluation methods that rely on trial copies of filtering software do require that researchers have the necessary hardware, software, and computer knowledge to download, install, and configure the software. Recognizing that these requirements are an inconvenience to those who wish to learn about and evaluate filtering databases, a number of filtering companies have taken the step of providing a free, publicly available query interface to their databases. These websites are offered for free on publicly available websites, and allow anyone, anywhere to look up any site, see how it is categorized, and request a ""re-review"" if they disagree with the categorization.  16    The Websense Site Lookup Tool, available at  http://www.websense.com/sitelookup/sitelookup.cfm  Users may lookup the categorization of any website, and submit a request for re-review.   SmartFilterWhere, available at www.smartfilterwhere.com  Users may lookup the categorization of any website, and submit a request for re-review.   17    Surfcontrol Test-a-Site, available at http://mtas.surfcontrol.com/mtas/MTAS.asp  Users may lookup the categorization of any website, and submit a request for re-review.   N2H2 URLChecker, available at http://database.n2h2.com  Users may lookup the categorization of any website, and submit a request for re-review.   18    Querying is a Well-Established Scientific Method for Evaluating Databases Information science establishes a number of measures for evaluating databases. Bert R. Boyce's standard 1994 information science textbook, Measurement in Information Science lists a number of database measures, such as scope, attributes, selection of entities, magnitude, timeliness, selectivity, reliability, etc. 64 Of concern here is the measurement of database retrieval outcomes. Boyce defines a number of formal measures for retrieval outcome, including relevance, precision, and recall. 65 Boyce then states that ""Measures of outcome have traditionally been measures of the relationship between queries or information need statements and retrieved records.""66 These methods and measures can and have been applied to databases that are not published in their entirety and are only accessible through a query interface. The professional literature of the information science field has a long, rich history of the publication of peer-reviewed research that involves the querying of copyright-protected databases, such as Lexis/Nexis and Dialog. The examples of such published research are far too many to list for this submission, so only a sampling of such research is provided here. The fact that the databases being evaluated in these studies are, like filtering databases, not accessible in their entirety and are only available through query interfaces does not prevent researchers from using queries to measure their accuracy, including formal information science measures such as relevance, precision, and recall. A 1998 publication in the journal Information Processing & Management employed querying of the copyright-protected database Lexis/Nexis, and: Compares results of traditional Boolean searching with those of Freestyle, LEXIS/NEXIS's natural language application. Study found that though the Boolean searches had better results more often, neither method demonstrated superior performance for every query, suggesting that different queries demand different techniques.67  1991 master's research published at Kent State University employed querying to evaluate the copyright-protected databases Lexis/Nexis and Westlaw: This paper compares strengths and weaknesses of the Lexis and Westlaw computer assisted legal research systems. Their powerful full text document delivery capabilities are contrasted with their inherent limitations as information retrieval systems. The objective here is to alert users to the complexities of online legal searching and the necessity for evaluating these systems critically. Sample searches highlight the major differences between Westlaw's and Lexis's searching protocols.68  A 2001 article in the Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology employed querying of the copyright-protected database Dialog, and: Examines the distribution of bibliographic records in online bibliographic databases using 14 different search topics on DIALOG. Discusses the presence of duplicate records and problems with lexical ambiguity, and concludes that the number of databases needed for searches with varying complexities of search strategies is much more topic dependent than previous studies indicated.69  19    A 1995 article in the journal Online employed querying to evaluate the copyright protected databases Lexis/Nexis and Westlaw: Compares two natural language processing search engines, WIN (WESTLAW Is Natural) and FREESTYLE, developed by LEXIS. Legal issues in natural language queries were presented to identical libraries in both systems. Results showed that the editorials enhanced relevance; a search would be more thorough using both databases; and if only one system were to be used, WESTLAW provides more relative documents.70  A 1992 paper submitted at the Proceedings of the ASIS Annual Meeting employed querying to evaluate the copyright-protected databases Lexis/Nexis and Westlaw: Discusses a study in progress that is analyzing retrieval failures in two full-text computer assisted legal research (CALR) systems, LEXIS and WESTLAW. Computer searching by experts is compared with manual searching by experts, examples are given, and a taxonomy of causes of retrieval failure is discussed.71  Querying methodology has also been extended to newer databases, such as search engines. In this 2002 publication in the Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, querying is used to evaluate Google: Compares search effectiveness when using query-based Internet search via the Google search engine, directory-based search via Yahoo, and phrase-based query reformulation assisted search via the Hyperindex browser by means of a controlled, user-based experimental study of undergraduates at the University of Queensland. Discusses cognitive load, relevance, and search time.72  Filtering databases, being available for searching through query interfaces, fit neatly into a category of databases that can be evaluated using querying methodologies.  20    Numerous Laboratory Studies of Filter Databases have Used Querying There is rich literature dating back to 1995 of laboratory tests of filters using querying methodologies. Among the publications conducting query-based tests have been Consumer Reports and JAMA . Many of the tests conclude that filters are effective, but others are critical. What the aggregate of these tests show is that filtering databases can be successfully evaluated using querying. Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) Test Most recently, the Kaiser Family Foundation conducted a sophisticated test using a querying methodology that was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. One member of the research team that designed the study was a professor at the information school of the University of Michigan, Dr. Paul J. Resnick. The abstract of the study is worth reviewing: Context The Internet has become an important tool for finding health information, especially among adolescents. Many computers have software designed to block access to Internet pornography. Because pornography-blocking software cannot perfectly discriminate between pornographic and nonpornographic Web sites, such products may block access to health information sites, particularly those related to sexuality. Objective To quantify the extent to which pornography-blocking software used in schools and libraries limits access to health information Web sites. Design and Setting In a simulation of adolescent Internet searching, we compiled search results from 24 health information searches (n = 3206) and 6 pornography searches (n = 781). We then classified the content of each site as either health information (n = 2467), pornography (n = 516), or other (n = 1004). We also compiled a list of top teen health information sites (n = 586). We then tested 6 blocking products commonly used in schools and libraries and 1 blocking product used on home computers, each at 2 or 3 levels of blocking restrictiveness. Main Outcome Measure Rates of health information and pornography blocking. Results At the least restrictive blocking setting, configured to block only pornography, the products blocked a mean of only 1.4% of health information sites. The differences between blocking products was small (range, 0.6%-2.3%). However, about 10% of health sites found using some search terms related to sexuality ( eg, safe sex, condoms) and homosexuality ( eg, gay) were blocked. The mean pornography blocking rate was 87% (range, 84%-90%). At moderate settings, the mean blocking rate was 5% for health information and 90% for pornography. At the most restrictive settings, health information blocking increased substantially (24%), but pornography blocking was only slightly higher (91%). Conclusions Blocking settings have a greater impact than choice of blocking product on frequency of health information blocking. At their least restrictive settings, overblocking of general health information poses a relatively minor impediment. However, searches on some terms related to sexuality led to substantially more health information blocking. More restrictive blocking configurations blocked pornography only slightly more, but substantially increased blocking of health information sites.73  21    Consumer Reports Tests In May 1997, Consumer Reports, using querying methods, tested four home filters, CyberSitter, Net Nanny, SurfWatch, and Cyber Patrol. Consumer Reports recommended none of the filters, and concluded: We set each to maximum protection, then noted its ease of use and effectiveness in keeping us from viewing 22 easy-to-find web sites we had judged inappropriate for children...None is 74 totally effective.  In March 2001, Consumer Reports, again using querying methods, issued a second evaluation of filtering software. Consumer Reports evaluated AOL Parental Controls, Cyber Patrol, Cyber Sitter, Cyber Snoop, Internet Guard Dog, Net Nanny, and Norton Internet Security 2001. Consumer Reports concluded: Filtering software is not a substitute for parental supervision. Most of the products we tested failed to block one objectionable site in five. 75  ZDNet Lab Tests for PC Magazine PC magazine is probably the best known, and among the most highly regarded sources of software testing. Since 1982, PC Magazine has published thousands of software tests. PC Magazine's test laboratory, ZDNet Labs, is described as performing ""Comprehensive performance and functionality testing. Our objective, precise, and repeatable testing methods--utilizing benchmarks accepted by the industry.""76 PC Magazine has conducted more formal testing of filters than any other publication. The testing laboratories employed by PC Magazine conducted eight rounds of testing multiple filters from 1995 to 2001. Several of these tests clearly describe the use of querying methods. In March of 1998, PC Magazine had ZDNet Labs test filtering software blocking effectiveness. Ten products were tested: Cyber Patrol, Cyber Sentinel, Cyber Snoop, Cyber Sitter 97, Net Nanny, SurfWatch,Time's Up!, WatchDog, WebChaperone, and XStop. PC Magazine provided a summary: Our tests involved trying to access extensive lists of URLs, words, and phrases while using each of the products. We tried to access well-known pornography sites as well as less obviously objectionable sites, some of which made no reference to sex...Our testing confirms that these packages principally block sites with pornography, obscenity, and sexually explicit content--and they do a pretty good job.77  In May 1999, PC Magazine tested filters, this time with an emphasis on business products, testing Cyber Patrol, Little Brother Pro, SmartFilter, and Websense. In this test, ZDNet Labs used a querying method and ""created a list of 100 URLs in nine categories and then tried to browse them through these products,"" and concluded: The software packages in this roundup have matured as the demand for them has increased--and in more ways than the addition of productivity categories... All in all, these products delivered as advertised, though some do so with more panache than others.78  Another PC Magazine test occurred in the September 2001 issue. This was the most extensive test to date, involving twelve filters: AOL Parental Control, CyberSitter, CyberSnoop, Internet Guard Dog, Net Nanny, Norton Internet Security, IM Web  22    Inspector, Super Scout, Surfin Gate, 8e6, Iprism, and NetSpective. PC Magazine used a querying methodology and concluded: In testing, most products blocked more than 85 percent of objectionable content--good enough to make a serious dent in inappropriate Internet usage.79  Info World Test Center Tests for Info World Magazine Info World is one of the leading technology publications, and provides ""in-depth technical analysis on key products, solutions, and technologies for sound buying decisions and business gain.""80 Like PC Magazine, Info World conducts regular software testing through a professional testing laboratory, the InfoWorld Test Center: The InfoWorld Test Center differentiates itself by providing the most real-world approach to testing. Our tests, which are conducted by the most knowledgeable analysts in the industry, focus on products and solutions as they are used and exist in IT environments.81  From 1997 to 2000 the InfoWorld Test Center conducted four tests of filtering software blocking effectiveness. Two tests clearly describe the use of querying methods. In the August 1997 issue, InfoWorld tested WebSense, and found that, ""Every time I tried to access a blocked site, I was presented with my customized ""access denied"" message ."" 82 In February 1998, InfoWorld tested Cyber Sentinel, and concluded, ""Cyber Sentinel proved quite adept at flagging all of my attempts at accessing offensive material.""83 PC World Test Center Tests for PC World PC World is the world's largest computer magazine, with a readership of nearly 6.9 million. Like PC Magazine, PC World has conducted thousands of software tests through its testing laboratory, the PC World Test Center. PC World conducted two tests of filtering effectiveness in 1997 and in 2001. One test clearly describes the use of querying methods. In October 1997, PC World tested five home filters --SurfWatch, Cyber Patrol, CyberSitter, Net Nanny and Net Shepherd: Internet-blocking software is neither as easy to use nor as foolproof as parents and developers would like...Among the five programs we tested, two ( Cybersitter and SurfWatch 1.6) effectively filtered out all 10 of our bellwether adult-oriented pages."" 84  ZDNet Lab Test for Internet Magazine In December 1997, ZD Internet Magazine used the ZD Net testing labs to measure the effectiveness of eight filters: Bess, Cyber Patrol, CyberSitter,SafeSurf, SurfWatch, WebSense, X-Stop and Cyber Snoop. ZD Net Labs used a querying methodology and found the majority of them effective. Internet Magazine reported that SafeServer and CyberSnoop were less effective, but did find the majority of the products effective: During our tests, Bess performed well, blocking all the pornographic and objectionable sites on our test list. In our testing, Cyber Patrol performed fairly well, blocking access to most of the sites on our list. All the pornographic sites were blocked effectively. During our testing, CYBERsitter 97 blocked access to most of the pornographic sites on our testing list.  23    SurfWatch was the best performer on our site-blocking test, blocking access to all the pornographic sites we tested, as well as adequately blocking attempts to search for obscene words with Yahoo! and other search engines. In our tests, WebSENSE performed exceptionally well. In our site blocking tests, X-Shadow performed quite well, preventing access to almost all the pornographic sites, as well as preventing searches on obscene words.85  Network World Test Alliance Tests for Network World Another well-known technology publication, Network World, conducted a round of filter tests through its Network World Test Alliance network of testing labs. Network World frequently tests software, and is described as ""the premier source of objective, authoritative reviews in the network market.""86 Network World used a querying methodology and tested seven filters: LittleBrother Pro, WebSense, WizGuard, SOS, and NNPro. Network World found that ""All the products with predefined databases allow you to customize their lists, but we found that locating inappropriate sites the vendors didn't include was a challenge."" 87 Real-World Labs Test for Network Computing Network Computing is another leading technology publication that regularly tests software. As described on the company website, ""Network Computing performs hands on product reviews in our Real-World Labs co-located on the sites of two large universities, a Fortune 100 corporation, as well as bench-test facilities."" Real-World Labs, using a querying methodology, tested SurfControl Super Scout, Elron Internet Manager, Little Brother, SmartFilter, Iprism, WebSense, and N2H2: We installed and configured each product to monitor and block Web traffic on our production network. We then configured each product to block traffic to unproductive or ""improper"" sites while letting productive uses of Web, e-mail and FTP traffic go past...We visited a broad range of improper Web sites to evaluate each product's content policies and, if applicable, dynamic policy rules. Our test results showed that network administrators can choose from many effective content monitoring solutions capable of stifling the most adamant of browsers.88  eWeek Labs Test for eWeek Another popular technology publication is eWeek, which regularly tests software through the eWeek Labs. In the February 2001 issue, eWeek Labs tested the effectiveness of SmartFilter using a querying methodology, and concluded that, ""We were impressed with the quick response from SmartFilter when we tried to access Web sites that were in the ""Deny"" ACL. 89 IW Labs for Internet World Since 1995, Internet World has been one of the leading Internet technology publications, and regularly tests Internet software in IW Labs. In September 1996, Internet World usad a querying methodology and examined Intergo, Cyber Patrol, Net Nanny, Net Shepherd, Specs for Kids, CyberSitter, and Surfwatch:  24    To evaluate how well the current programs work, IW Labs rounded up every available commercial product and tested them under controlled laboratory conditions...While each of the products is sold for the explicit purpose of blocking objectionable material, only three (Cyber Patrol, InterGo , and Specs for Kids) are able to do that with reasonable certainty. Cyber Patrol Drugs Excellent Excellent Sex Excellent Excellent Violence Excellent Excellent Inter go Net Nanny Net Shep Specs for Kids Poor Fair Excellent Fair Fair Excellent Poor Fair Excellent Cyber sitter Fair Good Excellent Surf watch Good Poor Poor  Ratings reflect the success of each product in blocking three main categories of objectionable material based on 100 test sites using the package's most stringent level of controls. 90 ETesting Labs The U.S. Department of Justice commissioned eTesting Labs to compare the four leading institutional-grade Web content filtering applications for effectiveness at blocking 200 randomly selected URLs containing pornography. 91 The test was submitted at the trial, and published in April 2002. Another eTesting Labs test was conducted for Websense. eTesting Labs tested 6,600 URLs for both over blocking and under blocking. The results were published in March 2002. 92 Log File Analysis Yet another method of evaluating filters without circumventing copyright protection is log file analysis. Most filtering products generate log files during their use. A log file records all Internet access by users, including URL, time, date, and the IP address of the workstation. When an attempt to access a URL is blocked by the filters, the log file also records this. Analyzing log files offers the advantage that the sample is based on real use. Only a small number of filter log file studies have been done to date, and this is likely because there are significant technical hurdles to properly analyzing and processing large log files, which can often run to millions of entries. Two such studies were presented in the case ALA v. U.S., by Certus Consulting Group 93 and by Tacoma Public Library Central Library Manager David Biek 94  25    Courts have Evaluated Filter Databases Without Research Derived from Circumventing Copyright Protections To date, three trial courts have directly evaluated filtering software, and issued findings  of fact and of law based on those evaluations. Notably, not one of these courts has used  research derived from the circumvention of copyright protection to reach these  conclusions. Further, none of these courts has opined that the use of copyright protection  measures is in any way an impediment to reaching findings of fact and of law pertaining  to the use of filtering software.  ACLU v. Reno I  The first court to examine the effectiveness of filters was ACLU v. Reno 95 in 1996,  which involved the Communications Decency Act (CDA), an act that required Internet  sites to filter indecent speech. The Reno court heard testimony from the Ann Duvall, the  president of the Surfwatch filtering company96 , examined filters, and drew conclusions  about filter effectiveness as part of the court's justification for striking down the CDA:  73. Despite its limitations, currently available user-based software suggests that a reasonably effective method by which parents can prevent their children from accessing sexually explicit and other material which parents may believe is inappropriate for their children will soon be widely available."" 12 [Footnote 12:] Testimony adduced at the hearing suggests that market forces exist to limit the availability of material on-line that parents consider inappropriate for their children. Although the parties sharply dispute the efficacy of so-called ""parental empowerment"" software, there is a sufficiently wide zone of agreement on what is available to restrict access to unwanted sites that the parties were able to enter into twenty-one paragraphs of stipulated facts on the subject, which form the basis of paragraphs 49 through 69 of our Findings of fact. Because of the rapidity of developments in this field, some of the technological facts we have found may become partially obsolete by the time of publication of these Findings.97  Nowhere in the Reno I court's decision is there any suggestion that the use of copyright  protection circumvention of filtering databases posed any impediment to the court's  evaluation of filtering.  ACLU v. Reno II  The second court to examine the effectiveness of filters was ACLU v. Reno II in 1998. 98   ACLU v. Reno II is a still ongoing challenge to the constitutionality of the Children's  Online Protection Act (COPA), a successor to the CDA. Again, the trial court evaluated  the effectiveness of filtering software. Again, nowhere in the Reno II court's decision is  there any suggestion that the encryption of filtering databases posed any impediment to  the court's evaluation of filtering:  The plaintiffs suggest that an example of a more efficacious and less restrictive means to shield minors from harmful materials is to rely upon filtering and blocking technology.(6) Evidence was presented that blocking and filtering software is not perfect, in that it is possible that some appropriate sites for minors will be blocked while inappropriate sites may slip through the cracks. However, there was also evidence that such software blocks certain sources of content that COPA does not cover, such as foreign sites and content on other protocols. (Finding of Fact 66). The record before the Court reveals that blocking or filtering technology may be at least as successful as COPA would be in restricting minors' access to harmful material online without imposing the burden on constitutionally protected speech that COPA imposes on adult users or Web site operators. Such a factual conclusion is at least some evidence that COPA does not employ the least restrictive means.99  26    American Library Association v. U.S.  The third court to examine filter databases was ALA v. U.S.,100 which challenged  the constitutionality of the Children's Internet Protection Act (CIPA), a federal law  that requires schools and libraries that receive certain types of federal funding to  purchase filtering software.  The ALA court heard extensive testimony from a number of experts about the  effectiveness of filtering software. Six witnesses conducted and presented research  that evaluated filter effectiveness. Four of these witnesses used querying  methodologies, and two used log file analysis. Notably, none of the experts used  research methods that employed the circumvention of copyright protection to  examine filters.  Plaintiff witness Dr. Geoff Nunberg Dr. Nunberg used a querying method when he reviewed 250 to 300 sites to compile a set of 29 ""illustrative"" examples of wrongly blocked sites, and was able to identify 29 sites, or 10% of his ""potentially incorrect"" set, that were, in fact, incorrectly blocked. 101 Plaintiff witness Benjamin Edelman Mr. Edelman used a querying method when he tested approximately 550,000 pages in order to generate a list of 6,000 to 7,000 pages that ""may"" be overblocked. Four librarians then reviewed samples of this list. 102 Plaintiff witness Christopher Hunter Mr. Hunter used a querying method when he created a sample of 200 sites which he tested against several filters. 103 Defense witness Christopher Lemmons Mr. Lemmons of eTesting Labs used a querying method when he compared the four leading institutional-grade Web content filtering applications for effectiveness at blocking 200 randomly selected URLs containing pornography. 104 Defense witness Cory Finnell Certus Consulting Group collected actual filtered Internet log file data from three public library systems. Certus found filtering error rates of between 6.34% and 8.14%. 105 Defense witness David Biek Tacoma Public Library Central Library Manager David Biek submitted an analysis of Cyber Patrol log files. Based upon his review of a sample of the January 2000 intercept logs, Mr. Biek concluded that the CyberPatrol filter flagged sites at a rate of approximately 98% conformity with the category definitions used by the filtering software. 106  27    The ALA Court's Decision In the ALA decision, the court noted that: The only way to discover which URLs are blocked and which are not blocked by any particular filtering company is by testing individual URLs with filtering software, or by entering URLs one by one into the ""URL checker"" that most filtering software companies provide on their Web sites.107  The court went on to discuss the problems associated with evaluating filters, noting: ""The fundamental problem with calculating over- and underblocking rates is selecting a universe of Web sites or Web pages to serve as the set to be tested."" The court suggested the preferred method would be ""a truly random sample of the indexed Web"" 108 The court, fully aware of the encrypted nature of filtering databases, discusses methods for evaluating filters, cites a preferred method, and pointedly does not cite the encryption of filtering databases as a barrier to filter research. The court concluded its evaluation of filters by noting: Those public libraries that have responded to these problems by using software filters have found such filters to provide a relatively effective means of preventing patrons from accessing sexually explicit material on the Internet. Nonetheless, out of the entire universe of speech on the Internet falling within the filtering products' category definitions, the filters will incorrectly fail to block a substantial amount of speech. 109  Mainstream Loudoun v. Board of Trustees  Mainstream Loudoun v. Board of Trustees involved the constitutionality of a  public library's filtering policy using the software program X-Stop. However, the  Loudoun court did not address the effectiveness of filtering software, noting,  ""...our finding that the Policy is unconstitutional on its face makes any  consideration of the operation of X-Stop moot.""110    28    Government Commissions have Evaluated Filter Databases Without Research Derived from Circumventing Copyright Protections Two important government commissions have examined the effectiveness of filtering  software. In both cases, the commissions received testimony from filtering companies, as  well as testimony from interest groups promoting filters and interest groups opposed to  filters. Both commissions came to conclusions about the effectiveness of filters.  Notably, both commissions failed to conclude that copyright protection mechanisms  represent a significant barrier to the evaluation of filter databases.  National Research Council In November 1998, the U.S. Congress mandated a study by the National Research Council (NRC) to address the availability of pornography on the Internet. In response to this mandate, the National Academies formed a committee with expertise diverse enough to address this topic. After a hearing from a diverse body of commenters on the subject of filtering effectiveness, and conducting site visits to schools and libraries where filters were in use, the committee issued a lengthy report in May 2002 entitled Youth, Pornography, and the Internet . The report issued a number of findings, including findings regarding the effectiveness of filtering software: Filters--systems or services that limit in some way the content to which users may be exposed--are the most-used technology-based tool. [Section 12.1] All filters suffer from both false positives (overblocking) and false negatives ( underblocking). However, filters can be highly effective in reducing the exposure of minors to inappropriate content if the inability to access large amounts of appropriate material is acceptable.111  The NRC report contains an extensive discussion of methods for evaluating filters. Notably, the report does not state that copyright protection measures are a barrier to research, and echoes the sentiments of the ALA v. U.S. court as to the choice of methods for evaluating filter databases: A controversy over methodology was the subject of testimony to the committee. One approach is that the number of appropriate pages should be estimated on the basis of a random sampling of Web pages. A second approach is that the number should be estimated on the basis of actual usage, which weights certain popular Web pages more heavily than those not accessed as frequently.112  The COPA Commission In October 1998 Congress the Commission on Online effectiveness of protective privacy, First Amendment final report to Congress on  enacted the Child Online Protection Act. The act established Child Protection to evaluate the accessibility, cost, and technologies and methods, as well as their possible effects on values and law enforcement. The Commission released its Friday, October 20, 2000. 113  Like the NRC commission, the COPA Commission conducted hearings, and received testimony from filtering companies, as well as filtering opponents and proponents. Among the filtering companies that testified were N2H2, ClickSafe.com, Net Nanny, Browse Safe, Cyber Patrol, Library Guardian, Exotrope, and FamilyClick. The commissions finding on filters were summarized on page 19:  29    Server-side filtering using URL lists is available now from numerous sources.   Relative to other technologies, the best of these technologies can be highly effective in directly  blocking access to global harmful to minors content on the Web and also on newsgroups, email  and chat rooms. Server-side filters may be more easily implemented on a wide scale than client  side filters and may be more difficult for children to defeat.   Due to rapid growth in Internet content, server-side filters using URL lists may not be perfectly  effective in blocking. Server side technologies are accessible and easy to install and require few  actions by the family. Different systems offer different degrees of customizability to reflect  parental values, though many offer less control than client-side systems. 114    Like the NRC Commission, the COPA Commission pointedly does not say that copyright protection measures are a barrier to filtering research.  30    Journalists have Evaluated Filter Databases Without Research Derived from Circumventing Copyright Protection Commenters claim that the circumvention exemption will aid journalists in critiquing filtering software databases. Filtering software has indeed been of great interest to journalists -- a search of the Dow/Jones Factiva news database for the phrase ""filtering software"" during the post comment period of October 28, 2000 until February 17, 2003 retrieves 3,463 articles. Notably, commenters do not point to a single one of these 3,463 articles to support the notion that journalists will benefit from the exemption. The only example they cite is from 1996, The Keys to the Kingdom,115 which is discussed on page 34. In fact, there is a rich literature of comment and criticism about filtering software by journalists that does not involve the use of copyright circumvention techniques. Some illustrative examples since 1995 are shown below, all of which use querying methods: In January of 2003, journalist Edward C. Baig used querying to publish an evaluation of filtering software in USA Today : During brief tests, both CyberPatrol and Net Nanny worked adequately for the most part, although neither proved flawless. The programs let you set up different privileges for different family members, but they could be much clearer on who is being monitored at any one moment. The pair also tended to slow down my surfing a tad, even when I was headed toward legitimate online destinations.116  In 2001, journalist Tom DiNome published an evaluation of filters used querying for The New York Times, and concluded: I tried three Internet filters -- Net Nanny, Cyber Patrol and We-Blocker -- as well as the filtering capabilities built into the Web browsers Internet Explorer and Netscape Communicator. Each had its pros and cons, and performance varied.117  In 2000, CNET News journalist Brian Livington used querying to publish a criticism of what he claimed was a political bias in the AOL parental controls database: AOL's latest software, version 5.0, was tested by viewing more than 100 political sites over a period of several days. AOL's filters for children consistently allowed the viewing of far more conservative sites than Democratic and liberal sites. The selection remained consistent throughout the testing period. 118  In 1997, journalist Hope Katz Gibbs used querying to publish an evaluation of filtering software for The Washington Post : I installed copies of four leading programs -- SurfWatch, Cyber Patrol, Cybersitter and Net Nanny -- and went trolling for smut...The results: Most programs blocked undesirable sites pretty well, but none was perfect... But parents who want some technological help in managing their kids' Internet experience should install at least one of the programs listed here.119  In 1996 journalist Amy Dunkin used querying to publish an evaluation of filtering software in Business Week "" This filtering function can produce curious results. All programs have enough built-in intelligence to avoid the kind of absurdity that hit America Online last year when it banned the word ""breast"" and cut off online discussions of breast cancer.120  31    Commenters Provide No Support for the ""Social Benefits"" of Circumventing the Copyright Protections of Filter Databases The commenters supporting an exemption for filtering databases provide several examples of research they claim was derived from decryptions of filter databases, and which they also claim has benefited the public. A close examination of the facts surrounding these claims reveals them to be lacking in merit. Commenter Samuel Greenfeld asserts that: Several research projects already have taken advantage of this exclusion. The results of these studies have significantly benefited the public. Ben Edelman's statistical work done for Multnomah County Public Library et al., v. United States of America, et al. demonstrated that thousands of websites may be inappropriately categorized by filtering software applications.121  Mr. Greenfeld is incorrect in his assertion that ""Ben Edelman's statistical work"" took advantage of the filtering exclusion. This is shown in the district court ruling in the case Mr. Greenfeld cites, Multnomah v. US: Benjamin Edelman, an expert witness who testified before us, compiled a list of more than 500,000 URLs and devised a program to feed them through all four filtering programs in order to compile a list of URLs that might have been erroneously blocked by one or more of the programs122  As the district courts findings of fact describe, Edelman generated a sample and used the query method to conduct his research. Since Edelman's report is another example of query-based research, it undercuts, rather than supports the exemption for filtering software. Mr. Greenfeld goes on to cite the publications of Seth Finkelstein, and Mr. Finkelstein cites two examples of his own publications, as well as a 1996 web article. 123 The first example Mr. Finkelstein cites is decryption research he asserts he performed on behalf of the plaintiffs in the Mainstream Loudoun case. Finkelstein asserts that he decrypted the filtering product X-Stop, provided examples of ""bad blocks"" to attorneys for the plaintiffs, and finally claims that ""Such evidence has played an important role in [the] litigation.""124 Evidence from the Mainstream Loudoun litigation record does not support Mr. Finkelstein's claim to have been an evidence source in this case. The plaintiff's litigants, the ACLU, submitted a lengthy ""Proposed Statement of Undisputed Facts"", that actually describes in great detail the sources for the ""bad blocks"" by X-Stop submitted as evidence. Section IV, A of this document is titled ""Well Over a Hundred Sites Have So Far Been Identified by Library Staff, Patrons, Intervenors, and Others That Were Blocked Even Though They Did Not Violate The Policy and Contained Constitutionally Protected Speech."" This portion of the document describes at great length the sources of over 100 ""wrongly blocked"" sites submitted into evidence, and in fact credits each example to various individual ""library staff, patrons, intervenors, and others"" by each individual's name. Mr. Finkelstein's name appears nowhere in this document, or in any other document submitted to the Loudoun Court. 125  32    But the Copyright Office need not consider the merit of Mr. Finkelstein's claim to have been an important evidence source in the Mainstream Loudoun case for the simple reason that the Loudoun court did not even consider this evidence in reaching its decision, as a careful reading of the Loudoun decision reveals: 3. Whether X-Stop Is the Least Restrictive Filtering Software Defendant claims that X-Stop is the least restrictive filtering software currently available and, therefore, the Policy [begin page 38] is narrowly tailored as applied. Our finding that the Policy is unconstitutional on its face makes this argument moot. A facially overbroad government policy may nevertheless be saved if a court is able to construe government actions under that policy narrowly along the lines of their implementation, if the policy's text or other sources of government intent demonstrate ""a clear line"" to draw. See Reno, 117 S. Ct. at 2350-51. we find no such clear line here. Defendant has asserted an unconditional right to filter the Internet access it provides to its patrons and there is no evidence in the record that it has applied the Policy in a less restrictive way than it is written. See Def. Resp. to Pl First Req. Admiss. 17 (denying that XStop does not block access to soft core pornography, which is protected). Therefore, our finding that the Policy is unconstitutional on its face makes any consideration of the operation of X-Stop moot. [Emphasis added]126  Mr. Finkelstein next asserts that he decrypted the filtering product N2H2, and that from this decryption, he was able to make public information about an N2H2 category: But I could not have exposed this secret category [N2H2 loophole], and seen that it could not ever be deactivated, as a structural, architectural, ""feature"" of the program, without examining the raw blacklist itself. There would be no other way of obtaining that hidden information...Here is a very concrete example - if I could not have circumvented the technological measure (encryption) controlling access to the N2H2/BESS blacklist, I would not have discovered the secret LOOPHOLE category.127  Mr. Finkelstein's claim that he ""could never have raw blacklist itself"" is refuted not once, but twice Secret Loophole. Bess's Secret Loophole actually methods for gathering this information that were Mr. Finkelstein wrote his report:  exposed this"" without ""examining the by Mr. Finkelstein's own report, Bess's documents two publicly available available at the time (August 2001) that  There is also a corresponding code LH which appears in log files of a N2H2 server...  The LOOPHOLE category can be verified by using N2H2's single-site blacklist checking form .  Just test it with an anonymizer or privacy site, e.g. http://www.safeweb.com/ , using their web  form, or an equivalent URL such as http://database.n2h2.com/cgi  perl/catrpt.pl?req_URL=http://www.safeweb.com/ The result should come back as, for example:  The Site: http://www.safeweb.com  is categorized by N2H2 as:  Loop Hole Sites.128    As this passages shows, documentation of the N2H2 ""Loophole"" category was indeed available in August 2001 on both the N2H2 website, and by checking log files from a trial copy of N2H2's software, since these files are not encrypted and available to users. 129 Finkelstein goes on to assert that Bess's Secret Loophole was ""cited in expert-witness testimony for the CIPA trial, and my overall work in this area seems to have been a factor in the District Court CIPA decision.""130 A review of the ALA v U.S. decision and the trial record does not support either of these assertions.  33    The ALA decision indeed cites ""so-called loophole sites"" as one of a number of flaws in filtering software in a lengthy section titled ""The Methods that Filtering Companies Use to Compile Category Lists."" But at the beginning of this section the court states that ""We base our understanding of these methods largely on the detailed testimony and expert report of Dr. Geoffrey Nunberg.""131 Dr. Nunberg's expert report does indeed contain a section entitled ""Loophole Sites.""132 This five-page section contains a detailed discussion of ""loophole sites"" and the potential problems their use in filtering can cause. But nowhere in this section or anywhere in Dr. Nunberg's report is the work of Seth Finkelstein cited. Finally, Mr. Finkelstein cites as an example of the use of decryption research by journalists, a 1996 web-published article entitled Keys to the Kingdom. But an actual reading of this article raises questions about its seriousness. The author describes how he obtained a list of blocked websites while drunk in a bar: I'd just spent the better part of a muggy Washington night knocking back boilermakers in an all night Georgetown bistro waiting for a couple of NSA spooks that never showed. I tried to stumble to the door and an arm reached out and gently shoved me back to my table. At the end of that arm was a leggy redhead; she had a fast figure and even faster smile. There was a wildness about her eyes and I knew it was the crank. But something else wasn't quite right. As I fought with my booze-addled brain, struggling to focus my eyes, I noticed her adam's apple.133  The probative value of Keys to the Kingdom was actually examined in ALA v. U.S. Plaintiff's expert Christopher Hunter submitted Keys to the Kingdom as evidence of the ineffectiveness of filters. During cross-examination of Mr. Hunter, the Judges expressed profound skepticism of Keys to the Kingdom: Q: [Ms. Bhattacharyya] What the report in fact says is that the reporters were drunk in a bar in Georgetown and got the list from a transvestite, isn't that right? A: [Mr. Hunter] That might be the case. Judge Becker: Well, it says at the end, we have Brock Meeks with giving his e-mail address did the heavy drinking for this article. He Declan McCullagh giving his e-mail address did the heavy reporting. Well, at least McCullagh wasn't drunk as far as we -The Witness: The journalist is actually in the room but I think he's sober today. By Ms. Bhattacharyya: Q: You were aware of this article at the time you wrote you peer review masters thesis, is that right? A: Yes, I was. Q: It doesn't appear in the list of sources that you attached to your masters thesis, does it? A: No, it didn't. Judge Becker: These are all exhibits to your reports?  34    The witness: They're the supporting -- they're the full reports which I summarized in my expert Judge Becker: Well, why would you summarize something like that article that Ms. Bhattacharyya just inquired about? The witness: Because it provides examples of over-blocked web sites consistent in each of these reports. Over time, all show over-blocking, under-blocking, or both. Judge Fullam: But these are truly anecdotal, right? They don't establish anything scientific very much.134  35    The Circumvention of Filter Database Copyright Protections has Harmed, and will Harm the Filtering Industry As the Copyright Office already found in its 2000 Exemption to Prohibition on Circumvention of Copyright Protection Systems for Access Control Technologies, allowing the circumvention of copyright protection for databases will cause harm to the database market: Finally, in assessing the effect of circumvention on the market for or value of the works, it appears likely that if circumvention were permitted, the ability of database producers to protect their investment would be seriously undermined and the market would be harmed.135  This finding should certainly apply to the databases created by filtering companies as well. The harms that can be inflicted upon filtering companies are not imaginary or hypothetical. A case exits, Microsystems Software, Inc. v. Scandinavia Online AB136 , that documents the harm perpetrated on a filtering company by two ""researchers"" -- two teen age hackers, Eddy Jansson and Matthew Skala. The appellate court that upheld the lower court ruling in Microsystems Software, Inc. v. Scandinavia Online AB summarizes the litigation: The plaintiffs, Microsystems Software, Inc. and Mattel, Inc. (collectively, Microsystems), developed and distributed ""Cyber Patrol"" -- a blocking device coveted by parents who wish to prevent their children from roaming into salacious Internet venues...shortly after Microsystems introduced Cyber Patrol, Jansson and Skala reverse-engineered it and wrote a bypass code that enabled users not only to thwart the program but also to gain access to the list of blocked sites. (1) They then posted the bypass code on their own web sites and gave blanket permission for others to copy it. The appellants took advantage of this offer...Microsystems was not pleased. On March 15, 2000, it brought suit seeking injunctive relief against the defendants and ""those persons in active concert or participation with them."" Microsystems complained that it was suffering irreparable injury because ""[m] ultiple individuals throughout the United States and the world . . . have downloaded, copied and created 'mirror' Web sites"" revealing the bypass code. When the district court issued a temporary restraining order two days later, Microsystems e-mailed copies of it, along with sundry supporting documents, to various persons (including the appellants)...Three days later, the court held a hearing on the motion for preliminary injunction. At that session, Microsystems advised the court that it had reached an accord with the named defendants and proffered a proposed final decree that purported to prohibit the defendants and those persons ""in active concert"" with them from posting the bypass code.137  36    It is well worth the Copyright Office's time to review the 14-page document, Microsystems Software, Inc. v. Scandinavia Online AB, Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, March 28 2000, which is available on line at http://www.epic.org/free_speech/censorware/cp_conclusions.html. The judicial findings of fact and conclusion of law in Microsystems show not only the harm done to Microsystems, but provide useful insight into the motivations and methods of two such ""researchers,"" and address the issues of ""fair use"" and the public good with regards to the reverse engineering of filtering software. The Findings of Fact call attention to motives of the ""researchers"": 9. In their March 21, 2000 press release, Jansson and Skala admitted to ""reverse engineering"" the Cyber Patrol software as a means of ""attack:"" Cyber Patrol(R) 4, a ""censorware"" product intended to prevent users from accessing undesirable Internet content, has been reverse engineered by youth rights activists Eddy L O Jansson and Matthew Skala... A detailed report of their findings, titled ""The Breaking of Cyber Patrol(R) 4"", with commentary on the reverse engineering process and cryptographic attacks against the product's authentication system, has been posted on the World Wide Web...A package of source code and binaries implementing the attacks is included. 10. Jansson and Skala published their press release over the Internet via e-mail into the United States, including Massachusetts, and throughout the World Wide Web. Ver. Con. 17. 11. Jansson and Skala created and promoted the Bypass Code and published it through software download links originally located on Jansson's Web page to make available to children in the United States and around the world software that enables the child to defeat parents' effort s to screen inappropriate material posted on the Internet. [Emphasis added] Ver. Cor. 1B. 138  The Conclusions of Law call attention to the issues of ""fair use"", the public good served by reverse engineering filtering software, and the adverse affects on filtering software: 47. The individual defendants have no ""fair use"" defense here because they neither asserted it nor submitted evidence supporting any fair use defense. 48. In addition, the purpose of the copying here is inconsistent with the general public good. The individual defendents' avowed purpose for decompiling CyberPatrol was to allow ""youth access"" to inappropriate content on the World Wide Web. Ver. Com. 16. That purpose contradicts the public interest as specifically found by Congress: The Congress finds that...while custody, care, and nurture of the child reside first with the  parent, the widespread availability of computers presents opportunities for minors to access  materials through the World Wide Web in a manner that can frustrate parental supervision  or control...the protection of the physical and psychological well-being of minors by  shielding them from materials that are harmful to them is a compelling governmental  interest... notwithstanding the existence of protections that limit the distribution over the  World Wide Web of material that is harmful to minors, parents, educators, and industry must  continue efforts to find ways to protect children from being  exposed to harmful material found on the Internet.  47 U.S.C. 231, The Child Online Protection Act  49. Finally, to negate fair use one need only show that if the challenged use should become widespread, it would adversely affect the potential market for the copyrighted work. Harper & Row, Pub. Inc. V. National Ent. 417 U.S. 533. 568 (1985) (finding no fair use.)  37    50. By their own admission, Jansson and Skala created the Bypass Code to ""break"" Cyber Patrol. Ver. Com., Ex. A. Software explicitly designed to make Cyber Patrol ineffective for its intended use can do nothing other than ""adversely affect the potential market for the copyrighted work."" Harper & Row Pub. Inc. 417 U.S. at 568. 53. In contrast, Microsystems -- as well as the public -- will continue to suffer irreparable harm unless the individual defendants are prohibited from distributing the Bypass Code.139  Notably, commenters do not even attempt to claim that any ""social good"" came from the efforts of Jansson and Skala. During the nearly three-year period following the publication of The Breaking of Cyber Patrol, commenters point to no examples of published research or journalism derived from Jansson and Skala's circumvention of Cyber Patrol's copyright protection. In the period following the Microsystems case, it is difficult to quantify the damage to the Cyber Patrol product. The reason for this is that three months after the March 28, 2000 Microsystems ruling, the parent company of Microsystems, Mattel, Inc., sold the Cyber Patrol product to a large filtering company, SurfControl. 140 The Cyber Patrol product was then rolled in with SurfControl's other products, most of which were acquired through acquisition, including SurfWatch, Little Brother, SuperScout, and CSM. 141 The Cyber Patrol database at the time of the acquisition was approximately 100,000 142 entries, and was rolled into several other SurfControl databases to create a new database of over 1.5 million sites. 143 The Cyber Patrol database as it was known in March 28, 2000 had ceased to exist a few months later, being absorbed into SurfControl's larger database. But the findings of the Microsystems court make it clear that filtering companies -- and more importantly, children, will ""suffer irreparable harm"" by activities such as those by Jansson and Skala.  38    Conclusion This comment has documented the considerable public benefits derived from the filtering industry. Filtering software provides crucial protection for millions of children, helps to reduce liability in the workplace, increases productivity, and saves corporate bandwidth. In 1996, Congress recognized the social benefits of filtering, and passed legislation specifically designed to promote the filtering industry. 144 This comment has also documented that there are no corresponding social benefits to allowing the circumvention of copyright control mechanisms for filtering software. The burden of proof is upon the commenters seeking an exemption to document such examples, and they have failed to meet their burden. Commenters cannot point to a single court case, ruling by a government body, or piece of independent laboratory research that benefited from such circumventions. Among the thousands of pieces of journalistic writing produced about filtering software, commenters can only point to a single example from 1996 of filtering journalism derived from copyright circumvention. The seriousness of this lone journalistic example is questionable, as it describes a reporter obtaining decryption while drunk in a bar. This comment has provided dozens examples of laboratory research, journalism, court findings, and findings by government entities that did not require the use of research derived from circumvention. These journalists, judges, researchers, and public policy officials have drawn upon a large body of research on filtering software that uses querying methods, including research published in Consumer Reports and the Journal of the American Medical Association. This comment has shown how circumvention of copyright controls, rather than benefiting the public, actually causes harm. This was stated best by the court in Microsystems Software, Inc. v. Scandinavia Online AB, which found that when a filtering company's code was reverse engineered and distributed, the filtering company, ""-- as well as the public -- will continue to suffer irreparable harm unless the individual defendants are prohibited from distributing the Bypass Code.""145 As the Copyright Office itself found when applying the DMCA to databases, ""[I]n assessing the effect of circumvention on the market for or value of the works, it appears likely that if circumvention were permitted, the ability of database producers to protect their investment would be seriously undermined and the market would be harmed.""146 For these reasons, the request for exemption for filtering databases should be denied.  39    FOOTNOTES 37 CFR  201.40.  37 CFR  201.40, 64564.  37 CFR  201.40, 64564.  37 CFR  201.40, 64564.  5 Testimony of Chris Ophus, Subcommittee on Telecommunications and the Internet Hearing,  ""E-Rate and Filtering: a Review of the Children's Internet Protection Act,"" April 04, 2001.

Students will meet a pilot from the Federal Aviation Association who will describe the growth of air transportation and its mathematical pattern and a professor who will explain a special pattern of numbers called the Fibonacci sequence. From this sequence, students can calculate the Golden Ratio, a special ratio found in nature, and discover how ratios are used in the design of everyday objects. Students will also see how NASA researchers are using ratios, proportions, and the Golden Ratio to design airplanes and test small aircraft data. To learn more about NASA CONNECT, visit our web site: edu.larc.nasa.gov/connect  CLASSROOM ACTIVITY In this activity, students will use objects found in nature to discover how ratios and proportions are present in everyday objects and their bodies. Students will gain an insight into the mathematics of ratios in nature and how ratios are used in the designs we create. The Fibonacci sequence and the Golden Ratio are used as the basis of discovery. Before the activity, students should review sequences and determine the succeeding terms of a sequence. Students will examine various natural objects and count petals, sections, or spirals to find numbers in the Fibonacci sequence to verify that the objects are ""Golden."" Students will be asked to calculate the ratios of pairs of numbers within the Fibonacci sequence. They will list the ratios and convert them to decimal form. Students will note the value that the entire sequence of ratios approaches, 1.62 (rounded), which is called the Golden Ratio or Golden Proportion. Next, the students will study the proportions they find by measuring their bodies, by calculating the ratio, and by determining whether they are Golden. The final activity requires students to examine man-made objects such as buildings, cars, paper objects, and art for the influence of the Golden Ratio. Suggested time schedule for activity is based on a 45-minute block:  Preparation for the classroom Activity lesson and collection of materials Day 1 (45 minutes)  Classroom Activity Day 2 (45 minutes)  1   Program 6 in the 1999-2000 NASA CONNECT Series Proportionality: Modeling the Future - Lesson Guide  WEB-BASED COMPONENT While visiting the corresponding web page for this program, students can access the Airplane Design WorkshopTM, the technology-based component of the program. This online activity is located in Norbert's Lab at edu.larc.nasa.gov/connect/xplane.html. Desktop Aeronautics, Inc.'s Airplane Design WorkshopTM is the online activity that provides an opportunity for students to model their own future passenger plane. By choosing different wings, tails, engines, and fuselage layouts, students can use ratios and proportions to design a complete airplane and see if it will fly. With the aid of computer analysis, students will receive quick feedback on the effect of each decision.  CAREER CORNER Access to information is critical to making career decisions. Career Corner, located in Norbert's Lab at edu.larc.nasa.gov/connect/xplane.html, is a web-based component that highlights the professionals who appear in the program, Proportionality: Modeling the Future.

VOCABULARY ratio  a pair of numbers that is used to make comparisons proportion  a number sentence or equation stating that two ratios are equal sequence  a following of one number after another in succession  3   Program 6 in the 1999-2000 NASA CONNECT Series Proportionality: Modeling the Future - Lesson Guide  FIBONACCI RATIO Early in the 13th century, a mathematician named Leonardo Fibonacci was studying a rabbit problem. Fibonacci wanted to know how many rabbits you would have at the end of the year if you started with a pair of newborn rabbits, one male and one female. Fibonacci knew that newborn rabbits are able to breed after one month and every month thereafter (under ideal circumstances). He found that the sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13... demonstrated the total number of rabbit pairs at the end of each month. Example: month 1  month 2  month 3  month 4   the original pair = 1 pair the original pair (now old enough to breed) = 1 pair the original pair + a newborn pair = 2 pairs the original pair and their newborn pair + the first newborn pair = 3 pairs  If you look at the sequence, month 12 corresponds to 144 pairs of rabbits! Fibonacci and others soon found this sequence occurring in many other things in nature. By counting the spirals of pinecones, pineapples, and sunflower seedheads, you can find neighboring pairs of Fibonacci numbers. The way in which leaves are arranged on a stem also displays a Fibonacci relationship; so do spiral seashells. The ancient Greeks thought the ratios obtained by successive terms in the sequence were special. This ""special"" ratio, known as the Golden Ratio, was so pleasing they used it to design their temples and buildings. The Parthenon is an example of a building using rectangles with the Golden Ratio. Objects that can be described by using the numbers in the Fibonacci sequence or the Golden Ratio are said to be in Golden Proportion or Golden.  4   Program 6 in the 1999-2000 NASA CONNECT Series Proportionality: Modeling the Future - Lesson Guide  THE ACTIVITY: THE GOLDEN RATIO BEFORE THE ACTIVITY Ask students to recall patterns of numbers in mathematics by providing examples and asking students to provide the next 3 or 4 terms. Ex. 2, 4, 6, 8, 10... Ex. 1, 5, 9, 13, 17... Ex. 3, 12, 48, 192... Discuss what operations were used to determine the next term. The following sequence is a very famous sequence called the Fibonacci sequence. What operation is used to determine the terms? 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13... Find the next four terms (21, 34, 55, 89). The ratio of certain pairs of numbers in the Fibonacci sequence is used to describe things in nature. The ratios look like this: 1/1 2/1 3/2 5/3 8/5 13/8 21/13 34/21 55/34 89/55 MATERIALS Choose a set of four from the following for the first part of the lesson. Avoid hybrids as some do not contain Fibonacci numbers. One set per team: Pinecones - in good shape, preferably young and still closed, but open ones are okay too Pineapples Bananas Daisies Grapefruit - white is best Sunflowers - dried seedheads are easier to count Apples - cut horizontally between blossom end and stem Green peppers - cut horizontally to expose the chambers Choose from the following for part three of the activity: 3 x 5 index cards - one per team classroom light-switch plate stamps - cancelled stamps; show variety, not all are golden paperback novels - one per team MonopolyTM game board Front end of a car - may require a ""field trip;"" some cars are more Golden than others; some are not Golden at all Other materials needed: Body Diagram, page 12 Objects Diagram, page 13 Student Data Worksheet, page 11 pencils calculators meter stick string metric ruler or standard ruler  If you divide the numerator of each ratio by its denominator, the results look like this: 1/1 2/1 3/2 5/3 8/5 13/8 21/13 34/21 55/34 89/55 = = = = = = = = = = 1 2 1.5 1.666... 1.6 1.625 1.61538... 1.61904... 1.61764... 1.61718...  5   Program 6 in the 1999-2000 NASA CONNECT Series Proportionality: Modeling the Future - Lesson Guide  Do you notice how the ratios begin to get close to the (rounded) number 1.62? The Greeks called the number phi (not to be confused with pi). When something in nature can be described by using the ratios in the Fibonacci sequence, it is said to be Golden. Let's see what we can find that is Golden. NOTE: Notice that the above ratios are written with the larger number divided by the smaller. If you divide the smaller number in the pair by the larger number, the answer will be .62 (rounded). This value is also recognized as the Golden Ratio; therefore, if a student arrives at a number close to .62 or 1.62, either is acceptable.  THE ACTIVITY The activity should be done in small groups or pairs with each student counting, calculating, and comparing results with the others in the group. The teacher may choose from the numbered objects given or from the additional natural objects listed, according to availability. Students will record their results on the worksheet provided, page 11. I. Objective: Be able to identify Fibonacci ratios in nature. Given the following, the students will examine each object for evidence of the Golden Ratio by identifying Fibonacci ratios. 1. Banana Students will count the number of sides of the unpeeled banana. Because bananas have either three or five sides, they are said to be Golden. Show the students how to find the spirals and count the number of squares in the spiral. Students will count the number of squares in two adjacent spirals to determine whether they are adjacent numbers in the Fibonacci sequence and therefore ratios; for example, 34 squares in one spiral and 21 in the adjacent spiral. The ratio is 34:21 and therefore the pineapples are Golden. Some pineapples have three different spirals, but all will be Fibonacci numbers. Students will count the segments of the halved grapefruit. Each grapefruit should yield a Fibonacci number; therefore, a grapefruit is Golden.  ADDITIONAL NATURAL OBJECTS sunflowers  ratio of petal length to diameter of seed head; number of spirals in two different directions chambered nautilus  ratio of volume of each cell to the consecutive cell leaf stem - ratio of distance between one set of leaves to the next set of leaves on the stem apples - number of seeds inside green pepper - number of chambers  2. Pineapples  3. Grapefruit  6   Program 6 in the 1999-2000 NASA CONNECT Series Proportionality: Modeling the Future - Lesson Guide  4. Pinecone  Students will examine the pinecone for the number of spirals that go to the right and compare that number to the number of spirals that go to the left. (See Objects Diagram, page 13.) Use colored markers that will show on the pinecone to keep track of the spirals in each direction. The spirals in one direction should be steeper than the spirals in the other direction. Compare smaller pinecones against larger ones. The ratio should be a Fibonacci ratio. Ex. With 8 spirals to the right and 5 to the left, the ratio is 5:8; therefore, the pinecone is golden. Students will count the number of petals that grow in a clockwise direction and the number that grow in a counterclockwise direction. The result is the Fibonacci pair, 21:34; therefore, the daisy is Golden.  5. Daisy  II. Objective: Be able to determine body measurements that are approximately the Golden Ratio. Have students work in pairs or small groups to count and/or measure portions of their bodies as listed. Demonstrate the ratio of finger segments in one finger to the number of fingers on one hand. The ratio should be a Fibonacci ratio, 3:5; therefore, each student's hands are Golden. Students will record results and calculations on their worksheet. NOTE: There are several definitions for proportion, depending on the context. When one ratio is equal to another ratio, the equality is called a proportion. When a ratio is equal to the Golden Ratio, it is proportional to the Golden Ratio. (Referred to as the Golden Proportion.)  1. Measure each student's height and record the results on the Student Data Worksheet, page 11. Measure each student from the top of the head to the tip of the middle finger of the outstretched arm; record the results. Compare the ratio of the height to the measure of the length from the top of the head to the end of the outstretched arm. When calculated, does the ratio approximate the Golden Ratio? Ex. 165.5/91.5 = 1.81 (pretty close!) 2. Measure the height of each student and the navel height of each. Write the result as a ratio of height:navel height. The result is close to the Golden Ratio. 3. Measure each student's entire arm length and the length of the arm from fingertip to elbow. Write the result as a ratio. The result is close to the Golden Ratio.  7   Program 6 in the 1999-2000 NASA CONNECT Series Proportionality: Modeling the Future - Lesson Guide  III. Objective: Be able to find examples of the Gold Ratio/Proportion in man-made objects. The teacher may choose objects to be measured based on availability, time, and convenience from the list given at the beginning of the activity or as indicated below. 1. Students will verify the Fibonacci numbers of index cards by measuring the width and the length. The ratio is 5:3 or 3:5; therefore, index cards are Golden. 2. Students will measure cards the size of a credit card. Record the ratio and determine whether the cards are Golden. Encourage students to discuss why something might not be Golden. For example, the card might not fit in a wallet or the card might be cheaper to produce if smaller. 3. Students will measure any of the following to determine if the length:width ratio is Golden: A. paperback novels B. postage stamps C. light-switch plates D. MonopolyTM game board 4. Students will measure a car grill and a car headlight to determine the Golden Ratio. Is the car designed to be Golden?  Measure the distance from the center of the car grill to the outside of the headlight.  Measure the distance from the inside edge of the headlight to the outside edge of the headlight.  Write the result of the ratio, largest length:smallest length. 5. Students will examine the keys on a piano to determine Fibonacci ratios.  Ratio of number of white keys:number of black keys  The number of black keys in a group Optional Questions: Once students have identified the Golden Ratio in certain objects, the following questions can help them use the Golden Ratio in problem solving. 1. A painter wishes to create a mural that would be in Golden Proportion. If the mural is 6.5 feet high, how wide should it be? 2. A quilt is 5.5 feet wide. To have Golden Proportions, what length would it be?  8   Program 6 in the 1999-2000 NASA CONNECT Series Proportionality: Modeling the Future - Lesson Guide  Optional Activity: This activity demonstrates to students how the pleasing ratio of the Golden Proportion influences the things we do. Ask students to print in upper case letters (as they usually print) the words ""GOLDEN RATIOS ARE FUN."" Using metric rulers, measure the letters ""E"", ""R"", ""A"", ""F"" AS FOLLOWS:  Measure the height of the letter.  Measure the distance from the middle line to the top of the letter.  Write the result as a ratio (long:short).  Measure the other letters in a similar way. Is the students' printing Golden? Analyzing the Activity Students should review their observations and respond to these questions in their journals or in the form of a classroom discussion: In four sentences, describe and analyze the activity. Was everything you examined ""Golden""? How did you determine whether an object was ""Golden""? Is everything in nature Golden? Challenge the students to think about the possibility that other special ratios might exist in nature by asking these questions: Do you think there is another special ratio like the Golden Ratio that exists in nature? Why? How could someone discover it? Do all sequences approach one certain number as the Golden Ratio did?  EXTENSION ACTIVITIES The following activities are meant to be exploratory exercises for students to conduct on their own, as a class activity, or as homework assignments. 1. Have students conduct a search at home for Golden Proportions. Students should list the item and the ratio they find of length:width. Prizes could be awarded for the greatest number of items found or for the most unusual list. 2. Have a party in which the only things brought to the party have Fibonacci numbers associated with them. For instance, the fruits in the class activity and/or a Fibonacci ratio of ingredients: 8 tortilla chips:5 Tbsp Salsa (must show ratio ingredients on a separate paper or card). 3. Students may bring in magazine photos of buildings or monuments to determine their Golden Ratios. (Suggested examples: The United Nations Building, the Parthenon, the Great Wall of China, and the dome on the Capitol building of the United States.)  9   Program 6 in the 1999-2000 NASA CONNECT Series Proportionality: Modeling the Future - Lesson Guide  CUE CARDS Van Hughes and Jennifer Pulley, NASA Langley Research Center Use the following information given from the video to set up a proportion.

Women        Contribution(s)          Mary Anderson            Invented the windshield wiper in 1903 and by 1916, wipers were standard equipment on all American cars.            Virginia Apgar - physician.             Developed the “Apgar Score”, a newborn scoring system used for assessing the health of newborn infants.  She published the “Apgar Score” in 1957; and, up until that time, physicians assumed that babies were in good health unless they exhibited some obvious medical problem.            Patricia Billings          Patented in 1997 GeoBond, a fireproof building material that is sold in more than 20 markets worldwide.            Katherine Blodgett (1898-1979) - scientist.            Created the world’s first 100% transparent or invisible glass.  In the 1920s, she along with Dr. Irving researched monomolecular coatings designed to cover the surfaces of water, metal, and glass.  It was not until the 1930s that she discovered a way to attached molecule-thick monomolecular coatings to metal and glass one at a time, resulting in the world's first 100% transparent, or truly ""invisible"" glass.  Her discovery has been used for many purposes including limiting the distortion in eyeglasses, microscopes, telescopes, cameras, and projector lenses.            Bessie Blount - physical therapist.          Patented, in 1951, a device that allowed amputees to feed themselves.  Ms. Blount’s invention was inspired by her work with soldiers injured in W.W.II.             Sarah Boone (1734-1820)             Designed and patented an improved ironing board that made it easier to iron sleeves and the bodies of lady garments.            Rachel Fuller Brown (1898 – 1975) and Elizabeth Lee Hazen (1885-1975)           Invented nystatin, the world's first useful antifungal antibiotic, that has been used to cure many disfiguring and disabling fungal infections of the skin, mouth, throat, and intestinal tract.  Nystatin has also been used to treat water-damaged art pieces from molds.            Gertrude Belle Elion          Developed and patented the leukemia-fighting drug 6-mercaptopurine.  She also developed drugs used to facilitate kidney transplants and fight herpes.            Edith Marie Flanigen (1929) - chemist.                Developed a petroleum refinement methods that makes use of “molecular sieves” that has made the production of gasoline in the U.S. and around the world greater, cleaner, and safer.  Her “sieves” have also been used to purify water and clean up environmental pollution.            Helen Murray Free           Developed the home diabetes test that for the first time allowed diabetics to monitor their blood glucose level instantly and at home.            Lillian Moller Gilbreth (1878-1972)            Patented the electric food mixer and trash can with a step-on-lid opener used by many households use today.            Bette Nesmith Graham (1924-1980)                      Invented liquid paper, also known as White-Out.            Erna Hoover  -  researcher at Bell Laboratories.          Created a computerized telephone switching system. The switching system used a computer to monitor incoming calls and then automatically adjusted the call's acceptance rate. This helped eliminate overloading problems as calls were processed. The principles of Hoover's design are used even today.                          Grace Hopper (1906-1992) - computer expert.              Developed Common Business-Oriented Language (COBOL), a compiler or computer program that allowed computers to communicate with one another.  COBOL at one time (and may still be) was the most widely used computer business language in the world.              Margaret Knight (1838)            Developed a stop-motion device that could be used in textile mills to shut down machinery, thereby, preventing workers from being injured.           Invented a device to cut, fold and paste bag bottoms.  Before her inventions, paper bags were glued by hand.            Stephanie Louise Kwolek             Invented Kevlar, a material five times stronger than steel. Kevlar is best known to the public as the material from which bulletproof vests are made; and, in this use alone, Kwolek's discovery has saved thousands of lives, particularly those men and women who serve in the Law Enforcement field.  Kevlar has other applications including: radial tires; brake pads (a replacement for asbestos); racing sails; fiberoptic cable; water-, air- and spacecraft shells; and mooring and suspension bridge cables. It is also used to make skis, safety helmets, and hiking and camping gear.             Patsy Sherman                 Invented Scotchgard that is used to keep fabric clean.            Madame CJ Walker (1867-1919)  -  businesswoman and inventor.            Developed a conditioning treatment for straightening hair.

GX230-69-10703500	"Inside Wallops National Aeronautics and Space Administration Goddard Space Flight Center Wallops Flight Facility, Wallops Island, Virginia Volume XX-03 Number 23 June 23, 2003  Nighttime Clouds Shed Light On Space Weather NASA is looking for the opportunity, beginning tonight, June 23, to launch rocket experiments that will form nighttime clouds in a project intended to shed light on space weather. Three of the four rocket experiments, launched from the NASA Wallops Flight Facility will include the formation of milky, white clouds. The clouds will allow scientists to view winds in a high and poorly accessible layer of Earth' s atmosphere called the ionosphere. the ground,"" Earle said. ""The clouds will act as a tracer and allow us to view the winds at various altitudes over a period of time."" ""The data gathered from this project will aid in our understanding of the relationship between the winds and ionospheric activity. This research may one day lead to the ability to forecast space weather, just as forecasters do today for Earth weather,"" Earle said. The time and day of launch depends on two major factors: clear skies are required at two of three special camera sites located along the Virginia and North Carolina coast; and a layer of ionized particles must form in the upper layers of the ionosphere and begin to descend. All four launches will occur in one night between 9:30 p.m. and 5 a.m., EDT, June 23 through July 10. There will be about 90 minutes between the launch of the first, second and third rockets. The third and fourth rockets will be launched about 10 minutes apart. The actual period between launches will be decided in real-time. The milky white clouds form from the release of trimethylaluminum (TMA) on the first, second and fourth rocket s. The third rocket carries only scientific instruments. The TMA will be released in space over the Atlantic Ocean at altitudes from 56 to 109 miles. The clouds will take about four to five minutes to form after the TMA release. The products of the reaction, when TMA is exposed to air or water, are aluminum oxide, carbon dioxide and water. TMA poses no threat to the public during preparation on the ground or during the release. The project is a NASA and multiuniversity effort. In addition to the University of Texas, students and personnel from Clemson University and Ut ah St ate University are participating in the mission. Keep track of the progress of the mission by calling the Wallop s launch status line at: 757/824-2050.

The ionosphere is strongly affected by solar activity, such as solar flares and UV radiation from sunspots. The state of the ionosphere affects such things as radio communications and Global Positioning System reception on Earth. The clouds may be visible, for up to 20 minutes by residents in the mid-Atlantic region, the lower northeastern United States and South Carolina. The chemicals used to make the clouds pose no danger to the public. The clouds will allow scientists to monitor the Earth's winds at the edge of space, said Dr. Gregory Earle from the University of Texas in Dallas, the lead researcher for the project.

It it is flown for 24 hours, it should be illuminated so the flag is not in complete darkness. The following are some of the rules for proper display and use of the U.S. flag, as est ablished by generally accepted custom and by Public Law 94-344 approved by Congress and signed by the President in 1976. The Flag Code does not impose penalties for the misuse of the flag. Such penalities are determined by the individual states and the District of Columbia. Bunting  The U.S. flag should never be used as drapery, never festooned, drawn back or up in folds. It should always be allowed to fall free. Bunting should be used for decoration; first blue, then white, then red. Behind a speaker  When used on a speaker 's platform, if displayed flat, the flag should be above and behind the speaker. Use bunting to decorate a speaker 's desk or the front of the platform. Over a street  When displayed over a street, place the union so it faces north or east depending on the direction of the street. From a building  When the flag is displayed from a staff projecting from a windowsill, balcony or building front, the union of the flag should always be at the peak of the staff unless the flag is half-staff. On a wall  When displayed either horizontally or vertically against a wall, the union should be uppermost and to the flag's own right, that is to the observer 's left. In a window, the union should be to the flag's right when viewed from the outside. On a staff  When the U.S. flag is flown with flags or pennants of states, cities or societies, it should always be at the peak. When flown from adjacent staffs, the U.S. flag should be hoisted first and lowered last. National flags  When flags of two or more nations are displayed together, they should be flown from separate staffs of the same height, and the flags should be of approximately equal size.

Covers in this instance refers to the front covers  of scholarly journals.   Images generated by Lynn and his colleagues in the Solid State and Metals and Ceramics divisions have graced many  nationally and internationally distributed scientific publications, and in some instances, they have been featured in books and on  calendars.   Scientifically interesting and aesthetically pleasing is how Lynn, a Corporate Fellow researcher, describes the beautifully  multi-hued microscopic images. Professional society journals that have featured these images include the  Journal of the  American Ceramic Society, Advanced Materials & Processes and Science . Theyve also been included in a book about scientific  images, in the traveling Nikon Small World exhibit that was on display this past summer at the American Museum of  Science and Energy, and in the 1999 calendar from Buehler, Ltd., the worlds leading manufacturer of metallographic  equipment.   The color micrographs demonstrate the inherent beauty in nature, even at microscopic resolution. But the eye appeal is a bonus.   Their real value is in the science they reveal. The pictures of striking geometrical shapesfrom orbs to polygons to fractalsare  valuable investigative tools that help Lynn and fellow researchers analyze experiments and understand the processes responsible  for their outcomes. They can show why an experiment didnt work, and they can reveal the mechanisms behind a  new materials properties.   Lynn notes one instance where microscopy was everything. In a 1994 experiment that anticipated the current drive toward  nanophase materials, a series of images from an experiment on the sintering of magnesium oxide nanoparticles showed why  certain structures would not bond with particular contact geometries: Tenuous links at corners of the cubic crystal structures  were unstable and disappeared during sintering. That series of electron microscope images showed the entire process and made  the cover of the  Journal of the American Ceramic Society , one of a long string in that publication.   Lynns earliest cover hit was a color photograph illustrating an article he co-authored with Solid States Brian Sales, which made  the front of  Science , one of the leading scientific journals. We discovered that by adding iron oxide to ordinary lead phosphate  glass, which is not very durable, it increased its durability by 10 4 . We proposed at the time that such glasses could be used to  incorporate nuclear waste, and the image accompanying the article was used on the cover of  Science .   The micrographs are obtained in a number of ways and with a number of instruments, including some of Solid States own transmission electronic microscopes as well as optical microscopes owned by other divisions, and at other institutions when specialized equipment is required. Lynn and his Solid State colleagues have enjoyed a long-term, fruitful collaboration with staff members in both the Metals and Ceramics Division and ORNLs graphics group.   The micrographs are usually strikingly colorful, but not all of them start out that way. Micrographs taken using transmission or scanning electron microscopy are originally black and white, but digital image processing can now be used to colorize these imagesmuch like colorizing some of the old black and white movies.   Although the electron microscope images only show colors after different hues are computer-assigned to the grey scale of the image, Lynn says that the  optical images taken with interference-contrast microscopy show a visual smorgasbord of beautiful colors from the moment that you look into the microscope.   One black and white  scanning-electron-microscope image produced this year by Lynn, Dorothy Coffey and David Norton shows changes in the surface of ceramic materials after they are hit by intense pulses of excimer laser light. The patterns are interesting enough, but one unmistakably resembles the head of an eagle . . . like the childrens game of looking for faces and animals in the clouds, Lynn says.     This eagle-head image resulted from a ceramic surfaces being subjected to intense pulses from a laser. The microscope image also revealed changes in the materials surface.     Other images resemble abstract designs, paisleys and cubist fantasies. An image they are preparing to unveil, which he calls one of his favorites, has a Dr. Strange-ish, other-dimension feel to it. In fact, whatever designs artists and designers have created over the years seem to already be covered by nature under the microscope.   The journal editors who select the ORNL images for their covers sometimes see them at poster-paper presentations  and micrograph competitions held at scientific professional society meetings. But Lynn, who may have acquired his appreciation for beautiful pictures from his father, a master photographer, has no doubt earned a reputation as a supplier of quality scientific images that are also fun to look at.   Sometimes our entries dont win anything in the competitions and then wind up on the covers. Its a matter of taste and judgment, says Lynn.   But they also keep the Lab in the forefront of the scientific community.  B.C.       Physical Sciences Directorate orients its capabilities to ORNLs future     Continuing a series of articles by members of the Labs Leadership Team, Associate Laboratory Director Jim Roberto discusses the outlook of the Physical Sciences Directorate.       by JIM ROBERTO   For more than 50 years, Oak Ridge National Laboratory has had a strong tradition in the physical sciences. This tradition has been documented by broad impacts in many fields, including neutron scattering, materials science and engineering, condensed matter physics, chemical and analytical science, and low-energy nuclear physicsand by significant national and international recognition including the Nobel Prize, Fermi Prize, E.O. Lawrence Award and more than 30 R&D 100 Awards.     Jim Roberto     The physical sciences are central to DOEs missions in science, energy, environment and national security. DOE is the nations largest supporter of research in the physical sciences, and ORNL is among DOEs largest performers of this research. The physical sciences directorate manages ORNLs core research programs in the physical sciences, develops and operates unique research facilities that support these programs and partners with other directorates to provide an integration of capabilities across disciplinesan important competitive advantage of the national laboratories.   Over the next five years, ORNL will see more investment in physical sciences infrastructure than at any other time in our history. The major change will be in neutron science, but initiatives are also under way in nanoscale science and engineering, materials and chemical sciences and nuclear physics.   The Spallation Neutron Source and the upgraded High Flux Isotope Reactor will transform ORNL. These are both billion-dollar facilities, and they are unique in the world. ORNL will become the worlds foremost center for neutron scattering research, a field with broad impacts in materials research, chemistry, fundamental physics, biology and engineering. Growing neutron scattering across the Laboratory is a high priority, and a Neutron Science Day addressing the new capabilities is being planned for the spring.   HFIR successfully completed its Operational Readiness Review in October and is preparing to resume operations. The scheduled replacement of the reflector and cooling tower has been completed, and installation of new and upgraded neutron scattering instrumentation is under way. Construction of the new cold guide hall will begin in the next few months, with installation of a high-performance cold neutron source and guide system to follow. The intense steady-state neutron beams at HFIR will complement the pulsed neutron capabilities of SNS.   In 1998, then Presidential Science Advisor Neal Lane described nanoscale science and engineering as the area of science and engineering that will most likely produce the breakthroughs of tomorrow.  This emerging field is a high priority at ORNL and is expected to have broad impacts across the Laboratory. The focus of this activity will be a $65 million Center for Nanophase Materials Sciences, one of three nanoscale science research centers recommended by DOE for FY 2003 construction funding.     ORNLs proposed Center for Nanophase Materials Sciences (foreground) will join the complex of buildings at the Spallation Neutron Source, putting the Lab at the forefront of an emerging field of science.     The CNMS will provide 80,000 square feet of laboratory and office space and state-of-the-art equipment for nanoscale science and engineering. The center will be located adjacent to SNS to take advantage of the unique nanocharacterization capabilities of neutron scattering and will include a Nanofabrication Research Laboratory and a Nanomaterials Theory Institute. More than 270 scientists from 60 institutions attended a planning workshop for the center October 2426. Hundreds of researchers from ORNL, universities and other institutions are expected to collaborate annually at the center.   In materials sciences, ORNLs Advanced Materials Characterization Laboratory will be constructed over the next 18 months. This facility, adjacent to the High Temperature Materials Laboratory, will house the next generation of highly sensitive microanalytical equipment, including two of the worlds highest-resolution electron microscopes. The next generation of analytical equipment is a priority in the chemical sciences. Both materials and chemical sciences are involved in the development of state-of-the-art beam lines at the upgraded HFIR and the SNS.   In nuclear physics, plans are under way for a fundamental neutron physics beam line at SNS, and a neutrino physics laboratory has been proposed to take advantage of the intense pulsed neutrino beams available at the facility. Plans are also being developed to upgrade the Holifield Radioactive Ion Beam Facility as a bridge to the next-generation radioactive ion beam facility.   The physical sciences agenda for the next five years is aggressive but achievable, provided we focus our resources and fully involve our partners. Laboratory-Directed R&D and program development investments have already paid off in positioning the Laboratory for the nanoscience center and in winning more than $10 million in new nanoscale science research programs over the next several years. Similar focused investments are strengthening neutron science, materials science, chemistry and nuclear physics. Collaborative outreach to other DOE programs and to university partners is providing leverage and broadening impacts. The outcome will be a Laboratory with unsurpassed capabilities in key areas of physical science for DOE and the nation.    Team UT-Battelle volunteers arrive in force at local events   Team UT-Battelle volunteers are making their mark on several major charitable events and activities this fall.   At the October 20 Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation Race for the Cure, 169 Team UT-Battelle members participated, winning the first-place award in the largest corporate team category. Team co-chairs were Wendell Ely and Nina Roberts. Close to 10,000 people took part in that event, held on the University of Tennessee campus in Knoxville.   Team UT-Battelle was also a strong presence in the American Diabetes Associations 2.5-mile Walk for Diabetes, held the following day. The 500-plus participants raised $70,000Team UT-B had 100 participants and turned in about $10,000. In addition, UT-Battelle made a corporate contribution of $3,000. ORNL Director Bill Madia served as general chairman of the walk.   Team UT-Battelle is also delving into the fine arts. A call went out for volunteer stagecraft workers for the Oak Ridge Playhouses upcoming production of Peter Pan, which runs November 22 through December 2. ORNLs Bob Wham has enlisted Team UT-Battelle support for the current season of productions for both the playhouse and junior playhouse, and volunteers are still needed.   Finally, Team UT-Bs Habitat for Humanity project is now a home for a Heiskell family, a scant five months after the project began. See the Lab Notes item on page 3.   If youd like to participate in Team UT-Battelle projects or have a project or cause that you think the team might be able to help, contact Bill Pardue, 576-0235, or Brenda Hackworth, 574-4160. B.C.       Bethel Valley Rd. closed to trucks   Bethel Valley Road, the main access route into ORNL, was closed to all trucks except those that have direct business with the Lab on October 30 following  consultation with DOE.   Trucks affected are defined as all vehicles larger than a pickup truck or those towing a trailer. The road will remain closed to trucks indefinitely.  Personal vehicles will still be permitted on Bethel Valley Road.   The decision is one of a number of security actions taken following the September 11 terrorist attacks.       Write it down   Mark Dobbs more or less sits in the captains chair of ORNLs central computing facility. As the facilitys manager, he holds a key position in the Labs shift to paperless business and communications over the past decade. The Building 4500-North facility runs the Labs scientific computing and business administration computing, databases, e-mail you name it. If things get unplugged in central computing, the on-line Lab pretty much comes to a standstill.   For that reason, the facility staff keeps a scrupulous record of daily routine operations and maintenanceor just about anything worth noting, including visits by dignitaries. Ironically, in the facility that has moved ORNL toward electronic operations, those notes are handwritten in a logbookjust like notes were written when they built this place. Just like Columbus used, for that matter.   The shift log book was started back in the 1960s as a good way to do business, Mark, an SAIC employee, says. Its since been incorporated into our conduct of operations. Its valuable for the 12-hour shift workers who come back from long breaksthey can catch up with whats happened.   The logbook, now into its 35th volume, is a historical record of just about everything significant thats ever happenedcomputerwiseat ORNL. It notes when the workhorse PDP10the machine that was system number one on the old system select networkwas shut down, on Dec. 10, 1994. It notes when ORNLs e-mail system went down for a day or two and when the Labs first trendsetting supercomputer, the Intel Paragon, was delivered.   Its all right there. Written down on paper. Kind of makes you think.     ORNLs own modern marvels   Those who make  Modern Marvels  part of their nightly TV fare may soon see some familiar faces on it. The show is getting together an episode on the Manhattan Projectand getting that story obviously involves a trip to Oak Ridge.     ORNL veterans John Gillette (left) and Don Trauger (seated) ham it up for the  Modern Marvels  camera crew on location at the Graphite Reactor Museum.     ORNL veterans Don Trauger and John Gillette recently filmed a session for the show at the Graphite Reactor Museum. John, who once directed the Isotopes Division, described his role loading uranium into the fabled reactor when it first went critical on the morning of Nov. 4, 1943. Don shared memories from his five-decade career in nuclear energy technology, including his first research efforts at ORNL involving K-25s gaseous diffusion process.   Its not the first time a cable-TV production has used Oak Ridge and the Graphite Reactor for a backdrop. British historian James Burke filmed an episode here for his Discovery Channel  Connections2  series back in 1993.   ORNL Director Emeritus Alvin Weinberg and Lab Director Bill Madia were interviewed for the History Channel show at Weinbergs home on the ridge. Six other interviewees gave accounts of life and work in Oak Ridge during the Manhattan years. Whatever makes the final cut, it should be an interesting show. Check local listings.     Moving day arrives for HFH couple   Team UT-Battelles Habitat for Humanity house, a project that began in May, was dedicated on October 20. The structure, located in the Heiskell community with a priceless view of the Cumberlands, represents the toil of up to 250 volunteers from around a dozen ORNL divisions, who helped a regular crew of Habitat volunteers with the construction.     Jerry, Ellen and Ellie Goodman (with Habitat for Humanity official Heide Croce) now live in their home in Heiskell.     Jerry and Ellen Goodman, formerly of Oliver Springs, contributed their own sweat equity and will own and occupy the home with their daughter Ellie, who is tickled with her new Winnie-the-Pooh blue bedroom. The Goodmans received the keys, a tool kit and a Bible from the Team UT-Battelle organizers led by Jim and Brenda Hackworth.   Team UT-Battelles participation in the Habitat build came as the result of a challenge by Lab Modernization Project Director Tim Myrick, who proposed that UT-Battelle match a $15,000 contribution from Tim and his wife, Teresa. Half of UT-Bs $15,000 went to the Habitat build, and the rest was applied to the Aid to Distressed Families of Appalachian Counties project that refurbishes existing houses.   The Habitat organization commented on how smoothly this build went, says Tim. We had good-sized, dedicated crews whenever needed, and they didnt have to bring in professionals to fix much of what we had done!   The Team UT-Battelle project was the 23rd home built by the Anderson County Habitat organization, and it was a project that went safely.   Probably the most amazing aspect of this build was that none of the Team UT-Battelle volunteers got hurt or hurt each other during the construction, Tim says. We should also feel good that Lee (Riedinger) only ruined one power tool.     United Way goal topped again   ORNL staff members have again pushed the annual ORNL United Way campaign over its goal. The goal for the August 1September 14 drive for 2001 was $565,000. By the close of the campaign, the total raised was $601,181.98, marking 106 percent of the goal. UT-Battelle Corporation contributed an additional $55,000, including designations of $19,100 for Anderson County and $20,300 for Knox County, making the grand total $656,181.98.   Calling this years campaign a great team effort, ORNL campaign chairman Harvey Gray expresses his sincere thanks to allthe campaign committee, division coordinators, solicitors, and, especially, you, the contributorsfor making the campaign a success.        — Reported by Bill Cabage                      Art of the possible    National Security Directorates trio explores a cornucopia of Oak Ridge technologies   All three are retired colonels, so they are well versed in the role science and technology play in warfare and national security. For the past three months the former Army officers have been learning how well ORNL can plug into the national security missions ever-increasing S&T needs and requirements.     The National Security Directorates new triumvirate are (from left) Bob Leicht, Gary Steimer and Rich Stouder.     The task of effectively applying new ideas and capabilities to national defense has attained a new-found urgency.   ORNL is an untapped resource for the Department of Defense and other U.S. government agencies, says Rich Stouder, who recently completed, along with his compatriots Bob Leicht and Gary Steimer, an intensive orientation they refer to as boot camp.   The boots actually hit the road running about three months ago in support of a U.S Army program called Objective Force Warrior, a Defense Department initiative to explore technologies the soldier of the near future will need to be dominant on the battlefields of the future.   The events of September 11 have added timeliness to their task. Since that day, the three have been working on a plan to demonstrate how Oak Ridge technologies can assist in counterterrorism, cyber warfare and homeland security.   In fact, shortly after the terrorist attacks, the National Security Directorate asked Lab researchers to apply your creativity toward technologies for the fight against terrorism. The respondents filled an auditorium and their deliberations resulted in a thick book of ideas and proposals.   Last month Associate Lab Director for National Security Frank Akers and ORNL Corporate Fellows Council Chairman Tom Wilbanks invited Lab researchers to a series of brainstorming sessions, organized into subject areas, to gather innovative ideas. Thats where the work will really start for the three ex-colonels and their colleagues, who include Dick Davis, Harvey Gray, Vivian Baylor and Art Clemons.   We have to figure out when and where these technologies might apply to this long-term fight, develop a marketing plan for them and tailor that plan for each customerthe Immigration and Naturalization Service, FBI or Defense Department, for instance, says Bob.   The three were invited by Akers to come as advocates and business developers for ORNL to the Defense Department and other government agencies. Weve all enjoyed this transition from our previous careers to the life and community surrounding Oak Ridge, says Rich.     We see things that could solve problems, in time, that we faced when we were on active duty.     NSDs Tim Vane set up the boot camp, an intensive introduction to ORNLs technological capabilities. They spent a week in October going through the Lab, talking to different directors and principal investigators, or PIsthe researchers who lead the projects.   We consider ourselves in direct support of the PIs, to assess their technologies, see if there is a customer and then match them up to bring those applications home, Bob says.   The Armys Objective Force Warrior program represents a new approach by the military in going outside for new technologies that can be applied on the battlefields of the new century. It has become readily apparent that many traditional concepts of warfare no longer apply.   Says Bob, with just enough militaryspeak: Our ultimate objective is to see if there are leap ahead technologies that can create a force overmatch that makes the U.S. soldier far superior. He already is, but we want to see how we can stretch that overmatch with potential and future adversaries. An open aim is to expose a group of outside experts to the art of the possiblein technological terms in the next 5 to 10 yearsof what can be adopted for use by the Army.   Rich characterizes Oak Ridges participation in Objective Force Warrior as a seminal event. The chief scientist for the Army went to a science and technology centerOak Ridgeand asked for an outside-the-Army look at Objective Force Warriorhelp the Army learn the art of the possible with a fresh set of eyes.   The three note that forging links with national security is not new to ORNL. Their presence does represent a stronger thrust toward establishing those vital relationships and discovering where the technologies and needs fit together. There are people here who have done this job before and are still doing it, Bob says. Were here to help focus the effort back to the Department of Defense and other agencies. Weve doubled the National Security Directorates capacity here in terms of Work-For-Others business development.   Those efforts are targeted toward continuing and building on ORNLs prestige and reputation with its customer baseraising consciousness of the capabilities the Oak Ridge complex represents, both for its intellectual capital and in bringing together diverse competencies.   Wed only been here a couple of weeks when we were tasked to go out and find ORNL matches for 20 technologies, Gary recounts. These PIs were amazing. They not only described their own but went out and found others in the research communities. The capabilities that are available here are truly amazing.   Gary, Rich and Bob represent nearly 100 years of military experience. Says Gary: Weve all experienced instances in our careers where weve said, Boy, if we just had  this , we could solve this problem. In the short time weve been here weve seen those opportunities jumping up all over the place. We see things that could solve problems, in time, that we faced when we were on active duty.   Some of the ORNL technologies the trio notes are in the areas of logistical systems and in software such as CFAST. This system for the first time allows a commander to build and rapidly deploy a military force with the necessary coordination of troops, equipment and suppliesan extremely complicated taskin an integrated fashion, and on the fly. In the old days, says Bob, you loaded an airplane with a diagram and little cutouts of trucks and supplies that you fit together.   They also cite ORNLs chem-bio detection research, thermal management technologies such as graphite foam, wireless sensor technology, ultra-wideband communications systems and scalable weapons such as frangible ammunition and variable-speed bullets.   The PIs are at the nucleus of everything we do. They are the heart of the Lab. Weve come to learn that very quickly, Gary says, speaking for the group.   Especially since September 11, there is a tremendous amount of patriotism that runs through the Lab, says Rich. Those scientists truly want to contribute their science to the nation. B.C.     2000 Benefit Plans Summary Annual Report   Plan Participants and Beneficiaries:   (The 2000 benefit plans report has been prepared in accordance with instruction from the U.S. Department of Labor and is required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.)   This report summarizes the annual reports of the benefit plans provided by the sponsoring employers, BWXT Y-12, L.L.C. (Employer Identification Number: 54-1987297) and UT-Battelle, L.L.C.

The sponsoring employers offered benefit plans under three structures during calendar year 2000.  The qualified retirement and savings plans are multiple employer plans, with both employers participating and under an administrative services agreement, BWXT Y-12, L.L.C. serving as the plan sponsor and plan administrator.  Five health and welfare plans (The Group Health Plan, The Dental Assistance Plan, The Group Life Plan, The Special Accident Plan, and the Travel Accident Plan) were provided under a Multiple  Employer Welfare Agreement, with an administrative services agreement that has BWXT Y-12, L.L.C. serving as the plan administrator.  The individual companies sponsored separate health and welfare plans for Long Term Disability, Employee Assistance, Education Assistance, Cafeteria Plan and a Severance Plan for Salaried Employees.

The items listed below are included in that report.      an accountants report  assets held for investment  transactions in excess of five percent of plan assets     Multiple Employer Welfare Agreement (MEWA)    Under this agreement, the participating employers jointly offer health and welfare plans.  Insurance policies for the plans included in the MEWA are held in trust by the Oak Ridge Insurance Benefit Trust.  This is a summary of the plans included in the MEWA.     Group Health Plan    The health plan operates under contracts between the participating employers and various health care providers which include true insurance contracts (premiums paid for services provided) and other insurance arrangements that require that the participating companies will supply funds for the payment of all claims due under the terms of the contracts, up to a specified maximum determined each plan year.  For the plan year 2000, the maximum was $57,208,267.  The companies share the cost of the group health plans with the participants by charging premiums to the employees.   For the plan year ended December 31, 2000, the total premiums paid were $34,261,451, the total claims paid were $74,510,546 and administrative expenses were $899,565.  $22,127,180 of funds were provided by employees to pay these claims and expenses and $88,444,382 was provided by the employers.   The financial statements of the Group Health Plan also reflect the postretirement benefit obligations of the employers.  This obligation represents the present value of future benefits to be paid to covered participants.  The benefit obligation is determined by the plan actuaries.  As of December 31, 2000, the benefit obligation was $721,149,440 as compared to the benefit obligation at January 1, 2000 of $707,767,087.  The increase in benefit obligation of $13,382,353 is attributed to a change in benefit obligation of $13,331,000 and an increase in claims incurred but not yet reported of $51,353.     Group Life Plan    The group life plan operates under true insurance contracts between the participating employers and Metropolitan Life Insurance Company.  The companies share the cost of the group life plan with the participants by charging premiums to the employees.   For the plan year ended December 31, 2000, the total premiums paid were $3,284,149.  $2,583,894 of funds were provided by employees to pay these claims and $700,255 was provided by the employers.  Actual claims incurred and charged by the insurance company totaled $6,358,242.  The insurance company released $4,306,106 of the Premium Stabilization Reserve during the year.   The financial statements of the Group Life Plan also reflect the postretirement benefit obligations of the employers.  This obligation represents the present value of future benefits to be paid to covered participants.  The benefit obligation is determined by the plan actuaries.  As of December 31, 2000, the benefit obligation was $97,506,000 as compared to the benefit obligation at January 1, 2000 of $97,235,000.  The increase in benefit obligation of $271,000 is attributed to a change in benefit obligation.

Colors coordinated    Display and care for the Stars and Stripes properly    The Stars and Stripes, never out of vogue, are hot fashion nowadays, adorning offices, t-shirts, mailboxes and pickup trucks. But flying the colors entails certain responsibilities and protocols. It wouldnt be a bad time to review what every Boy or Girl Scout knows about caring for and showing respect for the nations emblem.     Members of the ORNL Protective Force raise the flag during a past Veterans Day ceremony.     Our flag information was gathered from a National Flag Foundation pamphlet,  Our Flag , the Sons of Union Veterans of the Civil War Website (suvcw.org/flag.htm) and consultation with Kaye Johnson, ORNLs nearest thing to a vexillologist.    Care and Handling    Hold the flag carefully. Never let it touch the ground, floor, water or merchandise.   There is a certain way to fold the flaga two-person operation resulting in a triangular shape with only the stars showing.   Always carry the flag aloft and free. Never fly or carry it horizontally.   Keep the flag clean. Never let it become torn, soiled or damaged.   Worn or damaged flags should be disposed of in a dignified manner, preferably by burning. Old Glory should never be relegated to the landfill.   The flag must never be used for advertising purposes. Never embroider it on household items or pieces of clothing. It should never be used as part of a costume or athletic uniform. However, it is proper to attach a flag patch to the uniform of military personnel, firefighters, police and members of patriotic organizations, provided the patch is properly affixed.    Displaying the banner    On a wall, the flag should be displayed with the blue field to the observers top left.  Always display the flag with the blue star field up. The flag is to be flown upside down only as a distress signal.   Displayed with other countries in the United States, it should be displayed to its own right (observers left). In times of peace, no nations flag should be higher than anothers.   With subordinate flags, such as state flags, the U.S. flag should be at the center and should be highest on the staff. The only state flag allowed to be flown as high as the U.S. flag is that of Texas, because it was once a sovereign nation.   When flown on a staff, the flag should be hoisted briskly and lowered ceremoniously.   Unless its an all-weather flag, it should not be flown in bad weather. Unless it is properly illuminated, it should be lowered at night.   The flag should not be draped over the hood, top, sides or back of a vehicle. When the flag is displayed on a motorcar, the staff must be fixed firmly to the chassis or clamped to the right front fender.   The flag is traditionally flown at half-staff only upon the death of a prominent federal or state government figure. However, changes in the flag code in 1976 offer much leeway. Essentially, it is flown at half staff by Presidential order. When flown at half staff, it should be raised to the peak for an instant and then lowered to the halfway point of the mast.   There are myriad intricate rules about various ways to display the flag. A good rule of thumb is that, on American soil, it should never be superceded by any other banner.    Showing respect    Flag pins, currently very popular, should be worn on the left lapel, close to the heart.   Face the flag with the right hand placed over the heart when it is is raised or lowered, when the pledge of allegiance is recited, when the national anthem is played and when it passes in review.   This may be one of the most-often ignored protocols: Mens hats and other headdress, including and especially ball caps, should be removed and held in the right hand, which is then placed above the heart, any time the pledge of allegiance is recited, when the national anthem is played and when the colors pass by during processions or parades, including the Santa Claus parade.   The flag code appears to discourage disposable renditions of the banner, such as those printed on paper napkins or boxes. However, toy flags, such as those reproduced on newsprint and mounted on toothpicks, are commonly accepted. While not subject to as stringent a code as an authentic U.S. Flag, they should be accorded the same due respect and treatment as the national emblem.   Fly your flag any time. Fly it properly. Fly it proudly.  B.C.

GX250-51-1911742	"Nancy Lewis NOAA's Climate Observation Teacher at Sea Daily Logs Day 1: Friday, September 14, 2003 Nuku Hiva, Marquesas Islands, French Polynesia Personal Log: I arrived in Nuku Hiva on Friday, September 12, 2003 after flying from Honolulu to Los Angeles, and from there to Tahiti. I spent one night in Papeete, Tahiti, then boarded another flight for Nuku Hiva in the Marquesas Islands, 3 hours by air from Tahiti. From the air I could see many of the other islands and coral atolls that make up French Polynesia, and which are strung out over one thousand miles of ocean. The Marquesas Islands are one of 5 island groups comprising French Polynesia. The other island groups are the Society Islands, the Austral Islands, the Gambier Islands, and the Tuamotus. The plane landed on the southern end of Nuku Hiva, its landing strip right beside the ocean, as the island rises sharply into craggy peaks affording little flat, coastal ground. I was greeted by Jean Claude, who asked me if I spoke French, as he informed me, in English, that he would be my driver to the village of Taiohae, on the other side of the island. We soon departed in Jean Pierre's Land Rover, and it was to be a two hour ride over a very rough, unpaved road, definitely a four-wheel drive track. The road wound its way up into the mountains of the interior, and the views were spectacular. One particularly deep valley, almost at the summit, is called the Grand Canyon, and it aptly deserves that name. We bounced over the deeply rutted, twisting dirt road, and I was very glad that the rainy season was past, as I could tell that the road would have been absolutely treacherous under wet conditions. In many places, we were right on the edge of steep precipices, with no protection, but Jean Pierre was an excellent driver. Along the way I was observing the plants and trees, and saw many that were the same or similar to what we have in Hawaii. We began to descend out of the steep crests of the interior mountains, and passed pastures with cows and horses grazing. All at once we came to a paved road, and Jean Pierre joked that we had reached the ""freeway"". A young Marquesan waved to us from his horse. A freeway indeed! Soon the village of Taiohae was laid out below us, nestled around the horseshoe-shaped bay, truly a delightful scene of tropical tranquility. We descended into the village and came to The Pearl Lodge, my accommodations while in Nuku Hiva. The grounds of The Pearl are a botanical garden, carefully tended by Rose Corser, an American woman who started the lodge with her late husband, Frank. The bungalows are built in the Tahitian style, faced with split bamboo, and most tastefully decorated. My lanai faced the bay, and at last, I could have a rest from my long journey, and drink in the serene beauty of Nuku Hiva. In the afternoon, needing some exercise after two days of being on an airplane, I rode a bicycle from the lodge to the far end of the village, and stopped at the quay at the end of the harbor. Young men were just coming in on outrigger canoes and there were a number of people from the village there. On my way back to the lodge, I was hailed by some girls from the school, who said ""stop"" and indicated they wanted to talk to me. They soon brought their teacher over to talk to me in English, as my French is not very good. It was wonderful to meet these young people and to explain why I was on their island. I had dinner that evening with Rose and Tom Nolan, a scientist representing NASA from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and who would also be joining the NOAA Ship Ka'imimoana. Tom endeavored to coax Rose into telling some stories from her adventurous past, as evidently she had sailed around the world and certainly had a wealth of tales to tell. My first day on Nuku Hiva closed with the moon shining brightly over the bay, back-lighting the peaks of the mountains cradling the bay, and with the soft whisper of the surf a lullaby of the island.   Day 2: September 13, 2003 Nuku Hiva, Marquesas Islands, French Polynesia Despite my intention to catch up some sleep, I woke up for the stunning sunrise across the bay. Because of some dense tropical foliage obscuring my view from the lanai, it was not until I walked over to breakfast that I could see that the NOAA Ship Ka'imimoana had arrived and was anchored peacefully in the bay. My colleague, Tom Nolan, a scientist from NASA, had gone to meet the ship, so I took advantage of this opportunity to steal back to my bungalow and read. I had brought with me a copy of Herman Melville's Typee, which is the semi-biographical account of how he jumped ship on this very island of Nuku Hiva, and escaped over into the next valley to live for a period of time with the notorious Typee natives. I mused on his descriptions of tyrannical sea captains, and inhumane treatment aboard his ship, and dreamed myself of stealing over to Taipivai Valley to visit the very place of his mild imprisonment with the ""fierce Typees"". My reveries were soon broken by the arrival of the party from the ship, and soon I was sitting and conversing with Tetsuro Isono, the scientist from Japan who was on board for the first leg of the KA's mission from Honolulu. I also met Diane Bernstein, from the University of South Florida, who is working on calibrating an instrument designed to analyze CO 2 dissolved in the water. It was great to meet these people and all of the other folks who make up the crew of the Kai'mimoana. The day ended for all of us in a very special way. After dinner, a local dance troupe came and entertained the party with traditional Marquesan dancing and drumming. The young men and girls were decked out in hand made costumes of feathers, beads, and raffia, and they brought out huge homemade drums. The performance was a spirited dance that had the bare, painted chests of the young men glistening with sweat. The only complaint was that the dancing didn't go on all night. I thought again about Melville's time that he spent here on Nuku Hiva. His story helped to fuel the romantic ideas associated with the remote South Sea Islands. I walked back to my bungalow with the scent of tiares wafting down the path, and the moonlight reflecting off the waters of the bay.   Day 3: September 14, 2003 Nuku Hiva: Marquesas Islands, French Polynesia Personal Log: A group of us from the Pearl Lodge signed on to make the day long trip back into the interior of the island to see a one thousand foot waterfall. We were to have Jean Pierre, a native Marquesan, as our guide, but first we had to take a boat over to Hakaui Bay to reach the trailhead. Once we reached the mouth of the bay, things got really interesting, with our pilot expertly navigating the moderate sea swells that seemed much bigger from our small craft. We came well south of the bay passing sheer headlands that plunged right to the sea, and then entered into Hakaui Bay facing a gray sand beach fringed coconut trees, the perfect picture of a wild, tropical beach. As we all gathered on shore to begin the trek, an old Marquesan woman appeared with a dog on a leash, seeming to come out of nowhere. She reminded me of the stories of Pele back home in Hawaii. We soon started our trek, and found the very small village of Hakaui, and Jean Pierre, our Marquesan guide, told us that there had been many people living in this valley until 1942 when a malaria epidemic forced most of the inhabitants to leave. We also met Daniel, a spry Marquesan who'd lived in the village since 1927. The hike to the waterfall first passed through some of the village's cultivated cleared areas where they were growing bananas, coconuts, and papayas. We soon entered some dense tropical jungle, and were glad for the deep shade provided against the hot sum. We passed many stone foundations of houses, called in Marquesan ""papais"" , remnants of former human settlement. At one point, I saw a stone tiki sitting on top of one of these papais, and it seemed to be guarding some secret. Although there was a trail, we had to cross the river several times, and so we definitely needed Jean Pierre's services. Just before reaching the falls, we encountered several hunters on horseback, who had their kill wrapped in cloth and slung over their saddles. A little further on, spiky ramparts of needlelike rocks rose up five hundred feet, and Renault, our other guide, told us that there were the bones of human sacrifices hidden in the clefts of one of the needles. We soon reached the base of the falls with its sheer cliffs rising up in a narrow gorge that reminded me of certain places in Utah. There was a spacious pool easily accessible, but further back behind some rocks was the pool where the cascade roared down. Several of us jumped into the cold fresh water, and eventually we found a way into the cascade pool, and discovered a hidden grotto behind the rocks. The water was very cold, but invigorating. After our swim, and a bit of lunch, we started back , but took a slightly different route, arriving at the beach of Hakatea Bay where our boats were waiting. The ride back to Taiohae was exciting, and well, dangerous. The seas had kicked up to between 9 and 12 feet, and we were literally holding on for dear life to stay in the boat as it crashed into one trough and rose up to meet the next: and we had no life preservers! Jean Pierre was in my boat, and a few times had a worried look on his face, but I enjoyed it immensely. We cruised into the harbor past the KA and piled into the back of an open Land Rover to go back to the lodge. It was satisfying to turn in early after the excitement of our expedition into the interior of the island, and to once again hear the soft sounds of surf at the close of a great day.   Day 4: Monday, September 15, 2003 Nuku Hiva, Marquesas Islands, French Polynesia Personal Log: Several of us piled in Rose Corser's Land Rover and were dropped of at the school in Taiohae, where we soon found the principal's office. I was pressed into service as interpreter since the principal did not speak English. We were directed to one of the classes, where Tom Nolan and Tetsuro Isono made a short presentation to the students. ""Le professeur"" explained a little about the mission of the Ka'imimoana, and I was able to understand a quite bit of what he said. Except for the language being French, I would have thought I was in a classroom in Hawaii. The students then came outside with us and sang to us in the Marquesan language. With the bay in the background, the KA moored in the harbor, it was one of those ""island moments"". Our objective today wast definitely one of diplomacy and good will. Our next stop was the Mayor's office where there was to be a presentation from the Ka'imimoana to the VIP's of Nuku Hiva. The current mayor of Nuku Hiva was there, along with the past 2 mayors, the island Chief, the head of the Gendarmerie (Police) and the French representative for Nuku Hiva. Captain Mark Ablondi presented them with an enlarged satellite photo of Nuku Hiva. Many speeches were made, expressing appreciation for the collaborative work of all the parties in the effort to better understand the world's oceans. It was now time to take the water taxi out to the Ka'imimoana for the tour given to the VIP's. This was my first time on board the ship, in fact, my first time on board any ship! I joined in the VIP tour of what would be my floating home for the next 2 weeks. After lunch on board, a class of students from the school joined us and I enjoyed trying out my French with them, and just generally enjoying being around the kids. By the time they served ice cream in the mess, several of the crew on board had become celebrities, signing autographs and the subject of many 14 year old girls' giggles. For the last night on Nuku Hiva almost the entire crew went out for pizza after saying our goodbyes to Rose and Diana, the manager of The Pearl. It was nearly eleven by the time we took the water taxi to the ship, and I was shown to my stateroom. Tetsuro had flown back to the States, and I was taking over his berth on the ship. I must admit that my few hours on board earlier in the day had given me a bit of a queasy stomach, so I regretfully swallowed some dramamine before turning the lights out. We would get underway in the morning continuing the work of the Ka'imimoana near the equator. Bon nuit and au revoir Nuku Hiva!   Day 5: Tuesday, September 16., 2003 Nuku Hiva, Marquesas Islands, French Polynesia 0815 Anchor Aweigh: Underway  Weather Observation Log: 0100 Latitude: 8 degrees, 56.7' S Longitude: 139 degrees, 59.1' W Visibility: 12 nautical miles (nm) Wind direction: 100 degress Wind speed: 18 knots (kts) Sea wave height: 5-6 feet Swell wave height: 5-7 feet Sea water temperature: 27.2 degrees C Sea level pressure: 1013.8 mb (millibars) Dry bulb temperature: 28.0 degress C Wet bulb temperature: 23.0 degrees C Cloud cover: 2/8 Cumulus, Altocumulus Personal Log: Today is my first full day on the Ka'imimoana, and we steamed out of the harbor of Nuku Hiva at 8:15 am past the huge rocks that guard both sides of the bay. I was out on the forward deck for much of the morning, admiring the striking coastline of Nuku Hiva as we got underway in what were somewhat rough sea conditions. I took some pictures of the dramatic cliffs that break off sharply down to the sea with not a sign of any human habitation. I was somewhat wistful at departing this very unspoiled island, but thought, perhaps some day I will get to return. After all, I never in my life expected to ever visit such a remote spot as the Marquesas Islands. Off in the distance, so shrouded in mist it seemed almost a mirage, could be faintly discerned another one of the Marquesas Islands, its craggy peaks rising up like castle ramparts in a fairy tale. I remained on deck taking in the salty breeze, but the ship was heaving up and down in seas that were at least 6-9 feet. I thought I should go back to my stateroom and finish my unpacking and arranging my things, as everything on board a ship has to be ""ship-shape"", meaning neat, clean and orderly. I was aware that I really wasn't feeling all that well, having developed somewhat of a queasy feeling from the rocking of the ship while in the bay at Nuku Hiva. I went outside a few more times to catch some final glimpses of island we were leaving behind, and it seemed that the seas were definitely rough. Uh, oh, I had heard horror stories about some crew members being seasick for days on end. By this time, I was feeling quite ill. I talked to several ""old hands"" on board, and several urged me to take it easy, and maybe try and sleep. We were steaming to our destination at 4 degrees South Latitude from Nuku Hiva, which is at 8 degrees South latitude, and so were basically headed north, along the 139th meridian of Longitude. We had no buoy operations scheduled today, so I decided it would be best to just take it easy. There is nothing worse than being seasick, although I never really got that bad. I took some more Dramamine and hoped for the best. The few times I did get up in the afternoon to go down to the mess for some tea, I saw other crew members, and they were telling me it was unusually rough, and I was not the only one feeling sick. So there isn't much to tell about today, except that they say that a little seasickness comes with first going to sea until you get your ""sea legs"". As I turned in for the night, I imagine my face looked a little green, and I was fervently hoping I would get those legs as quickly as possible. From the Plan of the Day: Notice: "" Secure all items for sea"" Does that include lunch? Aloha from the KA!   Day 6: Wednesday, September 17, 2003 Plan of the Day: 0900: Recover/Deploy 5 S 140 W Buoy CTD after anchor drop AOML Drifter after buoy flyby  Weather Observation Log: 0100 Latitude: 5 degrees, 2' S Longitude: 139 degrees, 54.7' W Visibility: 12 nautical miles (nm) Wind direction: 090 Degrees Wind speed: 21 knots (kts) Sea wave height: 4-6 feet Swell wave height: 7-9 feet Sea water temperature: 26.8 degrees C Sea level pressure: 1012.7 mb. Dry bulb temperature: 27.1 degrees C Wet bulb temperature: 23.8 degrees C Cloud cover: 2/8 Cumulus Science and Technology Log: The primary mission of the Ka'imimoana is to service and maintain the TAO/Triton array of weather buoys strung out along the equatorial Pacific Ocean. TAO stands for Tropical Atmosphere Ocean and Triton is the name of the Japanese component of the array. These buoys are jointly maintained by Japan and the U.S. in an effort to better understand how the oceans affect climate and weather, especially in the regions close to the Equator. Today I was able to observe first hand the entire operation of retrieving and deploying what used to be called the Atlas buoy. They are now designated as TAO buoys. These buoys are placed at strategic points north, south and on the Equator. The first leg of this mission began in Honolulu on August 21, 2003. Honolulu is the home base port for the Ka'imimoana, which I hope you all know means ""ocean seeker"" in Hawaiian. Tetsuro Isono from JAMSTEC (Japan Marine Science and Technology Center) was on board as part of the Teacher at Sea program for the first leg from Honolulu to Nuku Hiva. You can access his broadcasts on the NOAA Teacher at Sea website. Although he was speaking Japanese, an English translation can be printed out for you to follow. In his broadcasts, Tetsuro interviews many of the scientists on board and introduces much of the equipment and buoys that are used in this project. It would be very helpful for you to view these broadcasts in order to get a working background for the buoys and their operations, but I will also be giving explanations during the project. The first thing in retrieving the buoy is that is that it is sighted from the bridge of the ship. These are moored buoys, so they remain in position where they are placed. Once the buoy is sighted, the RHIB (Reinforced Hull Inflatable Boat) is lowered from the ship, and a crew is sent out to visually inspect and to remove some of the instruments that would be damaged during the retrieval process. The anemometer, rain gauge, and Patrick Ahearn, the Chief Scientist and one other ""volunteer"". The buoys are usually very slimy and slippery having been out in the ocean for a period of several months, so climbing on the buoy can be a dangerous affair, especially if there are significant waves and swells. One of my students has asked the question: ""What information is gathered by the buoys?"" The buoys gather data constantly on the following: wind speed and direction, air temperature, relative humidity, rainfall, downwelling shortwave radiation, downwelling longwave radiation, barometric pressure, sea surface and subsurface temperature, salinity, water pressure, and ocean currents. You can find more details about the instruments for measuring these variables at this website: http:www.pmel.noaa.gov/tao/proj_over/sensors.shtml. The data is transmitted via NOAA polar satellites and is actually picked up by computers located on Wallops Island. This information is used by scientists all over the world who are studying the Pacific Ocean and its relationship to weather and climate, particularly the El Nino and its opposite La Nina. I will be talking more about these as the cruise progresses.   After the buoy was retrieved, a replacement buoy was deployed. I will be posting pictures on marine life growing on the bottom of the buoy, and it must be cleaned, painted and otherwise used again. The process of retrieving and deploying a new buoy takes approximately 8 hours, cable must be spooled on board, and it is amazing to watch this crew work together to bring it orchestrated event that I will do more to explain as we go along. Personal Log:  the website of the serviced before it is as many meters of all off. It is a well  Today was a full day indeed for me, and thankfully I was over my initial seasickness. The opening act of the morning was my first ride in the RHIB to go out to the buoy. You can see from the weather observations that it was by no means calm seas, so the ride out to the buoy was pretty exciting. I was then put to work helping to spool the Nilspin cable which attaches the mooring to the buoy. The spooling operation takes a long time, and even the ExO (Executive Officer) joins in to help. I observed the entire retrieval and deployment operation, and it basically took the whole day. After dinner, I began training with Randy Ramey, the Survey Technician in charge of the CTD's. I was actually involved in every aspect of the operation under Randy's expert guidance and Tom Nolan, the scientist from NASA was also on hand. I will save an explanation of the CTD for another day, but this instrument is really fascinating to me. It has been a long and exciting day, but very satisfying. I am still learning my way around the ship and getting used to the shipboard schedule I would like to invite anyone who is looking at the website to e-mail your questions to me, which I can include the answer to on my daily logs. Before I close, let me pose a question for you: What is the Dopplar effect? My thanks go out to my colleagues and students at Naalehu Elementary and Intermediate School for helping to make this project a success, and I wish you all a fond Aloha! Nancy Lewis   Day 7: Thursday, September 18, 2003 Plan of the Day: 0130: 0840: 1545: 1800: 2345: 4 S CTD and SOLO 3 S CTD and AOML Visit 2 S 140 W Buoy w/CTD and AOML Shellback Meeting in Main Mess: Shellbacks Only!

For me as for most people, it has always just been ""that line around the globe"", but now that I am out here on this project, I realize that the equator defines more than just the northern and southern hemispheres of the earth. It is here that the ocean currents are being intensively studied in order for us to understand the relationship between the oceans and climate. The 1982-83 El Nino was not predicted by scientists, and it had far-reaching, damaging effects on such diverse places as South America and Australia. It was then that NOAA funded the Tropical Ocean Global Atmosphere project that is the TAO/Triton array. Approximately 50 of the buoys are maintained by the U.S. and the other 20 are maintained by Japan. It took 10 years to complete and in essence, it is a 6,000 mile antennae for scientists to monitor conditions in the equatorial Pacific. Normally, the trade winds blow from east to west, but in an El Nino event, the situation is reversed. The phenomenon has long been observed by South American fisherman, and usually occurs around the time of Christmas, hence its name which means ""Christ child"". The great ocean currents are moved by the wind, but around the equator, there are counter, below-sea currents. Instruments in the TAO/Triton array are involved in collecting important data on these below surface currents. Each TAO buoy is moored to the bottom of the ocean using steel cable surrounded in plastic and railroad wheels are the anchor. At various depths on the Nilspin, temperature sensors called thermistors are strapped to the cable. The cable conducts a signal to the surface of the buoy. These cables can become damaged (by sharks biting them!) or otherwise degraded, and then the signal will be corrupted. Thus, there is the need for the periodic maintenance which is the main mission of the Ka''mimoana. In addition, some of the buoys are equipped with CO2 sensors, which measure the amount of dissolved CO2 in the water, and which can then be used in studies of global warming. The buoy which we retrieved today stopped working shortly after it was deployed, and it was not known if it had broken free or what had happened. As it turned out, the buoy was there, and has been replaced with a fully functioning buoy. Right now, I am looking at innards of that CO@ sensor, which is in the computer lab and is being analyzed by the Chief Scientist.  Personal Log:   Early this morning, we recovered the ADCP, which is a subsurface buoy. Shortly thereafter, we deployed a new ADCP. ADCP stands for Acoustic Dopplar Current Profiler, and this instrument is used to record data on the below surface currents. I will spend time later discussing this buoy, which looks like a giant orange ball. I spent much of the day catching up on my daily logs, downloading photos and making several video clips to send to the website. It appears that the hurricane did a number on the East Coast., and we probably will not have email communication until at least tomorrow. I have been very happy to get some good questions from the students at Naalehu School on the Big Island, and I am looking forward to hearing from many more of you next week. I also spent time today chatting with the Chief Boatswain, Kamaka, a very hard working Hawaiian young man who spreads a lot of aloha wherever he goes. I have invited Kamaka to come to my school when we get back to Hawaii since he is planning to visit the Big Island. His girlfriend is Marquesan and lives on Nuku Hiva. The sunset this evening at the equator was stunningly beautiful, and there was a rainbow under some misty clouds in the east. I am hoping my photo was able to capture it for you all. We shall remain here at the equator overnight, and I am looking forward to the gentle rocking of the ship once I tumble into my berth later this evening. Question of the Day: What is the Coreolus effect and how does it relate to winds and ocean currents? Aloha from the Ka'imimoana! Nancy Lewis   Day 9: Saturday, September 20, 2003 9/19/03~2015 Deep CTD 0100: pH Profiler 0800: Deploy CO2 Buoy 1600: .5 N CTD 2000: 1 N CTD and SOLO Weather Observation Log: 0100 Latitude: 0 degrees, 1.9' S Longitude: 139 degrees, 49.7 W Visibility: 12 nautical miles (nm) Wind direction: 120 degrees Wind speed: 15 knots Sea wave height: 3-5 feet Swell wave height: 4-6 feet Sea water temperature: 26.1 degrees C Sea level pressure: 1-12.0 mb Dry bulb pressure: 26.3 degrees C Wet bulb pressure: 24.0 degrees C Cloud cover: 48 Cumulus, altocumulus, cirrus Science and Technology Log: Last evening there was a deep cast of the CTD to a depth of 4000 meters. Tom Nolan and I packed lots of styrofoam cups that had been decorated by students in mesh bags, as well as several foam wig heads that had been artistically painted by Kamaka. These bags we attached to the CTD. The idea was to see what would happen to these cups when subjected to the pressures of the ocean at that extreme depth. The effect was quite interesting. The cups were scrunched, the heads shrunken, but all in perfect proportion. As you can see from the Plan of the Day, 2 other CTD casts were done today, both at the regular 1000 foot depth. The pH Profiler is a prototype instrument designed and being tested here by scientists from the University of South Florida, Renate Bernstein and Xuewu (Sherwood) Liu. The purpose of their work is the development of precise, accurate, simple, robust and inexpensive CO2-system measurement procedures for use in global CO2 investigations on NOAA vessels. What they are trying to do is to assess the accuracy, precision and overall performance of the University of South Florida systems compared to the systems used by NOAA over the past 15 years. From what I have gathered so far in talking to these scientists, they are not happy about the performance of their instrument. Let me address the question of AOML drifters. AOML stands for Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory, and these are surface drifting buoys which are deployed by simply tossing them off the fantail of the ship. They are tracked by the Argos satellite and provide SST (Sea Surface Temperature) and mixed layer current information. There is a global array of these drifters and they provide ground truth for NOAA's polar orbiting satellite AVHRR SST maps. Please email Craig Engler@noaa.gov or check out http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/ for more information concerning the AOML drifters. Personal Log: Before leaving Hawaii, I told all my students that it was going to be extremely hot and humid here at the equator. Surprisingly enough for me, that has not been the case at all. It has been actually quite pleasant outside, and of course, there is always a sea breeze blowing. Inside the ship is sometimes like an icebox, especially in the computer lab which is kept at 70 degrees Fahrenheit.   The ship's doctor, Michelle Pelkey, affectionately known as ""Doc"" runs the ship's store every evening from 0730 to 0800. Already I have bought a T-shirt and Aloha shirt emblazoned with the NOAA insignia and Ka'imimoana. They also sell soft drinks, popcorn, hats and other sundry items. Doc is also the ship's recreation director, and has pressed everyone to sign up for tournaments in cribbage, darts, Scrabble, and a card game called Sequence. My evening tonight was spent doing a CTD cast from start to finish with Tom, my colleague from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Tom has written down every step of the procedure, and we were editing his instructions during the entire procedure. Randy must have had a lot of faith in us, because we did the whole CTD cast without his help. The last thing to do on the CTD cast is to hose off the rosette, and I got soaked in the process. Looks like it is a good time to call it a day! Question of the Day: What event occurs this year on September 23rd and what is its significance? Until tomorrow, Nancy Lewis   Day 10: Sunday, September 21, 2003 Sunrise: 0609 Sunset: 1819 Plan of the Day: 0045: 1.5 N CTD 0445: pH profiler Cast 0700: Recover/Deploy 2 N 140 W Buoy CTD after anchor drop AOML after buoy fly by 2230: 3 N CTD and AOML Weather Observation Log: Latitude: 2 degrees, 2.2' N Longitude: 140 degrees, 2.5' W Visibility: 12 nautical miles Wind direction: 140 degrees Wind speed: 15 knots Sea wave height: 3-4 feet Swell wave height: 4-6 feet Sea water temperature: 27.7 degrees C Sea level pressure: 1012.2 mb Air Temperature: 26.7 degrees C Dry bulb pressure: 26.3 degrees C Wet bulb pressure: 24.0 degrees C Cloud cover: 2/8 Cumulus Science and Technology Log: Several other scientists are utilizing the CTD casts in their projects. The first thing that is done when the CTD is brought to the surface is to collect what we have been calling the ""Dickson"" sample A .5 liter sea water sample is collected from the surface and then capped using a small bench-top press. These samples are sent to the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego and are analyzed for dissolved inorganic carbon. This procedure is done by the Survey Technician, and yours truly has learned to do it. Also, scientist Charles Gutter-Johnson , from Bloomsburg University, uses the CTD water samples for the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute research. This involves taking chlorophyll and nutrient samples using a bench-top flourometer. Charles also works to collect barnacles off the retrieved buoys for the Bloomsburg University Barnacle Census. Tom Nolan from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory has been calibrating his instrument, called the MISR, which stands for Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer. What Tom is doing is checking this instrument against NASA's satellite in order to check its calibration. The instrument basically looks like a small oblong box, which he points to the sun to get a reading, and then down at the ocean to get another reading. These checks have to be done at precise times in order to catch the satellite in its orbit overhead. The satellite images are used in weather forecasting and tracking of storms, such as hurricane Isabel. Here is the website address for viewing the satellite image of Isabel taken by MISR: http://www-misr.jpl.nasa.gov. I would love to look at the image myself, but we do not have the internet on the KA. I would also like to give you a website address where you can view a labeled diagram of a buoy. It is:   http://www.pmel.noaa.gov/tao/images/nexgen.gif. Here is a question for you: why do the buoys measure conductivity? To give you somewhat of a hint, conductivity is actually measuring the salinity of the ocean water. How does salinity relate to ocean currents? Personal Log: Today we dedicated the TAO buoy to Naalehu Elementary and Intermediate School! On a large NOAA sticker, I wrote the name of our school, and we had a dedication ceremony where the Captain, John Kermond, our videographer, Tom Nolan and myself signed the sticker. Captain Ablondi and myself then fixed the sticker to the central shaft of the buoy, which is above the water. I am very proud to be a part of the Teacher at Sea program, and be able to share the work on the Ka'imimoana of climate observation. I hope to inspire many of the students at my school, and at schools around the country to a greater interest and study of science, and in particular earth science and oceanography. If we fail to care for the oceans (and it is all one big ocean despite our giving them separate names) we risk upsetting the entire ecosystem of this planet. We need the next generation, those of you in school now, to learn as much as they can about this planet, , the waters that cover 70 % of it, and the atmosphere above us. We finished filming this afternoon just before sunset, and would like to see who can answer this ""brain teaser"" of a question: Why does the ocean foam? Even I do not know the answer to this question, and I pose it for all you budding young scientists out there. The game tournaments have begun, and I just learned how to place the card game ""Sequence"". Tom is my partner and we won 2 out of 3 games that we played against Nicole Colasacco, the Field Operations Officer (the FOO) and Curt Redman, Engine Utilityman. The championship game will be against Doc and the CO (Commanding Officer), Mark Ablondi. According to Doc, whoever wins the first round will be going down when they play her and the CO. We'll see! Questions of the Day: Quiz for prizes! First prize will be a Ka'imimoana T-shirt, Second prize a ship's baseball cap, and Third prize a special Ka'imimoana patch. Here are the question: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. Name the world's 5 oceans. Which one is the largest? How many island groups make up French Polynesia and what are their names? What is La Nina? What does NOAA stand for?  Kia Orana!

You can see from the Daily Log's Plan of the Day when these were deployed, but they are deployed at the following locations: (0-147 E, 0-165 E, 0-170 W, 0-140 W). On which of these locations did we deploy the ADCP on this leg of the cruise? These moorings are subsurface, and the data is only available after their recovery. Typically, the depth is 300 meters, and these buoys use the Dopplar effect to gather data on ocean currents at that depth. I have posted several pictures on the website of the ADCP, and to me, it looks like a satellite when it was on board the ship. In the water, it looked like a big orange fishing bobber. Our buoy ops (operations) are beginning to wind down, and we recovered no TAO buoy today, as you can see from the plan of the day. There was a repair done to the 5 N 140 W buoy. A whole group went out to do that, and used the time while out at the buoy to do a little fishing. Two large fish came back on the RHIB, a yellow-fin tuna and a mahi-mahi. Kamaka was preparing the fish by cutting filets and making poke for tomorrow's lunch. I'd like to make available for teachers a lesson plan submitted by Suzanne Forehand from Virginia Beach City Public Schools. Because the schools have been closed due to the hurricane, it is not available as yet on the web. Teachers may request a copy from me, and I will send it as an attached file to an e-mail. I would like to thank Ms. Forehand for her collaboration on this project, andI hope that their electricity is restored soon. I look forward to hearing from the students at Plaza Middle School in Virginia Beach. Personal Log:   Oh, the life of a lowly Wog! Traditionally, those who have crossed the equator at sea for the first time are treated to a variety of secret initiation ceremonies where one is designated a ""wog"". Shellbacks are those people who have already made the passage, and it is their delight to devise various tortures to inflict on the wogs. The 6 of us on board here were ordered up on the forward deck early this morning, and the fun began. I cannot give away any of these secrets, but suffice it to say that we all got a saltwater shower. From here on until we complete the initiation, we have to wear our clothes in ridiculous ways, and bow and scrape to the honorable shellbacks. At the end of several days of this entertainment for all the shellbacks, we then become a shellback ourselves and will be issued certificates and a card that we will hold on to forever to avoid having to endure the same in the future. In the 19th century this tradition was carried to extremes with such measures as keel-hauling the wogs, and some very servious, life-threatening acts of hazing. It is toned way down from those days, and all is done with a spirit of fun and good humor. I have been busy looking at the photos I have taken on the digital camera, and of course selecting ones to be sent to Maryland to be posted on the website. There were various glitches today with the computer I am working on, so my work had to be done in fits and starts throughout the day. Tom and I played 2 games of sequence this evening against the CO and Doc and we won the championship! The competition is fierce around here because the winners get a T-shirt or cap from the ship's store. I guess I'll find out if it was wise to beat the Captain hands down like that. I am scheduled to play him next in Scrabble. Question of the Day: What is the origin of the word ""hurricane""? Aloha until tomorrow! Nancy Lewis   Day 12: Tuesday, September 23, 2003-09-25 Sunrise: 0608 Sunset: 1815 9/22/03~2330: 6 N CTD 0615: 7N CTD 1300: 8N CTD 2000: Repair 9 N Buoy W/ CTD Weather Observation Log: Latitude: 7 Degrees, 25.3' N Longitude: 140 degrees, 8.0 W Visibility: 12 nautical miles (nm) Wind direction: 170 degrees Wind speed: 10 knots Sea wave height: 3-4 feet Swell wave height: 4-6 feet Sea water temperature: 28.5 degrees C Dry bulb pressure: 30.4 degrees C Wet bulb pressure: 26.3 degrees C Cloud cover: 5/8, Altocumulus, cirrus Air Tempterature: 30.4 degrees C Science and Technology Log: Previously, I explained that there is other scientific work being done on this cruise. One such project is CO2 and pH analysis. Previous to this, NOAA has been using water samples taken from the CTD, and these samples only come from particular depths, generally every 200 meters. The scientists from the University of South Florida have brought along devices which they are testing in order to work out the ""bugs"", from these prototypes. They are called SEAS systems, and are lowered in the water column to a depth of 300 meters at a rate of 6 meters per minute to collect pH profile continuously. The advantage of the SEAS system over taking samples from the CTD is that they get a continuous data, not just data from the specific depths tested by the CTD. The data they produce is therefore much more complete and accurate. In my interview with Dr. Renate Bernstein I asked the question: ""Is your work related to studies of global warming?"" Her answer was: ""absolutely. "" The SEAS system is analyzing dissolved CO2 in the ocean water. Normally, the ocean is considered to be a ""sink"" for CO2 in the atmosphere. Cold water has the capacity to dissolve more CO2 from the atmosphere than hot water. The analogy would be to think of the carbon dioxide in a carbonated soda. If you shake up a cold drink, it doesn't fizz as much. If you do the same thing with a warm soda, it will fizz up much more. How does dissolved CO2 relate to the pH of the ocean? The carbon dioxide combines with water (H20) molecules in the ocean to produce carbonic acid, which has a higher acidity. Thus water with more dissolved CO2 would have a higher pH value. Dr. Bernstein explained that there are areas, however, where the ocean is liberating CO2. She said that was what they were seeing from the data they've collected. The water near the equator where cold water upwelling occurs were the places where CO2 was being diffused into the atmosphere. According to Dr. Bernstein, what they were doing on board this vessel was truly ""cutting edge science"" being done nowhere else in the world. It has been exciting to me and a great honor to share with you some of the science being done on board the Ka'imimoana.   Personal Log: For the first time on this cruise, the weather has become hot and humid. It was not a pleasant day to be out on the deck of the ship, plus they were power washing the deck and acid cleaning the sides of the vessel. Last night I was out with my Planosphere, trying to identify some constellations, but the clouds had started, so visibility was not that good. I did see Sagittarius, which looks like a teapot. Randy, the Survey Tech in charge of the CTD, showed me a computer program that I want to get called ""Starry Night"". You put in your location and the time and date, and it shows the night sky and superimposes images over the constellations: very cool! I almost missed the biggest event of the day, and for me, of this, cruise. John Kermond had told me that the buoy repair was cancelled, so there wouldn't be a last RHIB ride out to the buoy. I had already prepared for bed, when there came a knock at the door. "" Hurry up, they're going on the RHIB!"" I quickly scrambled on some clothes and ran up to the deck, while Doc hunted up a hard hat and life jacket for me. They strapped a Cyalume light onto my vest, John gave me a flashlight, and we were off. I felt a little like what it must have been like on the Titanic, getting into lifeboats in the inky blackness. We roared off, using a powerful light to see the buoy. The water around the buoy was teeming with large fish, mostly mahi. This buoy had been damaged and Patrick Ahearn, the Chief Scientist would be making the necessary repairs. Sometimes, they say, other ships hit the buoy, or fishing boats tie up to the buoy. This was the first time the sea had been relatively calm, and it seemed a good thing, since higher seas would make a repair job much more difficult, like working on a bobbing cork. Patrick swung out onto the buoy, follwed by Nicole Colasacco, the Field Operations Officer who would assist him. In the meantime, we sped back to the KA to pick up replacement instruments, a new rain gauge, a new anemometer, and a new temperature sensor. The ship seemed a long way off, but all of its running lights were on. I thought about how it must have felt for Patrick and Nicole to be all alone in the dark on that buoy while we went back to the ship. As soon as we returned with the instruments, Jimbo set out fishing lines and we bagan to troll. We spent a good 45 mindutes circling the buoy, but got nary a bite. Maybe it just wasn't feeding time. As our eyes got our night vision, we could see the sparkling of bioluminescent creatures in the water all around the boat. The skies were cloudy, so stargazing was out, and eventually it began to rain. Finally, they were finished with the repair job, and it was my turn to get out onto the buoy. I already knew that the donut would be slimy and slippery, and it was. There are several platforms, though, that afford good footing inside the bars of the instrument scaffold. By the time I was up on the buoy, the swells had picked up a little, and actually, there was a terrific current pulling on the buoy. It was a little like riding a bucking bronco! We were out on the buoy operation until well past 11 last night, but I was so glad I hadn't missed my last chance to get on one of the buoys. The fish weren't biting, so we came away empty handed, but they'll be other fishing opportunities as we start the long transit back to Honolulu. Since we have to go right past South Point on the island of Hawaii, there is a chance that students from my school may get to see us, and I'll keep you posted on exactly when that will be. Question of the Day: What is the chemical formula for carbonic acid? Aloha from the KA! Nancy Lewis   Day 13: Wednesday, September 24, 2003 Sunrise: 0613 Sunset: 1828 0600: All wogs on bow Transit to Honolulu Time Change: Set your clocks back one hour to Hawaii time Weather Observation Log: 0100 Latitude: 9 degrees, 57.8; N Longitude: 141 degrees, 41.6' W Visibility: 12 nautical miles (nm) Wind direction: 130 degrees Wind speed: 7 knots Sea wave height: 2-3 feet Swell wave height: 4-6 feet Sea water temperature: 27.8 degrees C Sea level pressure: 1012.2 mb Dry bulb pressure: 27.0 degrees C Wet bulb pressure: 26.0 degrees C Cloud cover: 7/8 Altocumulus, cumulus, altostrattus Air temperature: 27.0 degrees C Science and Technology Log: The phenomenon known as El Nino will be the subject of our discussion today. El Nino is a recurrent weather phenomenon that has been known for years by fisherman along the coasts of South America. During an El Nino, the normally strong easterly tradewinds weaken, bringing warmer than normal currents eastward to the the coasts of Peru and Ecuador. Fishing drops off, and there can be catastrophic effects in weather all the way from Australia and Indonesia to both American continents. During the unpredicted El Nino of 1982-83, the effects began to be felt in May. West of the dateline, strong westerly winds set in. Sea levels in the mid-Pacific rose several inches, and by October, sea level rises of up to one foot had spread 6000 miles east to Ecuador. As the sea levels rose in the east, it simultaneiously dropped in the western Pacific, destroying many fragile coral reefs. Sea temperatures in the Galapagos Islands rose from the low 70 degrees Fahrenheit to well into the 80s. Torrential rains on the coast of Peru changed a dry coastal desert into a grassland. Areas from Ecuador, Chile and Peru suffered from flooding as well as fishing losses, and that winter there were heavy storms pounding the California coastThe rains that normally fall in Indonesia and The effects of this El Nino to the world economy were estimated to be over $8 billion. During the 1920s, a British scientist, Sir Gilbert Walker, pioneered work in what he called the Southern Oscillation Index.. Using data from barometric readings taken on the eastern and the western sides of the Pacific Ocean, Gilbert discovered that when the pressure rises in the east, it falls to the west, and vice-versa. When the pressure is in its high-index, pressure is high on the eastern side. The pressure contrast along the equator is what drives surface winds from east to west. When the pressure is in the low index, the opposite condition occurs. Easterly winds usually disappear completely west of the dateline, and weaken east of that point. The TAO/Triton array is part of an international effort to be understand, in order to be able to predict and prepare for such events as El Nino and its counterpart, La Nina. Formerly, data was collected from historical records, instruments at tide gauging stations, and also the observations made by ships transiting the ocean. The data that is being collected will be able to help scientists hone their understanding of the complex relationship between the atmosphere and the oceans. We have only recently become aware of the profound effects that climate changes in far   flung points on the globe have for many parts of the inhabited world. It is a sobering fact to realize that oceans cover 71% of our planet, and that, next to the sun, the oceans are the biggest determinant of climate and weather. Personal Log: The buoy operations are over and we are now steaming our way back to the KA's home port of Honolulu. The ship is basically moving at approximately 10 miles an hour, so in 10 hours, we only travel 100 miles. Our estimated time back is sometime Sunday evening. Fishing lines have been set out off the fantail, and the crew is beginning to clean up the gear, power washing the deck and acid cleaning the sides for our grand entry back in Hawaii. Tonight in the mess lounge, we had the ""wog Olympics"" where we competed in such races as rolling olives on the floor with our noses. My usual routine has calmed down a bit, but we are still making videos. Some of them have to be tossed and redone if I flub my lines too much. It was raining today, the sky a mass of almost evil-looking clouds. We also had periods of rain and drizzle. I paid a visit to the bridge asking for any old navigation charts, and came away with a bundle. I am also busy rehearsing my ""act"" for tomorrow night's performance on the fantail after a barbecue dinner. We wogs are expected to provide the evening entertainment for the honorable shellbacks. Tonight for the first time, I watched some television. We have programming provided by the Armed Forces Network. I'd like to take this opportunity to send my best wishes for a safe return to all those men and women serving in the current conflict in the Middle East, and most especially to PFC Noel Lewis and all those in his unit. Question of the Day: What is the difference between weather and climate? Aloha from the KA! Nancy Lewis   Day 14: Thursday, September 25, 2003 Transit to Honolulu, HI: Approximate arrival: evening of 9/28//2003 1600-1700: Fantail BBQ 1800: Wog Talent Show Weather Observation Log: 0100 Latitude: 12 degrees, 29.6' N Longitude: 145 degrees, 30.0' W Visibility: 12 nautical miles Wind direction: 120 degrees Wind speed: 9 knots Sea wave height: 3-4 feet Swell wave height: 5-7 feet Sea water temperature: 28.0 degrees C Sea level pressure: 1013.4 mb Dry bulb pressure: 28.0 degrees C Wet bulb pressure: 25.7 degrees C Cloud cover: 6/8 Cumulus, cirrus Science and Technology Log: Yesterday, I asked the question: ""What is the difference between climate and weather?"" Understanding the distinction is important, and is often confused by students, who often hear the two terms used interchangeably. Very simply, weather is what is happening at any given moment in terms of temperature, rainfall, winds, humidity and storms. We all know that the weather can change from hour to hour and day to day. Climate, on the other hand, is the overall weather pattern and conditions for a given area or region over a period of time. Thus, we may say the climate for large areas of the continental U.S. is temperate, while the climate of Pacific islands is tropical. The Big Island of Hawaii, with its two 13,000 foot mountains, has at least 9 climate zones. We know that the earth has undergone times in its past of major climate change. At one time, the polar ice extended down into areas of the United States that today are ice free. We know that even very small changes in ocean temperatures can create conditions that have far-reaching effects around the world. Scientists are still attempting to understand the interaction of the atmosphere and oceans in order to be able to better predict and prepare for climate changes. The climate observation system provided by the TAP/Triton array and maintained by the Ka'imimoana is an important link in the global effort to completely understand the complex relationships between air, sea, land, and human actions and how these affect climate and weather. Personal Log: Today I spent a lot of time preparing for the Wog Talent Show, in addition to answering my email and writing this log. I thought I would share with you part of my little act, which was a dramatization of the Legend of Fenua Enata, the creation myth of the Marquesas Islands. It was set to some very nice island music from the island of Rarotonga, in the Cook Islands. The buoy that was dedicated to Taiohae School was painted and named by the students: "" Fenua Enata"", which they told me was their word for their islands. The term ""Marquesas"" was the name given to the islands by the first European to come to Fenua Enata. Legend of the Fenua Enata   A long time ago, when the sun was shining house. So Atanua told Atea: ""We do not live well He thought: ""I do not know how to build a Then he thought, ""I have the divine power  on the sea, the first man, Atea and the first woman, Atanua had no without a house"". Atea did not answer. house."" of the Mana. I will ask the gods.""  One evening Atea said to his wife Atanua: ""Tonight I will build you a home. I know how."" It was dark and Atea's voice was like a spell singing in the silent nothingness: AKA OA E, AKA POTO E, AKA NUI E, AKA ITI E E E E, AKA PITO E, AKA HANA E, HAKA TU TE HAE The spell was finished, the work began, the site was chosen in the middle of the ocean. Two sturdy posts were erected: these became UA POU A long beam was placed on top of them; it became HIVA OA The front posts and the rafter covering the roof was NUKU HIVA Nine woven coconut palm leaves, laid end to end as thatch became FATU IVA The weaving of the thatch took a long time as did the making of the sennit. Time passed quickly as Atea worked and worked without stopping. Suddenly Atanua shouted: ""O Atea e, The light of dawn is turning the sky to red"": it is TAHUATA ""O Atea e, Moho, the morning bird just sang"": It is MOHOTANI Atea kept digging a hole for the litter of fronds, sennit and hau bark, Until finally he said: ""This is UA HUKU"". Then the sun lit up the sky illuminating the ocean and the new dwelling place. Atanua cried out: ""Ir is EIAO"". Thus, the Land of Men, Fenua Enata, was created. Question of the Day: What is the thermocline? Aloha from the KA, Nancy Lewis   Day 15: Friday, September 26, 2003 Transit to Honolulu, HI 0700: Wog Breakfast Sunday night arrival at Hotel pier, Pearl Harbor Monday morning: clear Customs/Immigrations/Agriculture Refuel, then depart approximately 1500 for Snug Harbor Weather Observation Log: 0100 Latitude: 14 degrees, 54.7' N Longitude: 149 degrees, 22.4' W Visibility: 12 nautical miles Wind direction: 090 degrees Wind speed: 10 knots Sea wave height: 3-4 feet Swell wave height: 5-7 feet Sea water temperature: 28.0 degrees C Sea level pressure: 1012.7 mb Dry bulb pressure: 27.8 degrees C Wet bulb pressure: 24.9 degrees C Cloud cover: 6/8 Cumulus, strato-cumulus Science and Technology Log: Last night I was able to interview the Chief Scientist on board the KA, Patrick Ahearn. Patrick's responsibilities include assembling and diaassembling the buoy components, working with the Captain to map out the buoy operations each day, and also overseeing all the other science projects that are being done on board the KA. I have received several e-mail questions from students about whether or not they ever put out new buoys. Research and developments is always going on with the TAO/Triton program. Patrick talked about several experimental instruments that were used for the first time on this cruise. A new buoy was deployed (parallel with the one at 5 degrees North) that had on it a new type of wind strument called an Acoutstic Wind Anemometer. This will be a test buoy to see how it performs compared with the older propellar type model, which is greatly subject to damage. Another experimental device just deployed for the first time on this cruise is called a pCO2 unit. This unit has been laying out here in the lab, opened up, and we are shooting some video footage of it, so that you can see what it looks like. It is pretty amazing in that inside the waterproof canister are various transistors, wiring, and an iridium modem phone which they use to call up the buoy. Another canister contains lots and lots of batteries to power the instrument. The pCO2 unit is being used to measure the amount of carbon dissolved in the water. It will enable data to be gathered on the amount of carbon dioxide that is either being dissolved into the ocean, or being diffused out of the ocean water and into the atmosphere. These studies are very important to the study of the greenhouse effect and relate to studies that are considering whether or not global warming is indeed occurring. It was truly gascinating to see the inside of this sophisticated instrument, another example of the type of cutting edge science being conducted on board this vessel. Patrick is the one who always goes out to the buoys, climbs on them to remove the instruments before the buoy is retrieved, or brought on board the ship. On the night that I rode out to the buoy where a repair would be conducted, I was amazed to see Patrick bring onto the buoy a laptop computer. You can imagine how it must have looked, in the pitch dark, with him gazing at the lighted computer screen on the buoy. Personal Log:   All of the Wogs had to serve breakfast to the Shellbacks this morning. I have been sworn to secrecy about the exact nature of the rest of the morning's proceedings. The initiation of Wogs is a tradition that goes way back to the days of sailing ships, but nothing that happened to us was injurious to life or limb. suffice it to say, that I survived the treatment and was rewarded with a card that proves I have been across the Equator, and am now an honorable Shellback. The scientists are beginning to pack up all their instruments and gear. Tom Nolan is still running calibrations with his SINBAD instrument whenever the satellite is overhead. The crew has been busy cleaning the decks, painting and generally sprucing up the ship for our grand entrance into Pearl Harbor on Sunday. The Customs officials have to clear us, since the ship has been to a foreign country. Then, the ship will refuel and make its way over to Snug Harbor. Many of us will be leaving the vessel, but for much of the crew, a new cruise will begin for them after not too many days. In the meantime, I am keeping track of our projected time to approach Ka Lae, or South Point, the southernmost tip of land in the U.S. My school, Naalehu Elementary and Intermediate School, is located very close to South Point, and indeed, the school overlooks the ocean near there. It may be in the middle of the night, but I am planning on being, no matter what time it is. Question of the Day: Where is the ozone layer located in the atmosphere? Aloha from the KA, Nancy Lewis   Day 16: Saturday, September 27, 2003 Transit to Honolulu, HI Sunday night arrival at Hotel pier, Pearl Harbor Monday morning: clear Customs/Immigrations/Agriculture Refuel, then depart approximately 1500 for Snug Harbor Weather Observation Log: 0100 Latitude: 17 degrees, 18.4' N Longitude: 153 degrees, 17.5' W Visibility: 12 nautical miles Wind direction: 080 degrees Wind speed: 14 knots Sea wave height: 3-4 feet Swell wave height: 5-7 feet Sea water temperature: 26.8 degrees C Sea level pressure: 1013.5 mb Dry bulb pressure: 27.2 degrees C Wet bulb pressure: 25.0 degrees C Cloud cover: 1/8 Cumulus, alto-cumulus Science and Technology Log: Today I will try and summarize for you the"" El Nino Southern Oscillation Diagnostic Discussion"" that was forwarded to me by Captain Ablondi of the Kai'imimoana. This report was issued by the Climate Prediction Center. Current atmospheric and oceanic conditions are near normal and do not favor either the development of El Nino or La Nina. Sea surface temperature anomalies of +0.5 degrees Celcius were noted west of the International Dateline, but there were near-zero anomalies in the equatorial Pacific east of 150 degrees West longitude. During August, very little SST anomalies were observed in the El Nino regions. In May there were gains in upper-ocean temperature which spread eastward into the central and eastern Pacific. This was associated with an eastward Kelvin wave, that resulted from weaker than average easterly tradewinds that occurred in May and June. SST (Sea Surface Temperatures) anomalies increased during June and July, but then subsided during dAugust. The Tahiti-Darwin SOI (Southern Oscillation Index) showed a great deal of month to month variability, but shows no trend towards the development of either El Nino or La Nina. Most of the statistical forecasts display near neutral conditions for the remainer of 2003 and 2004. This forecast is consistent with the trends revealed by all other coeanic and atmospheric measurements and data. I have copies of the graphs associated with the above report, and would be happy to make them available to any classes, students or teachers upon request. Personal Log: Today everyone is readying for our arrival tomorrow night into Pearl Harbor. Accounts with the ship's store are being squared up, and some of the computers are having operating systems reinstalled. Most of us are starting to pack. I am still answering e-mails, cataloguing photos and catching up with my daily logs.   The real treat came just at sunset after dinner. The Big Island was visible from our position of 100 miles away. Mauna Loa showed clearly on the horizon, and I thought I could even see Kilauea off to the east. It was an exceptionally clear evening, but in spite of that, we saw no ""green flash"". I was really excited to get my first glimpse of land in so many days, and be able to see my much loved mountain.

The termination presentations are held every Laboratory pay day for University          of California Lab employees. Employees who are retiring aren't required          to attend a presentation, but rather, they should schedule a meeting with          their designated benefits specialist.         The presentations begin at 8:30 a.m. in room P280 on the second floor          of the Otowi Building at Technical Area 3. Pre-registration is required.          Employees should register on line at  http://hrcluster.lanl.gov/TIOCourses/TIOAha.asp?CourseNumber=21013           one to two weeks prior to their last scheduled work day to sign up for          a benefits termination presentation.         Employees also must obtain a departure processing form from Staffing          (HR-S) before the presentation. This form is available at  http://www.hr.lanl.gov/hrstaffing/Terminations/index.stm           online.         At the presentation, employees will receive a packet of information about          their benefits and savings balances. They will learn about options to          continue or convert insurance plans and distribution options for savings          funds.         Employees who require a sign language interpreter should write to  benefits@lanl.gov           by e-mail three days in advance of the presentation they plan to attend.          Or call the benefits office at 5-3842 (TDD).

GX001-98-0763964	"to be published in: Heylighen F. (ed.) (1998): The Evolution of Complexity (Kluwer Academic, Dordrecht).          Parasite Ecology and the Evolution of Religion     Ben Cullen     Dept of Archaeology and Palaeoecology     Queen's University of Belfast     BELFAST BT7 1NN     NORTHERN IRELAND         Abstract:  It is argued that the blanket view of religion as a disease, advocated by Dawkins, is inconsistent with the principles of parasite ecology. These principles state that vertically transmitted parasites evolve towards benign, symbiotic states, while horizontally transmitted parasites increase their virulence. Most of the world's established religions are transmitted vertically, from parents to children, and are therefore expected to be benign towards their hosts. Yet, certain horizontally transmitted cults, such as the Aum Shinrikyo, seem to effectively exploit their hosts in a way similar to an infectious disease.          Foreword by the editor      On December 29, 1995, while preparing this paper for publication, Ben Cullen unexpectedly died, apparently from an arrhythmea of the heart. This paper was one of two wonderful presentations which he had given at the conference ""Einstein Meets Magritte"" the previous summer. The unfinished manuscript consisted basically of the text he had read aloud during his presentation, which means that it lacked the structure typical of texts meant for publication. Therefore, I have edited the manuscript by dividing it into paragraphs and sections, eliminating references to photographs projected during the presentation, adding an abstract and bibliography, and correcting various small errors.     Let me elaborate why I find it important for Ben's work to be brought to the attention of the public. An Australian born in 1964, Ben Cullen graduated from the University of Sydney in 1987, with a degree in Prehistoric Archeology. After a stay as Research Fellow at the University of Wales, Lampeter, he moved to the Queen's University of Belfast a few months before his death. He had just defended his PhD thesis in archeology, in which he developed his ""Cultural Virus Theory"" (Cullen, 1993, 1995c, 1996), a stimulating new model of the evolution of culture, reminiscent of, but distinct from, the memetics view proposed by Dawkins (1989).     I met him in 1992 in London at a conference, where we were both presenting models of cultural evolution. We were obviously on the same wave length and had several long discussions after the lectures. I was impressed by his sharp intellect and the depth of his knowledge and understanding. Afterwards, we kept in touch by exchanging papers. Just a few weeks before his death, he sent me a preprint (Cullen, 1995) which he asked me to ""really read, not like some others"", which I interpreted to mean that many people misinterpret his ideas. There does not seem to be much danger of misinterpretation with the following paper, which is a jewel of clarity and simplicity.         Francis Heylighen              Introduction    There has been much recent publicity of the idea of religion and chain letters being diseases of the mind, or human information parasites as they are sometimes termed. Prominent amongst these have been pieces by the biologist Richard Dawkins in the London press, and also a piece about the St. Jude Chain Letter in a letter published recently in the leading scientific journal  Nature . (Goodenough & Dawkins, 1994). Headlines such as the one about the 'St Jude' mind virus, have not excited a great deal of controversy, presumably because few people publically identify with chain letters.     However, other headlines, such as ""Is Religion Just A Disease?"" in the Daily Telegraph (Dawkins, 1993b), have excited a great deal of vociferous debate, and pricked many egos. Richard Dawkins's view of religion (1993a,b) as a disease not surprisingly offended members of the Church of England, and various bishops wrote pieces condemning both Dawkins and his view. But most objections to the ""religion as a disease"" idea have come from the Church acting in self-defense, guarding its cultural capital so to speak. Most defences have come from theologians who submit the general idea that Dawkins is discussing spiritual matters beyond his understanding, a predictable theologian response. Very few objections have come from the sciences, human or otherwise. Few articles have explicitly disputed the scientific credentials of the Dawkins view, or the neo-Darwinian logic behind it.     In this paper I intend to go against this trend, and argue against the ""religion as a disease"" position, on the grounds that Dawkins has not manipulated neo-Darwinian logic consistently. In other words, I will argue that Dawkins has erected a highly personal view of religion which is in complete conflict with both his own selfish gene theories (Dawkins, 1989), and a growing body of parasite research.     Principles of Parasite Ecology     Let me enumerate the basic principles emerging in recent parasite ecology, the rules which the Dawkins view of religion are in direct conflict with, yet also the rules which Dawkins himself helped to articulate.     The first rule is that  vertically transmitted  parasites, namely, those that tend to pass from parent to child, evolve toward decreasing virulence, ultimately approaching benign or symbiotic configurations. Vertically transmitted parasites find themselves in the same sequence of bodies as the genes of their hosts, generation after generation, and the two therefore share a common future. They are in the same evolutionary boat, so to speak, and if the boat sinks, both parties drown.     One classic example of this type of relationship is that between wood-boring ambrosia beetles and bacteria, an example which Dawkins has featured in discussions of this nature. The bacteria are entirely dependent upon the beetles for food and shelter, and live their entire lives inside beetle tissue, being carried into the next generation inside the eggs which the females lay. This route to the future, however, ensures that they pass from each parent beetle to the beetle's offspring, and they are, therefore, vertically transmitted. Thus the rule would predict that these bacteria should be symbiotic, and indeed they are, as without them the beetles would be unable to reproduce. This is because male beetles can only develop from eggs in which the bacteria are present. Without the bacteria the beetles would be a race of female individuals who could only reproduce through sexual reproduction, a difficult situation at the best of times.     This general rule linking symbiosis with long term host/parasite cohabitation and vertical transmission also finds support elsewhere, particularly in the field of ""Darwinian medicine"" (Nesse & Williams, 1995), and in the work of researchers such as Paul Ewald (1990, 1995). For instance, it has been shown that new and less virulent strains of the AIDS virus are proving more successful in human populations where condoms are frequently used, and where viruses therefore have to spend longer periods of time in each host (Ewald, 1994).     Rule number 2 is simply the reverse of Rule number 1. Disease is often connected to  horizontal modes of transmission , where parasites are transmitted indiscriminately with respect to host relationships. Horizontally transmitted parasites are as likely to be passed on between families as within families. Parasites of this kind tend to evolve toward a typical ""disease"" configuration. The presence of the parasite significantly alters the host body or behaviour in such a way as to improve the parasite's chances of reproduction, and decrease that of the host. Curiously, this may involve enhancing the host's chances of survival, while preventing its reproduction, in an attempt to produce a thriving parasite factory. Some barnacles, for example, parasitize crabs by targeting the crab's sex organs first, and the vital organs last, so maintaining a living resource for the parasite for as long as possible.     One of the most spectacular parasites of all is not an animal, but a plant which hunts other plants. It too is horizontally transmitted, and conforms to the rule. The corpse flower, or  Rafflesia , is a family of plants so called because many of them exude a smell of rotting meat, mimicking the smell, colour and texture of a corpse. At 30 to 40 inches or about 1 metre across, it is the largest known single flower, and one of the most extraordinary predators of the plant world. It is an inhabitant of the rainforests of Borneo and Sumatra. The corpse flower has no leaves, no stem, no roots or trunk. It actually lives inside the tissues of another plant, one of the many vines which grow so abundantly in the rainforest canopy, as a net of tiny threads. How it actually gets inside these vines is not known. Thus the stem from which this truly monstrous flower grows does not belong to the flower, but to rafflesia's victim. Once the parasitic flower grows to its full size, the host vine has usually collapsed into the leaf litter of the forest, and is hidden from view.     The  corpse flower  is an excellent example of a predator which stalks its prey from within, biding its time in the body of the host vine, before leaping to new victims by means of its extraordinary flowers. To move through the forest, it enlists the help of tree shrews (small arboreal mammals) and insects. Viewed from the inside, the corpse flower is even more remarkable. Exuding a powerful aroma similar to a pile of fish after three days in the hot sun, it not surprisingly attracts flies. The flies crawl down to the sex organs, and there they are daubed with pollen which may then be carried to female flowers. The female flowers produce seeds which are then transported by small tree shrews to new vine hosts, elsewhere in the rainforest.         Religions as Parasites     Rafflesia is particularly relevant to the ""religion as a disease"" debate because it represents a rare example of a large predator that inhabits the bodies of its prey. It allows us to begin to imagine how an organisation such as a religion could be seen as a life form which inhabits the bodies of people, in the same way that rafflesia inhabits the bodies of rainforest vines. Anatomically, the corpse flower and cultural life forms have much more in common than one might expect.     This is a representation of the anatomy of a religion and its material products, in this case the megalithic tombs of Neolithic western Europe (Cullen, 1994). The outer ring of structures represent megaliths, but they could just as well be churches, or mosques or cathedrals. The central structures of the religion are composed of people, which are represented by the figure in the bottom corner--a circle for a head and a monk's robe for the body. There is an outer ring of acolytes or novices, whose heads are represented by circles A, B, C, and D their bodies by a robe, and the actions they perform in service of the religion by arrows. Finally there is an inner circle of priests or clergy, whose heads are represented by circles 1, 2, 3, and 4, their bodies by robes, and their actions by arrows. The religion or cultural organism consists solely of the shaded black areas and their material products - the people involved in the organisation may perform many other roles in society, some of these roles might work against the religion. So this schematic diagram gives us some idea of what a cultural life form looks like.     Now, using the rules of parasite ecology discussed a little earlier, we can begin to predict which religions will evolve toward disease-like states, and which religions should evolve toward benign or symbiotic states. Vertically transmitted religions, like vertically transmitted viruses and other parasites, should evolve toward symbiotic or benign states. This immediately disqualifies most of the world's established religions from the ""disease"" scenario, because they are generally passed on from generation to generation within the family. Family dependent religious affiliation should therefore evolve toward benign or symbiotic configurations. Dawkins actually points out the vertically transmitted nature of religions, although he does not connect it to any prediction of symbiosis.     For the same reasons, we would expect the religions of small scale, kinship based societies, such as those of indigenous Australian cultures and their associated artistic traditions, to evolve toward symbiotic configurations. When a religion occupies of small community in which members of subsequent generations are of close genetic relationship to previous generations, a pathological religion would tend to plunge itself and its community into oblivion.     But this is not to say that there can be no such thing as a parasitic religion. However, if we are to find a truly pathological religion, we will have to look for examples where the pattern of transmission is horizontal, or essentially indiscriminate with respect to genetic relatedness of new recruits. Established world religions cannot be totally excluded from the picture, as while congregational membership may be essentially vertically transmitted, membership of the priesthood is not so rigid. Nor can the religions of kinship based communities be totally excluded, as kinship is often employed as a means of social categorisation for both strangers or newcomers and family alike. So called ""fictive"" kinship of this kind can and often does follow a line of descent which does not conform to strict lines of genetic inheritance. So we might expect occasional parasitic forms of religion to arise in the established traditions.     But are there any more dramatic examples around? I think that we may not have to look too far. Religious cults would appear to be a good candidate. Chizuo Matsumoto, better known as Shoko Asahara, is the leader of the doomsday cult of Aum Shinrikyo or Way of the Divine Truth. The Way of the Divine Truth organisation was apparently responsible for the recent nerve gas attack on the Tokyo subway system.     The Aum Shinrikyo doomsday cult undoubtedly follows a horizontal pattern of transmission, selecting its recruits more for what they can do for the cult than for their relatedness to existing members. The rate at which it acquired members, many of them outside Japan, is testimony to the non-vertical nature of its reproduction. In the space of a decade or so, the cult acquired some 30,000 members in Russia, presumably none of them related to Asahara himself. Within Japan the cult boasted a surprising number of members from all walks of life. Asahara carefully chose the most talented individuals for his priests, recruiting lawyers, scientists, chemists and engineers. With so many thousands of members in such a short time, it is clear that the cult did not rely on the fecundity of its members for its expansion. Clearly, then, the Aum Shinrikyo doomsday cult was a horizontally transmitted phenomenon.     Parasite ecology, then, would predict that it would exploit some or all of its members. Is there any evidence of this? It would appear that there was. One recruit had to provide a list of her assets and promise that they would be passed over to the cult on her death. The most privileged were allowed to drink Asahara's blood or semen, but actually had to pay an incredible 74,000 pounds for the pleasure. Cult members received very little in return for these immense financial contributions to the cult. Apart from the lucky few allowed to drink a little blood or semen, they received dormitory or boarding school style accommodation, and two meagre vegetarian meals per day. The 53 children moved from the cult's commune proved to be suffering from severe malnutrition, while Asahara himself lived in luxury. An older recruit related how he was told to drink several gallons of water and vomit them as part of his training. So it would seem that the Aum Shinrikyo doomsday cult of Shoko Asahara does indeed conform to principles of parasite ecology.     In conclusion, then, it would appear that the blanket view of religion as a disease, as advocated by Dawkins (1993a,b), is not consistent with recent research into the nature of parasite evolution. Many religions are being vertically transmitted or family dependent, and we would therefore expect them to evolve toward symbiosis or at least benignness. As Dawkins has remarked, it is an extraordinary fact that if we adhere to a faith at all, it is overwhelmingly likely to be the same as that of our parents. This simple fact ought to ensure that if a religion which followed this pattern of transmission ruthlessly exploited its congregation, it would eventually plunge both itself and its people into extinction.

Unfortunately, the machine was too heavy and broke the very rails it was traveling on.      1813: Canned Food   An Englishman named Peter Durand developed a method of sealing food into unbreakable tin containers. The process was perfected by John Hall and Bryan Dorkin, who opened the first commercial canning factory in England in 1813.      1827: The Photograph   Joseph Nicéphore Niépce was the first person to take a photograph. He took the picture by setting up a machine called the camera obscura in the window of his home in France. It took eight hours for the camera to take the picture.      1850: The Dishwasher   Joel Houghton was granted the first dishwasher patent in 1850. The machine was made of wood and required you to hand-turn a wheel that caused water to splash on the dishes. Houghton's machine barely worked.     The first practical dishwasher was invented by a woman named Josephine Cochran in 1886. Dishwashers, however, did not begin appearing in homes until the 1950s.      1868: The Locomotive Air Brake   In 1868, George Westinghouse invented the air brake for railroad trains. Before his invention, brakes for each train car had to be applied separately and manually. His new automatic system allowed trains to safely travel at higher speeds.      1876: The Telephone   On March 10, 1876, Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone. The first words Bell spoke into the telephone were ""Mr. Watson! Come here! I want you!""      1893: The Zipper   Whitcomb Judson patented his ""clasp-locker"" on August 29, 1893. His invention wasn't very successful, but, in 1913, the idea was refined by a Swedish-American engineer named Gideon Sundbach. The U.S. Army soon began using the fasteners and by the late 1920s, they could be found on many different types of clothing and accessories.     The term ""zipper"" started being used around 1923 because of the sound it makes when fastening.      1903: The Engine-Powered Airplane   In 1903, Orville and Wilbur Wright invented the first engine-powered airplane that could actually fly. They patented their flying machine in 1906.      1912: Life Savers® Candy   Clarence Crane created Life Savers® candy in 1912. Crane was a chocolate maker but wanted a candy that wouldn't melt in the summer heat. Eventually, he came up with a peppermint flavored hard candy in the shape of a circle with a hole in it. The mints were called Life Savers® because they looked like tiny life preservers. Since then, many different flavors of Life Savers® have been produced. The five-flavor roll first appeared in 1935.      1928: Penicillin   In 1928, Alexander Fleming, an English bacteriologist, accidentally discovered penicillin, the first antibiotic medicine. Such medicines can kill certain types of disease-causing bacteria inside the body. At the time, however, the importance of Fleming's discovery was not known. Use of penicillin did not begin until the 1940s when Howard Florey and Ernst Chain developed a powdery form of the medicine.      1938: Teflon®   Roy Plunkett discovered polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), or Teflon®, in 1938. Today, Teflon® is used in a variety of products, but it is probably best known as a coating put on pots and pans to help prevent food from sticking to them.      1947: Cellular Phones   Although cell phones were not sold commercially until 1983, AT&T came up with the idea way back in 1947!      1956: Liquid Paper® Correction Fluid   Bette Nesmith Graham invented ""Mistake Out,"" later renamed Liquid Paper®, to paint over mistakes made with a typewriter.      1965: The Compact Disc   James Russell invented the compact disc (CD) in 1965. Before CDs, music was recorded on things like cassette tapes and vinyl records, which tended to wear out. Russell wanted something that could hold high quality music and not wear out so easily. His compact disc idea did the trick.      1972: Home Video Games   William Higinbotham created the first video game ever in 1958. His game, called ""Tennis for Two,"" was created and played on a laboratory computer.     The first video game that could be played in the home, however, was released in 1972 by Magnavox. Invented by Ralph Baer, the machine was called the Odyssey.      1988: The Indiglo® Nightlight   In 1988, Ralph Alessio and Fredrik Olsen received a patent for the Indiglo® nightlight. The bluish green light is used to illuminate the entire face of a watch.      1999: Tekno Bubbles®   Tekno Bubbles® are like regular blowing bubbles, except they glow under ultraviolet or black light. Byron and Melody Swetland were issued a patent for Tekno Bubbles® in 1999.        The NASA ""Why?"" Files has become the NASA SCIence Files™.

As usual, it was for the simple reason of visiting Erin that  we made the journey. The fact that we had various bits of climbing gear in the car was purely coincidental. We drove down on Friday afternoon, going over Sonora Pass which had just opened up. Tioga was still closed, and they're projecting an opening date of mid June. We were very pleased to discover that the restaurant at the Mobil station  at the intersection of 395 and 120 just south of Lee Vining was open. I sampled their fish tacos and was rather disappointed - the pork loin that I had last time was much tastier.          (1944x2592 at 2560 kb)    Erin. The reason we went to Bishop.      Once again, it was Erin who suggested that we trek into the Owen's River Gorge to study the texture of the rock, and witness the quality of the water - she is a hydrologist after all.        (1944x2592 at 2772 kb)     The Upper Gorge. Note the texture of the rock and the quality of the water.     On Saturday morning, we descended into the upper gorge, trying to stay away from the madness that was sure to plague the popular areas. Despite the 90 degree weather, the gorge was a popular destination. We started off at the Lower Elbow Room where Jack and I warmed up on   Quail Trail  (5.10b). I only did the first pitch, which was fairly trivial, but Jack continued on to the second, which involved some interesting stemming on a dihedral, and looked very fun. Rod, Vivian and Erin warmed up on Phoenix (5.7). Jack and I then did   Chuckers  (5.10c), which the guide describes as slab, but is really just a face climb with small crimps. Even though there are many climbs described as ""slab"" in the guide, true one are very rare - usually they're really thin face.          (1944x2592 at 2756 kb)     (1944x2592 at 2580 kb)   Rod on Phoenix, and Charles belaying Jack on Quail Trail        The sun was beginning to threaten us, so we moved down the gorge a bit, seeking out more shade. We found some at the Monkey to Monk Area, where Jack led   Scorched Egos  (5.11b), a tricky climb that starts up a thin crack, then traverses left for 30 feet. I followed, as it was the only way to clean it, and even then it gave me pause. Rod led   Know the Drill  (5.10c), a very fun vertical face climb, which Viv and Erin followed. We paused for lunch, lurking in the ever diminishing shade, then I braved the sun and led Know the Drill as well. By the time we were done, the sun had moved sufficiently that the west side of the gorge was in the shade, and some clouds had moved in as well. We headed for  the Mothership Cliff, where I wanted to get back on   Living Dead  (5.11c). I had tried this on TR last time we were in the gorge, and  wanted to lead it. I managed to convince Jack that it would be fun, so he hung around while Rod, Vivian and Erin walked further south to play with some gear. I had a little difficulty about half way up, when I tried to follow the dihedral instead of turning the arete and moving on the face, but after a few minutes of elevated heart rate and frustration,  I figured it out and made the move. This is a really amazing climb that features crack, crimps, smearing, and lots of sweat. Jack also led the route and had some fun near the top too. I also led   Northern Pike  (5.11a), which was interesting, but only had a few 5.11 moves.

Jack proceeded to lead a very tricky   Fingertip Ledge of Contentment  (5.10c), which had a really tough section where one has two minute crimps for hands, and then has to do an enormous high step. I followed it, and all I can say is that I'm glad I didn't lead it! I did lead   Breaking the Law  (5.10a), which was a series of small crimps for fingers and toes, with few rests. My toes were in serious agony by the end of it. It was getting late by then so we hiked out, and returned to Erin's place for a fine dinner of jambalaya that Vivian threw together.   On Sunday, we entered at the central gorge, and headed the Dilithium Crystal. Erin went for a bike ride, but promised to join us later in  the afternoon. The Great Wall of China was literally crawling with people as we walked by - I've never seen it that busy. There was no one at the Dilithium Crystal though. We warmed up on   Impulse Power  (5.10c), then I proceeded to try   Photon Torpedo  (5.11b). The guide says it's been getting more difficult as it gets polished, but I found it about right for the grade. Lots of fun, and fairly sustained. There's one more bolt on the climb than the guide claims. Jack also led it, while Rod did Extreme Caffeine (5.10a). I then tried out   Mind Meld  (5.12b) on TR. Ouch. The start is bouldery and hard. It took me a while to  figure out the sequence, and now I know for sure that I don't want to lead it!        (1200x1600 at 1096 kb)     (1200x1600 at 1216 kb)   Rod leading Extreme Caffeine, and Charles hanging on Mind Meld       After lunch, I tried out   Enterprise  (5.12b), which is very reminiscent of the climbs at Jailhouse. The start is fairly positive overhanging pockets, which took a lot out of me. The top section is crimpy face, somewhere in the mid 5.10s. I think that I might be able to get it all if I went back and worked the sequence for the first few bolts. The holds are good, it's just tiring as it's so overhung. The real crux is making the move just above the roof.          (2592x1944 at 2356 kb)     (1536x2048 at 996 kb)   Charles on Enterprise        Rod and I went across the river to the Fun House, while Jack and Vivian went to try to stand in line for Hardly Wallbanger on the Pub Wall. Rod and I both led   Melts in Your Mouth  (5.10c), a very fun face  climb of fairly small holds, with a sturdy bulge in the middle. You can traverse right of the bulge into slightly easier territory, but then you have to make a few delicate moves getting back left. We then moved on to Staying Power Towers, where Rod led   Blood Sugar Sex Magic  (5.10d). This is a long climb - about 140 ft, and 16 bolts. We did it as one pitch, with Rod belaying me from the top while I trailed a second line for the rap. It can be done with one rope, but requires to raps. It's an excellent climb - many jugs, with a few tricky moves thrown in, and fairly sustained.   As we headed down the gorge to rejoin the rest of the gang, we spotted Lisa, Todd and Doug on Faulty Towers, so we paused to chat. While chatting, I saw a nice 10d there that I hadn't tried before, so I led   Perched  , and got a nice stab wound in the chest as I  impaled myself on a sharp spire while trying to traverse under the roof. Ouch. Rod followed it, and did that section with much better style, avoiding any bloody encounters with the rock.          (1536x2048 at 824 kb)     (1536x2048 at 1020 kb)   Rod on Blood Sugar Sex Magic, and Lisa on Faulty Towers       We finally found Erin, Jack and Vivian climbing at the Warm Up Wall.  They had tried to get in line for Hardly Wallbanger, but were dissuaded by the enormous crowds there. Vivian had a go at Humbly, Mumbly, Jumbly (5.10b), but made Jack clip the first bolt for her. After she was done with it, Jack forced me to clean it. I didn't want to climb anymore, but he made me. I swear.   As we were standing around the car, trying to regain our breath after the hike out, we were joined by Dan and Chris. They had been up at Pine Creek in the morning, and then went into the gorge in the afternoon. They were driving back the next day, and wanted to boulder a bit in the morning, so we made some tentative plans to meet at Schat's for breakfast the next morning. We headed back to Erin's then  decided to go out for pizza, where we hoped to meet up with another large gang from the bay area. We found Erin and Heather there, but the rest of the gang failed to materialize.   The next morning, I was pushing for a trip to Rock Creek, to get away from the heat and climb a few granite cracks. Unfortunately, I was outvoted, and after a very large and fattening breakfast at  Schat's, we headed for the Happy boulders. It was hot, and not a cloud in the sky to protect us from mean Mr. Sun. We spent most of the  morning and early afternoon seeking shade under large boulders, making half hearted attempts at a few problems. The only one of us who worked hard was Jack, who kept on throwing himself at a certain V4. We finally retreated at around 3, and stopped by a river for a swim. Or a wade really - the water was only a few feet deep. It felt rather good, however the mosquitoes made us pay for our pleasure. We returned to Erin's for a game of scrabble, and to finish off the jambalaya, then walked to the theatre where we saw ""The Matrix Reloaded"". What a horrible film - I'm glad  movies are cheap in Bishop. The total lack of acting ability and plot in the film were truely mind boggling. When we returned to Erin's place, we celebrated Rod's birthday (I won't say which one...) with a very tasty cheese cake than erin had made. Yum!

We had thought to stop in the Sonora pass area and get in a bit more climbing, but the rock up there was still wet. Actually, it was considerably more than wet - there were large waterfalls coming down over the routes we wanted to do. So we just drove straight back, and then ended up meeting again at the gym. Oh well - plastic isn't anything like granite, but it's better than nothing.

Without sufficient labor and financial resources, Marshon's Fashions hovered at the edge of bankruptcy. When the company bid on a small share (75,000 units) of a 1.5 million-unit federal order providing coveralls for the armed forces, it had to convince the Department of Defense and the Small Business Administration that Marshon's Fashions could produce them. CMC helped Marshon's Fashions secure a $175,000 workforce training grant from the City of Chicago. The grant, managed by CMC, enabled the company to hire a CMC consultant to act as plant manager for her facility, provide back office administrative assistance, write change order proposals, and provide guidance on contract interpretation, rights, and responsibilities. CMC purchased approximately $50,000 of equipment for Marshon's Fashions, hired 40 people and trained them, and developed a supplier network. One month later, Marshon's Fashions made its first shipment of 2,040 units, and the company expects to maintain its on-time delivery record through the duration of the contract. CMC has also been instrumental in making sure Marshon's Fashions adheres to government specifications for this contract. In August 2002, CMC oversaw Marshon's Fashions' expansion from 3,500 square feet to 15,000 square feet and from 40 employees to 100.

Corporate agreed to a trial, and the Mexican plant proved its claim, producing the candy at a significantly lower cost. However, instead of moving production to Mexico, American Licorice decided to pursue a lean manufacturing strategy to cut costs and improve efficiency. South Suburban College (SSC), a partner of the Chicago Manufacturing Center (CMC), staged a one-week lean brainstorming event at the plant. Approximately 12 associates from different company departments attended. The team identified opportunities to eliminate waste in 75 areas of the plant, reducing scrap by 50 percent and increasing productivity by 43 percent. By week's end the Alsip plant had reduced enough costs to be able to produce the candy at 50 percent less than the Mexican plant. In keeping with its lean transformation, American Licorice is now transitioning from a strict line process to a cellular model and supervisors and line leaders are being trained as team leaders. SSC designed a 32-hour block of education and training for these developing leaders. The education package includes training in computer technology. Many of the company's employees had no knowledge of basic computer operation. Now all associates have access to the computer room, digital cameras, laminators, and post work instructions. The information technology team at American Licorice is training trainers so everyone can share the newfound information. All education sessions are done in English or Spanish as some employees become interpreters and trainers. American Licorice is pleased with its lean results, especially as 80 percent of the changes came from people and ideas; only 20 percent relied on capital investment.  2
GX050-94-14048668	Ask A Scientist   Mathematics Archive              Mersenne primes   Author:      yendor  Could someone please explain mersenne primes to me, examples, like the smallest Mersenne prime which is not a prime number, also is there any interesting problems associated with Mersenne primes?  Response #:  1 of 1 Author:      rcwinther  A number of the form (2^p)-1, where p is a prime, is called a Mersenne number.  If a Mersenne number is prime, it is called a Mersenne prime.  It is not known if there are infinitely many Mersenne primes.  The smallest non-prime Mersenne number is (2^11) - 1 = 2047 = 23*89; the largest Mersenne prime known as of 1992 is (2^756,839) - 1, which has 227,832 digits!  It is also the largest prime known as of 1992, and the 32nd known Mersenne prime.  Mersenne numbers are named for the French mathematician Marin Mersenne (1588-1648), who studied them.  Actually, interest in these numbers goes back at least as far as Euclid, who considered sums of powers of 2, that is, sums of the form 1 + 2 + 4 + . . . + 2^N  [we recognize this as a geometric series, whose sum is 2^(N + 1) - 1].  Euclid observed that sometimes this sum is a prime number, and he proved that if the sum       (1 + 2 + 4 + . . . + 2^N) is prime, then the number       (2^N) * (1 + 2 + 4 + . . . + 2^N) is a perfect number (a number equal to the sum of its proper divisors).  In carrying this over to the discussion of Mersenne primes, we must now make the identification N = p - 1.  Mersenne showed that if (2^p) - 1 is prime, then p must be prime (the converse is not  true, e.g. for p = 11), and Euler showed that ALL of the even perfect numbers are given by [2^(p - 1)] * [(2^p) - 1] where (2^p) - 1 is prime.  Nowadays, most of the interest in Mersenne numbers is connected with the search for larger and larger prime numbers.  This is because Euler also developed an algorithm that greatly facilitates checking for primeness of a Mersenne number.

GX035-55-13595344	"Day 1- Sunday, June 17, 2001    My day began at 3:00 am, Eastern standard time. I reluctantly woke up, and we soon headed for Orlando Int'l Airport, a good hour and a half drive from Ocala. My flight departed about 7:45, (late) and it was okay, a little turbulence, a little LONG, but I landed about 9:00 am in Albuquerque. I expected to see no one, but I walked off the plane and who's there? Don and Galen, all decked out in Earthwatch paraphanelia, complete with signs and shirts, jumping up and down. We spent the next hour wandering about the airport, taking pictures in front of the ""artistic"" (to say the least) ponies of the airpoint and watching planes take off in a coffee shop (complete with their inquisitive questions about the origin of Bagela and the Planckatron.)    Next to arrive was my roomate, the only other female, Alyse (she cut her hair!! We kinda didn't recognize her from her picture.) Well, at this point I was really tired, so we met the rest of the team at their gates in this order: 1) Me 2) Alyse 3)David/Steven 4) Kala 5)Brock/Collin 6)Seth.     We finally left the airport around 1:30, and headed for the New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science in Albuquerque. We saw an I-MAX about ecosystems and the importance of biodiversity, to which Collin exclaimed, ""This isn't about space!"" Here, we also discovered Alyse's ....love... for Micheal Jordan, David's crackhead need for Kool-aid, and Steven's affinity for arthropods. Afterwards, we were all really hungry so we wandered around the museum looking for the non-existant ""snack bar."" We had to resort to asking an employee who told us to go to the gift shop for gifts and ""stuff."" Well this ""stuff"" consisted of about 4 types of candy bars, a couple of handi snack things, and ""ghetto poptarts"" (it was a 12-pack box all ripped open for sale: ghet-to.) We then just played with the toys and hats in the store, taking pictures and laughing.     Next was dinner in Old Town Albuquerque, which was good, all of our first experiences with sopaipillas. Conversation was light, until Seth and Steven decided they were going to open an ice cream sandwich store, serving the sandwiches with lettuce, tomato, a dill pickle spear, and buttered toasted cats. Then began the 3 hour joke about ""STUFF."" The stuff store, and what it would sell: gormet stuff, fried stuff, stuff nuggets, stuff on a stick, etc. This lasted for hours.    We then got into the big van and headed off toward Los Alamos, using the back roads through the Jemez mountains, stopping at Soda Dam (climbing the cliffs) and stopping at a caldera (the elk were not 10 miles away!)    We got back to the hotel at about 9, got our rooms, and despite Seth's call to stay up for a card game, I went to bed.                   Day 2- Monday, June 18, 2001    Well, we got a call from Donna (Mom) around 7 am, arggg..... I was sleeping peacefully. Oh well. I got up showered, and Alyse and I left to meet the group in the lobby/by the van. We then headed to the Lab Badging office to become ""official."" Well, they had no record of Earthwatch kids, so we had to wait for the proper signatures. We got our pictures taken, awesome badges made, and headed for the Bradbury Science Museum for a lookaround. Bradbury is like the official Los Alamos history museum: they had everything. My favorite was the replicas of Fat Man and Little Boy the me using a Geiger counter. We then watched a video on Los Alamos, then had a ""deep"" conversation about a whole bunch of stuff with Galen. He's amazing: he actually put the way I feel about religion into words, a task I have yet been able to do. It was great.    Then, of course, lunch. Donna just kinda let us loose in the whopping city of Los Alamos (population, 10,000) to do whatever we wanted until 1:00. Seth and Brock left to go get Chinese, so me and the others wanted Subway, convienently located kinda next to/behind the museum. Well, we walked up and there's a sign on the door saying ""We ran out of bread. Reopening at 1."" A sub shop that ran out of bread..... Anyways we went to the big bank across the street to each cash our super-generous $80 check from the Lab for spending money. Walking into the bank, an old guy asked us, ""Oklahoma?"" Anyway, after, we actually found Furr's, the supermarket right behind our hotel. The six of us went shopping for lunch and to stock our cool fridges in our room. We wandered around the store, six teenagers with backpacks, and we spent $50 on sodas, fruit, bread, sandwich meats, and Kool-Aid (David was in bad withdrawl.)    We went back to Steven and David's room and ate, spreadin mayo and cutting cheese with our pocketknives. Of course we never even thought to buy plates or anything.... Plus Seth has his little heart set on having a party, and for all of us to eat different color glo-stick, and to see how long it takes to pass through a human digestive system.    We then went to the Canyon school to take our first tutorial into the world of telescopes and CCD cameras, thanks to Don. It was informative, but we all got tired. We then practiced taking pictures ( Don took a picture of my torso as our first experiment...) We ate pizza and such, etc. Interesting, but not fabulously interesting.    Next, we went back to Bradbury for a lecture on the solar system. It was about 2 hours long (arg!!!) Too many statistics. Anyway, it got real interesting when David drew pictures of the team and Don and Galen. They were hilaious. Next Collin drew David. Then Seth drew a caricture of the lecturer, and two absolutely annoying people, but for more on that, see Seth's page.    Affterwards, all of us ran out of the audiotrim, busting out laughing, mocking the old men with retarded questions, such as ""How does methane get frozen"" and ""It's a glacier! Wouldn't it evaporate on Mars?"" We then went back here, the Canyon school to do our journals. Don had a computer tracking the ISS (international space station) and we went outside (running throught the sprinklers) and saw it pass overhead. We also compared it's relative brightness to Mars and Vega. Nifty.     After we got back to the hotel, we all went over to Seth and Brock's room for their glowstick ""party."" It consisted of studying the lab's GET manuals and watching Steven paint himself with Brock's blue glowstick (dropping the glow stuff on the hotel carpet) and Seth attempting to paint himself, but instead slicing his thumb open with Brock's oversized and quite sharp pocket knife. Knives are generally sharp, aren't they Seth?    I stayed there until almost 1 am with Brock, Seth, and Steven, us telling the lamest jokes we can think of. For example, Brock's lamest was, ""A mushroom walked into a bar. The bartender says, 'hey, we don't serve your kind here.' the shroom replied, 'hey why not? I'm a fun guy (fungi)."" Yeah. On that note, I retired to my room for the night.              Day 3- Tuesday, June 19, 2001    Today for me began at about 7:15 am. After an extremely brief breakfast, we all piled into the gov't van and headed to White Rock to take our GET tests to be ""official"" at Los Alamos. It was a great waste of an hour. We all passed with semi-flying colors (c'mon it was open book...)     We then went back to the hotel and chilled for like 2 hours. But I was on a mission. I needed a phone card and some chapstick. After like a half hour of getting myself lost in the massive town of Los Alamos, I found the phone card and spent a whopping 10 bucks of government money. I then made a phone call to Erin Mulcahy in my true hometown of Pembroke Pines, Florida.     After David, Alyse, Brock, and Seth came downstairs, we all headed for China Moon, a decent chinese buffet. We ate, and then played the fortune cookie game (hahaha it's really quite amusing!)     Anyway, we met Donna, et al, back at the hotel and headed off to pick up Don, Galen, and Carol Hogsett (?) at LANL. Carol was our geological tour guide and we drove to various sites in the Jemez mountains. We first stopped at the caldera we saw the first night and sat there, and had lunch (not my group, who already ate) and Carol talked about the geology and history of it. Then, we stopped at this site where there was a lot of pumice rock. We had fun throwing it at the adjacent cliff, watching the cliff dissolve under the massive weight of the pumice. It was like compacted powder.... Then we drove to Battleship Rock, this really cool, really old cliff kinda sticking out of the mountain. It did look like the hull of a battleship. Anyway, we then hiked up a steep incline to this cave thing, where we searched for fossils. This was great because all the rocks were like mint green and rust colored, and it was limestone (I think) and it was soooo old that it was just flaking off. Collin, myself, Brock, David, and Kala then climbed way higher into the mountains, going to another cave-like thing. It was horrible trying to climb down though, because the rock/sand/rubble was so loose, and the incline so steep, you ended up falling and sliding. In my attepts to catch myself, I tore up my palm and cut my arm. Whatever. This was the first time the altitude caught up with my breathing. Then, we went back to Soda Dam, yet another place we saw the first night. But this time was awesome. Instead of seeing the hot springs in Soda Dam, we crossed the street and hiked/climbed up the super-steep mountain to a gigantic open cave on the top. It was great. Then, Brock led me out to a cliff that was so high it hung out and overlooked the street below. It was AMAZING. That was definitely the first time I truly realized my own mortality... Getting down was a problem though. I made it, fairly unharmed. Afterwards, we traveled to the Fenton Hill Observatory for the fisrt time, taking a little tour of the facility in the daytime. It was very different than I expected-- no grass, just ""trailers"" and dirt. Oh well, it's still cool.    We then headed back to town. A bunch of us chilled in our room, and ate cheese tortillas in our nifty microwave and slept until we had to go to yet another lecture. We watched a guy from the JPL (jet propulsion lab) talk about the Mars probe expeditions. They old guy from last night was there, with a whole new variety of idiotic questions. For example, ""Where's the camera?"" There was also this little 7 year old girl who was soooo annoying! When the lecturer said that maybe the Earthwatch kids would go to Fenton Hill tonight, she just busts out with, ""NO!! They can't! The cloud cover is way too..."" blah blah blah, on and on. Geez. It began to thunder and rain, so instead of going to Fenton Hill to observe until 1 am, we're back at the Canyon School, doing our journals.     To our luck, we actually DID go to Fenton Hill for the first time. The majority of us spent our time with Don and Galen, doing casual observing of stars, globular clusters, double stars, etc. I also (with the ever-so-kind help of Galen) learned to locate many stars (Vega, Acturus, Spica, Antares, etc.) and constellations. We left around one-ish but its like an hour drive, so we got back kinda late. We were all so exhausted that the latter half of the drive home was dead-silent. We were all asleep.              Day 4- Wednesday, June 20, 2001    Today, we traveled to the capital city of New Mexico, Santa Fe. It was about a 45 minute drive along some more gorgeous highway. We arrived, and went directly to the Plaza Resturant for lunch. I sat with David, Corrie (ex-Earthwatch member intern person), Steven, and Collin. After, Don let us loose for a whopping hour in the central Plaza. Alyse and I wanted to get some Indian turquoise jewerly, but it was starting at like $40 bucks a pop. We passed. We saw some Indian people, and actually found a five and dime store where we got cheap-o souviners.     We then traveled to the Santa Fe Community College to their planetarium to see a pretty decent show. It really reinforced our internal location of the stars and such. The chairs there were awesome. Big, comfy, reclining, in a dark room....    On a side note, every single one of Santa Fe's buildings was built from brown adobe. It was kinda weird, it felt like we were in Mexico or something....    At 6:30, as usual, we had our daily lecture at Bradbury, about the Galileo and Cassini space missions. It was interesting, but alas, The Old Man was not there. ::Sigh:: Oh well. And the little girl's father must have instructed her to be quiet, b/c she was there, but silent. ::Sigh:: Alas, our lecture entertainment was no more.    Tonight, we went to FHO again, but this time with a mission. There were several ""reporters"" from local newspapers and from LANL interviewing us about Earthwatch. Afterwards, Galen and Don put us ""to work."" We split into groups of 2, I was with David, and they gave us a list of 50 binary stars. We then had to use the right ascension and declination coordinates to locate them and measure the ""seeing"" of the site by determining whether or not we could seperate them. We used a 7"" Meade Maksutov type telescope. But no, we couldn't just do that. First we had to ALIGN the telescope. Dave and I must have spent an hour aligning and realigning that thing. (Arcturus Dave! Not Antares!) Oh well. We actually got 45 stars looked at before the interns closed our telescope. We even beat Steven (hahahahaa!) We stayed there until like after 3 am, and got back after 4. Alyse and I wanted to go to bed soooo bad, and Seth was throwing another party. Since we didn't want to go, they all busted into our room and had the party there. Arggg.... It was really interesting because Kala gave us a cool lecture-thing about Hawaii. It was fun. Also, they tried to get Brock to come, but he was.... ""vulnerable."" Hahahahahaa. Despite the fact that Dave fell asleep on my bed, after I sent him back to his room, I went to sleep. The time was 10:20 am.              Day 5- Thursday, June 21, 2001    Today was not a good day. We had a lecture at 2:00 on neutrinos by Dr. Todd Haines. It was really good, but I was so tired, considering I only had like a 3 hours worth of sleep.    After, we all went to the Central Ave. Grill here in Los Alamos to celebrate Galen's ""17 times 3"" birthday. It was really nice. I sat by Kala, Don, Galen, and Galen's wife, Susan. They had a big cake wih 17x3 candles and there were a total of like 25 people. We also gave Galen glowsticks. I don't think he liked them....    He then gave a lecture on cosmology at Bradbury, halfway through I got all sick. I actually felt like I was going to die. I was so looking forward to his lecture, and I missed most of it, and most of the part I did see, I felt so sick, it really didn't matter.     After the lecture, I stayed at the hotel for the night, instead of going to Fenton Hill. Oh well.              Day 6- Friday, June 22, 2001    Today was a nice ""sleep-in"" day. At around 11 am, we all (the earthwatch kids, Don, Galen, and Donna) went to the Hill Diner for lunch. It was really nice to just have the ""real"" group there. I talked mostly to Galen, Kala, Dave, and Collin about college, etc. I throughly enjoyed it.    After, we went to Canyon School for a lecture on radio astonomy from Don. It was pretty interesting. I really had no idea that all those beautiful, colorful images of ""transient phenomena"" were captured via radio waves. Also, we learned how the VLA dishes worked, so that we'll have some sort of background on them for our journey on Tuesday the 26. After that we went into the iMac lab to work on web pages and searching for pictures of toothpicks and glowsticks...    Then Jim Wren came into the room and gave us a brief lecture on the telescope system, ROTSE. What it is is an almost completely robotic telescope syastem consisting of 4 lens mounted onto 4 CCD cameras. It does several ""sky patrols"" each night, but has the capability to stop whatever it's doing to try to catch a visual of a gamma ray burst (GRB.) There are 3 seperate systems, I, II, and III (what a novel concept.) ROTSE I is the one in main usage, and ROTSE III will be headed off to Australia soon. ROTSE II is kind of no being used at the moment.    After our lectures, we all wanted to get pizza hut delivered, but, alas, they don't deliver. So, we opted to go to a local pizzaria, Tony's Pizza. We ordered 3 large pizzas, which were really good. Then Seth knocked over his drink onto his lap. That was funny (maybe not for him...) so he ran back to the hotel to change while the rest of us finished up and headed across the street to Bradbury for Bob Reedy's lecture on the ""Near Earf Mission to Mars."" And yes, I did say Earf. The guy was so amusing in his lack of proper enunciation. Kala was laughing so hard, he got a massive nosebleed... hahaa. And what makes it even more fun was the fact that The Old Man was there, and trying argue with the scientist. ""Well, ya know, some rocks just aren't magnetic!! Some are, but some aren't!"" We got some great shots of the old man, the little girl's father, and the bearded lady.     On the way back to the hotel, we stopped in the Furr's parking lot because there was a concert going on. It was an Austrailian band called Brothers, and they we all decked out in bagpipes and purple leather kilts. Very interesting. Watching them was great, not b/c of the band, but because of the people dancing to it. The penguin man and his purple shorted date were just too much. We were all dying of laughter watching them. And, of course, Brock had to make his signature rabid-dying-mose-giving-birth sound for the audience. It was great.    We then went back to the hotel to change, and left to go to the ROTSE site. We drove by the LANCSE site, which is a half mile long proton accelerator. Awesome stuff. And, to top it off, right across the way from the ROTSE telescopes was actual radioactive waste (that made my day! no sarcasm.) We all sat out by the cliff thing and were goofing off waiting to take our turn in ROTSE. Brock was trying to destroy the garbage can, while David looked like a nun and sand the ""Circle of Life"", and Collin sat atop a ladder. Brock was my partner, and we took a walk to the other end of the facility (setting off ""alarms"" as we went) and then we were the last group to go into ROTSE. We ""drove"" it, but there was complete cloud coverage, so our CCD image was of clouds instead of a spiral nebula! Oh well.    After, we went back to the hotel room, for sleep, I think....              Day 7- Saturday, June 23, 2001    We got to sleep in, again. At 11:30, we drove up to Fenton Hill. The gates were locked, so we went to the mountain store down the mountain store to hang out for a while. Then we went back to the Hill and had lunch, throwing chips and having ""double mayos, staight no chasers"" (ewww...) Then these people from UC cam to talk to us. It was okay.     We then got a tour of MILAGRO, a cosmic ray detector, that was like a gigantic waterbed! Frank Samuelson, our ""guide"" actually let us all run around on it. People were doing flips and such. That was like the highlight of the day.    Then, we had nothing ""concrete"" to do so I went to the DAT trailer and Corrine, David and I looked at radio frequencies to see for interference. That lasted for about an hour and a half, until I was practically asleep. Then I went over to the satellite tracking system and worked with Kala for about 3 hours on seeing which of the satellites would go over the lab that night. We had fun dissolving the biodegradable sytrofoam into a paste. It was interesting...    We then went to the Ops Building, and David and I had an arguement on DCI, the holy Cadets vs the mediocre Cavaliers... It was fun. We then hung out outside, stick fighting and making walking sticks, geting eaten alive by the mosquitos. Not fun ( I got bit on my forehead!)    We ate dinner, and then toasted marshmellows, and tried to think up additional lyrics to ""Survivor."" (David and Corrine should NEVER EVER become songwriters.) Kala drew the ""Earfwatch 2001"" logo on the dry erase board, and others were still working on the computers.     It was a pretty uninteresting day, until we all decided to add Brock's glowsticks to the styrofoam paste and paint ""Earfwatch"" on the back of the van...    The seeing was horrible, and it was way overcast, so we went back to the hotel. We ended up going to Collin and Kala's room for a ""party."" It consisted of Brock lip singing his favorite songs (You're as cold as ice...) Collin doing laundry (fabric softener sheets go in the dryer, not the drawer..) and Kala sleeping (messing up his clothes because they ""were warm"".) It was pretty uneventful, and we left and went to bed.              Day 8- Sunday, June 24, 2001    Today, we met up with a representative from the Durfee Foundation, and we took a hike through Bandelier National Monument. It was really great. The scenery was gorgeous, and the history was really interesting (cover up those numbers!) It was raining, which was good, and we climbed up the 140 ft. ladders to get to the ceremonial cave (?) which had an awesome view. I suppose because of the altitude, I was beyond winded, and I had no water... We took pictures, and then headed down.     We then headed over to Galen's house for a party. Galen has a really nice house, chock full of musical instruments. At first, Kala and I looked at the entire 2000 Guiness Book of World Records. It was fun. Then we ate and looked at this hilarious book of signs with Steve, Ellie, and Andy (Galen's kids.) Then the jam session began. Galen didn't have an instrument I was good at, but I played around with the harpsicord, flute, recorders, and the harp (pretty difficult...) But man, Brock and Seth were actually having a jam session. They are both soooo awesome on guitar and piano. Then everyone was around them, singing and playing instruments. It was fun. Alyse said it was ""the happiest moment of her life"" and she now wants to name her child Galen.    We all then sat around the TV and watched Contact. It was a really great night.              Day 9- Monday, June 25, 2001    Today began around noontime, when we met over at Canyon School to do some journal updating and binary star data. After hours of this, we all decided to go to our local Subway for lunch. Oh man, this is a story within itself. I believe I mentioned the first day they had a sign on the door: no bread. Next day, not meat. Third day: no workers. Quaility store, huh? Well today, they were not closed, but all they had working were idiots that were sotr! (dont ask.) You might want to see Brock's page for details.     We all went back to the Seth and Brock's room, ate, and then Alyse and I realized that we had no clean clothes. We left, got our stuff, and headed off to the laundry room, with our crazy washing machines that we have to sit on to get them to stop moving around. Well, we had a lecture at Bradbury at 6:30, but because of the not-hot dryers, our clothes were still soaking wet!! We took them out, layed them on or beds, cranked up the AC (why? it seemed like a good idea at the time...) and went to the lecture.     Our wet-clothing sacrifice was worth it. Ed Fenimore was the lecturer, and he debunked the scientific method and *finally* we were enlightened about gamma ray bursts."

Updated 1/9/03                         Employees leaving Lab must attend termination presentation         Employees who are leaving the Laboratory or changing to casual status          must attend a benefits termination presentation held by Benefits (HR-B).         The termination presentations are held every Laboratory pay day for University          of California Lab employees. Employees who are retiring aren't required          to attend a presentation, but rather, they should schedule a meeting with          their designated benefits specialist.         The presentations begin at 8:30 a.m. in room P280 on the second floor          of the Otowi Building at Technical Area 3. Pre-registration is required.          Employees should register on line at  http://hrcluster.lanl.gov/TIOCourses/TIOAha.asp?CourseNumber=21013           one to two weeks prior to their last scheduled work day to sign up for          a benefits termination presentation.         Employees also must obtain a departure processing form from Staffing          (HR-S) before the presentation. This form is available at  http://www.hr.lanl.gov/hrstaffing/Terminations/index.stm           online.         At the presentation, employees will receive a packet of information about          their benefits and savings balances. They will learn about options to          continue or convert insurance plans and distribution options for savings          funds.         Employees who require a sign language interpreter should write to  benefits@lanl.gov           by e-mail three days in advance of the presentation they plan to attend.          Or call the benefits office at 5-3842 (TDD).         Because of limited parking, employees should plan to arrive early and/or          make alternative transportation arrangements, such as using Johnson Controls          Northern New Mexico's ride service.

GX046-65-0715478	"Ask A Scientist   Chemistry Archive              Bonds for Tie Dye    (Created prior to 1993)  Question: I need references high school students could access for info about  bonds (types, process, etc.) between cotton fibers and dyes.  Current  references do not provide enough detail. ------------------------------------------------ Are you asking about the kinds of chemical bonds which can occur  between a dye molecule and a shirt fiber?  Or are you just interested in a  general sense in how dyes work?  One reference I found is ""The Chemistry and  application of dyes"" edited by David R. Waring and Geoffre Hallas (New York,  Plenum Press, 1990).  Another is ""Colour Chemistry"" by Reginald L.M. Allen  (New York, Appleton-Century-Crofts, 1971).  Finally, try ""The colour science  of dyes and pigments"" by K. McLauren (Bristol, A.Hilger, 1986).  I spoke with  my wife (who is a tie-dye expert) a little about dyes.  She tells me that  fiber-reactive dyes, like the ones she uses, bind to the individual fibers of  cotton cloth.  The main reason she uses cotton is that the fibers are  naturally hollow, and dye molecules can form bonds to the fiber from the  inside and outside of the fiber (resulting in brightly colored fabric).  The  cotton fabric is prepared before dying by soaking in potash, a powerfully  basic substance.  I suspect that this ""charges up"" active sites on the cotton  fibers, similar to the way that one ""charges up"" an analytical resin column  with acid before passing a solution through it to remove unwanted impurities .  . .  charged with active sites, the dye has many places on the fiber surface  to form good strong bonds.  Now, if you are using those el cheapo RIT dyes you  buy at the supermarket, your shirt will probably run.  They are not fiber- reactive at all, but are merely pigment dyes.  They will look nice at first,  but every trip through the washer will remove some of the water-soluble dye  and eventually your cool ""Grateful dead"" pattern has turned into a brownish- pink mess.  So, either use fiber-reactive dyes, or do not wash your shirt!

Science and Technology Log: Today we are underway to the next location which is the area of deployment for the PMEL Tsunami buoy.  I want to talk a little bit about what a Cruise Plan is and why you need one.  I have attached a picture of our latest cruise plan from Dr. Weller.  He had a very nice one ready to go well before we even boarded the ship and everyone in the science party ( yes, including me:) was given a copy.  Consider this the ""game plan"", it can and does change  due to weather or other unforeseen factors and it is very important that the Chief Scientist makes sure that it gets revised as it is necessary to make sure we will have enough time for all of the different deployments and data collections that are planned or to modify as needed.  These cruises are very expensive; from the cost of the ship itself ,to the equipment and science party, to the value of the data collected.  For the Stratus Project,  ( http://uop.whoi.edu/stratus ) this is the big event of the year, everything leads to this moment when the buoy and instruments are recovered and the new buoy is deployed.  Any mistakes made now could potentially result in the loss of data for a whole year.  This brings to mind the importance of really good planning for an expedition of this magnitude.  The Chief scientist has to know how much time he/she need to accomplish their project, build in a few days extra in case of weather or delays, know how much equipment to bring for the project including spare parts ( just in case Murphy's Law kicks in...which it does more often than not!).  Redundancy of equipment is essential from the project itself to the ship which has to be able to repair while on the move  with extra parts it has with it or to make a part as needed ( yes, they can do that!).  There are no stores out here, if you forget it or run out, you're out of luck!  That means a years work and a big grant could be in danger!  Prior planning is not just a good idea, it is essential and a good Chief scientist has foreseen almost any extenuating circumstance.  There is also the importance of remaining calm and being able to come up with creative solutions to problems in the middle of an important project.  Everyone is watching the Chief scientist and takes their cues on behavior from him/her.  If something happens, they watch to see how he reacts.  The technicians and research associates in a science party need to work well together as they may be at sea for long periods of time ( could be a month to several months) .  When you are at sea 8 hour days doesn't mean much.  You work whenever there is work to do, deployments or data collection can and do happen around the clock.  The time out here is expensive and data collection is sensitive to many different parameters.  You work seven days a week, but everyone is doing the same and it builds a sense of comradeship to be sharing the work.  Scrabble and Cribbage tournaments in off time are a big event.  Even though they work really hard out here, they all realize the value of what they do and they are here because this is what they wanted to do in life: science.  It is pretty exciting too, you never know what you might see and no matter how long you have been going to sea or how many cruises you do a year, it is still exciting to see whales or dolphins, and beautiful sunset still makes you pause. Sometimes, as in this cruise, there may be more than one project and multiple scientists.  However, there has to be a Chief scientist to determine priorities and the scheduling concerns so that everyone gets their data, specimens or deploys their equipment.  To be a chief scientist you need to be detail oriented and having workaholic tendencies ( at least during a cruise) doesn't hurt!  This does not mean they don't have fun after all the hard work is done.  Dr. Weller plans a few days at the beginning and end of a cruise after all the work is done ( his group have been working everyday for a month!) to see some of the sights and enjoy the culture of the ports they visit.  Sometimes these days get used for unforeseen circumstances, like extra time for loading, unloading and shipping, actually that's why they are put in there.  But if everything gets done in a timely manner, there is a little bit of down time.  He even organizes the tours  and had guide books for each of the ports we visited( it's that detail oriented thing I mentioned!).  He understands the value of appreciating the quality of work your group produces.  Many times the group will consist of one or more grad students under the Chief scientist and this is how they learn to be a chief scientist, it is not a class they take as part of their Ph.D. program, it comes from observation and personal experience.  So mentoring is another important component of the job description.  Seeing the bigger picture is also part of the equation; Dr. Weller really wanted a Teacher at Sea as part of this cruise to help share this experience with younger students and hopefully give a small peek at real scientific research to both k-12 teachers and students.  Many scientists today see the value of this and NOAA has been doing this for 13 years.  Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution has some outstanding education outreach programs such as ""Dive and Discover"" ( check out that WHOI web site!)  Scripps Oceanographic Institution  has additional resources at the SIO web site. Please check out the attached picture of the latest cruise plan, as well as a picture of one of the cups that the science party sent down to 4000m on the CTD.  I think the sentiment on the cup is a good reflection of the esteem in which they hold Dr. Weller and I wholeheartedly agree!         Hasta manana                                  Note for educators:     Consider this web site, as well as the other NOAA Teacher at Sea Web sites, a resource for teaching your students.

GX016-34-15205126	"Magic Is Alive   IN INDIA   By LEA TERHUN  George Lucas' Industrial Light and Magic sets the benchmark for special effects worldwide, as it has ever since Star Wars changed filmmaking three decades ago. Now Indian production companies are expanding capacity to meet international demands for digital animation. Ramesh Sharma thinks the benefits will be bigtime.    A smooth glide from Delhi on the Noida Expressway, a turn into a peaceful road flanked by trees, and you are in Film City. Buzz isn't obvious, but signs pointing the way to the Zee TV studios hint that you're in the right neighborhood for it. A pleasant edifice rises at the end of the block, all brick, steel and glass. It is the headquarters of Moving Picture Company. Inside abundant light, splashes of primary colors, and emphatic vertical space create a serene atmosphere that belies the intensity within. Computers in edit suites and open stations hum under the fingers of artist-technicians who are the stars at this high-tech dreamworks of filmmaker Ramesh Sharma and his wife Uma Gajapati Raju. Moving Picture Company spins films from ideas into cine-reality: ads, documentaries, short subjects and, most recently, 3D animated cartoons. It is on the front lines of an emerging trend, a product of the union of talent and technology. India, like the surfer girl heroine of the Disney cartoon feature Lilo and Stitch, is on the crest of a wave of digital outsourcing, and people like Ramesh Sharma are ready to ride.   Sharma has been in the film business for nearly 25 years. His first film, Monastery Wreathed in a Thousand Rainbows (1979), was a documentary about the 16th Karmapa and Rumtek monastery in Sikkim. A few years later Sharma achieved notoriety with his exceptional feature film starring Om Puri and Shashi Kapoor, The New Delhi Times (1985). Irked by the anti-corruption message-the story line dramatized the nexus between politicians and criminals-the government banned the award-winning film for a time. Since then Sharma has maintained a respectable profile in film production in partnership with his wife Uma, also a well-known media professional. Moving Picture Company has steadily grown, always with an eye toward the future. And, according to Sharma, digital animation is the future. ""I've been very keen that we should get into animation, primarily because we are a creatively driven company and we can bring a whole lot of value to this business,"" he says. Success in information technology, and the increase in diverse business product outsourcing to India, leads him to one conclusion, ""India is a dominant force."" India's ""incredible taskforce"" and the incredible volume of potential work from customers abroad, particularly the United States, Canada and Japan, plus demands of the domestic market spell opportunity for savvy film studios. Digital animation is now essential for motion picture visual effects, video games-""close to a $37 billion industry,"" Sharma points out-workaday ads, network IDs, or bread-and-butter documentaries. ""Animation is going to be one of the biggest growth markets,"" declares Sharma.      He is ebullient because a special project has just been completed: the pilot for a new cartoon series  based on the Panchatantra-in 3D. Investment in 3D animation technology, currently available at only a few Indian studios, was a carefully considered decision. Already involved in many co-productions for documentaries and with feature films on the story board, the next step for Moving Picture Company was an upgrade to 3D to complement its 2D facilities. ""We are doing ad films completely in 3D, for a company called NOW, an Internet service provider."" Now he hopes to market his winsome cast of Panchatantra-inspired  animal cartoon characters in Jungle Tales (Jungal Mangal in Hindi) to a global audience. ""We started looking for stories we felt would have crossover appeal, a story that would have appeal for children all over the world. So we selected the Panchatantra tales because they are based on animals, and animals have no culture-specific rules,"" he says.    Global outreach is an important part of the vision of Moving Picture Company. ""In fact,"" Sharma says, ""we are looking at possibilities of setting up idea cells and developmental cells in the U.S. and in the U.K. where we will have writers, creative people, develop it according to the market there, but the intellectual property rights are co-owned by us. So we don't become just a service industry, but we become partners in creativity...a kind of global partnership, so that we make a product that can be then sold worldwide."" A recently completed documentary, Afghanistan: Beyond the Taliban Years, co-produced with U.S.-based TeleProductions International (TPI), is one such film which uses all the bells and whistles of digital filmmaking and is targeted at a multinational audience. Tweaking a film to satisfy differing country-to-country requirements is easy in the digital world.    There are two roads to travel, Ramesh Sharma explains. One is outsourcing, ""basically doing the backend work, which means the designs are all made in America. The entire development of the story idea is done in America. The narrative soundtrack comes from America, and we execute it here."" The other is creative co-production, for which state-of-the-art studios are well equipped. Moving Picture Company has 30 engineers, including 18 core people who are both technical and creative whizzes. Every-thing is done in-house. Nothing is outsourced. With two studio floors, eight edit bays, camera people, writers, editors and the new 3DS Max/Discreet technology, ""it's one stop shopping,"" Sharma says. Co-production with well-endowed foreign partners makes sense economically. The Jungle Tales series consists of 26 episodes, 23 minutes each. It is an expensive proposition. In regular 2D, the minimum cost for a 23-minute cartoon is $150,000. ""3D, $200,000 minimum,  maybe even more. It can't be less,"" according to Sharma. Chief animator, National Institute of Design-trained Anupama Chatterjee, adds, ""It's a gargantuan task...you have to create the actors and make them act."" Regardless of the exhausting attention to detail required, she finds the work ""very exhilarating.""    Blossoming enthusiasm in the industry led to the founding of the Animation Producers Association of India (APAI) in October, which counts UTV Toons, Pentamedia, Padmalaya, Tata Elxi, Crest and Maya Entertainment among its members. So far the outsourcing market has been dominated by providers in the Far East, so to get a piece of that action APAI will represent members at important international festivals, create a Web site, and generally put out the good word that magic is alive in India, too. ""Long format animation, advertising films, visual effects for movies, all of that is a part of the world of animation. Lagaan-look at the clouds coming in. You can't get those kinds of clouds otherwise,"" Sharma observes, a gleam in his eyes. ""That is computer graphics. It can be done today. That's the magic of cinema. And that's what makes cinema so much more exciting today, because you can really let your imagination go wild.""

(Apollo 11 and her crew have been home almost 4 days , basking in the adulation of an admiring world, a world unaware that another NASA mission carries on, braving the cold, the darkness, the unknown, battling bacterial and air contamination, and the psychological toll that confinement, the cold, and sensory deprivation are exacting).          July 30 th , Day 16, and the food situation has become a problem .  The hot water system has not performed well.  The water is tepid, and it’s too early in the mission to use up valuable electricity to heat water.  The crew reconstitutes freeze-dried rations with tepid water, and finds distraction between scientific duties in reading, listening to music, and playing games, like Scrabble and poker.  Willy Nelson’s ""On the Road Again"" becomes a crew favorite.     August 1 st   is Swiss Natioanl Day.  Piccard and Aebersold call the President of Switzerland and send their best.   But the Gulf Stream has another nasty surprise in store for them.  Grumman scientists have been tracking the main core from the air and have detected another giant eddy in the current.  It appears that the  Franklin  is going to be ejected again, this time to the west, toward the mainland.          The  Franklin  manages to avoid the eddy, as the central core of the Gulf Stream now turns to the east, and carries them away from Cape Hatteras .  Tropical Storm Anna passes overhead, the  Privateer  is driven off station, but things are relatively serene in the  Franklin .  Busby wonders why more exploration and study of the oceans doesn’t happen underwater, away from the dangers of the sea surface and the weather.   The crew reports seeing large numbers of blue, gray, and hammerhead sharks.   Ken Haigh picks up dolphin and whale ""conversation"" around the sub as it drifts ever more quickly in the stream, with speeds up to 3 knots.    As the sub drifts north, masses of plankton are drawn to the  Franklin ’s lamps, but the Deep Scattering Layer has not been located - and never is for the duration of the mission.      NASA observer Chet May, now three weeks into the dive, says he believes living in future space stations will be very like the way the crew of the  Franklin  has been living aboard.   He’s observed the way the six crewmen have established routines and a social structure which he deems helpful in thinking about space station design.   However, he admits that some things, like the dart throwing, will not transfer well to the weightless environment of space.                        PREVIOUS PAGE  |   Page 15  |  NEXT PAGE"
GX059-00-0694531	Collections Overviews Home  -  Master    List of Collections Overviews             Collections Overviews - Science and Technology           LIFE SCIENCES                 [  Scope  ] [  Size  ] [  General            Research Strengths  ] [  Areas of Distinction             ] [  Weaknesses/Exclusions  ]                        SCOPE                   This overview of            the Library's collections focuses on its life science collections which            includes botany, biology, zoology, medicine, and agriculture as both            pure and applied sciences. Although the Library holds large numbers            of 19th and early 20th- century medical works, it has deferred to the            National Library of Medicine for the acquisition of clinical medicine            since the early 1950s. For the same period of time, the Library has            also deferred acquisition of technical agriculture and veterinary medicine            to the National Agricultural Library.            SIZE                       The Library's life            sciences collections number well over a half million titles and are            among the largest in the country. Materials in botany, biology, and            zoology--the backbone of our life sciences collections--number over            130,000 titles. These are supplemented by even larger collections in            medicine and agriculture, plus materials on anatomy, physiology, and            bacteriology.            GENERAL RESEARCH STRENGTHS           The Library's materials            supporting research in the life sciences are strong in both their breadth            and depth. The scientific publications of learned societies, botanical,            zoological, and agricultural research institutes, major universities,            both foreign and domestic, are well represented in our collections.            This is especially true of the publications issued in the 18th and 19th-            centuries where we have long, unbroken runs of monographic series and            journals. Holdings for the last half of the 20th-century are less complete.            The Library's collections in botany of materials on the morphology,            physiology, and evolution of plants are especially substantial as are            its collections on the taxonomy, anatomy, physiology, ethology, and            evolution of the animal kingdom.            Biology, the study            of living things, is a extremely diverse and varied discipline and represented            in the Library's collections by substantial bodies of literature on            molecular, systematic, and evolutionary biology, population genetics,            natural history, ecology, animal behavior, and microbiology. Materials            on invertebrate and vertebrate zoology, including humans, are strong            and cover all aspects of these subjects, from conception and development            to death and dying. Our collections in agriculture and medicine both            complement and expand this life sciences component of our collections.            Our materials relating to agricultural innovation, dryland agriculture,            soil erosion, agricultural economics, bioethics, public health, bioengineering,            aging, medical economics, and the diseases affecting plants, animals,            and man, are superb and have provided the basis for scientific treatises            and reports, literature reviews, scholarly research, Congressional debate,            and legislation. Titles in the LC Science Tracer Bullet series on scientific            topics of current interest also highlight notable reference works and            major monographs in these areas.            AREAS OF DISTINCTION           The Library's collections            of materials chronicling the botanical discovery of North America are            particularly strong. The history of plant exploration and taxonomic            botany has been captured in the scientific tracts of the great exploring            expeditions and the transactions of botanical societies, lyceums, and            herbariums and are highlighted in color plate volumes by such artists            as Isaac Sprague, Titian Ramsay Peale, and Pierre Joseph Redout. Discovering,            naming, and learning the uses of the flora and fauna of America sparked            an interest in economic botany that is reflected in our collections            by a plethora of material on plant utilization in commerce and industry,            biotechnology, genetic engineering, and ethnobotany.            The Library's collections            of herbals, food plants, and medicinal plants are described in some            length in Leonard Bruno's  The Tradition of Science: Landmarks of            Western Science  in the Collections of the Library of Congress (Washington,            1987) and in James Reveal's  Gentle Conquest: the Botanical Discovery            of North America  with Illustrations from the Library of Congress            (Washington, Starwood Pub., Inc., 1992). The Library's collections chronicling            the history of agriculture and the natural sciences in 18th and 19th-century            America are also clearly noteworthy. Again the proceedings of state            academies of science, the transactions of scientific and learned societies,            the accounts and discoveries of naturalists on expeditions sponsored            by natural history museums, zoological societies, and government survey            teams, and our rich collections of correspondence, reminiscences, and            biographical material from those periods provide the source material            for scholars. Especially important for the early history of medicine            are the collections of the 19th-century physician Joseph Toner. In addition            to his own correspondence, Dr. Toner collected a large number of letters            of doctors and prepared many bibliographical and biographical studies            in manuscript. The Library's psychoanalytic collections, which include            the papers of Sigmund Freud and those of most of his European and American            disciples, is among the finest in the world.            WEAKNESSES/EXCLUSIONS                       Because the Library            limits its collecting of rare books and manuscripts in the life and            physical sciences, concentrating its collections in those areas to materials            in the history of technology, the Library's holdings of the manuscript            collections of botanists, biologists, zoologists, and those working            in the life sciences, including agriculture and medicine are relatively            weak. The exceptions are the papers of E. O. Wilson, Gregory Pincus,            Jacques Loeb, T. Swann Harding, William C. Gorgas, Luther Burbank, William            T. Hornaday, Gifford Pinchot, and G. Hart Merriam.            Through the years,            volumes in the Library's unlocked stacks containing irreplaceable hand-colored            illustrations of flora and fauna from our collections of 18th- and 19th-century            books and journals have been mutilated, and many priceless color plates            removed. Materials hardest hit in the life sciences collections were            our folio volumes and  Curtis's Botanical Magazine .            A decision to            stop cataloging monographic series as collected sets in the early 1970s            has made access to our collections of the publications of university            museums, zoological, botanical, and learned societies as well as state            survey and natural history offices more difficult for readers. Many            volumes in botanical, biological and zoological series have been unavailable            to scholars or lost in arrearages awaiting classification. The fact            that the Library does not have an organized or established system of            claiming missing journal issues has also affected runs of scientific            journals in recent years.

GX007-94-10037078	Ask A Scientist   Mathematics Archive              Perfect numbers   Author:      kantars How are perfect numbers generated?  Response #:  1 of 2 Author:      tee If K is a prime and M(K) = 2^K-1 is also a prime (now called a Mersenne prime) then P(K) =2^(K-1)*M(K) is a perfect number (the sum of all of its proper divisors is equal to P(K)).    Response #:  2 of 2 Author:      rcwinther In fact, Euler proved that ALL *even* perfect numbers MUST be of the form given in response #1.  Just recently a new Mersenne prime was found, thus bringing the total number of known perfect numbers (if I remember correctly) to 33. It is not known if there are infinitely many perfect numbers, nor it is known whether there are any odd perfect numbers.  (However, in 1973 it was proven that, if there are, they must be larger than 10^50.)

The quake was preceded by concentrated pre-earthquake strain in the region, detected by sparse readings from newly developed Global Positioning System (GPS) deformation monitors.   NASA's unique contributions to this rapidly maturing field of study and implications of this research for mitigating future seismic hazards are the focus of a Earth Science Update, Thursday, 1 p.m. EST in NASA's Webb Auditorium, 300 E Street S.W., Washington.  In the 10 years since the devastating Northridge earthquake, a high tech GPS based ground deformation network was installed within Southern California. It provides a continuous measurement of ground deformation at 250 locations with a precision of a few millimeters.  Advances in satellite based radar Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar and lidar are combined with the GPS measurements to provide images of ground deformation for the entire Southern California earthquake region. Researchers obtained very surprising results, from the discovery of quiet earthquakes to imaging ground water withdrawal rates. These new high accuracy, space based radar, lidar, and GPS measurement technologies, coupled with powerful new computer modeling capabilities, have revitalized research in earthquake prediction with a new understanding of how the Earth's surface is changing.

Scientists at                NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif., together with                NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center ; Ames Research Center, Mountain                View, Calif.; and several universities, are developing an advanced                earthquake modeling system called QuakeSim. When completed in late                2004, QuakeSim's simulation tools will help scientists learn more                about what makes earthquakes happen.                The tools are                based upon the latest technologies. For example, one uses finite                element analysis, which solves complex computer modeling problems                by breaking them into small pieces. For QuakeSim, the finite elements                are tens to hundreds of thousands of measurements of how Earth's                crust deforms in response to movement of the giant tectonic plates                Earth's landmasses ride upon.

GX008-69-5452993	"Volume 4, Number 3    July/August 1996      Welcome to Innovation       Earthquake!     By John C. Mankins     When the quake hit, Ernest Schmidt was in a St. Louis skyscraper. Major earthquakes in the Midwest were exceptionally rare, but they could happen. Schmidt had never felt one and, like many in the building, felt only a momentary sense of surprise and fear. Then he remembered the Disaster Defense System the city had mandated five years earlier. An integrated network had been overlaid across all the major buildings downtown, including a web of sensors to detect dangers; discrete mechanical dampers, actuators and a range of other similar systems to allow individual buildings to react; and distributed computing and power supplies-all coupled together by continuous communications and monitoring from satellites in space. At the time, Schmidt had doubts about the cost, which was targeted on more typical threats in the region such as twisters. Surprisingly, individual elements of the system proved to be inexpensive, and collectively they were affordable. Now, as an earth- quake rippled through the structure, dampened automatically to a fraction of the force it would have had on an unprotected building, he had no doubts. It was rather amazing to him that by using technologies and systems developed for space program purposes, so many lives could be affected right here in his home town. Or maybe, he thought as the tremors faded, it was not really that surprising after all.    There are many areas in the marketplace where NASA and the space community's expertise, technology and facilities can be applied to do more directly for the public than just make scientific and technological discoveries. Strong programs for space technology commercialization have been developed by NASA, with an equally strong underpinning of policy in NASA's ""Agenda for Change,"" which details Agency goals and objectives in this area. Similarly, the aerospace industry has developed many technology application partnerships with nonaerospace industry- frequently between divisions of the same company.   As we enter the new century, NASA and the space community must further technology transfer and commercialization. Obviously, NASA and the space community cannot and should not be developing and deploying the commercial applications of their technologies. However, as we invent innovative and important new systems concepts of space technologies and capabilities, we must ensure that those that have terrestrial applications make their way to the private sector-quickly and easily. Revolutions of space technology might come in big ways: earthquake damage may be mitigated by a systems approach to precise computational modeling of structures and the placement of ""smart"" actuators that applies equally well in constellations of space telescopes or in the highrises of a terrestrial city. Terrestrial transportation may be transformed through the application of superconducting electromagnetic systems that are developed for future space launchers. These revolutions may be life-saving, such as new software developed both for geographically distributed space program management and for small hospitals and medical care centers operating as part of a ""virtual hospital""-with instant access to specialists nationwide via the Internet. Or such revolutions might be as small as a system that simply allows a company to exploit a satellite-based global positioning system (GPS) to more efficiently manage pizza delivery nationwide.   Scientists and engineers of space technologies may be in the best position to conceive innovative terrestrial applications of their inventions. The space community can collectively ""shake up"" established thinking at the systems level if it ""pushes the envelope"" for these new terrestrial applications by turning its inventions loose in these directions. The public and the ""bottom line"" will certainly expect no less       For more information, contact John Mankins at NASA Headquarters.

GX021-16-7374186	"Statement of Rear Admiral John Lang, British MAIB       ADMIRAL LANG: Mr. Chairman, ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon. It's a very great pleasure to be back here in Washington and to have this opportunity to tell you something about the United Kingdom's experience with data recorders in marine accident investigation.    I hope you have no difficulty in understanding a British accent for the second time today, and that you all forgive me if I lapse into an excess of nautical jargon. It's a habit of sailors when they get carried away, but I promise to stay with you, if I possibly can.    I have with me a friend and colleague, Captain Nick Beer, whose primary role is to answer all the difficult questions afterwards.    Allow me to start by setting you a very small mental task, albeit one with a very high-risk factor. I want you to shut your eyes for a moment and think what image springs to mind if I say the single word ""transport"". The risk involved is that so soon after lunch, you may feel this is an outstanding opportunity to nod off. So, perhaps you should perhaps open your eyes and consider the word again.    Most of us here today will have arrived by car or perhaps by Metro. Others will have flown into Washington, and there isn't one of us, I suspect, who isn't aware that there's a very busy airport less than one mile away.    The chance is that most people will associate the word ""transport"" with planes, cars, trucks or trains, and these are the modes that each one of us sees or uses every day. It's a curious fact of life then when asked this question, very few people ever pause to think that 95 percent of the world's trade in weight is actually carried in ships, and the sea is still the busiest highway of all.    Every day, millions of tons of gas, oil, bulk freight, manufactured goods and people are being transported across the oceans, through coastal waters, and along inland waterways. In many countries, rivers and canals are the main arteries of trade, and in some places, boats are the only form of transport.    The sea continues to be a prime source of food stuff, and fishing is a key industry for many, many countries. It is also increasingly a place of recreation. Many of us take holidays on floating cruise liners, and places like Miami are home to ships that can carry several thousand passengers.    On a more modest scale, in vessel size, if not in bank balance, some people could enjoy pleasure craft at this level, while others, many more, enjoy sailing and boating on a more modest scale on rivers, estuaries, lakes and on the open sea.    So, if I was to ask you once again what vision the word ""transport"" conjures up, I'll place a very small bet that perhaps one or two of you are now thinking of ships and the sea.     Now, let me try a second word, ""safety"". What image springs to mind? Life boats? Life jackets? Storms? Air-sea rescue helicopters? Or those poignant letters SOS or does it conjure up the name of a single ship? Titanic?     It's a curious feature of maritime life that the first thing that many people associate with the sea is disaster. This particular one remains amongst the worst of all times, and the story continues to grip people's imagination. No doubt, many of you have seen the Oscar-winning film, and if you can find a new angle on the disaster and have the gift of writing, you, too, can probably earn yourself a dollar or two.    But it is even more curious to reflect, and I hope you can read this slide, that if I was to mention the name ""Donna Paz"", the chances are that very few of you would know what I was talking about. It was the name of a Philippine Islands ferry that collided with a small tanker carrying petroleum in 1987 in what was one of the most awful transport disasters of all time.    The fire that broke out after the collision killed nearly 4,400 people or, to put it another way, about the same number of people that are carried in 10 jumbo jets, all who lost their life at the same moment.    The point of mentioning these horrific examples of past marine accidents is that although sea transport is relatively safe, accidents can and do happen.    Now, of all the things that can go wrong at sea, few manage to excite quite as much attention as a large oil tanker landing up in somebody's backyard. At one end of the scale, the master may get no more than a parking ticket, but at the other, we are talking about massive pollution damage, such as we have seen in Torey Canyon, as is seen here, Amoco Cadiz, Braer, and, of course, Exxon Valdez.    Safety at sea is foremost in many people's minds. The only United Nations body in the United Kingdom, the International Maritime Organization or IMO, is dedicated to improving safety, and many flag states spend much time and effort trying to raise standards in an industry where shortcomings are often all too evident.    But just like the air transport industry, one of the most effective catalysts for improving safety at sea has been the careful analysis of accidents. When properly carried out, they lead to effective recommendations and appropriate measures to prevent them happening again.    I can say with a degree of confidence that despite some awful tragedies, such as TWA 800 and SwissAir 111, aircraft safety has benefited immensely from the careful analysis of air accidents in the past. Much of this has been due to the widespread fitting of flight deck recorders and cockpit voice recorders and what they have revealed after the event.    I have to say I wish I could say the same about sea transport. I will make the bold assumption that most of us here are in no doubt about the value of having data recorders, but I have to say that such a view would not be shared by many ship owners and flag states around the world.    Many of them would argue strongly against them on commercial, financial or even, surprisingly, safety grounds. They see no commercial advantages to having them, and there is no doubt they are expensive to install.    They would also say that it is rare for there to be no witnesses to a marine accident, and those present are likely to be well placed to give a perfectly-good account of what occurred.    Although few would admit it, there is at least a suspicion, the one reason for this resistance is that many will be greatly embarrassed if marine accidents were probed too carefully. An element of doubt is a useful tool to employ in the law courts when resolving liability.    This failure to fit any form of data recorder in ships means that even when an investigation is carried out, those conducting it have to rely extensively on what people remember or by forensic means.     As this slide shows, there are many limitations to the existing methods of investigating accidents at sea, and it is perhaps worth reflecting that even when an accident investigation takes place, very often no report is ever published. So, none of us can ever learn from the experiences of others.    The problem with having to rely on witness evidence is that even the most gifted among us tend to forget things. How many of us remember where we put the car keys last night or what we were doing at 3:30 yesterday afternoon?     Until relatively recently, the main objective of marine accident investigation was to apportion blame or establish where liability lay. Many marine lawyers still focus on this for perfectly legitimate reasons. So far as the press is concerned, this is still the only thing worth reporting, but it is in my view an unhelpful approach when the principal objective is to find out what caused whatever the accident was and to make recommendations to prevent the same thing happening again, and this is a view shared by the growing number of independent marine accident investigation organizations around the world, many of whom are represented here today.    This enlightened approach has also led to greater interest in the human factor side of marine operations. Unlike the air transport industry, where much emphasis has been placed on this in recent years, it remains a little understood or perhaps even ignored part of sea-faring.    It is often said that over 80 percent of marine accidents are caused by human error. Interestingly, nobody really knows why, and surprisingly, little research has been conducted to find out how this appallingly-high figure can be lowered.    One of the problems faced by those who seek to make ships as safe as possible is that accidents can rarely be investigated with quite the same thoroughness as we see in air accident investigation, and the main reason for this is that with one or two exceptions, we still do not have the means of recording exactly what happened when the accident occurred.    But all is not lost. Some ship owners realize the great benefits of fitting data recorders and a handful of vessels are now sailing with a voyage data recorder fitted, and this is what one looks like on a bulk carrier. This particular one is carrying many thousands of tons of iron ore up the English Channel.    In my opinion, the sooner these are widely fitted, the better, and we can start to find out why things do go wrong at sea, and why so many accidents occur.    Although voyage data recorders are not widely fitted at sea, there are in practice many electronic instruments with memories. Some are obvious, such as shore radars, on-board closed-circuit tv, course recorders, private video cameras, and the automatic monitoring of radio transmissions.    At the same time, nearly every ship carries a range of computers that can be accessed for information if done correctly. This particular slide shows what the inside of a relatively small British fishing vessel wheelhouse looks like. Every one of these various displays has some form of memory with a potential to reveal valuable information, and I sometimes wonder how the officer of watch ever has time to look out of the window.    United Kingdom's Marine Accident Investigation Branch or the MAIB has been slowly accumulating experience in the use of a wide range of data recorders. These have varied from the simplest private video camera to a fully-integrated VDR on board a large cruise liner.    The information that we have managed to extract has frankly been quite a revelation. Not only have these various devices played a valuable and often crucial role in establishing the cause of an accident, they have also shown up the limitations of traditional methods of accident investigation, and they have also revealed much about human factors at sea.    Let me give you some examples. About three years ago, in this not particularly good slide I'm afraid, a security camera on a harbor jetty filmed a fishing vessel capsize in 16 seconds flat. This slide shows the unfortunate craft some six seconds into its embarrassing claim to instant fame. Not only did the film help identify the serious shortcomings of one fisherman's stability calculations, but recordings of the event made a major impact on other fishermen.    More recently, a vessel was in-bound up the River Thames when it ran aground and resulted in this picture. The master was absolutely sure he was in the deep water channel at the time, and the nature of the damage tended to support his view. But the evidence and the radar tapes recorded by the local port authority showed without any doubt whatsoever that he had been steering outside the channel for several minutes before he grounded.    Without such evidence, we would have been unable to make a firm judgment on what had happened or make several far-reaching recommendations about navigation competence in piloted waters.    About two years ago, a cruise liner was leaving a British port when she struck a rock and severely damaged herself as this picture of her bottom shows. Now, time doesn't permit me to go into any details, but suffice to say much of the event was recorded on video by someone standing next to the pilot, and while the video pictures greatly helped us reconstruct what actually happened, its most revealing feature was that it recorded what the pilot was saying, and we know from this that the pilot had absolutely no idea that the ship was just about to run aground.    But perhaps the most interesting investigation we have carried out was in a vessel which suffered a complete power failure one night in rough weather and started to drift towards a lee shore, and what made this incident so revealing is the vessel was equipped with a fully-integrated VDR, and to give you an idea of what it looks like inside the bridge, the recorder in this ship is situated in the gray box on the deck below the left-hand window.    The events in this incident, however, took place on this bridge at night. The most obvious advantage to arise from the VDR on this occasion is that we were able to reconstruct what happened against a common time standard, but of equal interest is it allowed us to identify many human factor issues that for all we know might have gone totally unnoticed in an investigation without the data recorder.    It was also interesting to note the surprise of some extremely reliable witnesses when they discovered that their recollection of what had happened was so different to what had actually occurred, and what made the whole episode particularly interesting is this was a well-run ship with an experienced and fully-qualified staff handling what was in effect a totally unfamiliar situation, and yet many inadvertent mistakes and errors were made.    Had it not been for the VDR, we would never have known precisely how things unfolded that night, and nothing would have been learned for the next time.    Let me take you through some examples of what actually did happen. The incident was investigated initially in a conventional manner. The crew were interviewed. Documentary evidence was examined, and the causes of the initial black-out were identified, and a picture emerged about what had happened.    But as so often happens in investigations, certain things were just not tieing up, and the deeper the investigation probed, it became clearer the events had not happened in the way described by witnesses. But the difference with this investigation is, as I said, we had access to a VDR that was, most importantly, functioning at the time.    It recorded all the significant features that underpinned the decisions taken and indeed the actions that followed. For the first time, we were able to find out not only what happened but why. We were able to listen to what people were actually saying to each other on the bridge, and this more than anything enabled the investigators to work out how the various discrepancies arose and to focus attention on matters that would almost certainly have been forgotten or ignored had it happened somewhere else.    In this particular incident, the master recalled keeping the Coast Guard informed about his vessel's movements towards the shore. He was very comfident he had done so. The Coast Guard, on the other hand, said that they had indeed been kept informed, but the reports from the vessel clearly stated that it was drifting away from the land, and using this information, the local emergency plan was never activated.    The actual exchange was recorded on both a radio transcription and the VDR. Faced with the evidence, the master was incredulous. His recollections about some of the things he had said during the emergency were very different to what the recorder revealed when it was replayed for him later.    But more revealing was that the VDR provided the information as to why the master had passed the wrong information. The bridge microphones had picked up what the officer at the chart table had reported to the master. The positional information on the VDR revealed that the officer concerned had in fact made several mistakes when plotting the ship's position on the chart and incorrectly calculating the drift direction and rate.    The VDR provided invaluable information about a vessel that was normally well run, but as it clearly revealed, even the most experienced people failed to remember things afterwards, and it also demonstrated that even in the best-run ship, things can go wrong when the pressures start to mount.    To the accident investigators, such discoveries focused attention on why the mistakes were made rather than apportioning blame or disciplining the poor person who got it wrong.    Very few merchant ships ever have the opportunity to exercise real-life crises, and when they do occur, they have to rely extensively on established but modified routines to manage whatever the new situation is. It is up to the investigator to make recommendations to explore how things might be handled differently in an emergency given the realities of life at sea today.    The catalyst for any such innovative thinking is the VDR. Without it, the chances are that precisely the same errors will be made again and again, not only in the ship in question but in others. So far as I'm aware, no in-depth study has ever been made to identify how a passenger liner captain should handle the command and control aspects of a major emergency, and this is because nobody really knows what they do at present, but the chances are that in the next major incident, the master will, I predict, probably try and do too much himself.    Careful accident analysis using VDRs may show there are better ways of doing things. Perhaps I should be bolder and say that VDR will show there are better ways. The reality of the data recorder is that it can expose the things that do go wrong, and as we have seen, things can go badly wrong at sea.    In many ships, such exposure could be acutely embarrassing if the raw material gets into the wrong hands. It is therefore understandable that such considerations might influence people's judgments when deciding whether to fit VDRs or not, but without such devices, we will never really get to the bottom of why some things do go wrong.    The important thing is not so much to point the finger at people who make the mistakes, the favorite ploy of many in the past, but to identify the problems and do something to overcome them.    Our experience to date demonstrates the very real differences between traditional ways of investigating an accident and what can be achieved with data recorders, both on board and ashore.    Despite some encouraging progress by the IMO, things will not really improve until VDRs are cheaper to fit, have proved to be effective in improving safety at sea, and mariners have confidence that the data on them is only made available to the accident investigators.    In my opinion, and it is only my opinion, the wide fitting in VDRs in every sea-going vessel, both big and small, would do more to improve safety at sea than almost any other measure. The problem is how does one encourage the ship owners to fit them.    According to some, regulating the international marine industry is comparable to King Canute telling the tide to ""hold it"". There is one thing a ship owner will always find attractive, the reduction in operating costs.    If some form of financial incentive can be provided to the vessels fitted with a functioning VDR, then we may start to see a much greater willingness to fit them and a commensurate reduction in installation costs.    If the incentives can be made large enough, then what could start as a trickle could land up as a flood. I hasten to assure you I use the word ""flood"" metaphorically.    And, finally, a personal observation. Although my evidence is still slightly tenuous, there are signs that a VDR-fitted vessel tends to have crews who are more safety conscious than those in vessels without. After all, those on board a VDR-fitted vessel will know that their poor performance can be monitored, and if they are involved in an accident, their actions will be closely scrutinized, and this thought tends to concentrate the mind a bit.    If this is true, it could just become a factor when charterers or potential passengers come to choose which vessel to use or sail in. Can you imagine what the impact would be if they were to ask whether the ship they were interested in had a voyage data recorder because they thought it was safer? It is an interesting thought, and those who travel or use ships to transport goods around the world should ask about safety because safety at sea and ways of improving it is why so many of us are here today, and in my opinion, having VDRs widely fitted at sea is one of the ways of achieving it.    Thank you."

The technology will allow farmers to navigate fields  at night and when visibility is poor. More importantly, with  soil sensors and other monitors, it will let them calculate  and map out precisely where their fields may need more water,  fertilizer or weed control, saving both time and money.                  The system combines software developed by JPL and real- time global positioning system (GPS) data from the NASA Global  GPS Network to produce corrections to the GPS orbits and  clocks. These corrections are broadcast to people using  communication satellites operated by NavCom, which has  licensed the Internet-based Global Differential GPS software  from JPL's parent institution, the California Institute of  Technology in Pasadena, and plans to market the system this  summer.                  ""NASA's Earth Science Enterprise supports pioneering  exploration and discovery of our home planet, while providing  America and the world with practical societal benefits from  our research,"" said Dr. Ghassem Asrar, associate administrator  for the Office of Earth Sciences, NASA Headquarters,  Washington, D.C.                 ""Our agreement with NavCom will accelerate NASA's ability  to develop, test and demonstrate the utility of global, real- time, precise GPS positioning for scientific and public  applications,"" said John LaBrecque, manager, Solid Earth and  Natural Hazards Program, NASA's Office of Earth Sciences.                 While existing GPS data can be used to locate a position  within a few meters, the new Global Differential GPS system  provides an instantaneous position to within 10 centimeters (4  inches) horizontally and 20 centimeters (8 inches) vertically  anywhere on Earth. No other system provides the same  combination of accuracy and coverage.                 In space, the new technology may enable improved  performance by NASA's Earth-observing satellites. Since the  satellites will have precise information on their position,  the information may make onboard data processing more  efficient and reduce the time needed to transmit the data to  the ground. NASA also expects this new positioning technology  to open the possibility for new airborne exploration  techniques through more accurately controlled flights of  airborne sensors.                 ""In the area of natural hazard monitoring, real-time data  from radar and ground networks of GPS receivers might provide  the ability to monitor volcanic activity precisely and in real  time, as well as the motion before, during and after major  earthquakes,"" said Dr. Yoaz Bar-Sever, task manager of the  NASA global differential GPS demonstration at JPL.                 The system's ability to provide precise positioning  information in real time has a variety of potential commercial  applications in aviation, marine operations, land management,  transportation and agriculture.                  The Commercial Technology Office at JPL is responsible  for the collaboration between JPL and NavCom, which will  provide NASA with a continuous, GPS differential-correction  signal and also will invest in improving the NASA GPS  infrastructure. This collaboration is just one of several JPL  programs designed to bring the benefits of the space program  to American industry.                  NASA's Earth Science Enterprise, Washington, D.C., funds  the development of the Global Differential GPS system.

Particular episodic events are of concern such as severe weather (thunderstorms, tornadoes, and hurricanes), as well as tsunamis, river flooding, plain/coastal flooding, volcanic ash, earthquakes, harmful ocean blooms and human-made disasters such as petroleum releases in rivers and oceans. Communities need an increased understanding of the effects of short-term events on the physical, chemical, and biological processes that interact to affect human safety, the environment, and the economy. Improved decision support systems are being developed that may address human life and property damage, meet the requirements of planners, early warning systems, first responders, and contribute to impact assessments, risk communication, mitigation, and implementation of relief efforts. Disaster management applications will evolve in cooperation with federal agencies such as FEMA. The applications will draw upon, and impact other national applications including coastal management, community growth, homeland security, public health and water management.

In the central equatorial Pacific, the large area of higher than normal sea surface heights (warmer than normal sea surface temperatures) associated with growing El Niño conditions has recently migrated eastward toward the coast of South America. Meanwhile, the influence of the 20- to 30-year larger than El Niño/La Niña pattern called the Pacific Decadal Oscillation continues to create warm, higher-than-normal sea-surface heights in the north Pacific that are connected in a warm horseshoe pattern with the western and southern Pacific.

SCIGN is a network of 250 GPS                     receivers which will continuously monitor motion along faults and other land surface deformation to provide better estimates of                     earthquake hazards and to more effectively support emergency response during earthquake recovery efforts.    [keywords: GPS, SCIGN, earthquake]   (Added: 22-Jun-1999 Hits: 704)   [Spider Link]                                                                                                                                                                                               + View the NASA Portal   + View Earth Science Enterprise   + View Goddard Space Flight Center     Top              + Contact Us  Chief Editor:  Tom Hood   NASA Privacy, Security Notices,   Disclaimer, & Accessibility Statements  Responsible NASA Official:  Dr. Franco Einaudi
