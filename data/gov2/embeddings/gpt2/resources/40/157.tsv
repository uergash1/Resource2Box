GX239-26-14951807	"SCHOOL FINANCE   IN COLORADO   December 2002   FOREWARD   The purpose of this booklet is to help readers understand how Colorado finances its public elementary and secondary schools. The major focus of this booklet is an explanation of the funding formula included in the Public School Finance Act of 1994, including amendments made to the act in 2002. Several illustrations are provided to help readers calculate funding under the formula. The booklet also describes several other important provisions of law that relate to school district funding. These provisions include a description of revenue that is earmarked for specific functions, other local sources of revenue, and selected specific-purpose programs that provide money to schools and school districts. Please note that this booklet is intended to provide a generic overview of programs that affect funding for schools; state law provides more specific details on the operation of the programs.   This booklet was prepared by the Colorado Legislative Council Staff, the non-partisan research arm of the Colorado General Assembly. It is also available via the Internet at http://www.state.co.us/gov_dir/leg_dir/lcsstaff/schfin/02-03-bkt.htm      TABLE OF CONTENTS             Colorado's School Finance Act       Public School Transportation               The Funding Formula       Vocational Education               What is Total Program?

Currently, these moneys are allocated under a law called the ""Public School Finance Act of 1994."" The school finance act contains a formula that calculates a per pupil funding amount for each school district based on the individual characteristics of the district, such as the cost to live in the district and the number of students enrolled. The act is explained in detail on the following pages, including amendments made under the most recent school finance bill, House Bill 02-1349. Many of the terms used in this booklet relate specifically to school finance, so a glossary is provided beginning on page 43.             THE FUNDING FORMULA       The formula for determining how much funding each school district receives under the school finance act includes several components. This section first describes the formula in general terms and then each component in greater detail.             WHAT IS TOTAL PROGRAM?       ""Total program"" refers to the total amount of funding received by a district under the school finance act, from both state and local sources. A district's total program is simply the number of pupils in the district multiplied by the district's per pupil funding level, plus an amount of funding provided to the district to compensate for the presence of at-risk pupils, plus funding for on-line students.                                     Total Program = (Pupils x Per Pupil Funding) +         At-Risk Funding + On-Line Funding                    The specific components of this formula are described in the following paragraphs along with the steps involved in calculating a district's total program.             How Are Pupils Counted?   Funding under the school finance act is based on the number of pupils enrolled in the school district on October 1. Thus, the number of pupils counted on October 1, 2002, determines funding for the budget year beginning July 1, 2002. Because the fiscal year begins in July, state aid is distributed based on estimated pupil counts. After October 1, when all pupils have been counted, state aid is adjusted to reflect the actual count. The funded pupil count is expressed in full-time equivalent (FTE) pupils to reflect the amount of time a student spends in an instructional setting.   The act provides an alternative to the October 1 count date in certain instances, such as when students in a year-round educational program will be on vacation on October 1. This alternative count date must be within 45 after the first school day after October 1.   The formula also makes enrollment allowances for districts that lose pupils from one year to the next, recognizing that such districts may have difficulty budgeting for fewer pupils. The pupil count for  declining enrollment districts  incorporates the greater of a two-year, three-year, or four-year average of the October counts.  On-line students  are counted separately from students who attend classes at schools. On-line students enrolled during the 2001-02 school year have been grandfathered into the district October counts and are excluded from the on-line count. The funded pupil count formula is illustrated below.                     Funded Pupil Count = On-Line Count + the Greater of       the Current Year's Count, Two-Year, Three-Year, or Four-Year Average of       the October Counts.                       How is Per Pupil Funding Calculated?       Per Pupil Funding Is the Statewide Base Adjusted by a District's Factors     A district's per pupil funding is the result of adjusting the statewide base by the district's cost-of-living factor, personnel costs factor, nonpersonnel costs factor, and size factor. The formula for computing per pupil funding is illustrated below and on page 26.                                     Per         Pupil Funding =           [(Base         x personnel costs factor x           Cost-of-living factor) +           (Base         x    Nonpersonnel Costs Factor)]         x          District Size Factor                         ""Statewide Base"" Is Starting Point     The calculation of each district's per pupil funding starts with a statewide base per pupil funding amount, which is set annually by the General Assembly. The statewide base for FY 2002-03 is $4,441.51, an increase of 5.7 percent ($239.51) over the prior year. Base funding accounts for roughly $3.2 billion of the $4.1 billion allocated under the formula in FY 2002-03, or approximately 77 percent of total program.   Although the General Assembly sets the base annually, Article IX, Section 17 of the Colorado Constitution, commonly referred to as Amendment 23, contains minimum increases for the base. Through FY 2010-11, the General Assembly must increase the base each year by the rate of inflation plus one percentage point. Thereafter, the General Assembly must increase the base by at least the rate of inflation.   A portion of the base is adjusted upward to account for differences in the cost of living in each district. An adjustment is also included for district size as measured by enrollment. A description of each of the components follows.   The Statewide Base Is Adjusted for Cost of Living   Each school district is assigned a factor to indicate the cost of living in the district relative to the cost of living in other districts in the state. The factors for FY 2002-03 and FY 2003-04 range from 1.008 to 1.641. Statewide, $608 million in FY 2002-03 school finance funding can be attributed to the cost-of-living factor, or nearly 15 percent of total program.   The cost-of-living factors are not contained in law, although the method for calculating the factors is. The cost-of-living factors are certified to the Department of Education by the Legislative Council Staff every two years following a study that measures the cost in each district of an identical set of items, such as housing, goods and services, transportation, and taxes. The 2001 cost-of-living study modified the factors for the 2002-03 and 2003-04 budget years. Factors are increased in districts where the study indicates an increase greater than the rate of inflation. The increase is equal to the percentage change in the district's cost of living from the previous study divided by the inflation rate. The increase in the factor is rounded to three decimal places.   District ""Personnel Costs Factor"" Defines the Portion of the Statewide Base Adjusted for Cost of Living   The formula recognizes that differences in cost of living primarily affect the salaries that must be paid to hire and retain qualified personnel. Therefore, the cost-of-living factor is applied only to the portion of the base that relates to personnel, as defined by the personnel costs factor.   Personnel costs factors range from 80.0 percent to 90.5 percent and differ by district according to enrollment; smaller districts have smaller factors. The formula for determining district personnel costs factors is illustrated on page 27.   Each district's  ""nonpersonnel costs factor""  is the difference between 100 percent and the district's personnel costs factor. It is the portion of the base which is  not  adjusted for cost of living and ranges from 20.0 percent to 9.5 percent.   District Size Factor Compensates for Economies of Scale   The act includes a size factor that provides additional money to all school districts, but particularly small school districts unable to take advantage of economies of scale. In FY 2002-03, approximately $183 million is allocated through the size factor, or about 4 percent of total program.   Similar to the personnel costs factor, a size factor is calculated under a formula using district enrollment. The smallest—districts with enrollments of less than 4,023— receive the largest size factor (up to a maximum possible factor of about 2.3458) and, therefore, more funding per pupil. All other districts receive a size factor of 1.0342.   The formula for calculating a school district's size factor appears on page 27.   Since the formula for determining the size factor is based on a district's enrollment, the act acknowledges that the formula inherently provides incentives and disincentives for districts to reorganize and take advantage of the formula. For example, when a reorganization results in a lower size factor, and less funding per pupil, the lower size factor is phased in over six years. When a reorganization results in a higher size factor, and more funding per pupil, the district or districts involved in the reorganization receive the lower size factor of the original district. Thus, the act lessens the negative fiscal impact of reorganization while prohibiting a district from taking advantage of a higher size factor following a reorganization.   The act attempts to minimize the effect that charter schools may have on the size factor of small school districts. The size factor for districts with less than 500 pupils is calculated using the district's enrollment minus 65 percent of the pupils enrolled in charter schools.         What is At-Risk Funding?       Colorado's school finance act provides additional funding for school districts that serve students who are at risk of failing or dropping out of school. The additional funding is based on the district's per pupil funding and the number of at-risk students, in addition to the proportion of at-risk students in the district. The proportion of at-risk students in each district is measured against the statewide average proportion to come up with an ""at-risk factor."" At-risk funding is determined according to the following formula.                                                   At-Risk =        At-Risk Pupils x         At-Risk Factor x Per Pupil Funding              Funding                               In FY 2002-03, the act provides an estimated $149 million in at-risk funding statewide, or about 3.6 percent of total program.       Definition of At-Risk Pupils Follows Federal Free Lunch Program and Includes Some Students with Limited English Skills   Under the act, at-risk pupils are defined as students from low-income families, as measured by eligibility for free lunches under the National School Lunch Act. The definition of at-risk pupils also includes a limited number of non-English-speaking students.   Students qualify for free meals at school based on their family's income. The act defines at-risk pupils as those who are  eligible  for free lunches so districts can receive funding for students that do not actually participate in the federal program. As an alternative, the act allows districts to use the proportion of free-lunch students in grades one through eight multiplied by the district's enrollment if it produces a larger number than the actual count. This alternative count is provided because some high schools do not offer free lunches, and some students choose not to participate in the free lunch program, especially at the high school level.   A student with limited English skills, as defined by the English Language Proficiency Act, can be included in the at-risk count if the student meets one of two criteria. First, a student can be counted if he or she took the Colorado Student Assessment Program (CSAP) test in a language other than English in the preceding year. Second, a student can be counted if the student took the regular, English CSAP, but the student has been in a Colorado public school for less than three years (two years for third graders). In either case, a student can be counted as at risk only once; therefore, a student who is counted under the income guidelines of the free lunch program cannot be counted because of limited proficiency in English.   Similar to the averaging of pupils for the district count, the at-risk count is averaged to make allowances for the financial impact of declines in the count. A district's at-risk count is the greater of: (1) the actual count for the budget year; (2) an average of the counts for the current and preceding budget years; and (3) an average of the counts for the current and two preceding budget years.   Preschool students are not included in a district's at-risk count. The official date for counting at-risk pupils is October 1.   At-Risk Factor Determines Additional Funding for At-Risk Pupils       The proportion of at-risk students in a district is used to calculate an ""at-risk factor."" This factor determines the amount of funding a district receives for its at-risk pupils. Every district receives an at-risk factor of at least 11.5 percent, which entitles the district to an additional 11.5 percent of its per pupil funding for each at-risk pupil.       Districts with High Concentrations of At-Risk Pupils Receive More Funding   Districts with higher-than-average proportions of at-risk students receive a higher at-risk factor. The increase in the at-risk factor for these districts depends upon the enrollment of the district. For districts with enrollments between 459 and 50,000, the higher factor is equal to 11.5 percent plus three-tenths of a percentage point for each percentage point that the district's at-risk concentration exceeds the statewide average. Thus, if the statewide average incidence is 25 percent, and a particular district has 36 percent of its students defined as at risk, the district's at-risk factor would be 14.8 percent (11.5 + (0.3 x 11) = 14.8). For districts with enrollments greater than 50,000, the higher factor is equal to 11.5 percent plus 0.36 of a percentage point for each percentage point that the district's at-risk concentration exceeds the statewide average.   The higher factor is provided only for pupils over the statewide average incidence of at-risk pupils. So, the district described above with 36 percent at-risk students would receive 11.5 percent more in per pupil funding for 25 percent of its students and 14.8 percent more in per pupil funding for the other 11 percent of its students who are at risk. In addition, only districts with more than 459 pupils qualify for the higher at-risk factor. The higher factor is capped at 30 percent .     What is On-Line Funding?     Beginning with budget year FY 2002-03, new on-line students are funded at the minimum per pupil funding level. For FY 2002-03, this amount is $5,435 per on-line student. Minimum funding increases each year by the rate of increase in the statewide base. Students enrolled in on-line programs for the 2001-02 school year are not included in the on-line count as the minimum funding only applies to new on-line students. Consequently, students already enrolled in on-line programs are funded in the same manner as all other pupils in the district. Beginning with the 2002-03 budget year, the on-line program is expanded to include 135 students annually who were enrolled in a private school or home-school program the preceding year. The General Assembly appropriated $733,725 for this program expansion for FY 2002-03. Further discussion of minimum per pupil funding can be found on page 14.                                                On-line Funding = On-Line Pupil Count x Minimum Per Pupil Funding                                           LOCAL SHARE AND STATE AID       The money to fund total program comes from a combination of local and state sources. In FY 2002-03, local taxpayers are expected to contribute an average of 40.4 percent of total program, while state sources account for the remaining 59.6 percent. These percentages vary widely among individual school districts, however, because districts have different amounts of property wealth. Under the act, each district's local portion is calculated first, and state aid makes up the difference between the local portion and total program. This principle of using state aid to make up for differences in local property wealth is called ""equalization.""             How is the Local Share Calculated?       A district's local share comes from two sources—property taxes and specific ownership taxes. Property taxes are paid on real estate; specific ownership taxes are paid on motor vehicles. Of the two local taxes, property taxes produce roughly eight times as much revenue as specific ownership taxes. Both of these taxes are described in greater detail below.                                       Local            =                      Current Year Property Taxes +                 Share                       Prior Year Specific Ownership Taxes                                 Property Taxes Provide Most Local Revenues     Statewide, property taxes are expected to contribute almost $1.5 billion in funding for school finance in FY 2002-03, or 36 percent of total program. A school district's property taxes are the result of multiplying a district's taxable property (assessed value) by its property tax rate (mill levy). The assessed value of a district is determined each year, and it includes all taxable property in the district. Mill levies are calculated according to a formula in state law which is designed to comply with constitutional limits.   The formula in law requires each district to impose the mill levy from the prior budget year unless that levy will increase property taxes by a greater percentage than allowed. The maximum allowable percentage increase in property taxes for each district is the sum of the state inflation rate and the percentage change in a district's enrollment. If a district's property taxes will exceed that amount with the prior year's levy, the district must reduce its mill levy so that annual change in property tax revenue does not grow faster than the maximum allowed.   The law also includes a ceiling on mill levies. A district's levy cannot be higher than the levy needed to fund the district's total program less specific ownership tax revenue and minimum state aid. This levy calculation is used in a limited number of districts with very high property wealth.         Specific Ownership Taxes Supplement Property Taxes     Specific ownership taxes are expected to contribute about $185 million for school finance in FY 2002-03, bringing the local share to 40.4 percent of total program. Specific ownership taxes are paid annually on motor vehicles instead of property taxes. Counties collect specific ownership taxes and distribute them to all governments in the county that collect property taxes, such as school districts, cities, special districts, and the county itself. By law, counties distribute specific ownership tax revenues to these governments in proportion to the amount of property taxes collected by each. Thus, a school district that receives 50 percent of all the property taxes collected in a county would receive 50 percent of the specific ownership taxes collected in the county.   The funding formula does not count all specific ownership tax revenue against the district's local share, however. Some districts collect more specific ownership taxes than others simply because the voters in those districts have approved additional property taxes. The formula specifically does not count any specific ownership taxes attributable to a bond redemption (debt) or override (operating) mill levy, if the mill levy was approved by the district's voters.   The formula uses specific ownership taxes collected in the previous fiscal year because they are the most recent actual figures. Thus, the local share in FY 2002-03 includes FY 2001-02 specific ownership tax revenue.             How is State Aid Calculated?       State aid provides the difference between a district's total program and the district's local share. In school finance, this concept of state assistance supplementing local resources is called ""equalization."" An equalized school finance system allows similar districts to spend similar amounts regardless of property wealth. For FY 2002-03, state aid is expected to provide $2.48 billion, or 59.6 percent, of total program.                                       State         Aid = Total Program – Local Share                               Districts that produce less from property taxes receive a greater proportion of state aid, but the state guarantees that even the wealthiest districts get a minimum amount of aid per pupil. This per pupil amount, established annually in the long appropriations bill, is based on the amount of school lands and mineral lease moneys received by the state. For FY 2002-03, minimum state aid is $73.40 per pupil.   The state distributes aid to school districts in 12 approximately equal monthly payments. In the first half of the fiscal year, the payments are based upon pupil count and assessed value estimates, because the state does not know exact pupil counts and district assessed values during that time period. The payments are later adjusted to reflect actual pupil counts and assessed values. These approximately equal monthly payments may cause some districts to experience cash flow problems at certain times of the year, so the state offers an interest-free loan program to qualifying school districts. This loan program is discussed in further detail on page   21.   State Aid Comes Primarily from Three Sources     Three sources of revenue provide money for the state aid appropriation for school finance. The state General Fund provides the vast majority of money: in FY 2002-03, 90.8 percent, or just over $2.2 billion, of the appropriation is provided by the General Fund. The state constitution requires that the General Fund appropriation increase by at least 5 percent each year through FY 2010-11, unless Colorado personal income grows by less than 4.5 percent between the two calendar years that precede a fiscal year.   The State Education Fund also contributes to the state aid appropriation. The State Education Fund, created by Article IX, Section 17, of the Colorado Constitution, receives revenue equal to a tax of one-third of one percent on federal taxable income. Its contribution to the state aid appropriation is almost $175 million in FY 2002-03, or 7.1 percent of the state aid package. Finally, rent from state school lands, interest on the Public School Fund, federal mineral lease moneys, and other miscellaneous sources of money provide the remaining 2.1 percent (almost $53 million) of state aid.             MODIFICATIONS TO THE FUNDING FORMULA       The state's basic funding formula applies to nearly all districts. However, the act makes modifications to the formula to account for unusual situations in some districts. These modifications may cause a district's total program to be computed differently than the formula described in the preceding pages. In addition, the act contains modifications that may alter the share of a district's funding that comes from state or local sources. These modifications are reviewed below.             Modifications to Total Program       There are three modifications that cause a district's total program to be computed differently than the formula described in the preceding pages. These modifications provide for a minimum per pupil funding level, a cap on increases in total program, and a cap on annual increases in per pupil funding.       The Law Contains Minimum Per Pupil Funding Levels       A school district can receive a higher per pupil funding level than the formula provides. The law guarantees that all districts will receive at least $5,435 per pupil in FY 2002-03. This funding level applies to any school district that would have a lesser per pupil funding amount under the formula. Seven districts are expected to benefit by about $2.1 million from this minimum per pupil funding provision. The amount of minimum per pupil funding increases each year by the same percentage as the statewide base amount. However, the General Assembly can increase this minimum amount beyond the automatic increase required by law. This was the case for FY 2002-03 as the required minimum funding was $5,391, but was increased an additional $44 to $5,435.     Increases in Total Program Are Capped       Under the act, annual increases in district total program are limited to the respective district's constitutional spending limit percentage (inflation plus the percentage change in district enrollment). The limit in the statute, however, is applied only to school finance funding (property taxes, specific ownership taxes, and state aid), while districts often receive additional funding from other sources. In addition, voters can agree to let a district collect more than the limit, and some money received by districts is exempt from the limit. Thus, the law allows districts to receive the total amount of formula funding if they can certify that the moneys will not cause the district to exceed its constitutional spending limit, when that limit is applied to all of the district's spending from the prior year.       Increases in Per Pupil Funding Are Capped       The act sets a cap on increases in total per pupil funding equal of 25 percent per year.             Modifications to the State and Local Shares       Just as there are exceptions to the calculation of total program, some districts' local share or state aid may be modified depending on a district's particular situation. For example, some districts pay for categorical programs, and state aid may be reduced in certain circumstances.       Some Districts Pay for Categorical Programs       The categorical buyout provisions of the school finance act require certain districts to offset or ""buy out"" state aid for categorical programs with local property tax revenue. This requirement applies to districts with very high property wealth. These districts can fund their total program, less minimum state aid and specific ownership taxes, with a levy less than the prior year's levy or a property tax change less than the sum of inflation plus the percentage change in enrollment. These districts must levy additional mills to pay for the categorical programs in their district. The categorical programs that are covered by these provisions include special education, the English Language Proficiency Act, transportation, vocational education, and small attendance centers. The additional levy for the categorical buyout cannot result in a levy that is greater than the prior year's or in property taxes that exceed the property tax revenue limit.         State Aid May Be Reduced in Certain Circumstances         State aid to school districts may be reduced if the General Assembly's original appropriation is insufficient or if a bill is passed to reduce the appropriation. In these instances, state aid would be reduced by a percentage of total program. Total program would be reduced by the same percentage in all districts, but no district would lose more state aid than it actually receives.             EARMARKED REVENUE       There are four provisions in the school finance act that require districts to earmark revenue for specific purposes. All other moneys under the school finance act are spent at districts' discretion.       Districts Must Earmark Money for Instructional Supplies, Materials, and Capital Outlay       For FY 2002-03, each district must budget $161 per pupil for items such as supplies, textbooks, library books, and periodicals. Districts can also use the money to acquire fixed assets for instruction, to transport pupils to school-sponsored instructional activities, and to repair or maintain instructional equipment. On-line students are not included in the count when calculating the amount to be budgeted. Each year, the per pupil allocation is increased by the same percentage as the statewide base per pupil amount.       Districts Must Earmark Money for Capital Reserve and Risk Management   Districts must allocate at least $262 per pupil in FY 2002-03 to a capital reserve fund or a risk management fund. Once again, on-line students are not included in the count when determining the amount to be allocated. Districts may allocate the $262 to the two funds as they wish, and transfers between the funds are permitted. The law caps the total amount that may be transferred in any year at $800 per pupil. Capital reserve moneys may be used to acquire land or improvements, construct buildings or additions, renovate buildings when the cost exceeds $2,500, purchase school buses or other equipment when the per unit cost is greater than $1,000, or pay for software licensing that costs more than $1,000. Risk management moneys are used to pay for insurance or to repair or replace school district property that has been damaged.   Just as with the allocation for instructional supplies, the per pupil allocation for capital reserve and risk management is increased each year by the same percentage as the statewide base per pupil amount. The mandatory per pupil allocation for capital reserve/risk management does not apply to any district that has a balance in its capital reserve fund of at least five times the required minimum transfer.       Districts Must Earmark a Portion of At-Risk Moneys       Districts are required to allocate a portion of the at-risk moneys they receive for specific purposes, and the purpose and amount depends on the source of the money. Seventy-five percent of at-risk moneys received from the count of students who are eligible for free lunch must be allocated for instructional programs or staff development efforts that relate directly to at-risk pupils. Districts must allocate all of the at-risk money generated by students with limited English skills to English language proficiency programs.       Districts Must Earmark All Preschool Moneys       Money received by a district for the Colorado Preschool Program must be allocated to the district's preschool program fund. The amount that must be allocated is determined by multiplying the preschool count by the district's per pupil operating revenues. Money in the fund can be spent on teacher and paraprofessional salaries and benefits, contracting for preschool services, supplies and materials, home visits, professional development, and a reasonable portion of district overhead costs.             UNEQUALIZED LOCAL REVENUE       The bulk of school district revenues are equalized, meaning that the state provides funding to equalize property wealth or ""level the playing field."" However, the school finance act also allows local school districts some discretion to raise additional local revenue, for which the state provides no equalization. These unequalized local revenue sources are described below.       School Districts May Raise Additional Property Taxes for Operating Purposes   The act allows districts to raise and spend additional property taxes, with voter approval, in excess of the amount authorized by the state's funding formula. These additional property taxes are called overrides. The act limits overrides to 20 percent of a district's total program or $200,000, whichever is greater, plus the 2001-02 supplemental cost-of-living adjustment amount. The total dollar amount approved by voters remains the same unless additional funding is approved at a subsequent election. The supplement cost-of-living amount is a fixed amount based on a calculation using the 2001-02 budget year.   The school finance act counts other revenue sources against a district's override limit. These other sources of revenue may limit a district's ability to request voter approval for a property tax increase equal to the full 20 percent limit. For example, specific ownership taxes that a district collects because of its override mill levy are counted against the limit, as are specific ownership taxes from a bond levy when the proceeds of the bond levy are not used to pay off the debt. In addition, the override for 34 districts also includes approximately $20.9 million in property taxes relating to the act's former hold harmless provisions. This funding was designed to hold districts harmless from any decrease in per pupil funding resulting from the passage of the 1994 act. In one district, the funding was derived from a higher-than-average mill levy.   In FY 2001-02, 50 school districts collected $247.3 million in voter-approved property taxes. Since some districts are phasing in their overrides, the amount of taxes collected was somewhat less than the amount authorized by voters.   Unequalized District Property Taxes also Pay for Debt     Independent of the school finance act, state law permits school districts to request voter approval to incur debt by issuing bonds. This is known as bonded debt. Districts repay the debt with a dedicated mill levy. Bonded debt is generally used by school districts for major capital construction projects. Revenue collected from a bonded debt mill levy must be credited to the district's bond redemption fund and used to repay the bondholders.   State law imposes a limit on the amount of bonded debt a school district may incur. Districts are prohibited from issuing bonded debt in excess of 20 percent of the district's assessed valuation or 6 percent of actual value, whichever is greater. For districts that meet specified increasing enrollment criteria and have debt elections approved between July 1, 1994, and July 1, 2005, the limit is the greater of 25 percent of assessed value or 6 percent of actual value.   ""Growth"" Districts May Raise Additional Property Taxes for Capital Improvements     Beginning in budget year 2002-03, growth districts can request voter approval to levy additional property taxes for capital projects. The money must be deposited into the district's capital reserve fund and can be used to pay for capital projects outright or to repay loans from the Public School Fund or the Colorado Educational and Cultural Facilities Authority. Growth districts are districts whose February enrollment count grows by at least 1 percent or 50 students, whichever is less, over the October count.   The additional mill levy for growth districts is based on a district's property wealth relative to the statewide average. A district with an assessed value per pupil that exceeds the statewide average may impose an additional levy up to 1 mill. The maximum levy increases as district property wealth decreases below the state average, up to the maximum of 5 mills. For instance, a district with an assessed value per pupil of $266,666 could impose a maximum of 1 mill when the statewide average assessed value per pupil is $83,000. A district with an assessed value of $16,600 could impose 5 mills, while a district with an assessed value per pupil of $33,200 could impose 2.5 mills.                     Growth District Mill Levy (5 Mill Maximum) = Average       Statewide Assessed Value Per Pupil ÷ Growth District Assessed Value Per       Pupil           Voters Must Approve Transportation Levies or Fees       Although not part of the school finance act, state law permits school districts to request voter approval to impose a levy or fee to pay for transportation costs not reimbursed by the state. The proceeds from this levy or fee must be deposited in the district's transportation fund.       Voters Can Also Approve Special Building or Technology Levies       School districts can also request voter approval of up to ten mills for up to three years to maintain and construct schools or to purchase and install instructional technology. The proceeds from such a levy must be deposited in the special building and technology fund.             CASH FLOW LOAN PROGRAM       School districts may participate in an interest-free cash flow loan program sponsored by the state. The state General Fund is the source of revenue for the loan program, which was created to help districts deal with the fact that property tax collections occur late in the budget year. A school district applies to the state treasurer for a loan. The loan is provided if the district meets the eligibility criteria in law. A district is eligible for a loan from the state in any month in which the district can demonstrate that a cash deficit will exist in its general fund. All loans must be repaid by June 25 of the state fiscal year in which the loan was made. A loan may not be made to provide assistance for matters eligible for payment from the contingency reserve or to cover a foreseeable level of uncollectible property taxes, nor may a loan be used by a district for arbitrage.             STATE CONTINGENCY RESERVE   State law requires the General Assembly to annually appropriate moneys to a contingency reserve fund to provide supplemental assistance to school districts. In FY 2002-03, the General Assembly appropriated $900,000 for this purpose. Moneys in the fund can be allocated by the State Board of Education to school districts for certain types of financial emergencies. Moneys are also available if a district's abatement levy is insufficient; if children placed in the district by a court create an unusual financial burden; to offset the impact of a decline in enrollment resulting from a detachment and annexation; or to offset the cost of pupils moving to a district after the count date. This last option is only available for districts under 2,000 pupils and only for the cost of the additional pupils.   In cases of extreme emergency, the state board may consider factors that are not specifically delineated in law and may provide financial aid from the contingency reserve to districts that could not maintain their schools without such additional assistance. In determining which districts receive payments from the contingency reserve and the amount of the payment, the state board must consider the amount of assistance requested as a percentage of each district's total program.             CAPITAL CONSTRUCTION       In addition to issuing bonds, school districts can request state assistance for some capital construction projects. Depending on the type of project and the school district’s circumstances, the state may provide assistance as a grant, a matching grant, or a loan.       The School Capital Construction Expenditures Reserve Provides Grants to School Districts   The State Board of Education may distribute money from the School Capital Construction Expenditures Reserve only for capital expenditures that address immediate safety hazards or health concerns within existing school facilities, that relieve excessive operating costs created by insufficient maintenance or construction spending, or that relieve building construction conditions that detract from an effective learning environment. Any money in the reserve that is not spent by March 15 of each fiscal year is transferred to the School Construction and Renovation Fund. Over the 11-year period from FY 2000-01 through FY 2010-11, $105 million dollars is scheduled to be appropriated to the School Capital Construction Expenditures Reserve from the General Fund ($5 million the first year, $10 million per year thereafter). Appropriations for the first two fiscal years (FY 2000-01 and FY 2001-02) were made from the General Fund. However, General Fund appropriations are only to be made if excess General Fund revenues, after satisfying required obligations, exceed $80 million. Excess General Fund reserves were not available for FY 2002-03. Instead the appropriation was made from the State Education Fund.   Beginning in FY 2001-02, the reserve was also to receive the same amount of money that is appropriated for charter school capital construction. For FY 2001-02, $16.5 million was appropriated to the School Capital Construction Expenditures Reserve; $6.5 million of that amount was the charter school capital construction match. The requirement that the reserve receive this match was suspended for FY 2002-03 and is to be restored for FY 2003-04.   The School Construction and Renovation Fund Provides Matching Grants to School Districts   The School Construction and Renovation Fund provides matching grant money to school districts for instructional facilities, such as classrooms, libraries, physical plants, and associated administrative areas. The state board determines the proportion of state and local funds to finance each project and prioritizes projects based on criteria in law. The state board submits a prioritized list to the Capital Development Committee, who determines the number of projects to be funded and forwards a list of those projects to the Joint Budget Committee so that an appropriation can be included in the long appropriations bill.   Over a nine-year period from FY 2002-03 through FY 2010-11, $85 million dollars is scheduled to be appropriated to the School Construction and Renovation Fund from the General Fund. The first appropriation for FY 2002-03 was made from the State Education Fund and lottery proceeds because excess General Fund revenues were not sufficient to make this appropriation. Beginning in FY 2000-01, the fund could also receive unspent money from the School Capital Construction Expenditures Reserve.   The Permanent School Fund Provides Loans for School Districts       The State Treasurer can loan money to school districts from the Public School Fund for construction involving instructional facilities. As with the matching grants from the School Construction and Renovation Fund, any project for which a loan is sought must be on the prioritized list prepared by the state board. The state board also determines the amount of the loan. To obtain a loan, the voters of a school district are required to approve the debt and, if the loan is to be repaid from property taxes, the additional mill levy. The State Treasurer determines the amount of the fund that may be loaned out and the interest rate on any loans, which cannot be less than the rate of inflation.       The Contingency Reserve Could Provide Money for Safety Hazards or Health Concerns       Beginning in FY 2001-02, any lottery money that exceeds the cap and would have otherwise been transferred to the state General Fund is now transferred to the contingency reserve for school district capital expenditures. The state board may award this money to address immediate safety hazards or health concerns within existing school facilities. FY 2002-03 is the first year lottery moneys are expected exceed the cap at an estimated $8.5 million. However, for FY 2002-03 only, $4.1 million of this amount is not to remain in the contingency reserve and is instead transferred from the contingency reserve to the Capital Construction and Renovation Fund. This leaves $4.4 million of lottery revenues in the contingency reserve.             CALCULATION EXAMPLES     The following tables are provided for two purposes. First, to help illustrate the calculations included in the formula. Second, to provide data on how to determine the factors used in the formula.

Local share includes general fund property taxes and specific ownership tax revenue. Categorical buyout property taxes are subtracted from the local share; carry forward taxes are added. Other local revenue, such as override or bonded debt property taxes, are excluded.   2. The state share includes state equalization less any recisions. For FY 1993-94, state share includes funding for state equalization, increasing enrollment, and the provisions of House Bill 93-1320.   3. Figures are estimates based on House Bill 00-1159.               SPECIFIC-PURPOSE PROGRAMS       School districts in Colorado receive state revenue through a variety of programs designed to serve special groups of students or student needs. This section groups these programs into three categories and briefly describes the funding formulas for each. The three categories of programs are categorical programs, grant programs and other distributions, and programs funded through the school finance act.             CATEGORICAL PROGRAMS       Article IX, Section 17 of the Colorado Constitution, commonly referred to as Amendment 23, defines categorical programs as transportation programs, English language proficiency programs, expelled and at-risk programs, special education programs including gifted and talented programs, suspended student programs, vocational education programs, small attendance centers, comprehensive health education programs, and any other accountable program specifically identified in law as a categorical program. The General Assembly is required to increase total funding for all of these programs by the rate of inflation plus an additional percentage point through FY 2010-11 and by the rate of inflation thereafter. The General Assembly may use money in the State Education Fund to provide the increased funding. The state appropriation figures in the descriptive paragraphs below include General Fund and State Education Fund appropriations.             Special Education       The state provides special education funding for disabled students as well as for gifted and talented students. The Exceptional Children's Educational Act (ECEA) dictates how funding is distributed.       The State Provides $81.1 Million in Funding for Disabled Students   State funding for the education of disabled students totals $81.1 million in FY 2002-03. These funds are used to provide special services to 78,334 Colorado public school students with disabilities in FY 2002-03, or roughly 10.9 percent of total pupil membership.   Most funding to educate students with disabilities is distributed to administrative units. An administrative unit could be a school district, a board of cooperative services, or a combination of school districts. Under the law, roughly $49.8 million is distributed to administrative units in proportion to the amount distributed in FY 1994-95. Another $30.8 million is distributed directly to school districts based on the number of special education students in the district relative to the total number of such students statewide. The remaining $500,000 is earmarked for administrative units that pay tuition to facilities to provide special education services to students whose parents cannot be located or are incarcerated or whose parental rights have been relinquished or terminated.       The State Provides Funding for Programs to Serve Gifted and Talented Students       For FY 2002-03, the General Assembly appropriated $6.1 million for district gifted and talented programs. This money is used to provide staff, activities, and educational materials and equipment to serve gifted students.             Public School Transportation   School districts are reimbursed for some of the cost of transporting pupils between their home and school. The reimbursement formula is two-pronged: it takes into account mileage and excess costs. The formula provides 37.87 cents for each mile traveled, plus 33.87 percent of the difference between the district's current operating expenditures and the mileage allowance. ""Current operating expenditures"" includes items such as motor fuel and oil, vehicle maintenance costs, equipment, facilities, driver employment costs, and insurance. Districts are not eligible for reimbursement for the cost of purchasing buses or for field trips.   The law guarantees that no district will receive less in any given year than it was entitled to receive in the prior year. However, the law also applies a cap of 90 percent of district current operating expenditures. For FY 2002-03, the General Assembly appropriated $40.2 million for the transportation program. Each district's funding is prorated if the appropriation is less than the required amount.             Vocational Education   Unlike the school finance act and the other specific-purpose programs discussed in this booklet, which are administered by the Colorado Department of Education, the vocational education program is administered by the State Board for Community Colleges and Occupational Education. Vocational education courses are designed to provide students with entry-level occupational skills and knowledge required by business and industry. Any school district conducting approved vocational education courses is entitled to funding from moneys appropriated by the General Assembly.   Vocational education aid is disbursed to districts according to the full-time equivalent (FTE) cost of a program. The state provides funding for instructional personnel, contracted educational services, books and supplies, and equipment. Each district is required to pay its program costs per FTE at 70 percent of its per pupil operating revenue (school finance act revenue per pupil minus $262). For costs exceeding 70 percent, the state pays 80 percent of the first $1,250 per FTE and 50 percent of any additional costs above the initial $1,250 level. If the state appropriation is less than the amount required by the funding formula, district allocations are prorated. The FY 2002-03 appropriation for this program is $19.4 million.             English Language Proficiency       The English Language Proficiency Act (ELPA) provides financial assistance to districts with students whose dominant language is not English. Districts are required to identify, assess, and provide programs for students in the following classifications:       (a) students who do not comprehend or speak any English;     (b) students who comprehend or speak some English but whose predominant   language is not English; and     (c) students who comprehend and speak English and at least one other   language, whose dominant language is difficult to determine, and who score at   or below average on state or national tests or below an acceptable level on a   state-developed test.     ELPA funding is disbursed to districts for up to two years for each participating student. The state appropriation for this program for FY 2002-03 is $3.5 million. About $2.8 million of this appropriation is distributed to districts with students in categories (a) and (b). The remainder is distributed to districts with students in category (c). The amount of money each district receives is calculated by dividing students in categories (a) and (b) and students in category (c) by the respective portions of the appropriation.             Small Attendance Centers       The state provides additional funding for school districts that operate small attendance centers, which are defined as schools with less than 200 pupils that are at least 20 miles from a similar school in the same district. Eligible districts receive 35 percent of the difference between the district's per pupil funding and the per pupil funding the school would have received if it was a separate school district. A smoothing factor phases out funding for schools with more than 200 pupils. The General Assembly appropriated $880,600 for this program in FY 2002-03. Last year, funding was distributed to 13 schools in 10 districts across the state.             Expelled and At-risk Student and In-school and In-home Suspension Grant Programs       For FY 2002-03, the General Assembly appropriated $6.1 million to the Department of Education to distribute as grants for programs to serve expelled and at-risk students and for in-school and in-home suspension programs. Beginning in FY  2002-03 the expelled/at-risk funding was consolidated with the in-school and in-home suspension grant programs. Funding was combined to allow the school districts to serve both currently suspended/expelled students and those at-risk for suspension.   Funding for Expelled and At-risk Student Programs     The department may distribute money to school districts, charter schools, public alternative schools, non-parochial private schools whose programs have been approved by the state board, boards of cooperative services, and pilot schools under contract with the state board to serve expelled and at-risk students.   In awarding grants, the state board must consider, among other issues, the quality and cost-effectiveness of the services to be provided, the demonstrated effectiveness of services funded by previous grants to an applicant, and the number of students receiving services. Forty-five percent of the appropriation must be awarded to applicants who provide services to students from more than one school district.    Funding for In-school and In-home Suspension Grants     Public schools, or any public or private agency operating in conjunction with a public school, are eligible to receive grants to provide programs to students who are suspended from participation in regular school activities but who continue to receive instruction either at home or at school. Any single grant cannot exceed $25,000 per year, and grants are provided for a two-year period. By law, the total amount of grants in any one year is limited to $500,000.             Comprehensive Health Education       School districts and boards of cooperative services can receive grants to provide a local comprehensive health education program, a component of which must be a law-related education program to reduce the incidence of gang involvement and substance abuse. The grant program receives 50 percent of moneys appropriated but not spent for school finance, although the money must be appropriated by the General Assembly. For FY 2002-03, the General Assembly appropriated $600,000.             GRANT PROGRAMS AND OTHER DISTRIBUTIONS       In addition to the categorical programs delineated in the state constitution, the state distributes aid to school districts for a variety of other programs. Some of these programs are grant programs whereby school districts or schools who meet eligibility criteria apply for the available money. For other programs, money is distributed by formula, either to all districts or to qualifying districts. The following paragraphs briefly describe these programs.               Read to Achieve         Schools may apply for grants to fund intensive reading programs for second and third grade pupils and pupils between the third and fourth grades whose literacy and reading skills are below grade level. Grants may be awarded for programs such as reading academies, after school literacy programs, summer school clinics, one-on-one or group tutoring services, and extended-day reading programs. The number of second and third grade pupils reading below grade level, the proven success of a proposed reading program, and the per pupil cost of a program are among the factors taken into account in selecting grant recipients. For FY 2002-03, the General Assembly appropriated $19.0 million for read-to-achieve grants from the Tobacco Litigation Settlement Cash Fund.             Summer School Grant Program       Districts may apply to the Department of Education for funding under the summer school grant program, and each applying district receives $100 for each student enrolled in the program. Summer school reading programs must be designed to provide intensive literacy and reading comprehension education services to students who have scored at the unsatisfactory proficiency level on the third or fourth grade reading CSAP. For FY 2002-03, $945,800 is appropriated from the State Education Fund for this program.       Facility Summer School Grant Program     Beginning in budget year 2002-03, schools operated by residential child care facilities or residential treatment centers may apply to the Department of Education for grants to provide summer school for children residing in their facilities. In awarding the grants, the Department of Education is to attempt to grant awards throughout the state to schools whose curricula is research-based and that have demonstrated success in improving the academic performance of students performing below grade level in reading, writing, mathematics, and science. The General Assembly appropriated $500,000 from the State Education Fund for the program in FY 2002-03.                 State Match for National School Lunch Act       For FY 2002-03, the General Assembly appropriated $2.5 million to provide the match that the federal government requires to receive funding under the National School Lunch Act. The money provided by the state can be used only for the school lunch program and cannot supplant any money currently provided by a school district from its general fund.     School Breakfast Program       Beginning in budget year 2002-03, low performing or unsatisfactory schools can receive funding for breakfast programs. Moneys are to be used by school districts participating in the federal National School Lunch Act or Child Nutrition Act to create, enhance, or expand an existing program. For FY 2002-03, the General Assembly appropriated $500,000 for this program and must appropriate a minimum of $500,000 each year thereafter.          School Improvement Grants         The school improvement grant program provides money to schools rated as ""unsatisfactory"" to implement school improvement plans. It provides two-year grants of $75,000 for elementary schools, $100,000 for middle or junior high schools, and $125,000 for high schools. Receipt of a grant is contingent upon the local board submitting a school improvement plan to the State Board of Education. Under the program, a school receives an additional $25,000 in the second year of the program if it improves by at least half a point from the standard deviation over the preceding year's total score. The General Assembly appropriated $2.8 million from the State Education Fund for the program in FY 2002-03. This two-year program expires July 1, 2003.       Increasing Enrollment Aid       Beginning in budget year 2002-03, school districts experiencing enrollment growth during the school year may receive additional funding. To qualify for the additional aid, a school district’s pupil enrollment growth for the current budget year and the two preceding budget years must increase by an average of at least 9 percent each year. After meeting the 9 percent criterion, school districts may receive funding for each pupil of increase greater than 1 percent or 50 students, whichever is less, from October to February. The amount of funding is equal to five-twelfths of the district’s per pupil operating revenue (PPOR). Districts seeking increasing enrollment aid must take a February 1 enrollment count. For FY 2002-03, the General Assembly appropriated $260,354 for increasing enrollment aid; three districts are estimated to qualify for the additional aid.               Charter School Capital Construction         The General Assembly appropriated $7.8 million from the State Education Fund for charter school capital construction in FY 2002-03. A charter school qualifies for money if it will receive funding from a district for the budget year. The amount that each charter school receives is equal to the total funding from the State Education Fund multiplied by each charter school's percentage of total pupils statewide enrolled in eligible charter schools. Funding from the State Education Fund for charter school capital construction is to increase annually, through FY 2011-12, by the rate of inflation plus one percentage point. Thereafter, it is to increase by the rate of inflation.               Purchase of New Textbooks         The General Assembly appropriated $15 million from the State Education Fund for FY 2002-03 to distribute to school districts to purchase new textbooks. Each district received $21 per student. In FY 2001-02 school districts received $14.1 million for this purpose based on $20 per student. Each school district is required to adopt a plan on the use of the money; moneys must first be used to provide up-to-date textbooks in reading, writing, math, science.             Teacher Pay Incentives         The teacher pay incentive program is a four-year grant program for teachers at public schools that receive an academic performance rating of ""unsatisfactory."" The grant money can only be used to provide bonuses (or associated costs) to reward outstanding performance, recruit or retain teachers, or defray housing costs. The program provides additional money to schools that receive a ""significant improvement"" or ""improvement"" rating after the first year of the four-year program. Both the basic grant money and the additional money are allocated to schools on a per pupil basis by dividing the appropriation by the total number of students enrolled in all eligible schools. For FY 2002-03, the General Assembly appropriated $4.2 million from the State Education Fund for this program. Schools which qualified as an eligible school in FY 2001-02, but no longer qualify (low performing schools) only receive funding for the 2001-02 school year. This program expires July 1, 2005.               Science and Technology Education Center Grants         The science and technology education center grant program provides development and operating moneys to nonprofit science and technology education centers that provide science and technology education activities, materials, and educational workshops for students and their teachers. The amount of a grant under this program is limited to $500,000 for a new center and $200,000 for an operating center. Any center that receives a grant is required to match the amount of a state grant. For FY 2002-03, the General Assembly appropriated $372,000 for this program, which expires July 1, 2011.               PROGRAMS FUNDED THROUGH THE FINANCE ACT         Two programs are created for a discrete group of students; however, funding for the programs is allocated through the school finance act. Students are counted under the act and therefore receive the district per pupil funding allocation for each pupil. The two programs are the Colorado Preschool Program and full-day kindergarten for at-risk youngsters.               Colorado Preschool Program     The Colorado Preschool Program, which has been in operation since 1989, serves children aged three to five years who lack overall learning readiness, who are in need of language development, or who participate in state programs for neglected or dependent children. A school district may provide the program itself, or contract with a Head Start or local child care agency to provide all or a portion of the program. School districts must meet specific state requirements regarding class size, parental involvement, and teacher training and planning to participate in the program.   The Colorado Preschool Program is funded through the school finance act. Children participating in the program are counted as half-day pupils. Current law limits the number of children that may participate in the program to 11,050. In FY 2002-03, nearly $32.8 million of school finance total program is attributable to this particular program. Of the 11,050 slots, 1,500 are reserved for full-day kindergarten. School districts must deposit revenue received for these children in the district preschool program fund.               Full-day Kindergarten         School districts may offer and receive funding for full-day kindergarten programs for students who attend a school that received an academic performance rating of ""unsatisfactory"" for the previous school year. A school district can provide the program itself or contract with other private or public entities to provide the program. In FY 2002-03, nearly $3.8 million of school finance total program is attributable to this program. The authorization for this program ends July 1, 2006.             GLOSSARY       Amendment 23 :   A   constitutional amendment adopted in 2000 that sets minimum levels of increase   in the statewide base per pupil funding amount and in categorical program   funding and sets a minimum increase in the state General Fund appropriation   for school finance. It also creates the State Education Fund and earmarks a   portion of income tax revenue for the fund. Amendment 23 is codified as   Article IX, Section 17, Colorado Constitution.         Assessed Value:   The taxable value of   property as determined by a tax assessor or government agency. Property taxes   are paid on the basis of a property's assessed valuation, which represents   only a fraction of a property's market value. (See p. 10)         At-Risk Pupils:  Students who are eligible for the federal free lunch   program because they come from families with incomes below a certain level or   who have limited English skills and meet other criteria relating to CSAP   tests. The act provides additional funding based on the number of at-risk   pupils enrolled in each district. (See pp. 7, 28)         At-Risk Factor:  A factor used to compute the additional amount of   funding a district receives for its at-risk pupils. Each district starts with   an at-risk factor of 11.5 percent. Districts with more than the statewide   average proportion of at-risk pupils receive an at-risk factor of 11.5 percent   plus three-tenths of one percentage point—0.36 percentage point for a   district with a pupil count greater than 50,000—for every percentage point   that the district's proportion exceeds the statewide average, up to 30   percent. (See pp. 8,28)         Base Funding Amount:   See Statewide Base Per Pupil Funding Amount.   (See p. 3)         Bonded Indebtedness:  Obligations of a school district to make payments   on a loan, generally for major capital construction projects. With voter   approval, districts can issue bonded debt and impose a mill levy to repay the   debt over time. (See p. 3)         Budget Year:  Same as a fiscal year, the period beginning   on July 1 of each year and ending on the following June 30.         Capital Outlay:  Money spent to acquire fixed assets which can be   expected to last for more than one year. Fixed assets include land, buildings,   machinery, and furniture.         Capital Reserve Fund : A fund used by school districts for long-term   capital outlay expenditures. Districts can only use the capital reserve fund   to acquire land and buildings, construct new buildings or additions to   buildings, purchase equipment and furnishings, alter or improve existing   buildings when the cost exceeds $2,500, acquire school buses or other   equipment with a per unit cost of at least $1,000, enter into long-term lease   agreements, or purchase software licenses that cost at least $1,000. Districts   must allocate a minimum of $262 per pupil between the capital reserve fund or   a risk management fund in FY 2002-03, unless they have at least five-years’   worth of transfers already in the fund. (See p. 17)         Categorical Programs:  Specific-purpose programs that are funded   separately from a district's total program funding under the school finance   act and are identified in the state constitution. Examples include vocational   education, special education, and transportation. (See pp. 15, 31)         Charter School:  A public school which operates under contract with a   public school district.         Constitutional Spending Limit:  The maximum allowable change in a school   district's spending from one year to the next. The limit for school districts   is equal to the percentage change in a district's enrollment plus the   Denver-Boulder inflation rate in the prior calendar year.   (See pp. 11, 15)         Cost-of-Living Factor:  One of the three main factors used in   calculating a district's per pupil funding. The cost-of-living factor reflects   the relative differences among the state's 178 districts in the costs of   housing, goods, and services for the regions in which districts are located.   (See pp. 4, 26)         District Per Pupil Funding:  The amount that results from combining the   statewide base with the components of the formula. A district's per pupil   funding is multiplied by its pupil count to determine funding, before   accounting for on-line and at-risk students. (See pp. 3, 26)         Enrollment:  The number of pupils enrolled on October 1 within the   budget year .  (See p. 2)         Equalization Aid:   State funding provided to equalize the property   wealth of districts. (See p. 12)         Growth Districts:  School districts whose February enrollment count   grows by at least 1 percent or 50 students, whichever is less, over the   October count. Growth districts can request voter approval to levy additional   property taxes for capital projects. (See p. 20)         Hold Harmless District:  A district whose formula per pupil funding in   the first year of the 1994 school finance act would have declined from the   prior year's level. (See p. 19)         Increasing Enrollment Districts:  School districts whose pupil   enrollment for the current budget year and the two preceding budget years   increases by an average of 9 percent each year. These districts are eligible   for additional aid if their February enrollment count grows by at least 1   percent or 50 students, whichever is less, over the October count. (See p. 39)         Local Share:  The portion of a district's total program contributed   directly by local taxpayers of the district. A district's local share includes   revenue from property taxes and specific ownership taxes. (See p. 10)         Maximum Increase in Per Pupil Funding:  The statutory cap which limits   annual increases in per pupil funding to 25 percent. (See p. 15)         Mill Levy:  A property tax rate based on dollars per thousand of   assessed valuation.  One mill is the same as one tenth of one percent   (.001). Thus, one mill will generate $1 when levied on $1,000 of a property's   assessed value. (See p. 10)         Minimum Per Pupil Funding:   A minimum funding level guaranteed to   each district. In FY 2002-03, the law guarantees $5,435 per pupil.   (See p. 14)         Minimum State Aid District:  A district that can pay for its entire   total program from local property and specific ownership taxes and, thus, only   receives the minimum amount of state aid per pupil. For FY 2002-03, each   district in the state receives at least $73.40 per pupil. (See p. 12)         Nonpersonnel Costs Factor:  A percentage representing   the difference between 100 percent and a district's personnel costs   factor. (See p. 5)        On-line students:  Students enrolled in an on-line education program  that   provides sequential program instruction to educate a child who resides in   Colorado through services accessible on the world wide web and monitored by a   district coordinator and a site coordinator; except that, if an on-line   program is provided by a charter school, the site coordinator has sole   responsibility for monitoring the program.  (See pp. 9, 29)         Override:  Local voter-approved property tax revenue in excess of total   program as defined under the act. (See  p .19)         Personnel Costs Factor:  One of the three main factors used in   calculating a district's per pupil funding. The personnel costs factor is a   percentage which represents the estimated portion of a district's budget which   is attributed to personnel costs. It is formula-driven and differs by district   based on enrollment. (See pp. 5, 27)         Per Pupil Funding:  The amount that results from combining the statewide   base with the components of the formula. A district's per pupil funding is   multiplied by its pupil count to determine funding, before accounting for   on-line and at-risk students. (See pp. 3, 26)         Per Pupil Operating Revenues/PPOR:  A district's total program divided   by its funded pupil count, minus the minimum amount per pupil required to be   transferred for the capital reserve fund or a risk management fund. In   FY 2002-03, a district's PPOR is its total per pupil funding minus $262.         Property Tax:  A local tax that is calculated by applying a   mill levy to assessed value. Revenue from the property   tax represents the primary source of local funding for K-12 public   education. (See p. 10)         Pupil Count/Funded Pupil Count:  The number of pupils for which a school   district receives funding under the school finance act. For funding purposes,   pupils are counted on October 1 within the applicable budget year.   (See p. 2)         Size Factor:  One of the three main factors used in calculating a   district's per pupil funding. The size factor is designed to compensate   districts for the cost pressures of economies of scale. It is   formula-driven and based on enrollment. (See pp. 5, 27)         Specific Ownership Tax:  A tax paid annually on motor vehicles instead   of property taxes. Specific ownership taxes are part of a district's local   contribution to school funding. (See p. 11)         Small Attendance Center:  A school of less than 200 students that is   located more than 20 miles from a similar school in the same district.

This enrollment drop has had a major financial impact upon the General State aid that the district receives. As a result the district made cuts totaling $126,726 in the spring of 01, $150,000 in the spring of 02 and will make cuts of $220,000 in the spring of 03.

Voters of the district defeated a referendum for an education fund tax rate increase of $1.00 in the spring of 2002. The district issued $725,000 of working cash bonds in December 2003 which will help a projected $250,000 budget deficit for FY03 and assist with cash flow problems. Approximately $425,000 of program and personnel cuts will be made in the FY04 budget, which includes closing an elementary building. In April 2003 voters will be asked to approve a $.50 education fund tax rate increase. The district is projected to lose just under $1,000,000 of assessed value on the 2002 tax levy, which is payable in 2003. Student enrollment is expected to decline. It is anticipated that the FY04 budget will be balanced, however, the district could quickly be back into a deficit situation if there are unexpected increases in operational costs, and if promised state funding continues to come late and at less that 100%.

When a school district is heavily reliant on State Aid, regardless of whether that is caused by lack of local wealth or tax base, any manipulation of the level of State Aid has immediate and direct consequences to that district. Schools that are reliant on State Aid to meet their daily obligations are constantly challenged to maintain financial integrity. Many of the challenges we face stem from delays, prorated dollars, and/or missed payments altogether. The Mulberry Grove Community Unit Schools have been extremely diligent in the planning and implementation of the District's budget. There is no question that every effort is being made to wisely spend the limited resources that we have available to fund our educational programs. The community has supported a substantial levy, yet as you are well aware we are heavily reliant on State Aid to finance our total program. The Mulberry Grove Schools are facing the very same problems as so many others are faced with throughout our State. We are faced with the increasing pressure of financial, statutory, litigated, and otherwise mandated obligations at both the State and Federal levels. At the very same time, we are expected to deal with decreasing revenues and other resources to meet these obligations. It should be recognized that the biggest problem this district faces is one of cash flow, not over spending. Many measures have been put in place to address our local financial concerns. A great amount of daily attention and energy is spent in doing our very best in providing a quality education for our students. The fact is we are heavily reliant on State Aid in order to meet our financial obligations. The fact that the State itself has not met its obligations by funding mandates fully, and providing revenues in a timely manner that are not prorated has complicated matters significantly. There is no doubt that since we are so reliant on State Aid that fluctuations and arbitrary manipulations of financial formulas certainly affect our local financial picture dramatically. Regardless of what is or is not done to help with this situation, we will continue to serve the students and members of this community to the very best of our ability.

This district in conjunction with four other districts will be involved in a reorganization feasibility study this Spring. We are in a depressed area with the only hope of growth coming when the newly built prison opens. Taxpayers of Mt. Carroll CUD 304 have the highest school tax rate, 6.1282, in the counties of Carroll, Jo Davies and Stephenson. With an approximate unemployment rate of 10% in Carroll County, taxpayers of Mt. Carroll show responsibility for students in our District. The over reliance on property tax is not a responsible method to fund education. The state and its elected officials need to change the way Illinois schools are funded. School are not able to withstand the unpredictability of the distribution of state funds.

We have reduced 15% of the certified staff and 25% of the administrative staff through retirements. We are in the middle of a $7,500,000 project with revenues from the Capital Development Board and a bond referendum. The district has sought additional revenue sources and cuts have been made on expenditure line items. A sincere effort has been made to be cost effective. Carlyle school district has lost significant funds by a declining interest rate on investments, state and federal grants and reductions in state aid as EAV growth has minimally taken place along with increases in operating costs. Carlyle like many districts is on the financial early warning list. The Board of Education and administration will continue to seek ways to provide the best educational opportunities for students at the most reasonable cost.

The District committed deficit spending, depending on operating funds and existing fund balances, to meet debt retirement obligations. The District meets its Alternate Revenue Bond debt retirement obligation by transferring interest from the Education, Operations and Maintenance, and Working Cash Funds to the Bond & Interest Fund. The principal and interest obligation is expensed via the Bond & Interest Fund. This expense (approximately $3.3 million annually) is not included in the Expenditure to Revenue Ratio. If this expense were included the Expenditures to Revenue Ratio, the District would score 2 in this category for fiscal year 2001/02. Over the past three years, District 59 has lost over $8 million in anticipated revenue to pay property tax refunds issued through Cook County. The loss of property taxes due to refunds is causing the District to implement expenditure reductions and to seek revenue alternatives, such as a debt service extension base.

The more recent phenomenon of the significant increase in property tax refunds will result in an additional financial burden to the school district. This fiscal year to date, District 67 has lost $252,000 in property tax refunds. The majority of those refunds, $192,000, results from commercial business refunds from tax years 1995 and 1996. Beginning in 1998 through 2001, Property Tax Appeals Board (PTAB) objections may cause the District to lose an additional $1.01 million. There is no mechanism at this time to recover this revenue. The PTAB process has provided commercial and industrial property owners with an incentive to increase the volume of property assessment appeals. In summary, because of legislation that encourages commercial and industrial property owners to file assessment appeals, a greater financial burden is placed both on residential property owners as property tax payers and the school district as a taxing body.

The district sold fire prevention and life safety bonds to fund life safety improvements in the school district. Rhodes passed a referendum for .5500 in the education fund in 2002. This should bring in excess of $1,000,000 new dollars per year into the district. It should enable us to alleviate our deficit over the next two to more years.

This budget projects Operational Funds revenues at $37,186,784 with expenditures of $35,870,444. February 13, 2003, a copy of the 2002-03 school year budget was given to Lisa D. Maher, Regional Financial Consultant, for ISBE review. During the 2001-02 school year the previous administration expended $3,810,495.52 from the Site and Construction Fund for capital improvements in the district. $13,503,937.98 was expended from the O & M Fund. Expenditures for capital improvements were under estimated in the previous administrations 2001-01 budget.

Enrollment in the Westchester Public Schools has increased by 34% in the last 10 years. During this time, the district responded by utilizing bonds to renovate and reopen a previously closed facility, to renovate its schools to meet current educational needs, and to build additions to provide required handicapped accessibility and adequately house students in our district. The long term impact of tax caps has prompted District 92 1/2 to propose an April referendum to increase its education fund rate, set in 1929, in order to provide sufficient revenue to eliminate deficit spending. With the passage of an education fund referendum, District 92 1/2 will implement a plan to align revenues and expenditures for FY04, reducing educational programs as needed to maintain quality services within our budgetary limits.

In 1993, the district was successful in passing a referendum in the educational fund rate of .90 after 11 previously unsuccessful attempts to do so. During the years from 1982-1993, when we were unsuccessful in passing our referendum and with the decline in State Aid, our district cut programs, cut staff and closed two buildings in an attempt to stay financially solvent. With the passage of the referendum in 1993, it appeared that our district's financial troubles were a thing of the past. Little did we realize however, that tax caps were on their way and would have a major negative impact on the financial health of our district. Because of the tax cap, District 117 has lost over six million dollars in local revenue. We have never fully accessed our approved .90 increase. This is not fair. Our local voters gave us authority in 1993 to raise our educational tax rate. This is local control at its best. However, because of the imposition of the tax caps, my district is starting to see an erosion of our financial base and expenditures, surpassing our revenues. We have very few alternatives if we intend to maintain our programs. This month (Feb. 03) will focus on borrowing $8,665,000 in working cash bonds to help balance the budget. What does the State expect us to do when our borrowed money is gone? Although the State has made verbal commitment to increase educational funding, we have not seen increases in District 117. What we have seen are additional limitations such as the imposition of administration tax caps in the 2000/01 budget which have limited expenses in legislatively designed accounts to 5% increases and restricted grants covering only a portion of the costs for new programs. Tax caps for Cook County and limited State Aid have also made us apprehensive of promises of any increases in State funding of education. In addition, due to tax limitation laws, we are not able to access the increased EAV. What can the State do to help us? It is simple: Remove the tax cap immediately Allow districts to fully access increase in EAV Remove all utility expenses from the tax cap Remove life safety from under the tax cap Support EFAB's recommendations  Thursday, May 15, 2003  Page 14 of 85   County/District Name Max PALOS COMM CONS SCHOOL DIST 118 RIDGELAND SCHOOL DISTRICT 122 OAK LAWN-HOMETOWN SCH DIST 123 EVERGREEN PK ELEM SCH DIST 124 ATWOOD HEIGHTS DISTRICT 125 ALSIP-HAZLGRN-OAKLWN S DIST 126 WORTH SCHOOL DISTRICT 127  FBRR (1.4) 1.40 1.40 1.40 1.40 1.05 1.40 1.40  EXRV (1.4) 1.05 1.05 0.35 1.05 0.70 0.70 1.05  DCOH (0.4) 0.30 0.30 0.10 0.20 0.20 0.20 0.30  STB (0.4) 0.40 0.40 0.40 0.40 0.40 0.40 0.40  LTD (0.4) 0.40 0.10 0.20 0.20 0.30 0.40 0.10  Score (4.0) 3.55 3.25 2.45 3.25 2.65 3.10 3.25  Designation Financial Recognition Financial Review Financial Watch Financial Review Financial Early Warning Financial Review Financial Review  District Comments  Educational rate referendum ($.65) will be on April 1, 2003 ballot.

Over eleven million dollars in construction bonds were issued in Fiscal Year 2002. This impacted the district's remaining debt margin (one of the factors which comprises the ISBE financial profile score). The Board of Education and administration were notified in September, 2001, by the state's Capital Development Board, that the district is eligible for $5,758 million in state funds for this construction project. To date, the state has not yet released these critical funds. Late payments by the state for categorical reimbursement for eligible transportation and special education expenses also negatively affected Fiscal Year 2002 revenues. As of June 30, 2002, over $275,000 was vouchered by ISBE as due and payable to the district but not remitted on time. Indeed, the weak economy has created financial problems at the state level which are now impacting local schools reliant on promised state financial support. The district will continue to monitor expenditures while the state seeks an answer to its revenue shortfalls. The district remains confident that ultimately the construction project will achieve greater efficiency regarding lighting, heating and maintenance costs. Additionally, more evenly distributed class size in the elementary buildings should also be achievable with the reconfigured early childhood learning center and two elementary buildings. The district is committed to continuing to offer a quality educational program within the constraints imposed by property tax caps and weakened state support. The Board of Education recently adopted a resolution in favor of the Educational Funding Advisory Board (EFAB) plan for better and more equitable funding of schools.

During the 2001-2002 school year, Arbor Park School District 145 paid for airconditioning and new school buses from bond proceeds. These expenditures were matched with revenues from bond proceeds. The State Board of Education's process for calculating the school district's financial profile did not take this into account.

They responded affirmatively and we are waiting for the State of Illinois to release the Construction Grant money so that we can break ground on construction. Prior to the 2001-2002 fiscal year, the district was without long-term debt. The 2001-2002 budget projection indicated that expenditures would grow beyond revenue for the first time in over five years. This was due almost entirely to an increase in staffing to match the needs of a growing enrollment. The community approved a second referendum for a $.60 increase in the education fund tax rate. We believe the districts response to its environment was both appropriate and timely and much more positive than the 2.80 profile would lead one to believe. A decrease in EAV is anticipated due to an onslaught of property tax appeal board cases coming from Cook County Commercial property taxpayers. Tax appeals as early as 1993-1996 have resulted in an unanticipated 12% reduction in 2001 tax collections. Notice of appeal was never required by law to be given to the affected taxing bodies, nor is there any relief provided under the current tax cap structure.

This caused a drastic change in our Expenditure to Revenue ratio. The difference between District 158's Financial profile designation for FY01 (financial review) and District 158's Financial profile as indicated on this preliminary report (financial watch) is not a true indicator of District 158's financial status. District 158 charges against the budget all salaries in the year they are earned. Some districts charge salaries only as they are paid. If we used an accrual accounting system we would charge the salaries as expenses and show an asset titled Prepaid Salaries. This is what actually happened. Salaries are paid in one fiscal year but checks are not issued until July and August in the next fiscal year. This diminished the cash on hand according to the financial records, yet the cash is still in the bank. This amounts to $970,173.56 for fiscal year 01/02.

During the 2000-01 school year the District sold $12,500,000 worth of Working Cash Fund bonds to fund a 5 year renovation project on the high school. During each of those years expenses for renovations appearing in the Operations and Maintenance Fund and have been and will be paid for with cooresponding revenue transfers to the O & M Fund from the Working Cash Fund. Since the Expenditure to Revenue Ratio Indicator excludes the Working Cash Fund and fund transfers, expenses for this type of project are recorded but the revenues are not. For FY 2002, reported here, $5,455,907 in expenses for the renovations to the facility were included in the Operations and Maintenance figures but the transfer from Working Cash for the same amount to pay for those renovations that is reflected in the District's Annual Financial Report FY2002 is not included as revenue to offset that expense. Consequently the District ratio for this indicator was incorrectly listed as 1.14. It should have been 1.05. The impact of this inaccuracy is that the District should have received an overall score of 3.55 instead of 3.2. This should have placed Evanston Township High School in the ""Financial Recognition"" category instead of the ""Financial Review"" category as listed in this document.

We used accumulated fund balances (savings) to build a new Center for the Arts at our junior high. This project was saved for and built without having to go to a referendum. Revised 3/12/03 During the period of time being considered, the Board of Education built a new Center for the Arts and a new Early Childhood/Administrative Center. The total cost of these one time expenditures was $7.5 million. The Board entered into a lease-purchase agreement and received $2.5 million which was not recognized as revenue in the State Board of Education's formulas. These projects were planned for and built utilizing fund balances without a referendum or tax rate increase.

The rev/exp ratio looks bad even though there are invested dollars earmarked for the expense. The one time receipt of the School Construction Grant assisted the district's revenues to expenditure ratio. The major reason that expenditures exceeded revenues in FY02 is that the school district completed paying for a 5.5 million dollar addition to our middle school from revenues accumulated in the previous two years and placed in the operations and maintenance fund. On March 19, 2002 District 2 passed a successful education fund rate increase of 80 cents. It was the first referendum passed in 34 years.

District to district comparisons are complicated by financial reporting cash or accrual accounting methods. Queen Bee School District 16 reports on an accrual basis. Therefore, fund balances include $1,200,000 of accrued salaries (summer payrolls) and accrued compensated days thereby reducing fund balances. Adding those dollars back into the fund balances would increase the district score to 1.05 from .70 in area 1 and increasing the total profile score from 2.55 to 2.9 which would move this district from the ""Financial Watch"" determination to the ""Financial Early Warning"" determination. 2. Every school district in Illinois has a different ""story"" of financial status that is reflected in the new Financial Profile. While we believe this evaluation better reflects a district's financial picture than the ""Financial Watch"" formula did, it is important to understand that unique circumstances can cause elevated or exceptionally dismal scores. For example, a deficit budget could reflect a construction project as we did in FY2001 when funds from a lease purchase were deposited in our Operations and Maintenance Fund in FY2000 and the costs incurred in FY2001. This would skew both step 2 and step 3 of the profile. 3. Percent of long-term debt margin remaining: The district has no non-referendum bond ability remaining even though there is 46.4% debt margin remaining for the district. Legislative action could make these funds available for an emergency (i.e. life safety). This district currently has $6,000,000 of approved life safety amendments it is unable to proceed with until funds become available. At this time it is not feasible to request funds via referendum. Please see statement #4. 4. The district has an education fund tax rate referendum question on the April 1, 2003 ballot after the defeat of the November 2, 2002 referendum. Should it not be successful, the district is preparing to implement $1,5000,000 in staff salary and benefit reductions. The last successful referendum was in 1993.

MAERCKER SCHOOL DISTRICT 60  1.40  1.05  0.30  0.40  0.10  3.25  Financial Review  Creating a financial profile of a school district is like trying to hit a moving target. This is because a district's cash balance changes daily with a continuous flow of revenue and expenses. Therefore, a certain point-in-time must be determined. In Illinois, that point-in-time is June 30. The establishment of any common date across Illinois is somewhat problematic in that different counties receive major tax deposits at different times of the year. Cook County districts receive a semi-annual tax deposit in October, while DuPage County districts receive a semi-annual tax deposit in June. One who analyzes a financial profile needs to understand this, as the financial health of a school district in DuPage County may appear healthier than school districts in other counties. Since Maercker District 60 does, in fact, receive major tax deposits each June, its financial health appears rosier than it may be when making statewide comparisons.

For FY02 our ranking dropped to Financial Watch List. The reason for the change can be accounted for in the scoring of the expenditure to revenue ratio. This is the only section of the five in which our scoring dropped from the previous year. In FY01 our score was a ""4"", in FY02 we dropped to a ""2"". The reason for the drop is attributed to nearly $8M of expenditures in the Operations & Maintenance Fund, which were construction related. We budgeted $5M for payout of construction work associated with a $52.5M project, which was only supported by a $25 referendum (and did not include equipment and furniture). A $7M State Construction Grant, operating funds and fund balances, offset the remaining $17.5M. Additionally, in FY02 we expended $3M for 36 portable classroom complexes at both of our high schools. In total we are doing $11M worth of work at our high schools (including portables), which is being paid for by an $11M Working Cash Bond Sale. The proceeds from this bond sale are not shown as revenue in FY02 even though the expenditures are included. While we still had a negative operating budget (not including the $11M), our ranking without the impact of construction would have only slipped to Financial Review not Financial Watch List.

Management of local (89%), state (8%) and federal (3%) funds at a ""break-even"" level has not had a negative impact on quality education at our local level. Minooka Community High School is predicted to experience sustained 5-6% growth in student population for the next 5 years. This will have a negative effect on our district financial profile without successful passage of Ed and building referendum.

This is especially true over the past three years. In 2000-2001 our Education Fund experienced a deficit of almost $435,000. Despite making cuts, we have continued to experience deficit spending. This year the situation was complicated by the loss of almost $140,000 in General State Aid and Corporate Personal Property Replacement Tax. Unit #9 entered the 20002001 school year with approximately $1,600,000 in savings in our Education and Working Cash Funds. We will end the 2002-2003 fiscal year with approximately $600,000. This projection assumes that the District will receive 24 General State Aid payments. There is much talk about school districts not receiving two General State Aid payments during this fiscal year. A loss of two General State Aid payments would mean an additional $265,000 loss to the District. This would be absolutely disastrous. At the present rate, we will expend all of our reserves during the 2004-2005 school year with limited capacity to raise additional revenue. The Board has instituted several cost controlling measures that reduced deficit spending by over $300,000 per year. The cost controlling measures are: Eliminated an administrative position Eliminated 5 certified positions Eliminated 4 non certified positions Closed an elementary school Reduced travel, supply and equipment budgets Many financial concerns exist for the 2003-2004 school year. There are concerns about possible reductions in State revenue and increases in maintenance costs, general personnel costs, insurance costs and special education costs. Unit #9 is heavily reliant on General State aid to meet operational expenses. Therefore, when the State cuts or freezes funding to schools it has a dramatic effect on our school district. To date, we have no solid information about what will happen with State funding, but the outlook appears to be bleak. Moreover, the Board has fully utilized the local tax levy by taxing at the maximum rates. The Board has also substantially increased the Tort Fund revenue to pay salaries for employees who are involved in risk management activities. This practice has increased the overall tax rate that our community is assessed. The Board is also extremely sensitive to the economic woes in our area. The unemployment rate in Watseka is approaching double digits as a number of factories have shut their doors over the past few months. This, in addition to a depressed farm economy, limits our community's ability to support schools with their tax dollars.

This means that the ISBE will be monitoring our school district closely and offering proactive technical assistance. Based on the information from ISBE management, there will be a large number of school districts on the state watch list. The ISBE estimates that 85% of school districts will be deficit spending by the end of this fiscal year. Based on conversation with other local school district administrators, our district is not alone in our financial woes. We project that the district's education fund could have a deficit fund balance of 1 million dollars by the end of the fiscal year. If the district continues to experience expenditures as we have in the past, we could reach a $5 million deficit by FY2005. Many factors have contributed to our school district's financial condition. Decreases in general state aid revenues ($382,000 decrease this year - could be more if 23rd and 24th State Aid payments are prorated or received late, as predicted) due to declining enrollment and a freeze in the funding foundation level, as well as proration of categorical grants by as much as 85% (i.e.. Special education and transportation) have had a large impact on district revenues. The district has also felt the effect of tax caps, which have limited the amount of property insurance premiums, which have nearly doubled, increasing costs by $150,000. Personnel costs have increased substantially due to significant salary increases over the past three years, although average salaries for teachers and administrators continue to fall below the state average. Personnel costs increased by over $300,000 in FY03. The State of Illinois is potentially faced with a $5 billion deficit. The district would like to attempt to cut 1/2 million dollars from our budget next year to help alleviate the situation. It appears that it could be at least 18 months before school districts get any relief through proposed income tax increases or other funding. Future considerations and concerns for our school district will be further decreases in state aid, tax caps, increased cost of health insurance, workman's compensation and property insurance and contract negotiations, variables which could cost the district an undeterminable amount of money. At present, the financial forecast for the State as well as the financial position of the district, in our opinion, creates the following conclusions: One way for the district to address our financial concerns will be through attrition  Thursday, May 15, 2003  Page 39 of 85   County/District Name Max  FBRR (1.4)  EXRV (1.4)  DCOH (0.4)  STB (0.4)  LTD (0.4)  Score (4.0)  Designation  District Comments created by employee retirements district wide.

It is the intent of the district administration to address every aspect of the budget and with the next school year plan to provide a savings of approximately $500,000. It is with these conclusions that we present our proposal to begin finding ways to reduce our deficit spending issues. The specific recommendations will be made at the February meeting.

Numerous expenses were incurred during the final phase of construction and moving into the new facility, which is the primary reason the expenditure to revenue ratio was greater than 1 for FY02. These were planned expenses for which money had been saved. Because the reorganization expenses were included in FY02, the expenditures were inflated to $15,147,886. With the exception of summer projects completed in FY03, the expenditures will be back to a more realistic number for FY03 ($12,395,652). The School Board of Education and Administration are working diligently to operate within a balanced budget. However, with delayed payments from the State and Federal governments and an overall reduction in school revenue, this will be a challenge.

The recommendation to build was substantiated by a successful referendum granting permission to build and to sell bonds for that purpose. Bourbonnais ranks fourth on the most recent priority ranking from the CDB for school construction funds. Significant repairs and associated costs are continuing for the other five Bourbonnais schools. The current method of calculating the School District Financial Profile fails to include the ""Sale of Fixed Assets"" as revenue. Each year the District replaces its bus fleet. In 2001-02, $383,037 was received in revenue as trade-in for eight buses and $446,344 was expended. Total Transportation Fund revenue including the trade-in receipts was $727,490.94 and expenditures were $694,271.19 or a positive $33,219.75 of revenue over expenditures. The ISBE data indicates receipts of $344,453,46 and expenditures of $694,271.19 or a deficit $349,817.73 of expenditures over revenue. The ISBE method of calculating the ""Expenditure to Revenue Ratio"" does not accurately convey the actual totals which are total revenues of $10,209,323 (not $9,826,286) and expenditures of $9,901,365, resulting in a ratio of .97 not 1.01. The other major item, besides salary and benefit personnel costs, that may negatively affect our financial position, is the State's funding of education. Flat or decreased overall funding by the State will lead to significant erosion of our financial position and the need to further cut programs and services to remain financially solvent. The State must adequately and equitably fund public education!

District 88 will be asking voters to approve an education fund rate increase in the April 1, 2003 election. The increased education fund rate is projected to stabilize the District's education fund for the foreseeable future. There are residential developments currently pending within the District's boundaries that will increase future student enrollment in all schools. A cooperative ""Growth Committee"" between the City of Plano and District 88 has been organized to develop a plan that will accommodate these anticipated increases in student enrollment. I am expecting our EAV to decrease approximately 3%. Our personnel costs will likely increase 6-8%. Special ed costs always increase. These are significant to us, of course, but should not dramatically affect our financial outlook. Maintaining Hold Harmless is our biggest need. District #115 passed Education Fund and Building Fund referendums in the spring of 2002 in an effort to address our increased enrollment due to growth. Our Equalized Assessed Valuation is also increasing due to this growth. We had to increase our debt service to build the new buildings to house the additional students. We also have to hire additional staff to address increases in enrollment, further reducing our Education Fund balance. Regarding our financial profile score portion regarding the percent of longterm debt remaining: Our score is a 1, low percentage, due to extremely rapid growth and large construction initiatives. This percentage will remain low as long as we continue to build schools to meet the facility needs of our students.

The City of Zion was the home for a CommonWealth Edison nuclear power plant; this plant closed in 1997. After CommonWealth Edison made the decision to permanently close the plant in 1998 the affected taxing bodies worked with CommonWealth Edison to draft an Equalized Assessed Value (EAV) rampdown agreement. This ramp-down agreement, which was finalized in December 2000, decreased the EAV of the plant from $171,000,000 in tax year 199 to $10,000,000 in tax year 2005. This agreement resulted in a loss of 60% of our district's EAV, which directly affects the tax revenues of all funds. The District has taken steps to improve the financial health of the district, including a community-supported $.60 education fund tax rate increase in March 2002. While the education fund tax rate increase was an important step, it is necessary for the district to take further steps to ensure the financial solvency of the district. Our enrollment increase from year to year over the past 5 years has increased 15.6% per year. Our EAV has increased at about the same rate, however, revenues based on property taxes have not, mostly because of the Illinois Limited Tax Extension Act, Tax Cap. Additionally GSA has not increased applicably, and 49% of our revenue is State Aid.

The Board is also pleased with the designation of financial recognition as delineated by the new Profile system as it bears out the Board's dedication to providing a quality and challenging educational environment for the students of Deerfield, Highland Park and Riverwoods while maintaining a watchful eye on the bottom line. However, the Board does need to draw attention to the distinction between itself and other districts that report results of operations to the Illinois State Board of Education on the modified accrual basis of accounting. Deerfield School District 109 reports the results of its operations to the Illinois State Board of Education on the cash basis of accounting. In Lake County, approximately 49% of an annual tax levy is distributed to school districts prior to July 1, the start of their fiscal years. Deerfield School District 109 properly reports these receipts as current year revenue in the income statement per the cash basis of accounting, while modified accrual basis of accounting districts report these receipts as deferred revenue, a liability on the balance sheet. Since approximately 80% of Deerfield School District 109's total revenue are generated by property tax collections, this particular item has found a profound effect on the district's FAAS ratio. This difference can be illustrated by utilizing District 109's information from the 2001-2002 Annual Financial Report. As reported under the new School District Financial Profile system, District 109's FAAS ratio is calculated at .60. This ratio calculation provides the district with a score of 4, which is then weighted by 35%, the highest weight of the five categories that comprise the new Profile system. However, by using a crude calculation that removes the early tax collections from the district's FAAS score to 3, which when weighted by 35% and added to the other four categories, produces a total score of 3.55, on the cusp of the financial review designation and not as strong an indicator of financial strength as depicted by the 3.90 score achieved when using the FAAS score generated using the cash basis of accounting. The Board of Education sincerely hopes that the Illinois State Board of Education continues working towards a rating system that provides a fair comparison of financial health for Illinois School Districts, regardless of the basis of accounting that is utilized in their reporting methodology.

First, the State of Illinois was unable to meet its obligations in a timely manner. Our cash-basis budget was dependant upon receiving our fourth quarter categorical payments by June 30, 2002. This did not occur. Also, the tax bills for Lake County went out late, further eroding our revenue collections for FY02. Had these two separate events not occurred, our revenue would have been greater than our expenses and we would have had more cash on hand at year-end. This would have raised Wauconda CUSD 118's profile to the Financial Review category. Given that this assessment system is new, it should be noted that it could be unfairly influenced by uncontrollable acts from outside parties, especially for districts like ours who operate under a cash-basis accounting system.

The fund balances have been depleted due to unfunded state and federal mandates. Federal law calls for 40% funding of IDEA and state funding has a constitutional requirement of 51%. Currently, our district receives 5% of our revenue from fedreal sources and 35% from state funding. State Board of Education letter head proudly states at the bottom, ""Making Illinois Schools Second to None"" and should add a line stateing ""While Funding Second to Last"". The majority of our school assessments come from farmland which due to state law has been reduced over the past four years by the Illinois Farmland Assessment Reduction. We are meeting all state laws and ISBE requirements and have a perfect score on our state audits and quality assurance reviews. Our academic scores are, and have always been well above state standards. Our school was exempt from quality review for years because of exemplary state test scores. Our greatest current financial need is for the state and federal funding of schools to meet their legal obligation.

Our district profile was 3.9 out of a 4.0 and we received Financial Recognition. On February 6, 2003 we received the proposed profile for our district using data from the 2001-2002 Annual Financial Report. Because our district had saved money and established a reserve to prepare for a building project and then expended these reserves this past year, the district was penalized using the formula. The School Accounting System does not allow for the flexible transferring of funds. The district had earmarked approximately $2.5 million in reserve money in the Ed Fund for the building project. All expenditures for the building project are required to come out of the Site and Construction Fund. The district is not allowed to move the money from one fund to another, but must deficit spend and deposit state aide payments into the Site and Construction Fund. The district is not allowed to move the money from one fund to another, but must deficit spend and deposit state aide payments into the Site and Construction Fund. Because of the deficit spending, we were rated a ""1"" in ""expenditures to revenue"" because of the building project and utilization of reserves. The Total Profile for the last year was 2.75 and placed us on an early warning list - which does not seem valid since the district has over $1.5 million remaining in the Ed Fund and $836,000 in the Working Cash Fund. I feel the profile should be determined on an average of the past three years to get a more accurate picture for the district. In summary, I do not feel this profile provides a valid representation of our district's assets.

In the 1980's the district was placed on the State's Financial Watch list as second year tax anticipation warrants were used to meet payroll and other financial obligations. In the early 1990's the district passed a $0.40 tax rate increase in the Education Fund. It was at this time that the farmland assessment and residential property assessments began to rise. The rise in residential property also brought an influx of students, which translated into additional State Aid. The Lincoln Community High School Board of Education also provided investment capital for the district through the sale of working cash bonds. The state was set to build the district's financial future through prudent fiscal management and solid investment opportunities. In 1997-98 a new funding formula was adopted by the legislature to calculate General State Aid. The new formula guaranteed school districts that they would not receive fewer State Aid dollars than they had previously received in 1997. This provision was called Hold Harmless. One of the objectives of the new Formula was to increase the Formula's Foundation Level each year until the Hold Harmless provision was no longer necessary, which has not occurred. Since the new Formula's inception LCHS has not received additional State Aid support. Instead, the district has been receiving Hold Harmless monies. In Fiscal Year 2002 Lincoln Community High School District #404 received $271,865 in Hold Harmless Aid. In Fiscal Year 2003 the amount of Hold Harmless Aid climbed to $477,921. This change in dependency on Hold Harmless is attributed to a declining student population and an increase in Equalized Assessed Value in the district. For the part four years the Illinois Legislature and the Illinois State Board of Education have discussed the probability of eliminating the Hold Harmless provision from the Funding Formula. Should this discussion become a reality then Lincoln Community High School's current fiscal stability will crumble.

In 1995, enrollment at some grade levels was in excess of 35 students per teacher, with second grade finishing the school year with one teacher for 41 students. Small storage closets were remodeled to provide space for counseling and for speech therapy services, but there were no rooms available for splitting classes. Restroom facilities were woefully insufficient to handle the student numbers enrolled at the time. In 1995, without foreknowledge that state construction funds would eventually become available and with the best interest of students in mind, the Board of Education felt it had no realistic alternative but to acquire two temporary classroom buildings, each with two classrooms. Restrooms were also built to accommodate increasing enrollment. Reserves were used to construct restroom facilities at a cost of $125,000. Likewise, the temporary classroom buildings were constructed through five year leave-purchase agreements, and the payments were made from district reserves at a cost of $250,000. Those buildings have now been incorporated into the school's new facility which was funded largely by a state construction grant. The Board of Education feels it noteworthy that the district has, since 1995, added three classroom teachers to reduce class sizes and has added a fulltime special education teacher and a half-time special education teacher to address the requirements of special needs students. The district has thus far been able to provide these services using local tax dollars (which are capped) and state and federal aid. It is the feeling of the Board of Education that the information contained in this profile should be analyzed in light of the fact that the district started out with reserves totaling $378.000 (June 30, 1994), has since that time built and staffed classrooms (regular and special education) in order to meet basic educational and legal needs and yet it finished the FY02 fiscal year (as indicated on the profile) with $200,000 remaining in reserves.

The reflections are not at all pleasant. As in many communities throughout the state, Centralia is experiencing a profound economic downturn. It is a matter of record that the levels of unemployment and poverty within this area are among the highest in the state. As a result, our schools must strive continually to reverse the effects of such poverty upon student learning. It is critical that our schools and the other schools with significant populations of low-income students be able to provide a high quality education through such methods as minimizing class size, maintaining optimum staffing levels, attracting and retaining highly qualified staff, providing adequate health and counseling services, sustaining education enrichment programs, and adequately meeting the education service requirements of special needs students. For most children of poverty, a quality education will be the only means through which they can realize a productive and stable life in adulthood. As is the case in many down-state districts, our local revenue sources are not adequate to provide the level of services needed by our students. These programs can only be realized and sustained through adequate funding from state and federal sources. Unfortunately, Centralia City Schools District #135 is scheduled to receive over $300,000 less in state aid for the 20022003 school year than it did for 2001-2002. Due to this decline in state funding and to an increase in operational expenses, our district has a current year deficit budgeted in excess of ($700,000 for 2002-2003). On Friday, February 7th, another crippling economic blow was dealt to our district when the 2000 Census Preliminary Data arrived. Incredibly, the 2000 census indicates that the number of students at poverty level within our district has decreased from 564 in 1990 to 393 in 2000. Our verifiable data supported by the Department of Human Services (DHS) and evidenced by the number of kids who are qualified for free or reduced means has steadily increased over the past 10 years. The fact that this supposed 30% decrease in the census poverty level has occurred within the county with the highest level of unemployment in the state makes the accuracy of census data all the more suspect. The 2000 census data for poverty levels clearly is not representative of the real conditions that exist in Centralia and many other communities. However, the funding inequities brought by this data will impact many schools in a most negative manner over the next ten years if it is allowed to stand. Centralia City Schools District #135 has worked long and hard to develop a top rated district, and we have accomplished this goal with expenditures below the average cost per student in Illinois and in the United States.

We have an efficient and successful school district. Unfortunately, the opportunities we provide our students will be at-risk if additional revenue is not provided. While reserves have allowed District #135 to continue without interruption for the current year, it is inevitable that serious reductions in expenditures will have to occur if adequate state funding is not forthcoming in the future. We anticipate that, as the effect of the 2000 census reduces our already reduced state aid, we will have a zero fund balance in the education fund within the coming year. Obviously the financial profile of Centralia #135 will take a steep nose dive if this occurs. Unless adequate funding is provided in the very near future, I see the deterioration of the district's educational services and financial standing as forgone conclusions. Nothing is more important than education. A well educated populace pays more taxes and lower costs for government in terms of welfare, containment, and services. An investment in education pays off more than any investment you can make. Please continue to lend your influence to securing adequate financing for the schools of Illinois. Thank you for your support of our school district and for any assistance that you can lend in this issue of critical importance.

In addition, cash flow problems are occurring due to the lateness of categorical payments from the Illinois comptroller due to the State's financial problems. District 200 is committed to operating within its means and reductions of $1.25 million were made to the 2002-2003 operating budgets and $2.2 million are being considered for 2003-2004. The funding methods of education in Illinois are outdated, inconsistent, unreliable, inequitable for students and relies too heavily on local property taxes.

If these funds are depleted and/or the ratio of expenditures to revenues is low, the district would receive a lower score on the District Financial Profile. This is what happened with last year's (2001-02) Financial Profile. During the 2001-02 school year Aledo 201 School District's financial designation changed from ""Recognition"" with a score of 3.55 to a designation of ""Early Warning"" with a score of 2.75. ""Recognition"" is the highest of the four designations, the ""Review"" and ""Early Warning"" is next to the bottom designation called ""Watch"". The reasons that Aledo changed so much in a single year are: 1) During the 2001-02 school year, the district moved $1,050,000 from the Education Fund into the Building Fund to build a new junior high school. The district patrons voted on a March 21, 2000 bond referendum to approve this depletion of the reserves in the Education Fund to build a new junior high school. 2) Besides the money being moved from the Education Fund, the Interest on that money is also depleted from the Education Fund. In our case, that amounts to $24,626. 3) The Average Daily Attendance (ADA) of students dropped by 18.7 students from the previous year resulting in a loss of over $85,000 that we would have received if our numbers would have stayed the same. Even though the district did receive an increase of $39,961 in General State Aid, that amount did not come close to the over 3% increase in expenditures of a 7 million dollar budget. It certainly does not help schools that the legislature cannot seem to decide how much money a district is to receive until May or June. This puts the district in the position of having to negotiate the teachers and staff and subsequently to build the next year's budget without knowing the actual money they will receive. Further, if the state determines that is has no money and gives no increase to the General State Aid like it did this year (2002-03) then districts with decreasing populations actually receive less state aid than the previous year.

Also a recent message from State Superintendent Schiller discussed the preliminary 2000 census data and its effect on the General State Aid poverty count for next year calculations. Our school district alone will lose $33,000 next year in general state aid using the new census poverty count. The process used is a skewed and unrepresentative count of those who truly qualify as poverty level in mine and other school districts. In my opinion and others, an audited free and reduced lunch count is the only true way to determine poverty in a local school district.

Maintaining this status in the future is going to be extremely difficult for the following reasons: 1) Changes in the poverty count of the 2000 Census will decrease the District's state and federal funding levels. 2) Decrease in student enrollment 3) Eroding local tax base due to the T.I.F. District and State land purchases. 4) The State of Illinois prorating payments. The District receives 61% of funding from state sources. As long as state aid payments increase the economic outlook appears healthy. However, the District is experiencing a declining student enrollment and a significant decrease in the poverty count as determined by the 2000 census. Depending on the poverty count the District could face between a $142,606 to $285,166 decrease in general state aid alone. Hopefully a hold harmless provision would decrease these amounts. Currently the State of Illinois has prorated special education and transportation funding costing the District $29,672 in revenue. There remains a question on state aid payments. Currently, unless legislators agree to fully fund state aid payments the best-case scenario is an additional $14,285 loss of state aid due to prorating. There is the possibility of creative state financing by sliding state aid payments into the next fiscal year.

During the decade of the 1990's through 2002 the District was able to accumulate a reasonable fund balance in its operating funds. The healthy economy fueled appropriations to keep up with increased operational costs. Unfortunately, the economy has bottomed out. States are not able to provide appropriations to assist with increased operational costs. The District is feeling the impact of the economy through reduced revenues as interest rates plummet, grants are pro-rated to less than 100% and costs continue to rise. To meet this economic challenge, the District began reducing expenditures during the 2002-03 year. It will also minimize the loss of programming for students by utilizing part of the accumulated surplus. As the poor economic conditions continue, the District foresees that its ranking on the financial profile will diminish. Great care and thought will be given to determine the most appropriate means to provide learning opportunities to the students and providing value to our community while maintaining fiscal responsibility. These decisions are difficult but necessary until the economy turns and the State is able to provide adequate assistance to meet the educational needs of the students.

These problems have been in the district for some time, and the school board is well aware of them. We as a district have been addressing these problems and we have made some real progress. Regardless of the financial problems, our district remains dedicated to bringing a quality program of education to our students. The main reason the district is experiencing financial shortfalls is due to reduced state funding. This can be traced back to the negative effect the new state aid formula had on high school districts and the pro-rating of state reimbursements, especially in the area of special education. The school district would not be facing financial difficulties if the state provided the funding appropriately.

STEPHENSON FREEPORT SCHOOL DIST 145 1.05 1.05 0.10 0.40 0.30 2.90 Financial Early Warning In an effort to raise achievement, the Freeport School District implemented a policy to reduce elementary class size. This initiative added staff and caused an increased budget deficit in the educational fund. The inability of the State to meet their financial obligations caused late payments to the district which were beyond the scope of the 2001-2002 fiscal year. This report reflects the financial position of the District and places a label on the District that is partially controlled by the receipt of the revenues. Late payments and pro-rated payments have caused the Freeport School District and many other Illinois School Districts to have significant cash flow problems. Freeport School District made a capital purchase of $500,000 for a transportation complex. This expense did not have an increase in balancing revenue, thus reflected a $500,000 deficit in the O&M Fund.

Building Maintenance Grant funds created surpluses in FY00 and 01 when the funds arrived. They added to a deficit in FY02 when some of the funds were expended. Some transportation and special education payments were received after July 1, 2002, and did not show up on the books for FY02. State aid payments in recent years have failed to keep pace with increasing labor and heating costs. The state continues to under fund special education mandates forcing schools to divert resources to pay for services required by legislature and the courts.

District financial solvency continues to be negatively impacted by the decision to eliminate the weighting of high school students, and by the reductions in funding from the State of Illinois. Fees and other local revenue sources have been increased, while several teaching positions have been reduced in order to control expenses. Without an improvement in state funding, Nashville Community High School may need to consider asking the local taxpayer's for a tax rate increase in the education and building funds.

School Board undertook some proactive cost-cutting measures. Namely, we instituted a ""retirementincentive buy-out"" program in which, among other things, the district offered eligible teachers to pay that respective teacher's ""2.2 upgrade"" PLUS a onetime bonus of a twenty percent (20%) check handed to them on the last day of instruction. As a result, some fourteen (14) veteran teachers opted for the incentives. Over the last four year, these fourteen people's buyout cost the district some $400,000.00 dollars in cash outlay. However, as this is my point, because of these retirements, the district has either absorbed or not replaced our of those fourtenn positions, thus saving about $200,000.00 dollars. Additionaly, of the other teaching positions that we did replace now -, we replace a teacher making $55,000.00 with a new fresh-out-ofschool teacher hired in at $25,000.00 - hence, saving the district about $30,000.00 per hire. If you do the math, the cumulative savings in ten years more than amount to $300,000.00 per teacher, with a net savings in ten years of almost three million dollars in salaries and benefits! NOW HERE IS WHERE THE RUB COMES IN! Under the state's new criteria, there ais a cumulative hit, a ""snowballing effect"" or a multiplying of factors in regards to finances. First of all, because of the buyout incentives, the outlay of $400,000.00 in bonuses caused our fund balances to dramatically decrease this affecting our Fund Balance to Revenue Ratio; secondly, since these monies are cash outlays, our Expenditures went upward markedly causing our Expenditures to Revenue Ratio to be affected; thirdly, then our Days Cash on Hand ratio is lowered. Finanlly, our Long-Term Debt Margin is caused by the fact that we built a brand new five and one-half million dollar ($5,500,000.00) K-8 building (at the encouragement of the state, I might add) replacing a nearly 100 year old structure! SO! - We are exasperated! Moreover, some of out funding from the state (transportation) has been delayed by almost three months! In sum, I am a great believer in accountability and good stewardship. However, punishing us with the lowest classification label of Financial Watch belies the point that the criteria are too planar and myopic in the sense of merely looking at the numbers and not as to the HOW'S AND WHY'S of the numbers!

The passage of this referendum will infuse approximately $2.5 million additional tax dollars into the Education Fund. The last referendum was in 1989. Since then the district has also been placed under Tax Caps. The Board of Education understands the need to increase revenues and decrease expenditures in order to work towards a balanced budget. Over the past few years with the failure of other referendum questions, the district has reduced expenditures by approximately $4 million and has also made further reductions for the FY04 budget year. The amount listed for Long Term Debt also includes items that have been classified as ""Other Long Term Debt"". These items should not lower the amount of the Legal Debt Margin of the district, as they are not part of any bond indebtedness. They pertain to compensated balances, accreted interest, and a possible arbitrage rebate according to the District's audit firm, BDO Seidman. The removal of these items would increase the percentage remaining of the Legal Debt Margin to 31%. However, this change will not effect the overall classification of the district as reported by the ISBE Financial Profile System.

Moving from an area that projects ""potential downward trends"" to the high rating of ""financial strength"" particularly when the fund balances reflect early local taxes, which show the financial stability of our district. Local officials look as if they are ""crying wolf"" when difficult decisions are being made to reduce local spending.

The 2002 School District Financial Profile is misleading because the only reason the Hononegah CHSD 207 received a higher score was due to the fact that it borrowed 3.5 million dollars in tax anticipation warrants which showed on the district's financial records as increased revenue for the year and lead to a higher cash balance and increased days of available cash. In reality the district is slowly increasing its deficit and now has needed to barrow funds in order to maintain all of its current programs.

If these funds are depleted and/or the ratio of expenditures to revenues is low, the district would receive a lower score on the District Financial Profile. This is what happened with last year's (2001-02) Financial Profile. During the 2001-02 school year Aledo 201 School District's financial designation changed from ""Recognition"" with a score of 3.55 to a designation of ""Early Warning"" with a score of 2.75. ""Recognition"" is the highest of the four designations, the ""Review"" and ""Early Warning"" is next to the bottom designation called ""Watch"". The reasons that Aledo changed so much in a single year are: 1) During the 2001-02 school year, the district moved $1,050,000 from the Education Fund into the Building Fund to build a new junior high school. The district patrons voted on a March 21, 2000 bond referendum to approve this depletion of the reserves in the Education Fund to build a new junior high school. 2) Besides the money being moved from the Education Fund, the Interest on that money is also depleted from the Education Fund. In our case, that amounts to $24,626. 3) The Average Daily Attendance (ADA) of students dropped by 18.7 students from the previous year resulting in a loss of over $85,000 that we would have received if our numbers would have stayed the same. Even though the district did receive an increase of $39,961 in General State Aid, that amount did not come close to the over 3% increase in expenditures of a 7 million dollar budget. It certainly does not help schools that the legislature cannot seem to decide how much money a district is to receive until May or June. This puts the district in the position of having to negotiate the teachers and staff and subsequently to build the next year's budget without knowing the actual money they will receive. Further, if the state determines that is has no money and gives no increase to the General State Aid like it did this year (2002-03) then districts with decreasing populations actually receive less state aid than the previous year.

For the purposes of debt margin, principal of $1,975,000 from the 1987 Building Bond should be subtracted from the total principal due. The proceeds from this bond are exempt from the 6.9 % debt limitation ceiling by referendum. Arbor Park School District 145 is not on the Watch List, rather, it is in the second category of Financial Review where it was last year and where most neighboring school districts are. The State Board of Education's process for calculating the school district's financial profile does not take into account one-time major expenditures that are paid by bond proceeds. During the 2001-2002 school year, Arbor Park School District 145 paid for airconditioning and new school buses from bond proceeds. These expenditures were matched with revenues from bond proceeds. The State Board of Education's process for calculating the school district's financial profile did not take this into account. As a result, a financially stable school district is reported as being in financial trouble. This is unconscionable and irresponsible. For the record, Arbor Park School District 145 is not on the Watch List!

This can be traced back to the negative effect the new state aid formula had on high school districts and the pro-rating of state reimbursements, especially in the area of special education. The school district would not be facing financial difficulties if the state provided the funding appropriately. Our district is definitely in need of additional revenue to offset the annual contractual personnel increasing cost. Our personnel costs are increasing substantially faster than new revenue is being generated for our district. We are looking into the possibility of a referendum.

At the January 27, 2003 Meeting of the Board of Education the Board voted to place a $1.25 increase in the Education Fund Tax Rate on the ballot as a referendum for April 1, 2003. This referendum, if passed would generate about $1.3 million per year. 3. The teacher contract for Carlinville teachers ends on August 1, 2003. The union has agreed to begin bargaining now (first session February 20, 2003) in order to clarify salary costs as soon as possible. This will help determine salary cost for next year as soon as possible. 4. Over the last three years the district has suffered a 90 student drop in enrollment and a slightly increasing EAV. 5. In the last three years the district has suffered a $360,000 loss or reduction in General State Aid. 6. In the last two years the district has suffered a $200,000 loss in Corporate Personal Property Replacement Taxes. 7. Tax caps, in the last year, have forced the district to suffer an increase in revenue of 1.6% versus a 7% increase in expenditures. These are increased expenditures such as special education costs, liability insurance, contractual commitments, health insurance and unfunded mandates, all of which the district has no control over.  CARLYLE C U SCHOOL DISTRICT 1  1.05  1.05  0.20  0.40  0.10  2.80  Financial Early Warning  Carlyle school district has for the past three years planned and reduced expenditures on a regular basis. We have reduced 15% of the certified staff and 25% of the administrative staff through retirements. We are in the middle of a $7,500,000 project with revenues from the Capital Development Board and a bond referendum. The district has sought additional revenue sources and cuts have been made on expenditure line items. A sincere effort has been made to be cost effective. Carlyle school district has lost significant funds by a declining interest rate on investments, state and federal grants and reductions in state aid as EAV growth has minimally taken place along with increases in operating costs. Carlyle like many districts is on the financial early warning list. The Board of Education and administration will continue to seek ways to provide the best educational opportunities for students at the most reasonable cost.

The reflections are not at all pleasant. As in many communities throughout the state, Centralia is experiencing a profound economic downturn. It is a matter of record that the levels of unemployment and poverty within this area are among the highest in the state. As a result, our schools must strive continually to reverse the effects of such poverty upon student learning. It is critical that our schools and the other schools with significant populations of low-income students be able to provide a high quality education through such methods as minimizing class size, maintaining optimum staffing levels, attracting and retaining highly qualified staff, providing adequate health and counseling services, sustaining education enrichment programs, and adequately meeting the education service requirements of special needs students. For most children of poverty, a quality education will be the only means through which they can realize a productive and stable life in adulthood. As is the case in many down-state districts, our local revenue sources are not adequate to provide the level of services needed by our students. These programs can only be realized and sustained through adequate funding from state and federal sources. Unfortunately, Centralia City Schools District #135 is scheduled to receive over $300,000 less in state aid for the 20022003 school year than it did for 2001-2002. Due to this decline in state funding and to an increase in operational expenses, our district has a current year deficit budgeted in excess of ($700,000 for 2002-2003). On Friday, February 7th, another crippling economic blow was dealt to our district when the 2000 Census Preliminary Data arrived. Incredibly, the 2000 census indicates that the number of students at poverty level within our district has decreased from 564 in 1990 to 393 in 2000. Our verifiable data supported by the Department of Human Services (DHS) and evidenced by the number of kids who are qualified for free or reduced means has steadily increased over the past 10 years. The fact that this supposed 30% decrease in the census poverty level has occurred within the county with the highest level of unemployment in the state makes the accuracy of census data all the more suspect. The 2000 census data for poverty levels clearly is not representative of the real conditions that exist in Centralia and many other communities. However, the funding inequities brought by this data will impact many schools in a most negative manner over the next ten years if it is allowed to stand. Centralia City Schools District #135 has worked long and hard to develop a top rated district, and we have accomplished this goal with expenditures below the average cost per student in Illinois and in the United States.

We have an efficient and successful school district. Unfortunately, the opportunities we provide our students will be at-risk if additional revenue is not provided. While reserves have allowed District #135 to continue without interruption for the current year, it is inevitable that serious reductions in expenditures will have to occur if adequate state funding is not forthcoming in the future. We anticipate that, as the effect of the 2000 census reduces our already reduced state aid, we will have a zero fund balance in the education fund within the coming year. Obviously the financial profile of Centralia #135 will take a steep nose dive if this occurs. Unless adequate funding is provided in the very near future, I see the deterioration of the district's educational services and financial standing as forgone conclusions. Nothing is more important than education. A well educated populace pays more taxes and lower costs for government in terms of welfare, containment, and services. An investment in education pays off more than any investment you can make. Please continue to lend your influence to securing adequate financing for the schools of Illinois. Thank you for your support of our school district and for any assistance that you can lend in this issue of critical importance.

The District committed deficit spending, depending on operating funds and existing fund balances, to meet debt retirement obligations. The District meets its Alternate Revenue Bond debt retirement obligation by transferring interest from the Education, Operations and Maintenance, and Working Cash Funds to the Bond & Interest Fund. The principal and interest obligation is expensed via the Bond & Interest Fund. This expense (approximately $3.3 million annually) is not included in the Expenditure to Revenue Ratio. If this expense were included the Expenditures to Revenue Ratio, the District would score 2 in this category for fiscal year 2001/02. Over the past three years, District 59 has lost over $8 million in anticipated revenue to pay property tax refunds issued through Cook County. The loss of property taxes due to refunds is causing the District to implement expenditure reductions and to seek revenue alternatives, such as a debt service extension base.

For FY02 our ranking dropped to Financial Watch List. The reason for the change can be accounted for in the scoring of the expenditure to revenue ratio. This is the only section of the five in which our scoring dropped from the previous year. In FY01 our score was a ""4"", in FY02 we dropped to a ""2"". The reason for the drop is attributed to nearly $8M of expenditures in the Operations & Maintenance Fund, which were construction related. We budgeted $5M for payout of construction work associated with a $52.5M project, which was only supported by a $25 referendum (and did not include equipment and furniture). A $7M State Construction Grant, operating funds and fund balances, offset the remaining $17.5M. Additionally, in FY02 we expended $3M for 36 portable classroom complexes at both of our high schools. In total we are doing $11M worth of work at our high schools (including portables), which is being paid for by an $11M Working Cash Bond Sale. The proceeds from this bond sale are not shown as revenue in FY02 even though the expenditures are included. While we still had a negative operating budget (not including the $11M), our ranking without the impact of construction would have only slipped to Financial Review not Financial Watch List.

Voters of the district defeated a referendum for an education fund tax rate increase of $1.00 in the spring of 2002. The district issued $725,000 of working cash bonds in December 2003 which will help a projected $250,000 budget deficit for FY03 and assist with cash flow problems. Approximately $425,000 of program and personnel cuts will be made in the FY04 budget, which includes closing an elementary building. In April 2003 voters will be asked to approve a $.50 education fund tax rate increase. The district is projected to lose just under $1,000,000 of assessed value on the 2002 tax levy, which is payable in 2003. Student enrollment is expected to decline. It is anticipated that the FY04 budget will be balanced, however, the district could quickly be back into a deficit situation if there are unexpected increases in operational costs, and if promised state funding continues to come late and at less that 100%. April 1, 2003 referendum results will impact our available funds for FY 04. $700,000 for FY02 grant money was not received until after the close of the fiscal year on June 30, 2002. This late payment, in addition to the proration of our state Transportation reimbursement for FY02, caused the Expenditure to Revenue Ratio to fall into Category 2. Neither of these factors were under the direct control of School District 130.

The Board is also pleased with the designation of financial recognition as delineated by the new Profile system as it bears out the Board's dedication to providing a quality and challenging educational environment for the students of Deerfield, Highland Park and Riverwoods while maintaining a watchful eye on the bottom line. However, the Board does need to draw attention to the distinction between itself and other districts that report results of operations to the Illinois State Board of Education on the modified accrual basis of accounting. Deerfield School District 109 reports the results of its operations to the Illinois State Board of Education on the cash basis of accounting. In Lake County, approximately 49% of an annual tax levy is distributed to school districts prior to July 1, the start of their fiscal years. Deerfield School District 109 properly reports these receipts as current year revenue in the income statement per the cash basis of accounting, while modified accrual basis of accounting districts report these receipts as deferred revenue, a liability on the balance sheet. Since approximately 80% of Deerfield School District 109's total revenue are generated by property tax collections, this particular item has found a profound effect on the district's FAAS ratio. This difference can be illustrated by utilizing District 109's information from the 2001-2002 Annual Financial Report. As reported under the new School District Financial Profile system, District 109's FAAS ratio is calculated at .60. This ratio calculation provides the district with a score of 4, which is then weighted by 35%, the highest weight of the five categories that comprise the new Profile system. However, by using a crude calculation that removes the early tax collections from the district's FAAS score to 3, which when weighted by 35% and added to the other four categories, produces a total score of 3.55, on the cusp of the financial review designation and not as strong an indicator of financial strength as depicted by the 3.90 score achieved when using the FAAS score generated using the cash basis of accounting. The Board of Education sincerely hopes that the Illinois State Board of Education continues working towards a rating system that provides a fair comparison of financial health for Illinois School Districts, regardless of the basis of accounting that is utilized in their reporting methodology.

We are one of the 61% of Illinois school districts deficit spending this fiscal year. The number may rise to 85% by the end of this year. Also a recent message from State Superintendent Schiller discussed the preliminary 2000 census data and its effect on the General State Aid poverty count for next year calculations. Our school district alone will lose $33,000 next year in general state aid using the new census poverty count. The process used is a skewed and unrepresentative count of those who truly qualify as poverty level in mine and other school districts. In my opinion and others, an audited free and reduced lunch count is the only true way to determine poverty in a local school district. Given our 2002 profile score, District 401 has an awesome task to elevate its score to a 4. Tax caps and state budget limitations are not positive signs that much progress can be made in improving our score. This district has made cuts in the past and are limited in reducing more without reducing programs and attempting to meet the unbelievable challenges contained in NCLB.

During the 2000-01 school year the District sold $12,500,000 worth of Working Cash Fund bonds to fund a 5 year renovation project on the high school. During each of those years expenses for renovations appearing in the Operations and Maintenance Fund and have been and will be paid for with cooresponding revenue transfers to the O & M Fund from the Working Cash Fund. Since the Expenditure to Revenue Ratio Indicator excludes the Working Cash Fund and fund transfers, expenses for this type of project are recorded but the revenues are not. For FY 2002, reported here, $5,455,907 in expenses for the renovations to the facility were included in the Operations and Maintenance figures but the transfer from Working Cash for the same amount to pay for those renovations that is reflected in the District's Annual Financial Report FY2002 is not included as revenue to offset that expense. Consequently the District ratio for this indicator was incorrectly listed as 1.14. It should have been 1.05. The impact of this inaccuracy is that the District should have received an overall score of 3.55 instead of 3.2.

Over eleven million dollars in construction bonds were issued in Fiscal Year 2002. This impacted the district's remaining debt margin (one of the factors which comprises the ISBE financial profile score). The Board of Education and administration were notified in September, 2001, by the state's Capital Development Board, that the district is eligible for $5,758 million in state funds for this construction project. To date, the state has not yet released these critical funds. Late payments by the state for categorical reimbursement for eligible transportation and special education expenses also negatively affected Fiscal Year 2002 revenues. As of June 30, 2002, over $275,000 was vouchered by ISBE as due and payable to the district but not remitted on time. Indeed, the weak economy has created financial problems at the state level which are now impacting local schools reliant on promised state financial support. The district will continue to monitor expenditures while the state seeks an answer to its revenue shortfalls. The district remains confident that ultimately the construction project will achieve greater efficiency regarding lighting, heating and maintenance costs. Additionally, more evenly distributed class size in the elementary buildings should also be achievable with the reconfigured early childhood learning center and two elementary buildings. The district is committed to continuing to offer a quality educational program within the constraints imposed by property tax caps and weakened state support. The Board of Education recently adopted a resolution in favor of the Educational Funding Advisory Board (EFAB) plan for better and more equitable funding of schools.

Health benefit costs increased significantly. Two new classrooms were constructed at Hester Junior High School. A new comprehensive reading program for K-8 was purchased. East School, which had previously been leased, was reopened to house the LASEC early childhood special education program. The district sold fire prevention and life safety bonds to fund life safety improvements in the school district. Declining enrollment, coupled with questionable state and federal revenue sources create a financial picture difficult to project.

This initiative added staff and caused an increased budget deficit in the educational fund. The inability of the State to meet their financial obligations caused late payments to the district which were beyond the scope of the 2001-2002 fiscal year. This report reflects the financial position of the District and places a label on the District that is partially controlled by the receipt of the revenues. Late payments and pro-rated payments have caused the Freeport School District and many other Illinois School Districts to have significant cash flow problems. Freeport School District made a capital purchase of $500,000 for a transportation complex. This expense did not have an increase in balancing revenue, thus reflected a $500,000 deficit in the O&M Fund.

The more recent phenomenon of the significant increase in property tax refunds will result in an additional financial burden to the school district. This fiscal year to date, District 67 has lost $252,000 in property tax refunds. The majority of those refunds, $192,000, results from commercial business refunds from tax years 1995 and 1996. Beginning in 1998 through 2001, Property Tax Appeals Board (PTAB) objections may cause the District to lose an additional $1.01 million. There is no mechanism at this time to recover this revenue. The PTAB process has provided commercial and industrial property owners with an incentive to increase the volume of property assessment appeals. In summary, because of legislation that encourages commercial and industrial property owners to file assessment appeals, a greater financial burden is placed both on residential property owners as property tax payers and the school district as a taxing body.

The passage of this referendum will infuse approximately $2.5 million additional tax dollars into the Education Fund. The last referendum was in 1989. Since then the district has also been placed under Tax Caps. The Board of Education understands the need to increase revenues and decrease expenditures in order to work towards a balanced budget. Over the past few years with the failure of other referendum questions, the district has reduced expenditures by approximately $4 million and has also made further reductions for the FY04 budget year. The amount listed for Long Term Debt also includes items that have been classified as ""Other Long Term Debt"". These items should not lower the amount of the Legal Debt Margin of the district, as they are not part of any bond indebtedness. They pertain to compensated balances, accreted interest, and a possible arbitrage rebate according to the District's audit firm, BDO Seidman. The removal of these items would increase the percentage remaining of the Legal Debt Margin to 31%. However, this change will not effect the overall classification of the district as reported by the ISBE Financial Profile System. We will not try to vote a referendum in 2003. Maybe in 2004.

Future funding of this program is critical to the future financial solvency of this district. Due to the fact that we have built two (2) new buildings and renovated two (2) others, our long-term debt has caused us to be placed on the financial early warning list.

The 2002 School District Financial Profile is misleading because the only reason the Hononegah CHSD 207 received a higher score was due to the fact that it borrowed 3.5 million dollars in tax anticipation warrants which showed on the district's financial records as increased revenue for the year and lead to a higher cash balance and increased days of available cash.

They responded affirmatively and we are waiting for the State of Illinois to release the Construction Grant money so that we can break ground on construction. Prior to the 2001-2002 fiscal year, the district was without long-term debt. The 2001-2002 budget projection indicated that expenditures would grow beyond revenue for the first time in over five years. This was due almost entirely to an increase in staffing to match the needs of a growing enrollment. The community approved a second referendum for a $.60 increase in the education fund tax rate. We believe the districts response to its environment was both appropriate and timely and much more positive than the 2.80 profile would lead one to believe. A decrease in EAV is anticipated due to an onslaught of property tax appeal board cases coming from Cook County Commercial property taxpayers. Tax appeals as early as 1993-1996 have resulted in an unanticipated 12% reduction in 2001 tax collections. Notice of appeal was never required by law to be given to the affected taxing bodies, nor is there any relief provided under the current tax cap structure.

This projection assumes that the District will receive 24 General State Aid payments. There is much talk about school districts not receiving two General State Aid payments during this fiscal year. A loss of two General State Aid payments would mean an additional $265,000 loss to the District. This would be absolutely disastrous. At the present rate, we will expend all of our reserves during the 2004-2005 school year with limited capacity to raise additional revenue. The Board has instituted several cost controlling measures that reduced deficit spending by over $300,000 per year. The cost controlling measures are: Eliminated an administrative position Eliminated 5 certified positions Eliminated 4 non certified positions Closed an elementary school Reduced travel, supply and equipment budgets Many financial concerns exist for the 2003-2004 school year. There are concerns about possible reductions in State revenue and increases in maintenance costs, general personnel costs, insurance costs and special education costs. Unit #9 is heavily reliant on General State aid to meet operational expenses. Therefore, when the State cuts or freezes funding to schools it has a dramatic effect on our school district. To date, we have no solid information about what will happen with State funding, but the outlook appears to be bleak. Moreover, the Board has fully utilized the local tax levy by taxing at the maximum rates. The Board has also substantially increased the Tort Fund revenue to pay salaries for employees who are involved in risk management activities. This practice has increased the overall tax rate that our community is assessed. The Board is also extremely sensitive to the economic woes in our area. The unemployment rate in Watseka is approaching double digits as a number of factories have shut their doors over the past few months. This, in addition to a depressed farm economy, limits our community's ability to support schools with their tax dollars.

The rev/exp ratio looks bad even though there are invested dollars earmarked for the expense. Due to sudden enrollment growth in the 90's the district found itself facing serious overcrowding at a number of grade levels. In 1995, enrollment at some grade levels was in excess of 35 students per teacher, with second grade finishing the school year with one teacher for 41 students. Small storage closets were remodeled to provide space for counseling and for speech therapy services, but there were no rooms available for splitting classes. Restroom facilities were woefully insufficient to handle the student numbers enrolled at the time. In 1995, without foreknowledge that state construction funds would eventually become available and with the best interest of students in mind, the Board of Education felt it had no realistic alternative but to acquire two temporary classroom buildings, each with two classrooms. Restrooms were also built to accommodate increasing enrollment. Reserves were used to construct restroom facilities at a cost of $125,000. Likewise, the temporary classroom buildings were constructed through five year leave-purchase agreements, and the payments were made from district reserves at a cost of $250,000. Those buildings have now been incorporated into the school's new facility which was funded largely by a state construction grant. The Board of Education feels it noteworthy that the district has, since 1995, added three classroom teachers to reduce class sizes and has added a fulltime special education teacher and a half-time special education teacher to address the requirements of special needs students. The district has thus far been able to provide these services using local tax dollars (which are capped) and state and federal aid. It is the feeling of the Board of Education that the information contained in this profile should be analyzed in light of the fact that the district started out with reserves totaling $378.000 (June 30, 1994), has since that time built and staffed classrooms (regular and special education) in order to meet basic educational and legal needs and yet it finished the FY02 fiscal year (as indicated on the profile) with $200,000 remaining in reserves.

This caused a drastic change in our Expenditure to Revenue ratio. The difference between District 158's Financial profile designation for FY01 (financial review) and District 158's Financial profile as indicated on this preliminary report (financial watch) is not a true indicator of District 158's financial status. District 158 charges against the budget all salaries in the year they are earned. Some districts charge salaries only as they are paid. If we used an accrual accounting system we would charge the salaries as expenses and show an asset titled Prepaid Salaries. This is what actually happened. Salaries are paid in one fiscal year but checks are not issued until July and August in the next fiscal year. This diminished the cash on hand according to the financial records, yet the cash is still in the bank. This amounts to $970,173.56 for fiscal year 01/02.

On January 9, 2003 all districts received a sample profile of the financial condition of the district based upon the school's Annual Financial Report for 2000-2001. Our district profile was 3.9 out of a 4.0 and we received Financial Recognition. On February 6, 2003 we received the proposed profile for our district using data from the 2001-2002 Annual Financial Report. Because our district had saved money and established a reserve to prepare for a building project and then expended these reserves this past year, the district was penalized using the formula. The School Accounting System does not allow for the flexible transferring of funds. The district had earmarked approximately $2.5 million in reserve money in the Ed Fund for the building project. All expenditures for the building project are required to come out of the Site and Construction Fund. The district is not allowed to move the money from one fund to another, but must deficit spend and deposit state aide payments into the Site and Construction Fund. The district is not allowed to move the money from one fund to another, but must deficit spend and deposit state aide payments into the Site and Construction Fund. Because of the deficit spending, we were rated a ""1"" in ""expenditures to revenue"" because of the building project and utilization of reserves. The Total Profile for the last year was 2.75 and placed us on an early warning list - which does not seem valid since the district has over $1.5 million remaining in the Ed Fund and $836,000 in the Working Cash Fund. I feel the profile should be determined on an average of the past three years to get a more accurate picture for the district. In summary, I do not feel this profile provides a valid representation of our district's assets.

In the 1980's the district was placed on the State's Financial Watch list as second year tax anticipation warrants were used to meet payroll and other financial obligations. In the early 1990's the district passed a $0.40 tax rate increase in the Education Fund. It was at this time that the farmland assessment and residential property assessments began to rise. The rise in residential property also brought an influx of students, which translated into additional State Aid. The Lincoln Community High School Board of Education also provided investment capital for the district through the sale of working cash bonds. The state was set to build the district's financial future through prudent fiscal management and solid investment opportunities. In 1997-98 a new funding formula was adopted by the legislature to calculate General State Aid. The new formula guaranteed school districts that they would not receive fewer State Aid dollars than they had previously received in 1997. This provision was called Hold Harmless. One of the objectives of the new Formula was to increase the Formula's Foundation Level each year until the Hold Harmless provision was no longer necessary, which has not occurred. Since the new Formula's inception LCHS has not received additional State Aid support. Instead, the district has been receiving Hold Harmless monies. In Fiscal Year 2002 Lincoln Community High School District #404 received $271,865 in Hold Harmless Aid. In Fiscal Year 2003 the amount of Hold Harmless Aid climbed to $477,921. This change in dependency on Hold Harmless is attributed to a declining student population and an increase in Equalized Assessed Value in the district. For the part four years the Illinois Legislature and the Illinois State Board of Education have discussed the probability of eliminating the Hold Harmless provision from the Funding Formula. Should this discussion become a reality then Lincoln Community High School's current fiscal stability will crumble.

This is because a district's cash balance changes daily with a continuous flow of revenue and expenses. Therefore, a certain point-in-time must be determined. In Illinois, that point-in-time is June 30. The establishment of any common date across Illinois is somewhat problematic in that different counties receive major tax deposits at different times of the year. Cook County districts receive a semi-annual tax deposit in October, while DuPage County districts receive a semi-annual tax deposit in June. One who analyzes a financial profile needs to understand this, as the financial health of a school district in DuPage County may appear healthier than school districts in other counties. Since Maercker District 60 does, in fact, receive major tax deposits each June, its financial health appears rosier than it may be when making statewide comparisons.

Management of local (89%), state (8%) and federal (3%) funds at a ""break-even"" level has not had a negative impact on quality education at our local level. The following factors relate to the financial situation at Morris Elementary: 1) The expenditures of the district are increasing at a higher rate than the equalized assessed valuation of the district. 2) The $.92 education fund tax rate is among the lowest in the state. The revenue that is generated in the education fund is well below what is necessary to educate the number of students that attend district schools. As a result, the district issued Working Cash Bonds in order to meet annual expenses. 3) The district is in the process of repaying $25,600,000 of building bonds that were approved by the district voters for the construction of a new elementary school. The bonds will be paid in full during the 2018-19 school year.

Numerous expenses were incurred during the final phase of construction and moving into the new facility, which is the primary reason the expenditure to revenue ratio was greater than 1 for FY02. These were planned expenses for which money had been saved. Because the reorganization expenses were included in FY02, the expenditures were inflated to $15,147,886. With the exception of summer projects completed in FY03, the expenditures will be back to a more realistic number for FY03 ($12,395,652). The School Board of Education and Administration are working diligently to operate within a balanced budget.

When a school district is heavily reliant on State Aid, regardless of whether that is caused by lack of local wealth or tax base, any manipulation of the level of State Aid has immediate and direct consequences to that district. Schools that are reliant on State Aid to meet their daily obligations are constantly challenged to maintain financial integrity. Many of the challenges we face stem from delays, prorated dollars, and/or missed payments altogether. The Mulberry Grove Community Unit Schools have been extremely diligent in the planning and implementation of the District's budget. There is no question that every effort is being made to wisely spend the limited resources that we have available to fund our educational programs. The community has supported a substantial levy, yet as you are well aware we are heavily reliant on State Aid to finance our total program. The Mulberry Grove Schools are facing the very same problems as so many others are faced with throughout our State. We are faced with the increasing pressure of financial, statutory, litigated, and otherwise mandated obligations at both the State and Federal levels. At the very same time, we are expected to deal with decreasing revenues and other resources to meet these obligations. It should be recognized that the biggest problem this district faces is one of cash flow, not over spending. Many measures have been put in place to address our local financial concerns. A great amount of daily attention and energy is spent in doing our very best in providing a quality education for our students. The fact is we are heavily reliant on State Aid in order to meet our financial obligations. The fact that the State itself has not met its obligations by funding mandates fully, and providing revenues in a timely manner that are not prorated has complicated matters significantly. There is no doubt that since we are so reliant on State Aid that fluctuations and arbitrary manipulations of financial formulas certainly affect our local financial picture dramatically. Regardless of what is or is not done to help with this situation, we will continue to serve the students and members of this community to the very best of our ability.

This means that the ISBE will be monitoring our school district closely and offering proactive technical assistance. Based on the information from ISBE management, there will be a large number of school districts on the state watch list. The ISBE estimates that 85% of school districts will be deficit spending by the end of this fiscal year. Based on conversation with other local school district administrators, our district is not alone in our financial woes. We project that the district's education fund could have a deficit fund balance of 1 million dollars by the end of the fiscal year. If the district continues to experience expenditures as we have in the past, we could reach a $5 million deficit by FY2005. Many factors have contributed to our school district's financial condition. Decreases in general state aid revenues ($382,000 decrease this year - could be more if 23rd and 24th State Aid payments are prorated or received late, as predicted) due to declining enrollment and a freeze in the funding foundation level, as well as proration of categorical grants by as much as 85% (i.e.. Special education and transportation) have had a large impact on district revenues. The district has also felt the effect of tax caps, which have limited the amount of property insurance premiums, which have nearly doubled, increasing costs by $150,000. Personnel costs have increased substantially due to significant salary increases over the past three years, although average salaries for teachers and administrators continue to fall below the state average. Personnel costs increased by over $300,000 in FY03. The State of Illinois is potentially faced with a $5 billion deficit. The district would like to attempt to cut 1/2 million dollars from our budget next year to help alleviate the situation. It appears that it could be at least 18 months before school districts get any relief through proposed income tax increases or other funding. Future considerations and concerns for our school district will be further decreases in state aid, tax caps, increased cost of health insurance, workman's compensation and property insurance and contract negotiations, variables which could cost the district an undeterminable amount of money. At present, the financial forecast for the State as well as the financial position of the district, in our opinion, creates the following conclusions: One way for the district to address our financial concerns will be through attrition  Thursday, May 15, 2003  Page 55 of 83   District Name Max  FBRR (1.4)  EXRV (1.4)  DCOH (0.4)  STB (0.4)  LTD (0.4)  Score (4.0)  Designation  District Comments created by employee retirements district wide.

School Board undertook some proactive cost-cutting measures. Namely, we instituted a ""retirementincentive buy-out"" program in which, among other things, the district offered eligible teachers to pay that respective teacher's ""2.2 upgrade"" PLUS a onetime bonus of a twenty percent (20%) check handed to them on the last day of instruction. As a result, some fourteen (14) veteran teachers opted for the incentives. Over the last four year, these fourteen people's buyout cost the district some $400,000.00 dollars in cash outlay. However, as this is my point, because of these retirements, the district has either absorbed or not replaced our of those fourtenn positions, thus saving about $200,000.00 dollars. Additionaly, of the other teaching positions that we did replace now -, we replace a teacher making $55,000.00 with a new fresh-out-ofschool teacher hired in at $25,000.00 - hence, saving the district about $30,000.00 per hire. If you do the math, the cumulative savings in ten years more than amount to $300,000.00 per teacher, with a net savings in ten years of almost three million dollars in salaries and benefits! NOW HERE IS WHERE THE RUB COMES IN! Under the state's new criteria, there ais a cumulative hit, a ""snowballing effect"" or a multiplying of factors in regards to finances. First of all, because of the buyout incentives, the outlay of $400,000.00 in bonuses caused our fund balances to dramatically decrease this affecting our Fund Balance to Revenue Ratio; secondly, since these monies are cash outlays, our Expenditures went upward markedly causing our Expenditures to Revenue Ratio to be affected; thirdly, then our Days Cash on Hand ratio is lowered. Finanlly, our Long-Term Debt Margin is caused by the fact that we built a brand new five and one-half million dollar ($5,500,000.00) K-8 building (at the encouragement of the state, I might add) replacing a nearly 100 year old structure! SO! - We are exasperated! Moreover, some of out funding from the state (transportation) has been delayed by almost three months! In sum, I am a great believer in accountability and good stewardship. However, punishing us with the lowest classification label of Financial Watch belies the point that the criteria are too planar and myopic in the sense of merely looking at the numbers and not as to the HOW'S AND WHY'S of the numbers!

During the years from 1982-1993, when we were unsuccessful in passing our referendum and with the decline in State Aid, our district cut programs, cut staff and closed two buildings in an attempt to stay financially solvent. With the passage of the referendum in 1993, it appeared that our district's financial troubles were a thing of the past. Little did we realize however, that tax caps were on their way and would have a major negative impact on the financial health of our district. Because of the tax cap, District 117 has lost over six million dollars in local revenue. We have never fully accessed our approved .90 increase. This is not fair. Our local voters gave us authority in 1993 to raise our educational tax rate. This is local control at its best. However, because of the imposition of the tax caps, my district is starting to see an erosion of our financial base and expenditures, surpassing our revenues. We have very few alternatives if we intend to maintain our programs. This month (Feb. 03) will focus on borrowing $8,665,000 in working cash bonds to help balance the budget. What does the State expect us to do when our borrowed money is gone? Although the State has made verbal commitment to increase educational funding, we have not seen increases in District 117. What we have seen are additional limitations such as the imposition of administration tax caps in the 2000/01 budget which have limited expenses in legislatively designed accounts to 5% increases and restricted grants covering only a portion of the costs for new programs. Tax caps for Cook County and limited State Aid have also made us apprehensive of promises of any increases in State funding of education. In addition, due to tax limitation laws, we are not able to access the increased EAV. What can the State do to help us? It is simple: Remove the tax cap immediately Allow districts to fully access increase in EAV Remove all utility expenses from the tax cap Remove life safety from under the tax cap Support EFAB's recommendations  NORTH SHORE SD 112 NORTH WAMAC SCHOOL DISTRICT 186 NORTH WAYNE C U SCHOOL DIST 200 NORTHBROOK ELEM SCHOOL DIST 27  1.40 1.05 1.40 1.40  1.40 0.70 1.05 1.05  0.40 0.20 0.40 0.40  0.40 0.40 0.40 0.40  0.30 0.30 0.40 0.40  3.90 2.65 3.65 3.65  Financial Recognition Financial Early Warning Financial Recognition Financial Recognition  Thursday, May 15, 2003  Page 59 of 83   District Name Max NORTHBROOK SCHOOL DIST 28 NORTHBROOK/GLENVIEW SCH DIST 30 NORTHFIELD TWP HIGH SCH DIST 225 NORTHWEST C U SCH DISTRICT 175  FBRR (1.4) 1.40 1.40 1.40 1.40  EXRV (1.4) 1.05 0.70 0.70 1.05  DCOH (0.4) 0.40 0.20 0.40 0.20  STB (0.4) 0.40 0.40 0.40 0.40  LTD (0.4) 0.40 0.30 0.40 0.40  Score (4.0) 3.65 3.00 3.30 3.45  Designation Financial Recognition Financial Early Warning Financial Review Financial Review  District Comments  On April 1, 2003, the Northwest CUSD 175 and the Colchester CUSD 180 will vote on a referendum to consolidate.

Some transportation and special education payments were received after July 1, 2002, and did not show up on the books for FY02. State aid payments in recent years have failed to keep pace with increasing labor and heating costs.

This enrollment drop has had a major financial impact upon the General State aid that the district receives. As a result the district made cuts totaling $126,726 in the spring of 01, $150,000 in the spring of 02 and will make cuts of $220,000 in the spring of 03. Falling assessed value of the district plus the inability of ISBE (state) to pay the promised amount of general state aid will result in serious future financial problems.

Maintaining this status in the future is going to be extremely difficult for the following reasons: 1) Changes in the poverty count of the 2000 Census will decrease the District's state and federal funding levels. 2) Decrease in student enrollment 3) Eroding local tax base due to the T.I.F. District and State land purchases. 4) The State of Illinois prorating payments. The District receives 61% of funding from state sources. As long as state aid payments increase the economic outlook appears healthy. However, the District is experiencing a declining student enrollment and a significant decrease in the poverty count as determined by the 2000 census. Depending on the poverty count the District could face between a $142,606 to $285,166 decrease in general state aid alone. Hopefully a hold harmless provision would decrease these amounts. Currently the State of Illinois has prorated special education and transportation funding costing the District $29,672 in revenue. There remains a question on state aid payments. Currently, unless legislators agree to fully fund state aid payments the best-case scenario is an additional $14,285 loss of state aid due to prorating. There is the possibility of creative state financing by sliding state aid payments into the next fiscal year. District #50 like many other Southern Illinois school districts will be faced with the task trying to do more with less. The uncertainty of funding levels makes it extremely difficult to plan for the future educational programming of Pinckneyville District #50.

District 88 will be asking voters to approve an education fund rate increase in the April 1, 2003 election. The increased education fund rate is projected to stabilize the District's education fund for the foreseeable future. There are residential developments currently pending within the District's boundaries that will increase future student enrollment in all schools. A cooperative ""Growth Committee"" between the City of Plano and District 88 has been organized to develop a plan that will accommodate these anticipated increases in student enrollment. Pleasant Hill CUSD 3 will continue to maintain a prudent and fiscally conservative approach to our fiduciary responsibilities. Pleasant Hill expects little change in enrollment or equalized assessed valuation. We will examine possible reductions in personnel and non essential programs. Field trips and some extra-curricular activities will need to be reduced. An eighty-five cent Education Fund increase will be voted on this spring. April 1, 2003 We received $407,586 in early tax distributions for the Education, Operation & Maintenance, and Transportation Funds. We also received $7500 in early tax distributions for the Working Cash Fund. (See below for changes to the Profile sheet brought about by this early tax distribution information.) These early tax distributions were reflected in fund balances for 2000-2001 when they were actually an early payment of revenue for 2001-2002. We spent $98,486 from the Operation & Maintenance Fund that was from accumulated School Maintenance Grant; so, actual expenditures would be $4,403,427. (See below for changes to the Profile sheet brought by this expenditure from the accumulated School Maintenance Grant) Incorporating these changes into the first three areas of the Profile changed the Revenue, Expenditure, and Fund Balance TOTALS; but, the SCORE or VALUE figures of areas 1 and 3 were not effected. In area 2 the SCORE increased from a 2 to a 3 and the VALUE increased from .70 to 1.05. Thus, the TOTAL PROFILE SCORE would be 3.35 instead of 3.00.

We, therefore, will continue to control spending as well as possible while finding creative means to meet the educational needs of our students. The financial condition of the Prairie du Rocher School District has been very sound over the past several years. Although student enrollment is down from what it once was in the early 1990's, it has remained fairly constant for the past four years.

Revised 3/13/03 The fact that Prairie Hill Community Consolidated School District is now moving from ""Financial Review"" in the draft of FY01, to ""Financial Recognition"" for FY02, presents a false sense of positive revenue funds. Moving from an area that projects ""potential downward trends"" to the high rating of ""financial strength"" particularly when the fund balances reflect early local taxes, which show the financial stability of our district. Local officials look as if they are ""crying wolf"" when difficult decisions are being made to reduce local spending. Local constituents now will get the opinion we are not presenting a true picture of the financial state of the Prairie Hill Community Consolidated School District. All of these inconsistencies will affect this school district when we go to the district taxpayers for additional funds through referendum questions.

School District 209 has not been able to successfully pass an education fund tax rate increase in more than 33 years. In addition, tax adjustments made by the Cook County Assessor's office, have all worked to adversely impact District 209's ability to maintain revenues and expenditures in alignment.

District to district comparisons are complicated by financial reporting cash or accrual accounting methods. Queen Bee School District 16 reports on an accrual basis. Therefore, fund balances include $1,200,000 of accrued salaries (summer payrolls) and accrued compensated days thereby reducing fund balances. Adding those dollars back into the fund balances would increase the district score to 1.05 from .70 in area 1 and increasing the total profile score from 2.55 to 2.9 which would move this district from the ""Financial Watch"" determination to the ""Financial Early Warning"" determination. 2. Every school district in Illinois has a different ""story"" of financial status that is reflected in the new Financial Profile. While we believe this evaluation better reflects a district's financial picture than the ""Financial Watch"" formula did, it is important to understand that unique circumstances can cause elevated or exceptionally dismal scores. For example, a deficit budget could reflect a construction project as we did in FY2001 when funds from a lease purchase were deposited in our Operations and Maintenance Fund in FY2000 and the costs incurred in FY2001. This would skew both step 2 and step 3 of the profile. 3. Percent of long-term debt margin remaining: The district has no non-referendum bond ability remaining even though there is 46.4% debt margin remaining for the district. Legislative action could make these funds available for an emergency (i.e. life safety). This district currently has $6,000,000 of approved life safety amendments it is unable to proceed with until funds become available. At this time it is not feasible to request funds via referendum. Please see statement #4. 4. The district has an education fund tax rate referendum question on the April 1, 2003 ballot after the defeat of the November 2, 2002 referendum. Should it not be successful, the district is preparing to implement $1,5000,000 in staff salary and benefit reductions. The last successful referendum was in 1993.

This should bring in excess of $1,000,000 new dollars per year into the district. It should enable us to alleviate our deficit over the next two to more years. The District has existed for many years with a single administrator. As enrollment doubles in the next 3-5 years, an additional administrator will be necessary. This will increase the operating expense. It is hoped that increased EAV will offset the additional costs.

During the decade of the 1990's through 2002 the District was able to accumulate a reasonable fund balance in its operating funds. The healthy economy fueled appropriations to keep up with increased operational costs. Unfortunately, the economy has bottomed out. States are not able to provide appropriations to assist with increased operational costs. The District is feeling the impact of the economy through reduced revenues as interest rates plummet, grants are pro-rated to less than 100% and costs continue to rise. To meet this economic challenge, the District began reducing expenditures during the 2002-03 year. It will also minimize the loss of programming for students by utilizing part of the accumulated surplus. As the poor economic conditions continue, the District foresees that its ranking on the financial profile will diminish. Great care and thought will be given to determine the most appropriate means to provide learning opportunities to the students and providing value to our community while maintaining fiscal responsibility. These decisions are difficult but necessary until the economy turns and the State is able to provide adequate assistance to meet the educational needs of the students.

Due to business claiming bankruptcy and another proposing tax evaluation we expect a drop in our tax base. We are seeking an Education Fund tax rate increase of $.59 in the February 25, 2003 consolidated primary election and also have it on the April 1, 2003 consolidated general election should it fail on February 25, 2003. This tax increase is expected to increase revenues by $1.5 million in the Education Fund.

First, the State of Illinois was unable to meet its obligations in a timely manner. Our cash-basis budget was dependant upon receiving our fourth quarter categorical payments by June 30, 2002. This did not occur. Also, the tax bills for Lake County went out late, further eroding our revenue collections for FY02. Had these two separate events not occurred, our revenue would have been greater than our expenses and we would have had more cash on hand at year-end. This would have raised Wauconda CUSD 118's profile to the Financial Review category. Given that this assessment system is new, it should be noted that it could be unfairly influenced by uncontrollable acts from outside parties, especially for districts like ours who operate under a cash-basis accounting system.

We used accumulated fund balances (savings) to build a new Center for the Arts at our junior high. This project was saved for and built without having to go to a referendum. Revised 3/12/03 During the period of time being considered, the Board of Education built a new Center for the Arts and a new Early Childhood/Administrative Center. The total cost of these one time expenditures was $7.5 million. The Board entered into a lease-purchase agreement and received $2.5 million which was not recognized as revenue in the State Board of Education's formulas. These projects were planned for and built utilizing fund balances without a referendum or tax rate increase.

In addition, cash flow problems are occurring due to the lateness of categorical payments from the Illinois comptroller due to the State's financial problems. District 200 is committed to operating within its means and reductions of $1.25 million were made to the 2002-2003 operating budgets and $2.2 million are being considered for 2003-2004. The funding methods of education in Illinois are outdated, inconsistent, unreliable, inequitable for students and relies too heavily on local property taxes. The educational funding system is broken and needs to be repaired. Statesmanship and political leadership in Springfield will be necessary to make the necessary changes in the way education if funded in Illinois The EAV is expected to increase at a very low rate of 2.44%, based on historical data. This rate increase will not keep up with the costs of operating the school district. The annual enrollment is increasing at a minimal rate also. These two contributing factors, along with the State Aid formula will have detrimental effects on the district District #115 passed Education Fund and Building Fund referendums in the spring of 2002 in an effort to address our increased enrollment due to growth. Our Equalized Assessed Valuation is also increasing due to this growth. We had to increase our debt service to build the new buildings to house the additional students. We also have to hire additional staff to address increases in enrollment, further reducing our Education Fund balance.

The City of Zion was the home for a CommonWealth Edison nuclear power plant; this plant closed in 1997. After CommonWealth Edison made the decision to permanently close the plant in 1998 the affected taxing bodies worked with CommonWealth Edison to draft an Equalized Assessed Value (EAV) rampdown agreement. This ramp-down agreement, which was finalized in December 2000, decreased the EAV of the plant from $171,000,000 in tax year 199 to $10,000,000 in tax year 2005. This agreement resulted in a loss of 60% of our district's EAV, which directly affects the tax revenues of all funds. The District has taken steps to improve the financial health of the district, including a community-supported $.60 education fund tax rate increase in March 2002. While the education fund tax rate increase was an important step, it is necessary for the district to take further steps to ensure the financial solvency of the district.

It was the first referendum passed in 34 years.  Student enrollment increases resulted in consideration, by a significant number of community representatives, of the need to build a new school. The recommendation to build was substantiated by a successful referendum granting permission to build and to sell bonds for that purpose. Bourbonnais ranks fourth on the most recent priority ranking from the CDB for school construction funds. Significant repairs and associated costs are continuing for the other five Bourbonnais schools.

The ISBE method of calculating the ""Expenditure to Revenue Ratio"" does not accurately convey the actual totals which are total revenues of $10,209,323 (not $9,826,286) and expenditures of $9,901,365, resulting in a ratio of .97 not 1.01.

The reflections are not at all pleasant. As in many communities throughout the state, Centralia is experiencing a profound economic downturn. It is a matter of record that the levels of unemployment and poverty within this area are among the highest in the state. As a result, our schools must strive continually to reverse the effects of such poverty upon student learning. It is critical that our schools and the other schools with significant populations of low-income students be able to provide a high quality education through such methods as minimizing class size, maintaining optimum staffing levels, attracting and retaining highly qualified staff, providing adequate health and counseling services, sustaining education enrichment programs, and adequately meeting the education service requirements of special needs students. For most children of poverty, a quality education will be the only means through which they can realize a productive and stable life in adulthood. As is the case in many down-state districts, our local revenue sources are not adequate to provide the level of services needed by our students. These programs can only be realized and sustained through adequate funding from state and federal sources. Unfortunately, Centralia City Schools District #135 is scheduled to receive over $300,000 less in state aid for the 20022003 school year than it did for 2001-2002. Due to this decline in state funding and to an increase in operational expenses, our district has a current year deficit budgeted in excess of ($700,000 for 2002-2003). On Friday, February 7th, another crippling economic blow was dealt to our district when the 2000 Census Preliminary Data arrived. Incredibly, the 2000 census indicates that the number of students at poverty level within our district has decreased from 564 in 1990 to 393 in 2000. Our verifiable data supported by the Department of Human Services (DHS) and evidenced by the number of kids who are qualified for free or reduced means has steadily increased over the past 10 years. The fact that this supposed 30% decrease in the census poverty level has occurred within the county with the highest level of unemployment in the state makes the accuracy of census data all the more suspect. The 2000 census data for poverty levels clearly is not representative of the real conditions that exist in Centralia and many other communities. However, the funding inequities brought by this data will impact many schools in a most negative manner over the next ten years if it is allowed to stand. Centralia City Schools District #135 has worked long and hard to develop a top rated district, and we have accomplished this goal with expenditures below the average cost per student in Illinois and in the United States. We  Thursday, May 15, 2003  Page 4 of 83   District Name Max  FBRR (1.4)  EXRV (1.4)  DCOH (0.4)  STB (0.4)  LTD (0.4)  Score (4.0)  Designation  District Comments are proud that two of our schools were named recently as Golden Spike schools. We have an efficient and successful school district. Unfortunately, the opportunities we provide our students will be at-risk if additional revenue is not provided. While reserves have allowed District #135 to continue without interruption for the current year, it is inevitable that serious reductions in expenditures will have to occur if adequate state funding is not forthcoming in the future. We anticipate that, as the effect of the 2000 census reduces our already reduced state aid, we will have a zero fund balance in the education fund within the coming year. Obviously the financial profile of Centralia #135 will take a steep nose dive if this occurs. Unless adequate funding is provided in the very near future, I see the deterioration of the district's educational services and financial standing as forgone conclusions. Nothing is more important than education. A well educated populace pays more taxes and lower costs for government in terms of welfare, containment, and services. An investment in education pays off more than any investment you can make. Please continue to lend your influence to securing adequate financing for the schools of Illinois. Thank you for your support of our school district and for any assistance that you can lend in this issue of critical importance.

The District committed deficit spending, depending on operating funds and existing fund balances, to meet debt retirement obligations. The District meets its Alternate Revenue Bond debt retirement obligation by transferring interest from the Education, Operations and Maintenance, and Working Cash Funds to the Bond & Interest Fund. The principal and interest obligation is expensed via the Bond & Interest Fund. This expense (approximately $3.3 million annually) is not included in the Expenditure to Revenue Ratio. If this expense were included the Expenditures to Revenue Ratio, the District would score 2 in this category for fiscal year 2001/02. Over the past three years, District 59 has lost over $8 million in anticipated revenue to pay property tax refunds issued through Cook County. The loss of property taxes due to refunds is causing the District to implement expenditure reductions and to seek revenue alternatives, such as a debt service extension base.

The Board is also pleased with the designation of financial recognition as delineated by the new Profile system as it bears out the Board's dedication to providing a quality and challenging educational environment for the students of Deerfield, Highland Park and Riverwoods while maintaining a watchful eye on the bottom line. However, the Board does need to draw attention to the distinction between itself and other districts that report results of operations to the Illinois State Board of Education on the modified accrual basis of accounting. Deerfield School District 109 reports the results of its operations to the Illinois State Board of Education on the cash basis of accounting. In Lake County, approximately 49% of an annual tax levy is distributed to school districts prior to July 1, the start of their fiscal years. Deerfield School District 109 properly reports these receipts as current year revenue in the income statement per the cash basis of accounting, while modified accrual basis of accounting districts report these receipts as deferred revenue, a liability on the balance sheet. Since approximately 80% of Deerfield School District 109's total revenue are generated by property tax collections, this particular item has found a profound effect on the district's FAAS ratio. This difference can be illustrated by utilizing District 109's information from the 2001-2002 Annual Financial Report. As reported under the new School District Financial Profile system, District 109's FAAS ratio is calculated at .60. This ratio calculation provides the district with a score of 4, which is then weighted by 35%, the highest weight of the five categories that comprise the new Profile system. However, by using a crude calculation that removes the early tax collections from the district's FAAS score to 3, which when weighted by 35% and added to the other four categories, produces a total score of 3.55, on the cusp of the financial review designation and not as strong an indicator of financial strength as depicted by the 3.90 score achieved when using the FAAS score generated using the cash basis of accounting. The Board of Education sincerely hopes that the Illinois State Board of Education continues working towards a rating system that provides a fair comparison of financial health for Illinois School Districts, regardless of the basis of accounting that is utilized in their reporting methodology.

This ISBE Financial Profile is a start in the accumulation of information needed in determining a school district's financial health. With additional financial information and modifications to the Financial Profile, this model will be a helpful tool in determining the financial conditions of school districts. Downers Grove Grade School District 58 has a total score of 3.55 for FY02, which indicated that the district is in the highest category or the ""Financial Recognition Designation"" category. Yet this score does not reflect the financial challenges that the District faces today. The expected budget shortfall for FY03 is over $700,000 and this deficit is expected to increase to over $1.3 million in FY04. The District does not have adequate funding for the implementation of our Facility Plan. Resources necessary for the continuation of the Technology Plan after FY06 are non-existent.

In the 1980's the district was placed on the State's Financial Watch list as second year tax anticipation warrants were used to meet payroll and other financial obligations. In the early 1990's the district passed a $0.40 tax rate increase in the Education Fund. It was at this time that the farmland assessment and residential property assessments began to rise. The rise in residential property also brought an influx of students, which translated into additional State Aid. The Lincoln Community High School Board of Education also provided investment capital for the district through the sale of working cash bonds. The state was set to build the district's financial future through prudent fiscal management and solid investment opportunities. In 1997-98 a new funding formula was adopted by the legislature to calculate General State Aid. The new formula guaranteed school districts that they would not receive fewer State Aid dollars than they had previously received in 1997. This provision was called Hold Harmless. One of the objectives of the new Formula was to increase the Formula's Foundation Level each year until the Hold Harmless provision was no longer necessary, which has not occurred. Since the new Formula's inception LCHS has not received additional State Aid support. Instead, the district has been receiving Hold Harmless monies. In Fiscal Year 2002 Lincoln Community High School District #404 received $271,865 in Hold Harmless Aid. In Fiscal Year 2003 the amount of Hold Harmless Aid climbed to $477,921. This change in dependency on Hold Harmless is attributed to a declining student population and an increase in Equalized Assessed Value in the district. For the part four years the Illinois Legislature and the Illinois State Board of Education have discussed the probability of eliminating the Hold Harmless provision from the Funding Formula. Should this discussion become a reality then Lincoln Community High School's current fiscal stability will crumble.

Maintaining this status in the future is going to be extremely difficult for the following reasons: 1) Changes in the poverty count of the 2000 Census will decrease the District's state and federal funding levels. 2) Decrease in student enrollment 3) Eroding local tax base due to the T.I.F. District and State land purchases. 4) The State of Illinois prorating payments. The District receives 61% of funding from state sources. As long as state aid payments increase the economic outlook appears healthy. However, the District is experiencing a declining student enrollment and a significant decrease in the poverty count as determined by the 2000 census. Depending on the poverty count the District could face between a $142,606 to $285,166 decrease in general state aid alone. Hopefully a hold harmless provision would decrease these amounts. Currently the State of Illinois has prorated special education and transportation funding costing the District $29,672 in revenue. There remains a question on state aid payments. Currently, unless legislators agree to fully fund state aid payments the best-case scenario is an additional $14,285 loss of state aid due to prorating. There is the possibility of creative state financing by sliding state aid payments into the next fiscal year. District #50 like many other Southern Illinois school districts will be faced with the task trying to do more with less. The uncertainty of funding levels makes it extremely difficult to plan for the future educational programming of Pinckneyville District #50.

Revised 3/13/03 The fact that Prairie Hill Community Consolidated School District is now moving from ""Financial Review"" in the draft of FY01, to ""Financial Recognition"" for FY02, presents a false sense of positive revenue funds. Moving from an area that projects ""potential downward trends"" to the high rating of ""financial strength"" particularly when the fund balances reflect early local taxes, which show the financial stability of our district. Local officials look as if they are ""crying wolf"" when difficult decisions are being made to reduce local spending. Local constituents now will get the opinion we are not presenting a true picture of the financial state of the Prairie Hill Community Consolidated School District. All of these inconsistencies will affect this school district when we go to the district taxpayers for additional funds through referendum questions.

During the decade of the 1990's through 2002 the District was able to accumulate a reasonable fund balance in its operating funds. The healthy economy fueled appropriations to keep up with increased operational costs. Unfortunately, the economy has bottomed out. States are not able to provide appropriations to assist with increased operational costs. The District is feeling the impact of the economy through reduced revenues as interest rates plummet, grants are pro-rated to less than 100% and costs continue to rise. To meet this economic challenge, the District began reducing expenditures during the 2002-03 year. It will also minimize the loss of programming for students by utilizing part of the accumulated surplus. As the poor economic conditions continue, the District foresees that its ranking on the financial profile will diminish. Great care and thought will be given to determine the most appropriate means to provide learning opportunities to the students and providing value to our community while maintaining fiscal responsibility. These decisions are difficult but necessary until the economy turns and the State is able to provide adequate assistance to meet the educational needs of the students.

The City of Zion was the home for a CommonWealth Edison nuclear power plant; this plant closed in 1997. After CommonWealth Edison made the decision to permanently close the plant in 1998 the affected taxing bodies worked with CommonWealth Edison to draft an Equalized Assessed Value (EAV) rampdown agreement. This ramp-down agreement, which was finalized in December 2000, decreased the EAV of the plant from $171,000,000 in tax year 199 to $10,000,000 in tax year 2005. This agreement resulted in a loss of 60% of our district's EAV, which directly affects the tax revenues of all funds. The District has taken steps to improve the financial health of the district, including a community-supported $.60 education fund tax rate increase in March 2002. While the education fund tax rate increase was an important step, it is necessary for the district to take further steps to ensure the financial solvency of the district.

Consequently, the lateness of the GSA payment and the addition of the one-time expense, although not to reoccur in FY03, caused DeSoto District 86 to drop one category in the FY02 financial profile.

If these payments had been received on time, District Fund Balances would have increased, thereby increasing the profile score for 1, 2 and 3. The Expenditure to Revenue Ratio Indicator misrepresents the District's financial condition. During the 2000-01 school year the District sold $12,500,000 worth of Working Cash Fund bonds to fund a 5 year renovation project on the high school. During each of those years expenses for renovations appearing in the Operations and Maintenance Fund and have been and will be paid for with cooresponding revenue transfers to the O & M Fund from the Working Cash Fund. Since the Expenditure to Revenue Ratio Indicator excludes the Working Cash Fund and fund transfers, expenses for this type of project are recorded but the revenues are not. For FY 2002, reported here, $5,455,907 in expenses for the renovations to the facility were included in the Operations and Maintenance figures but the transfer from Working Cash for the same amount to pay for those renovations that is reflected in the District's Annual Financial Report FY2002 is not included as revenue to offset that expense. Consequently the District ratio for this indicator was incorrectly listed as 1.14. It should have been 1.05. The impact of this inaccuracy is that the District should have received an overall score of 3.55 instead of 3.2. This should have placed Evanston Township High School in the ""Financial Recognition"" category instead of the ""Financial Review"" category as listed in this document.

Over eleven million dollars in construction bonds were issued in Fiscal Year 2002. This impacted the district's remaining debt margin (one of the factors which comprises the ISBE financial profile score). The Board of Education and administration were notified in September, 2001, by the state's Capital Development Board, that the district is eligible for $5,758 million in state funds for this construction project. To date, the state has not yet released these critical funds. Late payments by the state for categorical reimbursement for eligible transportation and special education expenses also negatively affected Fiscal Year 2002 revenues. As of June 30, 2002, over $275,000 was vouchered by ISBE as due and payable to the district but not remitted on time. Indeed, the weak economy has created financial problems at the state level which are now impacting local schools reliant on promised state financial support. The district will continue to monitor expenditures while the state seeks an answer to its revenue shortfalls. The district remains confident that ultimately the construction project will achieve greater efficiency regarding lighting, heating and maintenance costs. Additionally, more evenly distributed class size in the elementary buildings should also be achievable with the reconfigured early childhood learning center and two elementary buildings. The district is committed to continuing to offer a quality educational program within the constraints imposed by property tax caps and weakened state support. The Board of Education recently adopted a resolution in favor of the Educational Funding Advisory Board (EFAB) plan for better and more equitable funding of schools.

The more recent phenomenon of the significant increase in property tax refunds will result in an additional financial burden to the school district. This fiscal year to date, District 67 has lost $252,000 in property tax refunds. The majority of those refunds, $192,000, results from commercial business refunds from tax years 1995 and 1996. Beginning in 1998 through 2001, Property Tax Appeals Board (PTAB) objections may cause the District to lose an additional $1.01 million. There is no mechanism at this time to recover this revenue. The PTAB process has provided commercial and industrial property owners with an incentive to increase the volume of property assessment appeals. In summary, because of legislation that encourages commercial and industrial property owners to file assessment appeals, a greater financial burden is placed both on residential property owners as property tax payers and the school district as a taxing body.

The 2002 School District Financial Profile is misleading because the only reason the Hononegah CHSD 207 received a higher score was due to the fact that it borrowed 3.5 million dollars in tax anticipation warrants which showed on the district's financial records as increased revenue for the year and lead to a higher cash balance and increased days of available cash. In reality the district is slowly increasing its deficit and now has needed to barrow funds in order to maintain all of its current programs.

This is because a district's cash balance changes daily with a continuous flow of revenue and expenses. Therefore, a certain point-in-time must be determined. In Illinois, that point-in-time is June 30. The establishment of any common date across Illinois is somewhat problematic in that different counties receive major tax deposits at different times of the year. Cook County districts receive a semi-annual tax deposit in October, while DuPage County districts receive a semi-annual tax deposit in June. One who analyzes a financial profile needs to understand this, as the financial health of a school district in DuPage County may appear healthier than school districts in other counties. Since Maercker District 60 does, in fact, receive major tax deposits each June, its financial health appears rosier than it may be when making statewide comparisons.

First, the State of Illinois delayed payments due to $153,779 until after July 1, 2002. This had a negative impact on both revenues received and the ending balance. Secondly, the report includes a one time expenditure of $765,176 in the operations and maintenance fund for construction of a building addition. Funding for this project came primarily from reorganization incentives received after the annexation of Ophir School District.

Building Maintenance Grant funds created surpluses in FY00 and 01 when the funds arrived. They added to a deficit in FY02 when some of the funds were expended. Some transportation and special education payments were received after July 1, 2002, and did not show up on the books for FY02. State aid payments in recent years have failed to keep pace with increasing labor and heating costs. The state continues to under fund special education mandates forcing schools to divert resources to pay for services required by legislature and the courts.

If these funds are depleted and/or the ratio of expenditures to revenues is low, the district would receive a lower score on the District Financial Profile. This is what happened with last year's (2001-02) Financial Profile. During the 2001-02 school year Aledo 201 School District's financial designation changed from ""Recognition"" with a score of 3.55 to a designation of ""Early Warning"" with a score of 2.75. ""Recognition"" is the highest of the four designations, the ""Review"" and ""Early Warning"" is next to the bottom designation called ""Watch"". The reasons that Aledo changed so much in a single year are: 1) During the 2001-02 school year, the district moved $1,050,000 from the Education Fund into the Building Fund to build a new junior high school. The district patrons voted on a March 21, 2000 bond referendum to approve this depletion of the reserves in the Education Fund to build a new junior high school. 2) Besides the money being moved from the Education Fund, the Interest on that money is also depleted from the Education Fund. In our case, that amounts to $24,626. 3) The Average Daily Attendance (ADA) of students dropped by 18.7 students from the previous year resulting in a loss of over $85,000 that we would have received if our numbers would have stayed the same. Even though the district did receive an increase of $39,961 in General State Aid, that amount did not come close to the over 3% increase in expenditures of a 7 million dollar budget. It certainly does not help schools that the legislature cannot seem to decide how much money a district is to receive until May or June. This puts the district in the position of having to negotiate the teachers and staff and subsequently to build the next year's budget without knowing the actual money they will receive. Further, if the state determines that is has no money and gives no increase to the General State Aid like it did this year (2002-03) then districts with decreasing populations actually receive less state aid than the previous year.

For FY02 our ranking dropped to Financial Watch List. The reason for the change can be accounted for in the scoring of the expenditure to revenue ratio. This is the only section of the five in which our scoring dropped from the previous year. In FY01 our score was a ""4"", in FY02 we dropped to a ""2"". The reason for the drop is attributed to nearly $8M of expenditures in the Operations & Maintenance Fund, which were construction related. We budgeted $5M for payout of construction work associated with a $52.5M project, which was only supported by a $25 referendum (and did not include equipment and furniture). A $7M State Construction Grant, operating funds and fund balances, offset the remaining $17.5M. Additionally, in FY02 we expended $3M for 36 portable classroom complexes at both of our high schools. In total we are doing $11M worth of work at our high schools (including portables), which is being paid for by an $11M Working Cash Bond Sale. The proceeds from this bond sale are not shown as revenue in FY02 even though the expenditures are included. While we still had a negative operating budget (not including the $11M), our ranking without the impact of construction would have only slipped to Financial Review not Financial Watch List.

Our school district alone will lose $33,000 next year in general state aid using the new census poverty count. The process used is a skewed and unrepresentative count of those who truly qualify as poverty level in mine and other school districts. In my opinion and others, an audited free and reduced lunch count is the only true way to determine poverty in a local school district. We are growing quicker than our ability to provide services. The tax cap is killing us! We also need the school construction grant to be brought back!

The inability of the State to meet their financial obligations caused late payments to the district which were beyond the scope of the 2001-2002 fiscal year. This report reflects the financial position of the District and places a label on the District that is partially controlled by the receipt of the revenues. Late payments and pro-rated payments have caused the Freeport School District and many other Illinois School Districts to have significant cash flow problems. Freeport School District made a capital purchase of $500,000 for a transportation complex. This expense did not have an increase in balancing revenue, thus reflected a $500,000 deficit in the O&M Fund.

The passage of this referendum will infuse approximately $2.5 million additional tax dollars into the Education Fund. The last referendum was in 1989. Since then the district has also been placed under Tax Caps. The Board of Education understands the need to increase revenues and decrease expenditures in order to work towards a balanced budget. Over the past few years with the failure of other referendum questions, the district has reduced expenditures by approximately $4 million and has also made further reductions for the FY04 budget year. The amount listed for Long Term Debt also includes items that have been classified as ""Other Long Term Debt"". These items should not lower the amount of the Legal Debt Margin of the district, as they are not part of any bond indebtedness. They pertain to compensated balances, accreted interest, and a possible arbitrage rebate according to the District's audit firm, BDO Seidman. The removal of these items would increase the percentage remaining of the Legal Debt Margin to 31%. However, this change will not effect the overall classification of the district as reported by the ISBE Financial Profile System. Due to the fact that we have built two (2) new buildings and renovated two (2) others, our long-term debt has caused us to be placed on the financial early warning list. The other cause is the cuts the state has made over the past two (2) years in our state aid, as well as, the untimely distribution of said funds. To put this district on the financial early warning list because of this state's shortcomings in funding I believe is outrageous.

They responded affirmatively and we are waiting for the State of Illinois to release the Construction Grant money so that we can break ground on construction. Prior to the 2001-2002 fiscal year, the district was without long-term debt. The 2001-2002 budget projection indicated that expenditures would grow beyond revenue for the first time in over five years. This was due almost entirely to an increase in staffing to match the needs of a growing enrollment. The community approved a second referendum for a $.60 increase in the education fund tax rate. We believe the districts response to its environment was both appropriate and timely and much more positive than the 2.80 profile would lead one to believe. A decrease in EAV is anticipated due to an onslaught of property tax appeal board cases coming from Cook County Commercial property taxpayers. Tax appeals as early as 1993-1996 have resulted in an unanticipated 12% reduction in 2001 tax collections.

This is especially true over the past three years. In 2000-2001 our Education Fund experienced a deficit of almost $435,000. Despite making cuts, we have continued to experience deficit spending. This year the situation was complicated by the loss of almost $140,000 in General State Aid and Corporate Personal Property Replacement Tax. Unit #9 entered the 20002001 school year with approximately $1,600,000 in savings in our Education and Working Cash Funds. We will end the 2002-2003 fiscal year with approximately $600,000. This projection assumes that the District will receive 24 General State Aid payments. There is much talk about school districts not receiving two General State Aid payments during this fiscal year. A loss of two General State Aid payments would mean an additional $265,000 loss to the District. This would be absolutely disastrous. At the present rate, we will expend all of our reserves during the 2004-2005 school year with limited capacity to raise additional revenue. The Board has instituted several cost controlling measures that reduced deficit spending by over $300,000 per year. The cost controlling measures are: Eliminated an administrative position Eliminated 5 certified positions Eliminated 4 non certified positions Closed an elementary school Reduced travel, supply and equipment budgets Many financial concerns exist for the 2003-2004 school year. There are concerns about possible reductions in State revenue and increases in maintenance costs, general personnel costs, insurance costs and special education costs. Unit #9 is heavily reliant on General State aid to meet operational expenses. Therefore, when the State cuts or freezes funding to schools it has a dramatic effect on our school district. To date, we have no solid information about what will happen with State funding, but the outlook appears to be bleak. Moreover, the Board has fully utilized the local tax levy by taxing at the maximum rates. The Board has also substantially increased the Tort Fund revenue to pay salaries for employees who are involved in risk management activities. This practice has increased the overall tax rate that our community is assessed. The Board is also extremely sensitive to the economic woes in our area. The unemployment rate in Watseka is approaching double digits as a number of factories have shut their doors over the past few months. This, in addition to a depressed farm economy, limits our community's ability to support schools with their tax dollars.

In 1995, enrollment at some grade levels was in excess of 35 students per teacher, with second grade finishing the school year with one teacher for 41 students. Small storage closets were remodeled to provide space for counseling and for speech therapy services, but there were no rooms available for splitting classes. Restroom facilities were woefully insufficient to handle the student numbers enrolled at the time. In 1995, without foreknowledge that state construction funds would eventually become available and with the best interest of students in mind, the Board of Education felt it had no realistic alternative but to acquire two temporary classroom buildings, each with two classrooms. Restrooms were also built to accommodate increasing enrollment. Reserves were used to construct restroom facilities at a cost of $125,000. Likewise, the temporary classroom buildings were constructed through five year leave-purchase agreements, and the payments were made from district reserves at a cost of $250,000. Those buildings have now been incorporated into the school's new facility which was funded largely by a state construction grant. The Board of Education feels it noteworthy that the district has, since 1995, added three classroom teachers to reduce class sizes and has added a fulltime special education teacher and a half-time special education teacher to address the requirements of special needs students. The district has thus far been able to provide these services using local tax dollars (which are capped) and state and federal aid. It is the feeling of the Board of Education that the information contained in this profile should be analyzed in light of the fact that the district started out with reserves totaling $378.000 (June 30, 1994), has since that time built and staffed classrooms (regular and special education) in order to meet basic educational and legal needs and yet it finished the FY02 fiscal year (as indicated on the profile) with $200,000 remaining in reserves.

On January 9, 2003 all districts received a sample profile of the financial condition of the district based upon the school's Annual Financial Report for 2000-2001. Our district profile was 3.9 out of a 4.0 and we received Financial Recognition. On February 6, 2003 we received the proposed profile for our district using data from the 2001-2002 Annual Financial Report. Because our district had saved money and established a reserve to prepare for a building project and then expended these reserves this past year, the district was penalized using the formula. The School Accounting System does not allow for the flexible transferring of funds. The district had earmarked approximately $2.5 million in reserve money in the Ed Fund for the building project. All expenditures for the building project are required to come out of the Site and Construction Fund. The district is not allowed to move the money from one fund to another, but must deficit spend and deposit state aide payments into the Site and Construction Fund. The district is not allowed to move the money from one fund to another, but must deficit spend and deposit state aide payments into the Site and Construction Fund. Because of the deficit spending, we were rated a ""1"" in ""expenditures to revenue"" because of the building project and utilization of reserves. The Total Profile for the last year was 2.75 and placed us on an early warning list - which does not seem valid since the district has over $1.5 million remaining in the Ed Fund and $836,000 in the Working Cash Fund. I feel the profile should be determined on an average of the past three years to get a more accurate picture for the district. In summary, I do not feel this profile provides a valid representation of our district's assets.

Numerous expenses were incurred during the final phase of construction and moving into the new facility, which is the primary reason the expenditure to revenue ratio was greater than 1 for FY02. These were planned expenses for which money had been saved. Because the reorganization expenses were included in FY02, the expenditures were inflated to $15,147,886. With the exception of summer projects completed in FY03, the expenditures will be back to a more realistic number for FY03 ($12,395,652). The School Board of Education and Administration are working diligently to operate within a balanced budget. However, with delayed payments from the State and Federal governments and an overall reduction in school revenue, this will be a challenge.

This means that the ISBE will be monitoring our school district closely and offering proactive technical assistance. Based on the information from ISBE management, there will be a large number of school districts on the state watch list. The ISBE estimates that 85% of school districts will be deficit spending by the end of this fiscal year. Based on conversation with other local school district administrators, our district is not alone in our financial woes. We project that the district's education fund could have a deficit fund balance of 1 million dollars by the end of the fiscal year. If the district continues to experience expenditures as we have in the past, we could reach a $5 million deficit by FY2005. Many factors have contributed to our school district's financial condition. Decreases in general state aid revenues ($382,000 decrease this year - could be more if 23rd and 24th State Aid payments are prorated or received late, as predicted) due to declining enrollment and a freeze in the funding foundation level, as well as proration of categorical grants by as much as 85% (i.e.. Special education and transportation) have had a large impact on district revenues. The district has also felt the effect of tax caps, which have limited the amount of property insurance premiums, which have nearly doubled, increasing costs by $150,000. Personnel costs have increased substantially due to significant salary increases over the past three years, although average salaries for teachers and administrators continue to fall below the state average. Personnel costs increased by over $300,000 in FY03. The State of Illinois is potentially faced with a $5 billion deficit. The district would like to attempt to cut 1/2 million dollars from our budget next year to help alleviate the situation. It appears that it could be at least 18 months before school districts get any relief through proposed income tax increases or other funding. Future considerations and concerns for our school district will be further decreases in state aid, tax caps, increased cost of health insurance, workman's compensation and property insurance and contract negotiations, variables which could cost the district an undeterminable amount of money.

During the years from 1982-1993, when we were unsuccessful in passing our referendum and with the decline in State Aid, our district cut programs, cut staff and closed two buildings in an attempt to stay financially solvent. With the passage of the referendum in 1993, it appeared that our district's financial troubles were a thing of the past. Little did we realize however, that tax caps were on their way and would have a major negative impact on the financial health of our district. Because of the tax cap, District 117 has lost over six million dollars in local revenue. We have never fully accessed our approved .90 increase. This is not fair. Our local voters gave us authority in 1993 to raise our educational tax rate. This is local control at its best. However, because of the imposition of the tax caps, my district is starting to see an erosion of our financial base and expenditures, surpassing our revenues. We have very few alternatives if we intend to maintain our programs. This month (Feb. 03) will focus on borrowing $8,665,000 in working cash bonds to help balance the budget. What does the State expect us to do when our borrowed money is gone? Although the State has made verbal commitment to increase educational funding, we have not seen increases in District 117. What we have seen are additional limitations such as the imposition of administration tax caps in the 2000/01 budget which have limited expenses in legislatively designed accounts to 5% increases and restricted grants covering only a portion of the costs for new programs. Tax caps for Cook County and limited State Aid have also made us apprehensive of promises of any increases in State funding of education. In addition, due to tax limitation laws, we are not able to access the increased EAV. What can the State do to help us? It is simple: Remove the tax cap immediately Allow districts to fully access increase in EAV Remove all utility expenses from the tax cap Remove life safety from under the tax cap Support EFAB's recommendations  NORTH WAMAC SCHOOL DISTRICT 186 NORTHBROOK/GLENVIEW SCH DIST 30 O FALLON C C SCHOOL DIST 90 ORLAND SCHOOL DISTRICT 135  1.05 1.40 1.05 1.40  0.70 0.70 1.05 0.70  0.20 0.20 0.10 0.20  0.40 0.40 0.40 0.40  0.30 0.30 0.10 0.30  2.65 3.00 2.70 3.00  Financial Early Warning Financial Early Warning Financial Early Warning Financial Early Warning  Thursday, May 15, 2003  Page 63 of 83   District Name Max OTTAWA ELEM SCHOOL DIST 141 OTTER CREEK-HYATT SCHOOL DIST 56 PALATINE C C SCHOOL DIST 15 PALOS HEIGHTS SCHOOL DIST 128 PANA COMM UNIT SCHOOL DIST 8 PARK RIDGE C C SCHOOL DIST 64 PAYSON COMM UNIT SCHOOL DIST 1  FBRR (1.4) 1.40 1.05 1.40 1.40 1.40 1.05 1.05  EXRV (1.4) 0.70 0.70 0.35 0.70 0.70 1.05 1.05  DCOH (0.4) 0.20 0.20 0.20 0.30 0.40 0.20 0.10  STB (0.4) 0.40 0.40 0.40 0.40 0.40 0.40 0.40  LTD (0.4) 0.30 0.40 0.30 0.10 0.10 0.30 0.30  Score (4.0) 3.00 2.75 2.65 2.90 3.00 3.00 2.90  Designation Financial Early Warning Financial Early Warning Financial Early Warning Financial Early Warning Financial Early Warning Financial Early Warning Financial Early Warning  District Comments  District closing June 30, 2003.

In addition, the project failed to comply with standards and some parts of the work had to be redone. Due to the need to complete emergency repairs and pay those completing the work, district funds had to be spent. These emergency repair costs lowered our district Days Cash on Hand and Fund Balance to Revenues. The construction completion and repairs increased our Expenditures to Revenues.

First, the State of Illinois was unable to meet its obligations in a timely manner. Our cash-basis budget was dependant upon receiving our fourth quarter categorical payments by June 30, 2002. This did not occur. Also, the tax bills for Lake County went out late, further eroding our revenue collections for FY02. Had these two separate events not occurred, our revenue would have been greater than our expenses and we would have had more cash on hand at year-end. This would have raised Wauconda CUSD 118's profile to the Financial Review category. Given that this assessment system is new, it should be noted that it could be unfairly influenced by uncontrollable acts from outside parties, especially for districts like ours who operate under a cash-basis accounting system.

Voters of the district defeated a referendum for an education fund tax rate increase of $1.00 in the spring of 2002. The district issued $725,000 of working cash bonds in December 2003 which will help a projected $250,000 budget deficit for FY03 and assist with cash flow problems. Approximately $425,000 of program and personnel cuts will be made in the FY04 budget, which includes closing an elementary building. In April 2003 voters will be asked to approve a $.50 education fund tax rate increase. The district is projected to lose just under $1,000,000 of assessed value on the 2002 tax levy, which is payable in 2003. Student enrollment is expected to decline.

This caused a drastic change in our Expenditure to Revenue ratio. The difference between District 158's Financial profile designation for FY01 (financial review) and District 158's Financial profile as indicated on this preliminary report (financial watch) is not a true indicator of District 158's financial status. District 158 charges against the budget all salaries in the year they are earned. Some districts charge salaries only as they are paid. If we used an accrual accounting system we would charge the salaries as expenses and show an asset titled Prepaid Salaries. This is what actually happened. Salaries are paid in one fiscal year but checks are not issued until July and August in the next fiscal year.

The revenue that is generated in the education fund is well below what is necessary to educate the number of students that attend district schools. As a result, the district issued Working Cash Bonds in order to meet annual expenses. 3) The district is in the process of repaying $25,600,000 of building bonds that were approved by the district voters for the construction of a new elementary school. The bonds will be paid in full during the 2018-19 school year.  MT CARROLL COMM UNIT DIST 304  0.70  1.05  0.10  0.40  0.20  2.45  Financial Watch  Taxpayers of Mt. Carroll CUD 304 have the highest school tax rate, 6.1282, in the counties of Carroll, Jo Davies and Stephenson. With an approximate unemployment rate of 10% in Carroll County, taxpayers of Mt. Carroll show responsibility for students in our District. The over reliance on property tax is not a responsible method to fund education. The state and its elected officials need to change the way Illinois schools are funded. School are not able to withstand the unpredictability of the distribution of state funds.

When a school district is heavily reliant on State Aid, regardless of whether that is caused by lack of local wealth or tax base, any manipulation of the level of State Aid has immediate and direct consequences to that district. Schools that are reliant on State Aid to meet their daily obligations are constantly challenged to maintain financial integrity. Many of the challenges we face stem from delays, prorated dollars, and/or missed payments altogether. The Mulberry Grove Community Unit Schools have been extremely diligent in the planning and implementation of the District's budget. There is no question that every effort is being made to wisely spend the limited resources that we have available to fund our educational programs. The community has supported a substantial levy, yet as you are well aware we are heavily reliant on State Aid to finance our total program. The Mulberry Grove Schools are facing the very same problems as so many others are faced with throughout our State. We are faced with the increasing pressure of financial, statutory, litigated, and otherwise mandated obligations at both the State and Federal levels. At the very same time, we are expected to deal with decreasing revenues and other resources to meet these obligations. It should be recognized that the biggest problem this district faces is one of cash flow, not over spending. Many measures have been put in place to address our local financial concerns. A great amount of daily attention and energy is spent in doing our very best in providing a quality education for our students. The fact is we are heavily reliant on State Aid in order to meet our financial obligations. The fact that the State itself has not met its obligations by funding mandates fully, and providing revenues in a timely manner that are not prorated has complicated matters significantly. There is no doubt that since we are so reliant on State Aid that fluctuations and arbitrary manipulations of financial formulas certainly affect our local financial picture dramatically. Regardless of what is or is not done to help with this situation, we will continue to serve the students and members of this community to the very best of our ability.

School Board undertook some proactive cost-cutting measures. Namely, we instituted a ""retirementincentive buy-out"" program in which, among other things, the district offered eligible teachers to pay that respective teacher's ""2.2 upgrade"" PLUS a onetime bonus of a twenty percent (20%) check handed to them on the last day of instruction. As a result, some fourteen (14) veteran teachers opted for the incentives. Over the last four year, these fourteen people's buyout cost the district some $400,000.00 dollars in cash outlay. However, as this is my point, because of these retirements, the district has either absorbed or not replaced our of those fourtenn positions, thus saving about $200,000.00 dollars. Additionaly, of the other teaching positions that we did replace now -, we replace a teacher making $55,000.00 with a new fresh-out-ofschool teacher hired in at $25,000.00 - hence, saving the district about $30,000.00 per hire. If you do the math, the cumulative savings in ten years more than amount to $300,000.00 per teacher, with a net savings in ten years of almost three million dollars in salaries and benefits! NOW HERE IS WHERE THE RUB COMES IN! Under the state's new criteria, there ais a cumulative hit, a ""snowballing effect"" or a multiplying of factors in regards to finances. First of all, because of the buyout incentives, the outlay of $400,000.00 in bonuses caused our fund balances to dramatically decrease this affecting our Fund Balance to Revenue Ratio; secondly, since these monies are cash outlays, our Expenditures went upward markedly causing our Expenditures to Revenue Ratio to be affected; thirdly, then our Days Cash on Hand ratio is lowered. Finanlly, our Long-Term Debt Margin is caused by the fact that we built a brand new five and one-half million dollar ($5,500,000.00) K-8 building (at the encouragement of the state, I might add) replacing a nearly 100 year old structure! SO! - We are exasperated! Moreover, some of out funding from the state (transportation) has been delayed by almost three months! In sum, I am a great believer in accountability and good stewardship. However, punishing us with the lowest classification label of Financial Watch belies the point that the criteria are too planar and myopic in the sense of merely looking at the numbers and not as to the HOW'S AND WHY'S of the numbers!

District to district comparisons are complicated by financial reporting cash or accrual accounting methods. Queen Bee School District 16 reports on an accrual basis. Therefore, fund balances include $1,200,000 of accrued salaries (summer payrolls) and accrued compensated days thereby reducing fund balances. Adding those dollars back into the fund balances would increase the district score to 1.05 from .70 in area 1 and increasing the total profile score from 2.55 to 2.9 which would move this district from the ""Financial Watch"" determination to the ""Financial Early Warning"" determination. 2. Every school district in Illinois has a different ""story"" of financial status that is reflected in the new Financial Profile. While we believe this evaluation better reflects a district's financial picture than the ""Financial Watch"" formula did, it is important to understand that unique circumstances can cause elevated or exceptionally dismal scores. For example, a deficit budget could reflect a construction project as we did in FY2001 when funds from a lease purchase were deposited in our Operations and Maintenance Fund in FY2000 and the costs incurred in FY2001. This would skew both step 2 and step 3 of the profile. 3. Percent of long-term debt margin remaining: The district has no non-referendum bond ability remaining even though there is 46.4% debt margin remaining for the district. Legislative action could make these funds available for an emergency (i.e. life safety). This district currently has $6,000,000 of approved life safety amendments it is unable to proceed with until funds become available. At this time it is not feasible to request funds via referendum. Please see statement #4. 4. The district has an education fund tax rate referendum question on the April 1, 2003 ballot after the defeat of the November 2, 2002 referendum. Should it not be successful, the district is preparing to implement $1,5000,000 in staff salary and benefit reductions. The last successful referendum was in 1993.

GX000-20-1976132	2003-04 STAR Reimbursement         The School Tax Relief (STAR) program directly reimburses school districts for the lost real property revenue as a result of a property tax exemption provided to homeowners.         Although the STAR payment schedule has remained the same since its inception, the method of calculating the payment amount has changed for the 2003-04 school year.    STAR payments will now be based on a percentage of the tax levy, that is, the positive difference (if any) of the STAR portion of the tax levy minus a fixed percent, times the tax levy for the months of October, November, and December.    The balance of STAR Aid will be paid on January 2.         Additionally, there will be a payment on or before March 31, 2004 for corrections filed after December 5, 2003 and prior to February 20, 2004 with the Office of Real Property Services.    This payment will only credit school districts money owed for the current year.         The following examples will illustrate the payment methodology.                      Example 1.                    Real property tax levy (excluding library levy) = $10,000,000                                                     Total STAR Aid Payable    =    3,500,000                                                      STAR portion of the tax levy    =    35% (3,500,000/10,000,000)                             Pay Date                          % of School Tax Levy                                                                Payment Amount                     Oct 15                             Tax Levy  times  ( 35%    -    25%)                                                     $1,000,000                     Nov14                            (Tax Levy  times  ( 35% -    20%)) – Oct                                         $     500,000                     Dec15                             (Tax Levy  times  ( 35% -    15%)) – (Oct + Nov)                          $     500,000                     Jan 2                                Balance due (total STAR – all previous payments)               $1,500,000                             Example 2.                    Real property tax levy (excluding library levy) =    $10,000,000                                                    Total STAR Aid Payable    =    $2,100,000                                                    STAR portion of the tax levy    =    21% (2,100,000/10,000,000)                           Pay Date                           % of School Tax Levy                                                                Payment Amount                  Oct 15                               Tax Levy  times  ( 21%    -    25%)                                                      $       - 0 -                  Nov14                               (Tax Levy  times  ( 21% -    20%)) – Oct                                         $     100,000                  Dec15                               (Tax Levy  times  ( 21% -    15%)) – (Oct + Nov)                           $     500,000                  Jan 2                                  Balance due (total STAR – all previous payments)                 $1,500,000                             Example 3.                    Real property tax levy (excluding library levy) =    $10,000,000                                                    Total STAR Aid Payable    =    $1,500,000                                                    STAR portion of the tax levy    =    15% (1,500,000/10,000,000)                            Pay Date                        % of School Tax Levy                                                                  Payment Amount                   Oct 15                            Tax Levy  times  ( 15%    -    25%)                                                       $       - 0 -                   Nov14                           (Tax Levy  times  ( 15% -    20%)) – Oct                                            $       - 0 -                   Dec15                            (Tax Levy  times  ( 15% -    15%)) – (Oct + Nov)                            $       - 0 -                   Jan 2                               Balance due (total STAR – all previous payments)                  $1,500,000               Return to  State Aid

Please note that all financial statements must be     completed in accordance with generally accepted accounting/auditing     principles.       (actual citations are listed below the table)                           Audited Financial Statement         Can be used for all schools but  must be used for         schools which have:                                 Gross tuition income exceeding $250,000             or                           Combined Federal and State student             financial aid in excess of $100,000 in a school fiscal year or                           Gross tuition income exceeding $50,000 in              the previous fiscal year and no audited financial statement on             file for any previous year.                                         Unaudited Reviewed Financial         Statement         Can be used for schools requiring an unaudited compiled         financial statement but  must be used for schools which have:                                 Gross tuition income between $100,000 and             $250,000                                   Remember to check above  items #2 and #3          listed under the  Audited Financial Statement          requirements to determine if, in spite of earning between $100,000 and         250,000 gross tuition income, the school must still submit an audited         financial statement.                             Unaudited Compiled Financial         Statement         May only be used for school which have:                                 Gross tuition of less than $100,000 in             gross tuition                                   Remember to check above  item #3          listed under the  Audited Financial Statement  requirements         to determine if, in spite of earning less than $100,000 gross tuition         income, the school must still submit an audited financial statement.                       For more information, you may  contact the Bureau  regarding the type of financial statement you must submit.  Be sure to include a good estimate of your gross tuition income for the most recent fiscal year, the gross tuition income for your previous fiscal year, and the combined total amount of Federal and State student aid that you received during your most recent fiscal year.  Otherwise, BPSS will not be able to advise you regarding the appropriate financial statement.     Education Law   Education Law Section 5001(4)(e)(i) states in part that ""Licensed private schools and registered business schools shall submit such certified statistical reports and annual financial statements as required by the commissioner. The commissioner may require audited statistical reports upon a determination that a school has provided false or inaccurate certified statistical reports. The financial statements shall be based on the fiscal year of the school and shall also include an itemized account of tuition refunds due and owing to past or presently enrolled students.""    Commissioner's Regulations   Commissioner's Regulations Section 126.8(b)(3) states,             ""Pursuant to section 500l(4)(e) of the Education Law, schools shall     be required to submit to the commissioner an annual financial statement and     shall meet the following requirements with respect to the submission of such     annual financial statement:                         (i) Any school which received in excess of $250,000 in gross tuition         in a school fiscal year shall submit an audited financial statement to         the commissioner for that fiscal year.           (ii) Any school which received in excess of $100,000 in combined         Federal and State student financial aid in a school fiscal year shall         submit an audited financial statement to the commissioner for that         fiscal year.           (iii) Any school which received between $100,000 and $250,000 in         gross tuition and $100,000 or less in combined State and Federal student         financial aid in a school fiscal year shall submit an unaudited reviewed         financial statement to the commissioner for that fiscal year.           (iv) Any school which received less than $100,000 in gross tuition         and $100,000 or less in combined State and Federal student financial aid         in a school fiscal year shall submit an unaudited compiled financial         statement to the commissioner for that fiscal year.           (v) Any school which received in excess of $50,000 but no more than         $250,000 in gross tuition and $100,000 or less in combined State and         Federal student financial aid in a school fiscal year shall submit an         audited financial statement to the commissioner for the next school         fiscal year, provided that such school has not filed at least one         audited financial statement since its first year of operation.           (vi) Any school may satisfy the requirement for an unaudited compiled         financial statement with either an unaudited reviewed financial         statement or an audited financial statement; and may satisfy the         requirement for an unaudited reviewed financial statement with an         audited financial statement."

This letter is intended to give you an overview of those changes, with a detailed      description of the new funding model for charter schools.     The following      is a summary of the most significant bills affecting charter schools. The      language of the bills may be found on our charter school Web site at:        www.cde.ca.gov/charter .     Assembly Bill      544, Lempert (Chapter 34, Statutes of 1998, effective January 1, 1999)       significantly strengthened and expanded the state's Charter Schools Act ( Education      Code  Section 47600 et seq.). The major changes in law enacted through      AB 544 include:           Requiring        the California Department of Education (CDE) to propose a funding model        for charter schools that would provide operational funding equal to total        funding received by a school district serving a similar population.        Raising the        cap on the total number of charter schools that may be authorized to operate        in the state to a maximum of 250 for the 1998-99 school year with an additional        100 charter schools every school year thereafter.        Allowing petitions        for new charter schools to be based on the signatures of 50 percent of the        parents of pupils expected to enroll in the school or 50 percent of the        teachers ""meaningfully interested"" in teaching at the school.        Creating a        process for review by either a county board of education or the State Board        of Education (SBE) of a petition that has been denied by a local school        district governing board.        Compelling        school district governing boards to approve charter petitions unless they        make specific, valid written findings that the proposal is unsound or otherwise        fails to meet specified standards of law.        Authorizing        SBE revocation of charters for specified reasons.       Requiring        that each charter school teacher of a core subject hold a Commission on        Teacher Credentialing certificate, permit, or other document equivalent        to that which a teacher in other public schools would be required to hold.               Limiting the        amount of supervisorial oversight fees that a chartering agency may charge        a charter school, to one percent of the school's revenue or three percent        of the school's revenue if the chartering agency is providing the school        with substantially rent-free facilities.         Senate Bill      434, Johnston (Chapter 162, Statutes of 1999, effective January 1, 2000)       requires charter schools to:           Offer at least        the same number of instructional minutes that are required for other pupils        attending public schools, for the appropriate grade levels ( Education        Code  Section 46201(a)(3));        Maintain written        records documenting pupil attendance, and to make these records available        for audit and inspection; and        Certify that        their pupils have participated in the Standardized Testing and Reporting        (STAR) program in the same manner as other pupils attending public schools,        as a condition of the apportionment of state funding.         The provisions      of this bill also require charter schools providing independent study and      distance learning programs to comply with the same procedural requirements      for independent study as other public schools. The law limits a charter school's      ability to claim average daily attendance (ADA) through independent study.      Specifically, a charter school is allowed to claim ADA through independent      study only for pupils who are residents of the county in which their attendance      is reported, or who are residents of a county immediately adjacent to the      county in which their attendance is reported. This restriction cannot be overridden      by the use of interdistrict transfer agreements.     SB 434 became      effective as of January 1, 2000; therefore, this change in law is not applicable      to the reporting of ADA prior to that date. Accordingly, a charter school      may receive partial year funding for ADA generated from the beginning of the      current school year through December 31, 1999 for programs that were not operated      consistent with the provisions of SB 434.     Senate Bill      267, Lewis (Chapter 736, Statutes of 1999,   effective October 7, 1999)       increases the maximum loan amount to charter schools from the charter school      revolving loan fund and allows charter schools that are incorporated to apply      directly for loans. Please refer to our letter dated November 5, 1999 describing      the new loan application and approval process; it was sent to all school districts,      county offices of education, and charter schools and is also posted on our      charter school web site.     Assembly Bill      631, Migden (Chapter 828, Statutes of 1999, effective January 1, 2000)       requires all charter school charters to be amended to address issues related      to collective bargaining. Specifically, each charter must include a declaration      indicating whether the charter school is deemed the exclusive public school      employer of the employees of the charter school for the purposes of collective      bargaining. If the charter school is not deemed a public school employer,      the school district where the charter is located shall be the public school      employer.     Assembly Bill      1115, Strom-Martin (Chapter 78, Statutes of 1999, as amended by Assembly Bill      1600, Committee on Education (Chapter 646, Statutes of 1999), effective January      1, 2000 but applies to the entire 1999-2000 fiscal year)  establishes a      funding model for charter schools.     Background       AB 544 required the CDE to propose a funding model for charter schools      that would provide operational funding equal to total funding received by      a school district serving a similar pupil population. The model was to provide      funding in a simple manner and, at the option of the charter school, through      a local or direct allocation of funds. It also allowed the SBE to implement      the model through regulations.       As a result of      that legislation, the CDE, with the assistance and input of the public school      community, began developing a new charter school ""block grant"" funding model.      Instead of the model being implemented through regulation, however, the legislature      codified a funding model which was substantially the same as that proposed      by CDE, as part of the 1999-2000 education trailer bill, which took effect      January 1, 2000, but applies to the entire 1999-2000 fiscal year (see  Education      Code  sections 47630 through 47664).     Eligibility      and Time Line       Pursuant to  Education Code  Section 47630.5, the charter school block      grant funding model applies to all charter schools. However, if a charter      school was assigned a charter number by the SBE prior to June 1, 1999, applicability      of the funding model is at the charter school's option until fiscal year 2002-2003.      Once a charter school has opted into the model, its decision is irrevocable.      The decision to opt into the model must be communicated to CDE by June 1 prior      to the affected fiscal year in which the model applies. Beginning in fiscal      year 2002-2003, charter schools will no longer have the option to be funded      under the traditional revenue limit model. The exception to this is districtwide      charter schools which will retain the option to be funded under the revenue      limit model or the block grant model. However, once the decision is made to      be funded under the block grant model, the decision is irrevocable.           Charter schools      authorized by a county office of education after the petition has been denied      by a school district, and numbered by the SBE after June 1, 1999, will also      receive funding under the block grant according to the same criteria that      applies to district approved charter schools.     County offices      of education can continue to approve charter schools for pupils in county      office programs. However, only charter school pupils attending a community      school at the request of the parent ( Education Code  Section 1981(b))      are funded under the block grant funding model.      Definition      of Sponsoring Local Educational Agency (LEA)       The charter school funding model refers to LEAs that authorize charter schools      and LEAs that sponsor charter schools. They are not necessarily one and the      same. The significance of the sponsoring LEA is that it provides the revenue      in lieu of property taxes to charter schools.       For purposes      of the funding model, a sponsoring LEA is defined as:                 the district      that granted the charter; or     in the case      of a charter that was denied by a district and subsequently approved by a      county office, the district that initially denied the charter; or     in the case      of a charter approved by the SBE, any LEA that agrees to be the sponsor, or      the LEA that denied the charter if no other LEA has been designated as the      sponsor.           In a county approved      charter, for students who are referred by parental request pursuant to  Education      Code  Section 1981(b), the sponsoring LEA is the district of residence      of each pupil in the school. That means some county approved charter schools      will have several sponsoring districts if the school has students that come      from different districts.     Description      of the Charter School Funding Model and Funding Rates       The charter school funding model contains two block grants:            a general purpose      entitlement in lieu of revenue limit funding     a block grant      amount in lieu of categorical funding. The categorical block grant will also      include an amount in lieu of Economic Impact Aid (EIA) funding if the charter      school has students who qualify as English Learners (EL) and/or qualify for      free or reduced priced school meals.           General      Purpose Entitlement:  Pursuant to  Education Code  Section 47633,      general purpose funding is provided to each charter school on the basis of      each unit of ADA. A general purpose amount is calculated for each of four      grade ranges (K-3, 4-6, 7-8, and 9-12). The amount is based on comparable      revenue limit funding and computed annually.     The general purpose      entitlement is funded through a combination of state aid and local funds.      The funds are unrestricted and may be used for any public school purpose.     For a pupil who      attends a charter school that is sponsored by either an elementary or high      school district, the state will fund the portion of the general purpose entitlement      equal to the per pupil  entitlement  less local revenues. For a pupil      who attends a charter school that is sponsored by a unified school district      that has at least one school that is not a charter school, the state will      fund an amount equal to the per pupil district  revenue limit  less local      revenues. Because the charter school  is still guaranteed  from the sponsoring      district  its full block grant entitlement , the unified district will      pay or gain from the difference between the per pupil block grant entitlement      and the district revenue limit ( Education Code  sections 42238(h)(8)      and 47660).     Categorical      Block Grant:   Education   Code  Section 47634 describes      the method for computing the categorical block grant. This block grant, like      the general purpose entitlement, is provided to charter schools on a per ADA      basis, with the amount determined by total ADA reported in each grade range      (K-3, 4-6, 7-8, and 9-12).      The categorical      grant is provided in lieu of funding for many categorical programs. Therefore,      a charter school is not eligible for separate funding for any program included      in the block grant. A district may not include the charter school in its determination      of eligibility for any of these programs; however, for the 1999-2000 fiscal      year, funding for districts reflects prior year ADA which includes charter      school ADA. A charter school may not participate in new categorical programs      established in 1999-2000 and beyond, unless the authorizing legislation specifically      includes eligibility for charter schools.     Charter schools      are exempt from the program requirements of the individual categorical programs      included in the block grant calculation. Like the general purpose entitlement,      the funds provided in this block grant may be used for any purpose determined      by the governing body of the charter school.      The categorical      block grant also includes an amount representing a charter school's entitlement      for state EIA. This entitlement results from a separate calculation that is      based on the total number of pupils in the charter school that are designated      EL or who are eligible for free or reduced priced meals. The grade level entitlement      in lieu of categorical funding plus the EIA funding constitute the total categorical      block grant that the charter school will receive.      Local or      Direct Funding Options Under the Block Grant       Only charter schools funded under the block grant model have the option of      electing to have funds deposited in the appropriate fund or account of the      authorizing local educational agency  ( local)  or deposited in      the appropriate fund or account of the charter school  ( direct) .       Charter schools that do not participate in the block grant funding model      will be funded through their authorizing local educational agency.          Each block grant-funded      charter school may make the election to receive its funding directly. In any      year in which a charter school elects to be direct funded, the charter school      must notify the county superintendent of schools of this choice by June 1      prior to the affected fiscal year. We recommend that the charter school also      notify its authorizing local educational agency and the CDE of the election      to be direct funded. The decision on whether to be funded locally or directly      will not affect the amount of block grant funding provided to the charter      school. However, as a practical matter, this decision may affect the level      of administrative support necessary to apply for and manage the several separate      programs that  are not  included in the block grant.      Local Funding:       Charter schools that choose to be funded locally will receive their block      grant funding through the LEA that approved the charter. They may apply for      categorical programs that are not included in the block grant through the      approving local educational agency, unless legislation for individual programs      specifically allows charter schools to apply separately. Charter schools that      are locally funded should work with their approving local educational agencies      to ensure they are included in those agencies' applications for programs for      which the charter schools are eligible and choose to participate.     Direct      Funding:  For direct funded charters, the state warrant will be drawn      in favor of the county superintendent of schools of the county in which the      charter approving LEA is located and deposited in the appropriate fund or      account of the charter school.      A charter school      that is direct funded must apply separately for categorical programs that      are not included in the block grant. A charter school that chooses to be direct      funded may not be included in the application or eligibility of the authorizing      entity for any categorical programs. An election to receive funding directly      applies to all funding the charter receives, including other state and federal      categorical aid, and lottery funds.     Portions      and Timing of General Purpose Entitlement       The charter school general purpose entitlement is made up of a combination      of state and local revenues; the proportionate shares will vary by sponsoring      school district.       State Aid      Portion:  The state aid portion of the general purpose entitlement      is the amount which is not funded through local in lieu property tax revenue.      The state aid portion will be allocated according to the same schedule as      revenue limit funds apportioned to school districts ( Education Code       Section 14041). This schedule provides for monthly payments based on fixed      percentages of the annual entitlement. Funding is based on ADA reports certified      by the county office of education and accordingly, is adjusted periodically      during the school year to reflect the most current ADA reports.      Local Aid      Portion:  Charter schools will receive a portion of the entitlement      from local funds that are in lieu of local property taxes. In some districts,      the entire general purpose entitlement may be funded through these in lieu      revenues.     The sponsoring      LEA is responsible for allocating to charter schools on a monthly basis the      amount in lieu of property taxes. Each monthly amount represents a specified      percent of the estimated annual property tax amount. (See  Education Code       Section 47635 for the monthly percentages.)     Calculating      the Local Aid Portion:  The local aid portion of the charter school      block grant is an in lieu of property tax amount per ADA multiplied by the      charter school ADA. The property tax per ADA calculation divides the sponsoring      LEA's property taxes by the total ADA of the sponsoring district. The ADA      and property taxes should correspond with regard to the period being reported,      e.g., if property taxes are based on the 1998-99 second principal apportionment,      ADA for that period should also be used.     During the months      of August through February, the sponsoring LEA should compute a per ADA amount      based on property taxes received by the sponsoring LEA as reported at the      second principal apportionment (P-2) of the preceding year. In other words,      for the advance apportionment, use prior year P-2 taxes in the calculation.      During the months of March through June, the per ADA in lieu of property tax      amount should be based on taxes reported for the then current fiscal year      first principal apportionment (P-1). The July payment should be based on taxes      reported by the sponsoring LEA for the prior year second principal apportionment      (P-2). Final adjustments to the amount of funding in lieu of property taxes      allocated to a charter school shall be made in February in conjunction with      the final reconciliation of annual apportionments to schools.     Following is      a simple model for computing the in lieu property tax amount:           Local Property        Taxes (from Form K-12) .............. (B-1) __________         Total District        and Charter ADA (including county-operated charter        school ADA for ""Type B"" parental request pupils that reside in the         district) ......................... (B-2) __________          Per ADA Property        Tax (Line B-1 divided by Line B-2) ....... (B-3) __________              Charter Block        Grant ADA .................. (B-4) __________          Local Property        Taxes for Charter Block Grant ADA        (Line B-3 times Line B-4) ................... (B-5) __________           The amount          of in lieu taxes transferred by the LEA should not exceed the charter          school's total entitlement. In accordance with the law, the sponsor must          provide the lesser of (1) the average amount of property taxes per unit          of ADA received by the LEA multiplied by the charter school's ADA, or          (2) the statewide average general purpose funding per unit of ADA received          by school districts multiplied by the charter school's ADA in each of          the four specified grade level ranges (the block grant). Therefore, the          following steps are also necessary:             Total Block        Grant Funding Entitlement (refer to the details listed         under        (2) in the paragraph above) ............. (B-6) __________                          Charter School        Local Revenue (E.C. 47635 (a))        (Enter the lesser of B-5 and B-6) .............. (B-7) __________                         Accounting      for the In lieu of Property Tax Transfer:  For school districts using      the standardized account code structure (SACS), the sponsoring district will      transfer out the charter school funding in lieu of property taxes with the      following coding:                Fund        01         Resource        0000         Year        0         Goal        0000         Function        9000         Object        7280         Site        000                Fund 01 is the      General Fund of the sponsoring district.      Resource 0000      is Unrestricted.      Project Year      is not applicable for this example.      Goal 0000 is      Undistributed.      Function 9000      is Other Outgo.      Object 7280      is Transfer to Charter School In-Lieu of Property Taxes          For school districts      that have not yet converted to SACS, the sponsoring district will report the      transfer of charter school funding in-lieu of property taxes as Transfer to      Charter School In-Lieu of Property Taxes (Object 7280) in the General Fund      of the Budget and Financial Reports (J-201). On the Program Cost Report (J-380),      the district will report the transfer as All Other Outgo (EDP 480).     The charter schools      (SACS and non-SACS alike) will use Object code 8780 to deposit their funding      in lieu of property taxes, Object 8015 to deposit their general purpose entitlement,      and Object 8480 to deposit their categorical block grant.      Timing      of Categorical Block Grant Funding Allocations       The categorical block grant will be distributed in three installments for      the 1999-2000 school year. The first distribution, equal to 40 percent of      the estimated annual entitlement, was certified on December 6, 1999. This      Spring, the estimated annual entitlements will be updated with P-1 ADA and      disadvantaged pupil counts. An allocation will follow that equals 80 percent      of the adjusted entitlement, less the amount received in December. In August      2000 entitlements will be finalized upon receipt of the March 2000 language      census survey results. A final payment will ensue that is equal to 100 percent      of the categorical block grant, less the amounts received in the previous      apportionments. Please refer to the CDE's charter school web site for additional      details regarding categorical block grant allocations. The letter and payment      schedule for the December 6, 1999, apportionment may be viewed at that Web      site:   www.cde.ca.gov/charter/funding/       The apportionment letter provides a detailed overview of the ADA, pupil counts,      and funding rates which will be utilized in the current and future categorical      block grant apportionments.       Categorical      Programs Not Included in the Block Grant       Non-block grant programs include all federally funded programs such as Title      I, funding for disadvantaged pupils, and other criteria-based state programs      such as K-3 Class Size Reduction. While the state charter school law allows      significant flexibility regarding the expenditure of state funds, all compliance      requirements for federal funding still apply to charter schools.        A locally funded      charter school may only apply through the authorizing agency for funding not      included in the block grant. Direct funded charters may only apply individually      for federal or state funds not included in the block grant. A direct funded      charter school is deemed a school district for that purpose. In order to ensure      that direct-funded charter schools receive timely notification of their eligibility,      CDE will provide information on programs outside of the block grant on its      charter school web site. A partial list of program summaries, including a      specific contact person for each of these programs, is currently posted at       www.cde.ca.gov/charter . More program      information will continue to be posted.     Oversight      of Charter Schools       Regardless of the decisions a charter school makes related to funding, the      oversight responsibilities of the chartering entity do not change. The chartering      entity is still responsible to assure that the charter school is meeting all      of the terms of its charter, including ensuring that an annual audit of the      charter school is completed. The chartering entity also retains the right      to review records of the charter school and to initiate revocation of the      charter, if necessary.       Charter schools      should be aware that it is the intention of CDE to request end of year financial      reporting for all charter schools most likely through their chartering entity.      Pursuant to  Education Code  Section 47604.3, charter schools must promptly      respond to all reasonable inquiries regarding their financial records, from      either their chartering entity or from the State Superintendent of Public      Instruction.     Although the      exact level of detail and format of the reporting is still being reviewed,      at a minimum charter schools should be able to provide an accounting of all      revenues and expenditures for each fiscal year. This financial data will most      likely require a breakdown of revenues identified by source, and details regarding      the amounts spent for certain expenditure categories, such as employee salaries      and benefits, books, supplies, equipment, contracted services and other operating      expenses, capital outlay, and other outgo. Charter schools should also be      prepared to provide additional financial information about beginning and ending      balances, amounts set aside for reserves, amounts spent for debt service,      and specific amounts spent from certain state and federal funding sources.     Lottery            Education Code  Section 47638 provides that each charter school shall be      deemed a school district for purposes of receiving lottery funds, regardless      of whether the charter school is funded under the block grant funding model,      or whether it has chosen local or direct funding. We are required to report      all charter ADA to the State Controller's Office (SCO) for purposes of determining      lottery funding. As a result, lottery funds will be calculated independently      for each charter school. These funds will be deposited in the appropriate      account of the charter school.       Throughout the      year, the allocation of lottery funds is based on estimated annual ADA for      that year; an estimate is necessary because the actual ADA is not certified      until a few months after the close of the year. The estimate is based on prior      year ADA. Because new charter schools, which are not conversion schools, have      no prior year ADA, lottery funds will first be received by these charter schools      after the close of the first year of operation. However, in the second year      of operation, these charter schools will not only receive their first year      entitlement, they will also receive second year payments during that year      because historical data are available on which to estimate ADA.     Special      Education       The statewide special education funding model (AB 602) combines funds from      several different sources - state, federal, and local property taxes - into      a unique rate for each special education local plan area (SELPA). Generally,      SELPAs are confederations of districts and counties that have joined together      to more easily develop the programs and services necessary to provide full      educational opportunities to students with disabilities. Special education      funding is generated by the total ADA reported by districts and combined at      the SELPA level.       For special      education purposes ,  Education Code  sections 47640 through 47647      assume that each charter school is a public school of the LEA that granted      its charter, unless the charter school takes the steps necessary to be considered      an LEA. Charter schools that are deemed public schools of the LEA that granted      their charters generate special education revenue by reporting ADA. A charter      school whose ""sponsoring"" LEA (see  Local Aid Portion ) differs from      the LEA that granted its charter should take steps to ensure that the sponsoring      LEA identifies the charter school's ADA as belonging to the correct SELPA.           The LEA that      granted the charter is responsible for ensuring that all students with disabilities      enrolled in the charter school receive specialized instruction and related      services in a manner that complies with all provisions of federal law regardless      of the student's district of residence.  Education Code  Section 47646      requires that LEAs provide charter schools with an ""equitable"" share of funds      or services, or a combination of both, to support the educational needs of      students with disabilities enrolled in the charter school.      The working definition      of ""equitable"" will depend on agreements reached by each LEA and charter school.      It is generally recognized that special education funding does not cover the      total costs of special education services. Therefore, as a starting point      for reaching agreement, charter schools should be assigned a level of encroachment      equal to that experienced by the district. The starting point can be adjusted      up or down based on estimates of disproportionately higher or lower special      education costs that are likely to be incurred by the charter school.     Because educating      students with disabilities enrolled in charter schools is a responsibility      shared by the charter school and the LEA that approved the charter, creating      a memorandum of understanding between the charter and the LEA specifying the      role of each in discharging this responsibility is a prudent practice.      A charter school      that does not want to receive special education funding and services through      a district can be deemed an LEA  for special education purposes  if it      applies for and is granted admission to a SELPA as an LEA. The process for      securing participation in a SELPA as an LEA may differ from SELPA to SELPA.      A charter school that applies for admission as an LEA cannot be treated differently      from other districts based on its status as a charter school. Charter schools      may also apply to the SBE for approval as a new SELPA, in conjunction with      other charter schools or districts.      A charter school      that is deemed an LEA            will receive        special education funds through its SELPA, as determined by the allocation        plan of its SELPA;        will participate        in SELPA governance as an LEA, consistent with the policy-making process        described in its SELPA's local plan; and        will assume        responsibility for ensuring that all students with disabilities enrolled        in the charter school receive special education and related services in        a manner that complies with federal law.         County      Office Of Education Approved Charters       A charter school that is approved by a county office after denial by a school      district may be funded pursuant to the block grant. However, the funding model      cannot be used by county office of education charter schools  for county      office programs  with one exception - the model must apply to any charter      school pupil attending a community school at the request of the parent ( Education      Code  Section 1981(b)). Note that the block grant may not be used to fund      the ADA of pupils attending a community school who have been referred to the      school by a School Attendance Review Board (also  Education Code  Section      1981(b)). County office authorized block grant funded charter schools may      choose direct or local funding.        Basic Aid      District Charters       A charter school sponsored by a basic aid district is entitled to receive      in lieu property taxes at a level that does not exceed the charter school      block grant entitlement. The charter school also is entitled to $120 in state      aid.       Education      Code  Section 47663 provides that if a charter school pupil resides in      a district other than a basic aid district, and attends a charter school in      a district other than his or her district of residence, and that district      of attendance is a basic aid district, then the district of attendance will      receive from the State an amount equal to 70% of the revenue limit of the      district of residence. Further, if a sponsoring school district loses basic      aid status as a result of providing in lieu property tax revenue to sponsored      charter schools, the district will receive a compensatory amount of state      aid, as provided by the statutory formula ( Education Code  Section 47663).           Declining      Enrollment       Education Code  Section 47661 (as amended by Senate Bill 267, Chapter 736,      Statutes of 1999) requires a sponsoring school district to calculate declining      enrollment independent of enrollment changes in the charter school. A district,      however, will not receive declining enrollment funding as a result of a decline      in enrollment due to pupils who change attendance from a district non-charter      school to a district charter school.       All-Charter      Districts       Education Code  Section 47664 allows all-charter school districts the option      of being funded pursuant to the funding model. Once an all-charter district      is funded pursuant to the model, the choice is irrevocable. However, if charter      schools are funded pursuant to the block grant prior to the district converting      all of its schools to charter status, and the district subsequently becomes      an all-charter school district, the district may then choose to be funded      under the revenue limit calculation. It is only in such cases where the choice      to be block grant funded can be changed. Regardless of whether the all-charter      district selects to be funded under the revenue limit calculation or the block      grant, all schools within the school district must be funded under the same      funding method.       For all-charter      school districts electing to be funded through the revenue limit calculation,       Education Code  Section 47664 provides that ADA increases resulting      from pupils who reside outside of the district will be funded at the lesser      of the statewide average base revenue limit per unit of ADA for districts      of similar type or the district's own base revenue limit per unit of ADA.      Increases in ADA shall be measured relative to the 1998-99 fiscal year or      the fiscal year in which all schools in the district were converted to charter      schools, whichever fiscal year is later.     CDE Assistance            We understand that the funding for charter schools may be difficult to understand,      and encourage you to carefully review the language in the law and the information      in this letter.

These funds are,      in effect, an advance apportionment.      The amount to be      received in this August apportionment is for the months of July 1999 through      October 1999 and equals 34 percent of the charter school's projected total      general purpose state aid for the 1999-2000 fiscal year. As with the regular      advance apportionment for school districts, the special apportionment is based      on the prior year second principal apportionment average daily attendance      (a.d.a.) and the revenue limit funding generated by that a.d.a.     We will adjust      the apportionment in November 1999 through January 2000 based upon actual      attendance as reported by the charter school. The attendance reported to CDE      will be the charter school's a.d.a. for its first twenty (20) school days.      To continue to receive this special apportionment funding in November through      January, this a.d.a. must be reported to CDE not later than five business      days immediately following the 20 th  school day. We will provide      the proper form for this attendance report within the next few weeks.     For charter schools      that are funded under the new charter school block grant model as authorized      by Chapter 78, Statutes of 1999 (AB 1115), the apportionment amount for November      through January will be recalculated based on the actual attendance reported      and in accordance with the provisions of the new funding model. That attendance      information will also be used as the initial basis for calculating the categorical      block grant funding, a portion of which will be allocated in November.      The special apportionment      is paid from the state aid portion of the charter school's total funding amount.      Charter schools that are funded pursuant to the AB 1115 model should receive      that portion of their funding that is in lieu of property taxes from the charter      school's sponsoring district, as provided by law. Charter schools that are      not funded under the new model should receive property taxes as agreed to      by the approving local education agency.     For charter schools      that elect to receive funding directly, AB 1115 provides that ""the warrant      shall be drawn in favor of the superintendent of schools of the county in      which the local educational agency that approved the charter or was designated      by the State Board of Education as the oversight agency pursuant to paragraph      (1) of subdivision (k) of Section 47605 is located, for deposit to the appropriate      funds or accounts of the charter school in the county treasury. The county      superintendent of schools is authorized to establish appropriate funds or      accounts in the county treasury for each charter school."" For all other charter      schools, the funds shall be deposited in the appropriate funds or accounts      of the local education agency that granted the charter.     The amount apportioned      to each participating charter school is available on CDE's Web site under      Principal Apportionments at  www.cde.ca.gov/sfsdiv .

This apportionment, like the first special      apportionment in August 1999 is, in effect, an advance apportionment.      This advance      apportionment amount was determined by calculating 58% of the charter school's      annual entitlement, which covers the entire advance apportionment period of      July through January, and then subtracting state aid funds already apportioned      to the charter school in the first special apportionment in August 1999. The      amount to be received is based on a report of average daily attendance (ADA)      for the charter school's first twenty (20) school days in the 1999-2000 fiscal      year. The next apportionment will be the first principal apportionment in      February based on ADA reported for that period, which is July 1, 1999 through      December 31, 1999.       This special      apportionment is based on revenue limits. We will convert to block grant amounts      with the 1999-2000 first principal apportionment in February. Adjustments      to charter school funding will be made to ensure the block grant entitlement      applies to the entire fiscal year.      This apportionment      is the state aid portion of charter school funding. The local revenue portion      should be provided to the charter school by the charter school's sponsoring      local educational agency (LEA) as provided by AB 1115. Charter schools should      have received the in lieu property tax funds in the months of August through      November. These revenues should continue to be allocated monthly by the sponsoring      LEA to the charter school throughout the year.      We expect to      distribute 40 percent of the categorical block grant annual entitlement by      the end of December 1999. The remainder of the categorical block grant will      be provided in at least two subsequent payments, with the next payment of      40 percent in the spring of 2000, and the final payment of 20 percent to follow      after the end of the fiscal year.       For charter      schools that elect to receive funding directly, AB 1115 provides that ""the      warrant shall be drawn in favor of the superintendent of schools of the county      in which the local educational agency that approved the charter or was designated      by the State Board of Education as the oversight agency pursuant to paragraph      (1) of subdivision (k) of Section 47605 is located, for deposit to the appropriate      funds or accounts of the charter school in the county treasury.

GX007-46-8853216	( 英文版 )   鲍威尔说亚洲将得到美国持久的支持    纽约 ─ 美国国务卿科林·鲍威尔6月10日在亚洲协会发表讲话。他表示，亚洲人民和国家在建设和平与繁荣未来的过程中，能够得到美国“实质性的持久支持”。     鲍威尔说，美国“在亚洲的第一目标和首要任务”是帮助建立经济和政治自由蓬勃发展的安全条件。他说，美国将继续成为保证地区稳定的“亚洲安全的平衡因素”。     鲍威尔说：“任何人都不应怀疑，美国致力于亚洲安全与稳定的承诺是持久的，它既是为了亚洲，也是为了我们自己。我们是一个太平洋大国。我们不会放弃在亚洲的战略地位。”     鲍威尔国务卿在长达45分钟的讲话中谈到了这个地区国家取得的进步和存在的问题。他说，大部份国家所给予的重大支持对反恐怖主义斗争和阿富汗的重建做出了贡献。但是，他在讲话中用相当大的篇幅着重谈到了北韩所奉行的危险政策以及美中关系。(详见讲话原文节选)     鲍威尔还提到，美国在亚洲看到了与盟友甚至与原来的敌人进行合作的机会，解决各种由来以久的冲突，结成对付新的全球挑战 ─ 如恐怖主义、艾滋病病毒/艾滋病、贩毒和贩运人口 ─ 的联盟，让普通人民自由地追求自己的希望和梦想，从而以前所未有的规模推进全球的福祉。     他说，从日本做出坚定的反应到马来西亚、泰国和新加坡粉碎恐怖主义基层组织的活动，亚洲国家纷纷加强了执法、边境巡逻和情报合作，使恐怖主义分子难以流窜、联络和策划阴谋，从而对全球反恐行动做出了贡献。有些亚洲国家大力切断假借合法企业或慈善组织的名义开展活动的恐怖组织的资金来源。(详见讲话原文节选)     鲍威尔说：“我毫不怀疑，亚洲国家从任人摆布到经济生龙活虎、从经济生龙活虎到民主化的伟大转变，在这个新的世纪里只会进一步加速。”              “毫无疑问，在前进道路上会遇到种种挫折和危险。可以同样肯定地说，亚洲各国人民有决心，有智慧克服这些挫折和危险。”    以下是鲍威尔国务卿在亚洲协会的讲话节选。     美国国务院  亚洲协会年度餐会上的讲话     国务卿科林· L ·鲍威尔      纽约市   2002年6月10日     (节选一)  两个星期前，我们得到穆沙拉夫总统的保证，他将制止跨越控制线的渗透活动。我们向印度方面转达了这一保证。随后，副国务卿阿米蒂奇这个周末得到了进一步的保证，即：对渗透活动的制止将是有形可见的，永久的，并且将有后续行动，旨在拆除使渗透活动得以展开的营地。     我对印度方面得到穆沙拉夫总统的这一保证感到非常高兴。瓦杰帕伊总理和其他印度领导人最近几天利用这一保证，开始采取进一步行动，来缓和这个地区的紧张局势。印度宣布重新向巴基斯坦开放航空通道是令人欢迎的举动。我们还得到迹象，印度舰队正在从有可能与巴基斯坦交战的状态中撤离。我高兴地看到印度已经任命了驻巴基斯坦的新高级专员，当然该官员将按时得到认可。     作为回应，巴基斯坦对这些行动表示欢迎，我期待穆沙拉夫总统明天将向我们进一步显示出这些行动受到欢迎的程度。     这是迈出的第一步。还有待做出更多努力。我们仍然处在危机阶段。局势仍然非常紧张。我们将继续保持接触。这就是唐·拉姆斯菲尔德部长为什么在结束对北约和海湾的访问之后将于明天前往这个地区，继续进行我们与印度和巴基斯坦的磋商，以便使局势得以开始走向真正的缓和，使印度军队和巴基斯坦军队现在可以朝反方向移动。     正如我们已经对印度和巴基斯坦领导人所说的那样，美国将继续保持接触，与国际联盟一起找到向前迈进的途径，找到开始在它们双方之间展开讨论，开始对话的途径。     各方现在都看到，跨越控制线的渗透活动、跨越控制线的攻击，在程度上减弱了，我对此感到欣慰。我今天还注意到，朝控制线对方的炮击也已经有所缓和。     所以我们对这一进展感到高兴，但是还有很长的路要走，我今晚可以向你们保证，美国将继续保持接触。布什总统给我们确定了一项首要任务，指示我们尽一切努力来找到引导通往稳定与和平而不是战争的途径。      (节选二)  亚洲国家除了在阿富汗做出的努力外，还正在为全球反恐斗争做出贡献：加强执法和边界巡逻，并促进情报合作，从而使恐怖主义分子更难以流窜、联络和策划针对我们的邪恶行径。我们还十分感激不少亚洲国家为杜绝资金流入那些借合法商业或慈善事业的名义运作的恐怖组织而做出的努力。     马来西亚、泰国和新加坡等国政府正在它们的本土上围剿恐怖分子网，逮捕恐怖主义嫌犯和侦察出新的线索，并在反恐斗争中与我们全面合作。    菲律宾武装部队勇猛地抗击了当地恐怖主义组织，这些组织显然有着国际联系。我感到非常骄傲的是，美国军队正在帮助训练和装备菲律宾部队以打击类似阿布萨耶夫之类的组织；正如各位所熟知，该恐怖组织惯于绑架平民进行勒索。    就在上星期，菲律宾部队与扣押两名美国传道士马丁和格拉西娅·伯纳姆夫妇以及菲律宾护士埃迪波拉·亚普的阿布萨耶夫成员进行了交火。伯纳姆夫妇被当作人质扣押了一年。不幸的是，尽管菲律宾政府为了确保人质的安全释放竭尽全力，但马丁·伯纳姆和埃迪波拉·亚普在随后的交火中丧生，格拉西娅·伯纳姆受伤。也有七名菲律宾武装人员负伤。伯纳姆夫人现已回到堪萨斯家中。她是一名伟大而出色的女性，尽管她失去了丈夫，尽管她在过去的一年历尽了那么多的苦难，但她坦然地面对丧夫之痛， 并对菲律宾政府所尽的努力表达了她的感激和敬佩之情。    类似阿布萨耶夫这样的邪恶组织无恶不作，也毫不畏惧任何人。阿布萨耶夫的凶残行径表明，布什总统领导的这场反对一切形式而不仅仅是针对“基地”组织的恐怖主义的全球运动，是何等重要。    我们认识到，一些拥有较大穆斯林人口的亚洲国家，由于存在国内的关注，往往不情愿与恐怖主义发生对抗。它们担心，对恐怖主义分子采取行动将导致出现殉教者。这一担忧源自于一种被极端分子煽起的错误的流行观点，即全球反恐运动是针对伊斯兰的战争。而这是再失真不过的。威胁伊斯兰的并非我们。是恐怖主义者在屠杀，他们屠杀男女及儿童，在违犯伊斯兰教中有关宽容与和平的基本教义。恐怖主义分子威胁着伊斯兰教。他们使一个令人骄傲、崇高的宗教蒙受耻辱。     更大的危险来自对恐怖主义问题的忽略，来自听任激进的少数人对国内政治的操纵，来自未能采取强硬举措打击恐怖主义分子及其支持者。    在9月11日袭击中丧失生命的3000名无辜者当中有来自韩国、中国、台湾、菲律宾、泰国、马来西亚、印度尼西亚、澳大利亚、新西兰以及日本等国的侨民。他们并非是死于恐怖主义分子之手的第一批亚洲人；可悲的是，我们知道他们不会是最后一批；只需回想一下1995年发生在东京地铁里的沙林毒气袭击事件，便可以清楚这一点。     无可置疑的是，恐怖主义是一个全球性的问题，需要继续得到来自各大洲、各个地区、信奉各种教义和各种宗教的国家之果断回应。     (节选三)   如果同恐怖主义和21世纪其它祸害的斗争的复杂性使你怀念相对单纯的冷战时期 ─ 那些黑白分明的时期 ─ 的话，那么，北韩会使人们重新回到现实。北韩具有欺骗性的危险政策将其人民日益拖入贫困和压迫的深渊。    北韩统治者扼杀了国家的经济发展，为了维持大规模的进攻性军事能力，挥霍国家仅存的少量资源。他们生产导弹和大规模毁灭性武器，却不为贫困饥饿的人民生产所需的粮食。     新一代的北韩人不应只能继续过惊恐不安、饥寒交迫的生活。温暖的阳光如今可以普照在日夜漆黑的地方。我们希望北韩人民能接触到各种各样的思想，我们希望他们能加入日益扩大的自由国家人民的大家庭。这就是我们为什么全心全意支持韩国阳光政策的原因。     为了推动这一进程，我们认为平壤应该迅速履行它对汉城所作的承诺。平壤应该建立工业区；应该实施军事互信措施；应该让更多的离散家庭团聚。延长铁路，与南方的铁路连接。今年早些时候，布什总统站在韩国人在三八线附近新修的都罗山火车站。铁轨在位于非军事区的这个漂亮的火车站突然终止。铁轨在那里突然终止，等待着，等待着，等着北方的铁路延伸到此处相接。我希望这一天早日来到。    美国与韩国和日本密切合作，做好了采取重大步骤的准备，帮助北韩推动与美国关系的正常化。我们期待不久与北韩方面举行会晤，探讨这样的步骤。但是，双方关系的进展取决于平壤在一系列重大问题上的表现。     首先，北韩必须停止扩散活动，消除威胁他国的远程导弹。北韩必须使自己不再属于那些无赖国家的首选采购名单。    第二，北韩必须做出更为认真的努力，为其受苦受难的人民提供衣食。美国将继续是世界上向北韩提供人道主义援助的最大捐助国。就在上个星期，布什总统再次批准向北韩捐赠10.2万公吨的食品。我们将继续慷慨资助世界粮食计划署在北韩开展的救济工作，但是，我们希望看到监督工作有大的改善，进入北韩能更加方便，以便确信我们捐赠的食品确实到了饥民的口中。     第三，北韩必须采取行动，缓和常规军事力量的威胁态势。我们正在密切注视平壤是否信守其过去做出的保证，执行与南方建立互信的基本措施。    最后，北韩必须充份接受它在签署核不扩散条约时同意接受的国际原子能机构的保障监督。美国继续承诺遵守有关冻结并最终拆除北韩危险的旧核反应堆代之以更安全的轻水反应堆的框架协议。     2月间，布什总统在汉城明确表示，我们希望朝鲜半岛的和平转变。但是，无论将来发生什么情况，美国军队继续准备以自己的生命保卫韩国人民和韩国的民主。对我来说，这不仅仅是冠冕堂皇之词，这是我的亲身经历，我曾看到为保卫韩国的自由而做出的牺牲。     任何人都不应怀疑，美国致力于亚洲安全与稳定的承诺是持久的，它既是为了亚洲，也是为了我们自己。我们是一个太平洋大国。我们不会放弃在亚洲的战略地位。虽然我们会不断审视我们的立场，考虑做出明智的调整，但我们在可预见的将来，会继续保持在亚太地区的前沿部署军队。我们将继续履行地理位置和历史所赋予我们的安全义务。      (节选四)  在中国，市场的活力显然已经取代了教条主义。中国不再处于文化大革命的动荡中。它不再输出共产主义。它不再是资本主义的敌人。   尽管中国仍有大量的经济问题和其它问题，但它已成为世界上第四大贸易体，仅次于欧盟、美国和日本。它现在是世界贸易组织成员，对法制的国际秩序做出了承诺。     我们同中国的双边关系仅在一年中就取得了长足的进展。去年春天，我们陷入EP-3侦察机的危机之中。有些人怀疑，中国不仅打下了一架飞机，而且打破了建立有成效的关系的希望。今年春天，我们的关系非但没有因这个事件下滑，我们还正在同中国探索从反恐怖主义到贸易自由化和南亚稳定的新的、有前途的合作领域。    在过去一年中，我三次访问中国，其中两次是陪同布什总统。我们目睹了中国的景象是如何在其公民的创业精神和以美国为主的外国投资浪潮的推动下，旧貌换新颜。     人们的期望随着高楼大厦而升高。人们想要汽车，而不是自行车。美国银行和保险公司踊跃地向中国消费者提供从金融服务到便利店的种种服务；相应地，中国的经济发展也惠及美国消费者、工人、农民和企业家。     但与此同时，我毫不怀疑中国的军队想把中国新创造的部份财富用于军队现代化。中国在同其它国家开展贸易并更新军队和设备时，需同我们合作。它需同我们合作来向我们和它的邻国显示它的透明度，告诉我们他们在做什么，从而建立信任并缓和紧张局势。     我们仍对中国继续参与导弹技术和设备的扩散深感关注。中国在承诺与兑现承诺之间存在差距。布什总统在北京的首脑会谈中阐明，中国履行不扩散承诺将对确定美中关系的性质至关重要。     像针对台湾部署新的导弹这种军事集结，只会加剧紧张局势并加深猜疑。中国在解决同台湾的分歧时，是选择和平方式还是高压手段，能在很大程度上向我们说明，中国不仅想同其邻国，而且想同我们建立何种关系。     中国同台湾的分歧从根本上讲是政治性的。它们不能通过军事手段得到解决。    在台湾问题上，美国的立场明确而且不会改变。我们将坚持我们的“一个中国”政策，并继续坚决要求中国大陆和平解决同台湾的分歧。事实上，和平解决方式是制定突破性的中美联合公报的基础，美国非常、非常严肃地对待《台湾关系法》所赋予的责任。     人们在提到台湾时往往称之为“台湾问题”。我说台湾不是一个问题，而是一个成功范例。台湾已成为一个富有活力的经济体和生气勃勃的民主社会，并慷慨地为国际社会做贡献。     中华人民共和国和台湾都在迅速发展。两岸关系中的一个不变常量，是一个以不流血方式解决分歧的共同和长远的利益。在他们直接同对方合作缩小分歧时，我们祝他们成功。他们现在的情形相当好。台湾在大陆的投资达800到1000亿美元。数十万台湾商人和他们的家属在上海一带生活和工作。海峡两岸每天通话50万次。双方正在为和平的、共同的未来奠定基础，我们对此表示称赞。     中国如何使用国内日益增多的财富和在国外日益增强的影响，最终将由中国自己来决定。    美国希望同中国合作，做出与全球领袖地位相称的决定和行动。我们敦促中国同我们以及我们的盟国和友邦共同促进全球的稳定和福祉，向支持或庇护恐怖主义分子的政府施加压力，给陷于危机的地区带去和平，并成为一个反对贫穷、疾病、环境退化和扩散的全球夥伴。     其它很多亚洲国家的经验说明，随着中国继续繁荣并融入国际社会，其公民将不断要求得到更大的个人自由和政治自由。    有人认为中国的情况不同，其文化、历史和面积意味着普通的中国人不关心人权，民主不能在那里发展。我不同意这种看法。    对自由的渴望为人性使然。自由不是一个选择性的软件，只与一些文化匹配，而不与另一些文化兼容。中国的防火长城无法剥夺上天赋予中国人民的权利，也无法剥夺中国人民加入不断壮大的民主大家庭的权利。中国人民有和全世界人民一样的愿望：得到对他们的基本人权的尊重，让自己和后代过上更好的生活，并对国家的未来有真正的发言权。      (节选完)     * * * * * *        回到

GX008-20-3844669	( 英文版 )   美国 - 中国关系的未来    助理国务卿凯利在参议院的证词讲稿全文    (全文开始)     美国 - 中国关系的未来   在参议院外交委员会东亚和太平洋事务小组委员会的证词     詹姆斯·A·凯利   负责东亚和太平洋事务的助理国务卿   2001年5月1日    主席先生，我感谢你和小组委员会成员给我机会，让我首次以负责东亚和太平洋事务的助理国务卿的身份来到这里。我们今天谈中国这个话题正合时宜，因为上个月发生的事情吸引了世界对于这个重要关系的关注。     正如我上星期在本委员会所说，美国在东亚和太平洋地区的国家利益是长期和一贯的。     我们寻求一个稳定、和平的地区，每个政府都能自由地在一个安全和开放的环境中实现经济发展和繁荣。     我们支持国际上公认的行为准则，这些准则确保寻求安全和发展是以透明的方式实现的，是通过和邻国合作，而不是以他们为代价。     美国在亚洲的存在和我们同盟友的关系对该地区的稳定至关重要。这种存在表现在外交、经济和军事方面。让我强调一下，在这后一方面的存在长期以来一直得到该地区大多数国家的欢迎和支持。我们的未来和繁荣，以及我们的盟友的未来和繁荣，都同东亚的未来连在一起。     我无需告诉你中国的发展对这一未来将有多么重要。在经济上和政治上发展的中国有利于美国利益。     最近的事件提出了我们在同中国的关系中处于何种位置和我们希望向何处发展的问题。从我们这方面讲，正如总统所说，我们不把中国看成敌人。在一些问题上，我们把中国看成夥伴；在另一些问题上，我们把中国看成竞争者。国务卿也同样明确地说明了我们对这一关系的看法，他说：“中国是一个竞争者，一个地区性的潜在对手，但它也是贸易夥伴，愿意在我们两国都有战略利益的领域合作，如朝鲜半岛。中国具有所有上述这些特徵；但中国不是敌人，我们面临的挑战就是要继续保持这种状态。” 从倡导朝鲜半岛的和平稳定到不扩散和贸易，我们同中国有共同的利益，一个有成效的、积极的关系对此最为有利。     在说明了这一点之后，我们必须坦率地对待我们的分歧。台湾是其中之一；人权也是，特别是言论自由和表述及实践个人信仰的自由。我们也曾就全球军火贸易和大规模毁灭性武器的扩散这些重要问题向中国表示过关注。驾驭我们同中国关系某些方面的竞争不一定意味不信任和愤怒。正如总统所说，我们将本着相互尊重的精神讨论我们的分歧。     过去几周发生的事情突出显示了不让我们的关系被沟通失误、不信任和误解各自意图及目的所破坏的重要性。一些有影响力的中国人对我们的关系的理解似乎是有缺陷的。我们一向言行明确，中国也必须做到明确。遵循总统的政策，我们一向坚定，但持尊重态度。     我们一向明确说明我们的利益，包括我们根据《台湾关系法》对台湾自我防御的承诺和在国际水域和空域航行和飞行的自由。我们不想针对中国非常激烈的口头批评展开舌战，但在我们的男女军人被扣留在中国11天之后，我们不会一切照旧。北京必须明白这一点。我们通过外交渠道使我们的机组人员返回，并争取让我们的EP-3飞机早日返回。我们一直对需要怎样做非常明确；我们拥有那架飞机并期待中国方面归还它。     广而言之，我们同中国的关系最首先是基于我们的国家安全利益，以及对美国的盟友的作用和影响。     正如国务卿鲍威尔对本委员会所说，日本、韩国、澳大利亚和我们在这个地区的其它盟友都与发展这种建设性关系的过程利害相关。本届政府将同我们在亚洲的盟友磋商并密切合作，以制订一个符合我们长远利益的针对不断变化的新中国的方针。磋商意味着聆听我们的盟友要说的话：他们希望美国在该地区保护和平和促进繁荣方面发挥有力可靠的作用。他们对中国的面积、实力和最近的经济发展有所顾忌。他们不赞成同中国无端地对抗或关系紧张，不管是在他们自己同中国的关系中还是在我们同中国的关系中。我们也不赞成；我们需要坚定地促进和保护我们的国家利益，并明确说明我们在亚洲和在美中关系中的重点。     正如国务卿鲍威尔所说，我们希望同中国的现任领导人和下一代领导人一起努力。为取得成功，我们需要找到同这个不断变化、有时还充满矛盾的国家交往的有效方式。这是一个有时赞成全球化，有时又鼓励强烈的民族主义的国家；一个希望加入世界贸易体系，但又保有保护主义壁垒的国家。     我们将使中国遵守它的双边和国际承诺。如果中国选择漠视其在安全问题、人权、不扩散或贸易这些不同领域中的国际义务，那我们将使用现有的所有政策手段来说服它向更具有建设性的方向发展。     我知道你们对美国同台湾的关系有多感兴趣，我想直接谈谈这个问题。总统在他有关我们最近向台湾出售武器的计划的讨论中表明，我们将继续提供防御武器以使台湾能够保卫自己。要知道，很多人已经注意到中华人民共和国加强了以台湾为重点的军事准备。中国已对我们的决定表示不快。但我们在同中国的会谈中已经明确到了无以复加的地步：我们维持同台湾人民的非官方关系是我们“一个中国”政策的基本组成部份。     与此同时，海峡两岸关系也是复杂的，在有些人看来还是充满矛盾的。双向贸易是10年前的4倍，台湾在大陆的投资也迅速增加。台湾人民看到在大陆有极大的机会。我们赞成并鼓励海峡两岸对话，但不充当调解人的角色。     我们将观察中国如何对我们做出回应。如果这个回应是违背其对于得到世界上大多数国家支持和遵守的国际标准的承诺，那将是令人遗憾的。中国自身的利益和它对促进全球和平、安全和繁荣所负有的责任应指导北京领导层在从人权到不扩散的政策领域坚持国际标准。中国必须象世界上其它国家一样，遵守其全球义务。     我们同中国有成效的关系只能基于对我们的价值观的真实反映。这是我们的最雄厚实力。我们将直截了当地告诉北京，侵犯人权令美国人民无法容忍。历届美国政府都表明：只要美国人相信中国政府蓄意侵犯中国人民最基本的敬神权、和平集会权和公开发表言论权，美中关系就不能发展出其全部潜力。     就这一点，我想让本委员会放心，我们已经着重提出了最近美国公民和合法永久居民被扣押的问题，并将继续这样做。为尽到我们对美国人民的责任，我们针对这一令人担忧的趋势发布了公告，以确保那些计划到中国旅行的美国人了解全部情况。     宗教自由是我们所关注的中国如何对待其人民的核心问题。总统在公开场合以及同中国方面的会谈中都说明了这一点。对几个团体的思想和宗教自由的践踏行为近期有所增加。例如，我们谴责了最近几个月中国取缔家庭教会以及针对法轮功成员的践踏行为，并向北京政府提出了这些问题。当我们看到有关中国在4月13日受难节逮捕了一位79岁的天主教主教的报导后，立即努力对报导进行核实，并敦促，如果报导被证明真实，立即释放这位主教。     我们将继续集中关注西藏。我们正在敦促中国政府各层结束包括使用酷刑、任意逮捕、不经公开审判就拘押和因和平表述政治及宗教观点而拘押的践踏人权的行为。 我们将特别敦促结束针对西藏佛教徒的宗教限制。从长远考虑，我们还将努力保护西藏人独特的文化、宗教和语言遗产。我们继续敦促中国同达赖喇嘛或他的代表进行对话。     我们的贸易关系是中国最新的改革和积极的社会发展。我们同中国确有显著的贸易逆差，我们的进口远远超过我们的出口。但让我们不要忘记2000年我们的出口总额达160亿美元，比前一年增长了18%。我们同中国的贸易符合我们的利益。这不因贸易恰好也对中国有利这一事实而改变。正如总统4月5日在美国报纸主编协会所说的，市场促进美国价值观；贸易鼓励更多的自由和个人解放。你能看到现在这些正在中国发生，贸易带来了更大的开放以及政府对日常生活的控制的减少，特别是在受国际贸易影响最大的沿海地区。我们不宣称贸易将再造中国，但它有所帮助。鉴于这些原因，也鉴于我们的经济利益，以及为帮助促进中国更好地融入国际社会，一旦中国做好满足世界贸易组织标准的准备，美国就支持中国加入世贸组织。 台湾已做好了加入世贸组织的准备，我们预期两者将以非常接近的时间加入世贸组织。     由于同样的原因，我们期待中国主办今年的亚太经合组织首脑会议。总统曾说他计划秋天去上海。他的出席将充份表达出我们致力于中国的市场经济改革。     我们将继续密切注视香港的发展，它即便是作为中国特别行政区，也仍是一个生气勃勃的国际城市。香港仍然不一样。它是一个自由、开放的社会，依靠法治。它的市场是自由的。我们在那里仍有很大的利益 ─ 5万多名美国人在那里生活和工作；而且我们同香港政府在包括执法在内的几个领域中的合作是出色的。我的判断是中华人民共和国总体上遵守了它对基本法和联合声明的承诺，它们规定，除外交事务和国防事务以外，让香港管理自己的事务。自1997年以来有几次例外，但这些突出显示了对于香港大多数居民来说，自治是生活中真正的现实。对一些领域需要有所警惕：根据我们看到的报告，香港的法轮功成员仍能自由练功，这符合香港的特殊地位和世界人权准则。重要的是香港坚持它的宪法原则和法治，并保持香港人民传统上所享有的全部权利和自由。     在其它的一些领域中我们也同中国有共同利益，并希望看到中国继续或扩展其建设性的政策。我们希望加强打击贩毒的合作；中国认识到毒品对中国人民是一个威胁。我们希望和中国一起控制艾滋病及其病毒的泛滥。我们还将在可能的领域继续共同保护环境。     鲍威尔国务卿说，我们非常有意支持中国的法治建设。在中国试图发展一个更透明和更负责任的法律体系时，我们准备好向它提供美国的见解。我们毕竟拥有世界上最开放、最透明和最民主的法律体系。     总而言之，我要强调我们已经阐明了一条明确的路线。中国可以绘制一个对双方都有利的我们未来关系的路线。本届政府希望同北京建立有成效的关系，促进我们的利益和整个亚洲-太平洋地区的利益。我们愿意和中国一道处理我所提到的共同关心的问题。这些问题在我们和中国的双边议事日程上，它们符合我们的国家利益，我们相信中国领导人也会把它们看成是有共同利益的问题。     但我们将坚定地提倡我们的观点：     ─ 我们在支持我们的友邦和在该地区保护我们的共同利益方面不会退缩。     ─ 我们将以我们的价值观为指导，并确保北京理解：如果它继续压迫本国人民，就不能同美国人民建立稳定关系。     ─ 最首要的是，我们将坚持要求中国尊重其双边和国际义务。     中国的表现，特别是在未来几个月里的表现，将决定我们是否发展总统所希望的那种有成效的关系。我们鼓励中国做出能反映出它在国际社会中的地位和它对国际社会的承诺的负责任的选择。     (全文完)        回到 美中关系，2001

These funds support the Pupil Transportation          (Special Purpose), the School Improvement (SIP), and Economic Impact Aid          (EIA) programs. Because enactment of the 2002-03 state budget was significantly          delayed, we are processing this apportionment based on prior year entitlements          in order to provide the timely allocation of funds. However, we have applied          the new 2002-03 monthly allocation provisions, as discussed below, to          the 2001-02 amounts in order to more closely match the actual entitlements,          which will be reflected beginning with the December 2002 apportionment.          The December apportionment also will reflect the enacted version of AB          2781.            The actual 2002-03 levels of funding for Pupil Transportation and SIP            are reduced from prior year levels. LEAs will receive approximately            75 percent of 2001-02 funding for these two programs. Statute requires            the 2002-03 funds be apportioned in the months September through March            with just over 14 percent of the annual entitlement in each month. No            funds will be distributed in April, May and June. However, special Pupil            Transportation and SIP funds are already appropriated for 2003-04, to            be allocated in July 2003. The July 2003 apportionment equals about            28 percent of the 2001-02 funding in these two areas.           Regarding Economic Impact Aid, the 2002-03 budget appropriates $498.6            million statewide for the program, which includes a growth increase            of 5 percent, and a cost of living adjustment of 2 percent. Allocations            to LEAs will follow the traditional special purpose formula of 10 percent            monthly for 10 months beginning in September.            The Summary of Apportionment and the Monthly Payment Schedule show            subtotals for the SIP and Transportation funds. One monthly warrant            for the sum of the programs included on this apportionment will be made            by the State Controller.

Exhibit            I/I-S lists the fiscal year 2002-03 Estimated Home-to-School and Special            Education Transportation allowances for each participating LEA. Please            note the following:                        The fiscal year              2002-03 Estimated Home-to-School and Special Education allowances              have been adjusted for fiscal year 2001-02 reorganizations and/or              transfers of service that were submitted prior to September 1, 2002.              The fiscal year              2002-03 estimated allowances are equal to 73.2 percent of the fiscal              year 2001-02 allowances.              The estimated              allowances will be recertified at a later date to include prior year              corrections and 1.37 percent for growth and 2.00 percent for cost-of-living              adjustments (COLA) as provided by the 2002-03 budget.                      For standardized            account code structure (SACS) coding, use Resource Code 7230, Transportation–Home            to School, or Resource Code 7240, Transportation–Special Education            (SH/OH), and Revenue Object Code 8311, Other State Apportionments–Current            Year, for either Home-to-School or Special Education Transportation.            For prior year adjustments, use Revenue Object Code 8319, Other State            Apportionments-Prior Year. For non-SACS coding, use Income Account Code            8342, Home-to-School Transportation or Income Account Code 8347, Special            Education Transportation.           School Improvement            Program (SIP)  – Assembly Bill 2781, Section 45 appropriates            $313.9 million for SIP ($259.7 million for K-6, and $54.2 million for            grades 7-12). In addition, Assembly Bill 2781 Section 50(a)(1) makes            a special appropriation of $115.2 million for SIP for the beginning            of 2003-04, which equals about 27 percent of the combined 2002-03 and            July 2003 appropriations for this program.                         In Exhibit II, the amounts in the column entitled “Amount for            Each Operating District or LEA” are to be credited to the account            of school districts or LEAs indicated in the first column. The list            of member school districts in cooperatives (second column) and the amount            of entitlements for these school districts (third column) are information            for use by the county superintendents for school districts involved            in cooperative programs.           There is no restriction            on the amount of School Improvement Program funds that may be carried            over from year to year. For standardized account code structure (SACS)            coding, use Resource Codes 7260, School Improvement Program-Grades K            to 6, and 7265, School Improvement Program-Grades 7 to 12. All grades            K-12 use Revenue Object Code 8311, Other State Apportionments-Current            Year. For non-SACS coding, please use Income Account Code 8344, School            Improvement Program.            Economic            Impact Aid (EIA)  – Assembly Bill 425 appropriates $498.6            million to the EIA program. Fiscal year 2002-03 entitlements will be            calculated by December 2002. Pursuant to AB 2781, Section 49, funds            equaling one-tenth of the estimated EIA total amount certified will            be paid in the months September through June.           In Exhibit III,            the amounts in the column entitled “Amount for Each Operating            District or Local Educational Agency” are credited to the account            of school districts or LEAs indicated in the first column.           There is no restriction            on the amount of EIA funds that may be carried over from one year to            the next. For SACS coding, use Resource Code 7090, Economic Impact Aid,            and Revenue Object Code 8311, Other State Apportionments-Current Year.            For non-SACS coding, use Income Account Code 8346, Economic Impact Aid.           Supplemental            Grants Roll-In  – No Supplemental Grant funding is provided            in 2002-03. As such, no allocations will be made for Supplemental Grants            which contribute to the SIP and EIA program selections made pursuant            to  Education Code  Section 54761.2 in 2002-03. However, Assembly            Bill 2781 appropriates $ 241,739,000 for a special supplemental grant            apportionment in July 2003.            SIP and            EIA for Charter Schools  – Beginning fiscal year 2002-03,            all charter schools, except for certain districts with all schools converting            to charter status, will be funded through the charter school block grant            funding model pursuant to  Education Code  Section 47633 et.            seq., which includes funds for SIP and EIA purposes. These funds are            allocated as part of the revenue limit Principal Apportionment process.            Charter enrollment and average daily attendance will be excluded from            district totals when computing the 2002-03 entitlements.           For purposes of            Pupil Transportation, however,  Education Code  Section 47612            deems a charter school to be a school district. As such, to establish            base transportation funding for a charter school, the district must            determine its cost to transport the charter school students previously            served by the district. This will establish the separate transportation            funding base for the charter school and result in a corresponding reduction            to the district’s allowance.            More Information/Questions           County offices of            education should notify their LEAs of the information included in this            apportionment.

These            funds support the Pupil Transportation (Special Purpose), School Improvement            (SIP), and Economic Impact Aid (EIA) programs.           Pursuant to  Education Code  section 14041(a)(5), these program            allocations equal 10 percent of the annual entitlement for the ten months            of September 2003 through June 2004. In October 2003, this apportionment            is being recertified to include new EIA and revised SIP fiscal year            2003-04 entitlements. The October warrant for each local educational            agency (LEA) will equal two-tenths of the newly certified amount, less            the amount paid to the LEA in September. Thereafter, in general, one-tenth            of the amount certified in October will be included in the warrants            for the months from November 2003 through June 2004. This apportionment            will be recertified as necessary in future months due to revised entitlements.           The Summary of Apportionment and the Monthly Payment Schedule show            subtotals for the Transportation, SIP, and EIA funds. The State Controller            will issue one warrant to each County (that includes all associated            LEAs) for the total payment of all programs in this apportionment.             Notice, Summary, and Exhibits Enclosed                        Notice of the Recertified Special Purpose Apportionment:              Pupil Transportation (Special Purpose), School Improvement Program,              and Economic Impact Aid, Fiscal Year 2003-04              Schedules of Apportionments-Computer Printout Tabulations              School Improvement Program - Exhibit II              Economic Impact Aid – Exhibit III              Summary of Apportionments by County              Monthly Payment Schedule                       Program Notes           Pupil Transportation  – There has been no change to the            annual entitlement previously certified.           School Improvement Program  – The 2003-04 Budget Act provides            $320,360,000 for Kindergarten and grades 1-6 (K-6) SIP entitlements            and $66,830,000 for grades 7-12 SIP entitlements; no funding was included            for growth or COLA in either program. There were no SIP funding deferrals            in the 2003-04 budget, however, the total appropriation was reduced            from the prior year level. Fiscal year 2003-04 funding for K-6 equals            each district’s fiscal year 2002-03 allocation (total of funds            allocated during the fiscal year plus funds deferred to 2003-04) reduced            by 9.59 percent. Funding for grades 7-12 utilizes fiscal year 2002-03            First Period (P1) Report of Average Daily Attendance (ADA) for each            participating school multiplied by the following rates: grades 7-8,            approximately $32.27 or $114.66 per ADA; grades 9-12, $82.72 per ADA.            These grade 7-12 rates reflect the 2002-03 funding rates, including            funds deferred to 2003-04, reduced by approximately 6.9118 percent.           The September payment certified for SIP was based on actual K-6 entitlements            and estimated grade 7-12 entitlements. This October recertification            reflects actual entitlements for both K-6 and grades            7-12, that will also be included in Part II of the 2003-04 Consolidated            Application.           In Exhibit II, the amount in the column entitled “Amount for            Each Participating District” should be credited to the account            of the school district or LEA indicated in the first column. The list            of member school districts in cooperatives (third column) and the respective            entitlement amounts (sixth column) are provided as information for use            by the county superintendents.           There is no restriction on the amount of SIP funds that may be carried            over from year to year. For standardized account code structure (SACS)            coding, use Resource Codes 7260, School Improvement Program-Grades K            to 6, and 7265 (optional) School Improvement Program-Grades 7 to 12.            All grades K-12, use Revenue Object Code 8311, Other State Apportionments-Current            Year. For non-SACS coding, please use Income Account Code 8244, School            Improvement Program.           Economic Impact Aid  – This October EIA apportionment allocates            to districts their newly calculated fiscal year 2003-04 EIA entitlement            amount. The 2003-04 Budget Act provides $498,682,000 million for EIA;            no funding was included for growth or COLA.           The following will apply for fiscal year 2003-04 entitlements: districts            will receive no less than the minimum funding rate ($220.78) multiplied            by the sum of their October 2002 district California Work and Responsibility            to Kids (CalWORKs) count plus their Spring 2002 district English Learner            (EL) count. Each district will receive at least $4,901 (1 to 10 CalWORKs            plus EL), or $7,356 (11 or more CalWORKs plus EL). There is a ""hold            harmless"" of 85 percent, which means that no district will receive            less than 85 percent of their fiscal year 2002-03 entitlement.           In Exhibit III, the amount in the column entitled “Amount for            Each Operating District or Local Educational Agency” should be            credited to the account of the respective school district or LEA indicated            in the first column.           There is no restriction on the amount of EIA funds that may be carried            over from year to year. For SACS coding, use Resource Code 7090, Economic            Impact Aid, and Revenue Object Code 8311, Other State Apportionments-Current            Year. For non-SACS coding, use Income Account Code 8346, Economic Impact            Aid.           Supplemental Grants Roll-In  – Allocations for Supplemental            Grants which may contribute to the Transportation, SIP, and EIA program            selections made pursuant to  Education Code  section 54761.2            will be paid in a separate apportionment.           Transportation, SIP and EIA for Charter Schools  – Beginning            in fiscal year 2002-03, all charter schools, except for district wide            charters, are being funded through the charter school block grant funding            model pursuant to  Education Code  section 47633 et seq. This            funding model includes categorical block grant funds in lieu of various            categorical programs, including Transportation, SIP and EIA. These block            grant funds are allocated as part of the revenue limit Principal Apportionment            process. Charter enrollment and ADA are excluded from district totals            when computing the 2003-04 entitlements for SIP and EIA. For purposes            of Pupil Transportation, however,  Education Code  section 47612            deems a charter school to be a school district. As such, to establish            base transportation funding for a charter school, the district must            determine its cost to transport the charter school students previously            served by the district. This will establish the separate transportation            funding base for the charter school and result in a corresponding reduction            to the district’s allowance.             Additional Information/Questions           County offices of education should immediately notify LEAs in their            county of the information included in this apportionment. In addition,            this letter, along with the summary and monthly payment schedule, will            be posted on the California Department of Education’s Web site            at < www.cde.ca.gov/fiscal/categorical >.

These            funds support the Pupil Transportation (Special Purpose), the School            Improvement Program (SIP), and Economic Impact Aid (EIA) programs.           Pursuant to  Education Code  section 14041(a)(5), the program            allocations will be 10 percent of the annual entitlement for the ten            months of September 2003 through June 2004. In October 2003, this apportionment            will be recertified to include new fiscal year 2003-04 EIA and SIP entitlements,            which have not been finalized as of this date. This apportionment will            be recertified again in December 2003 to correct excesses or deficiencies            in accordance with  Education Code  section 41334.           The December warrant for each local educational agency (LEA) will equal            four-tenths of the newly certified amount, less the amounts paid to            the LEA from September through November. Thereafter, in general, one-tenth            of the amount certified in December will be included in the warrants            for the months from January through June 2004.

The fiscal            year 2003-04 entitlements have been adjusted for fiscal year 2002-03            reorganizations and/or transfers of service that were submitted prior            to September 1, 2003 and prior year corrections submitted by June 30,            2003. Please note the following:                       Exhibit I, Column 6, lists the fiscal year 2003-04 Home-to-School              advance for each participating school district and county office of              education. This is the estimated transportation allowance for regular              pupils and special education pupils not severely handicapped or orthopedically              handicapped. When Home-to-School Transportation is recertified in              April with data collected on either Form TRAN or Form J-141 for fiscal              year 2002-03, school districts and county offices of education will              be entitled to the lesser of their 2002-03 approved Home-to-School              expenses or their fiscal year 2002-03 Home-to-School entitlement (including              any supplemental grant add-on for fiscal 2002-03).             Exhibit I-S, Column 4, lists the fiscal year 2003-04 Special Education              Transportation advance for each participating school district and              county office of education. This is the estimated transportation allowance              for special education pupils that are severely handicapped or orthopedically              handicapped (SH/OH). When Special Education Transportation is recertified              in April with data collected on either Form TRAN or Form J-141-S,              school districts and county offices of education will be entitled              to the lesser of their 2002-03 approved SH/OH expenses or their fiscal              year 2002-03 Special Education entitlement.             LEAs unable to fully expend their fiscal year 2002-03 entitlements              and/or supplemental grant add-on (in the case of home-to-school transportation)              due to the deferrals will not have their entitlements reduced for              2003-04. The LEA must spend any unexpended 2002-03 deferred amounts              as well as the fiscal year 2003-04 entitlements (including any supplemental              grant add-on) during fiscal year 2003-04 to avoid reduction of the              fiscal year 2004-05 entitlements.              The appropriation for fiscal year 2003-04 was not sufficient to              fully fund the estimated allocations and a deficit factor of 0.925381437              has been applied to each program. Since               AB 1754 deferred $50M of transportation funding to fiscal year 2004-05,              that portion of the 2003-04 allocation not paid in fiscal year 2003-04              will be paid in fiscal year 2004-05.                     Note: Prior year exhibits amended by corrections were processed in            August 2003 and have been included for your information.

For prior year adjustments, use            Revenue Object Code 8319, Other State Apportionments-Prior Year. For            non-SACS coding, use Income Account Code 8342, Home-to-School Transportation            or Income Account Code 8347, Special Education Transportation.           School Improvement Program (SIP)  – The 2003-04 Budget            Act provided $320,360,000 for K-6 School Improvement Program entitlements;            no funding was included for growth or COLA. The Budget Act also provided            $66,830,000 for grades 7-12; no funding was included for growth or COLA.            SIP did not experience any funding deferrals in the 2003-04 budget.            Payments will be made in ten installments beginning in September 2003            and ending in June 2004. The September payment is based on actual K-6            entitlements and estimated entitlements for grades 7-12. Final entitlements            should be available for the next certification, which will be in October.           In Exhibit II, the amounts in the column entitled “Amount for            Each Operating District or LEA” should be credited to the account            of school districts or LEAs indicated in the first column. The list            of member school districts in cooperatives (second column) and the amount            of entitlements for these school districts (third column) are information            for use by the county superintendents for school districts involved            in cooperative programs.           There is no restriction to the amount of School Improvement Program            funds that may be carried over from year to year. For standardized account            code structure (SACS) coding, use Resource Codes 7260, School Improvement            Program-Grades K to 6, and 7265 (optional) School Improvement Program-Grades            7 to 12. All grades K-12, use Revenue Object Code 8311, Other State            Apportionments-Current Year. For non-SACS coding, please use Income            Account Code 8244, School Improvement Program.           Economic Impact Aid (EIA)  – The September Special Purpose            apportionment allocates to districts their fiscal year 2002-03 EIA entitlement            amount. The October Special Purpose Apportionment recertification will            reflect the actual fiscal year 2003-04 entitlements.            In Exhibit III, the amounts in the column entitled “Amount for            Each Operating District or Local Educational Agency” should be            credited to the account of school districts or LEAs indicated in the            first column.            There is no restriction to the amount of EIA funds that may be carried            over from year to year. For SACS coding, use Resource Code 7090, Economic            Impact Aid, and Revenue Object Code 8311, Other State Apportionments-Current            Year. For non-SACS coding, use Income Account Code 8346, Economic Impact            Aid.           Supplemental Grants Roll-In  – Allocations for Supplemental            Grants which may contribute to the Transportation, SIP, and EIA program            selections made pursuant to  Education Code  section 54761.2            will be paid in a separate apportionment.           Transportation, SIP and EIA for Charter Schools  – Beginning            in fiscal year 2002-03, all charter schools, except for certain districts            with all schools converting to charter status, are being funded through            the charter school block grant funding model pursuant to  Education            Code  section 47633 et seq. This funding model includes categorical            block grant funds in lieu of various categorical programs, including            SIP and EIA. These block grant funds are allocated as part of the revenue            limit Principal Apportionment process. Charter enrollment and average            daily attendance are excluded from district totals when computing the            2003-04 entitlements for SIP and EIA. For purposes of Pupil Transportation,            however,  Education Code  section 47612 deems a charter school            to be a school district. As such, to establish base transportation funding            for a charter school, the district must determine its cost to transport            the charter school students previously served by the district. This            will establish the separate transportation funding base for the charter            school and result in a corresponding reduction to the district’s            allowance.            Additional Information/Questions           County offices of education should notify LEAs in their county of the            information included in this apportionment. In addition, this apportionment            letter will be posted on the California Department of Education’s            Web site at < www.cde.ca.gov/fiscal/categorical >.

These            funds support the Pupil Transportation (Special Purpose), the School            Improvement, and the Economic Impact Aid Programs. Pursuant to  Education            Code  Section 14041(a)(5), the program allocations are paid in ten            monthly installments, which began in September 2001. In the months September            and October, the State Controller issued warrants to each county treasurer            for one-tenth of the total amount certified to the county. This apportionment            is currently recertified to correct excesses or deficiencies in accordance            with  Education Code  Section 41334. The November warrants will            include three-tenths of the amount certified, less the amounts paid            in September and October. Thereafter, one-tenth of the amount certified            in November will be included in the warrants for the months from December            2001 through June 2002. Please note that additional recertification            of the apportionment amounts may occur between the months of December            2001 and June 2002 due to revised data or additional legislation. If            necessary, the monthly payment schedule will be adjusted accordingly            to reflect payments already made.                                                                 I.

Special Purpose Apportionment           Pupil Transportation -The transportation exhibits mailed to you            in September with the September 2001 certification remain unchanged.           School Improvement Program (SIP) -The SIP apportionment has been            recertified only for Los Angeles and Santa Cruz counties. For all other            counties, there has been no change to the funds previously certified.           Please note that the 2001-02 fiscal year rates are as follows: The            targeted K-6 ceiling rate was increased to $127.46 per October 2000            CBEDS enrollment. Districts with current funding levels under the ceiling            rate were increased at a minimum by the 3.87 cost-of-living-adjustment.            Current rates for grades 7-8 are $33.99 per unit of fiscal year 2000-01            First Principal Apportionment average daily attendance (P-1 ADA), or            $120.76 (depending on the respective funding level) per P-1 ADA. For            grades 9-12, the current rate is $87.13 per P-1 ADA.           In Exhibit II, the amounts in the column entitled ""Amount for            Each Operating District or Local Educational Agency"" are to be            credited to the account of school districts or local educational agencies            (LEAs) indicated in the first column. The list of member school districts            in cooperatives (second column) and the amount of entitlements for these            school districts (third column) are information for use by the county            superintendents for school districts involved in cooperative programs.           There is no restriction on the amount of SIP funds that may be carried            over. For standardized account code structure (SACS) coding, use Resource            Codes 7260, School Improvement Program-Grades K to 6, and 7265, School            Improvement Program-Grades             7 to 12. All grades K-12 use Revenue Object Code 8311, Other State Apportionments-Current            Year. For non-SACS coding, please use Income Account Code 8344, School            Improvement Program.            Economic Impact Aid (EIA) - The fiscal year 2001-02 budget appropriation            for the EIA program in Item 6110-128-0001 was originally deleted, but            later restored through SB 735, which was signed by the Governor October            14, 2001           The minimum funding rate for the October 2000 California Work Opportunity            and Responsibility to Kids (CalWORKs) population plus Spring 2000 English            Language Learners (ELL) has increased to $199.56. The minimum district            entitlement is $4,805 (for districts with from 1 to 10 CalWORKs plus            ELL), or $7,211 (11 or more CalWORKs plus ELL).           In Exhibit III, the amounts in the column entitled ""Amount for            Each Operating District or Local Educational Agency"" are to be            credited to the account of school districts or LEAs indicated in the            first column.                     There is no restriction on the amount of EIA funds that may be carried            over. For standardized account code structure (SACS) coding, use Resource            Code 7090, Economic Impact Aid, and Revenue Object Code 8311, Other            State Apportionments-Current Year. For non-SACS coding, use Income Account            Code 8346, Economic Impact Aid.           Supplemental Grants Roll-Ins -Allocations for Supplemental Grants            selections made pursuant to  Education Code  Section 54761.2 will            be paid in a separate apportionment.           Charter School Funds -SIP and EIA programs are included in the            charter school block grant funding model pursuant to Chapter 6 (commencing            with Section 47630) of Part 26.8 of the  Education Code . Therefore,            charter schools that are participating in the model will receive their            SIP and EIA funding as part of the categorical component of the charter            school block grant, which is allocated as part of the Principal Apportionment.            The enrollment and/or ADA data for these charter schools have been excluded            from the enrollment and/or ADA data that generate SIP and EIA funding            for the chartering agency. Charter schools that are not participating            in the charter school block grant funding model will receive their SIP            and EIA funding through their             chartering agency. The Pupil Transportation program allocations included            in this apportionment are for school districts and county offices of            education. For purposes of Pupil Transportation,  Education Code             Section 47612 deems charter schools to be school districts. Therefore,            to receive transportation funding, the charter school must negotiate            a transfer of service from the school district previously transporting            the students. This will establish a separate transportation allowance            for the charter school.           Questions -LEAs should consult their county office of education            regarding this apportionment. In addition, this apportionment letter            will be posted on the California Department of Education Web site at:             www.cde.ca.gov/fiscal/categorical .
