In a study published in the July 10 issue of the journal  Nature,  a multi-institution team, led by the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, reported it had sequenced 99.4 percent of the gene-containing region of chromosome 7 to an accuracy of greater than 99.99 percent. The team also described its analysis of this highly accurate reference sequence, an effort that took advantage of recently released data on the mouse genome to refine gene predictions and zero in on chromosomal regions that may be of special interest in understanding genetic diseases.    In addition to representing the largest chromosome to date to undergo detailed sequence analysis, chromosome 7 is significant because it has served as a pioneering chromosome for genomic and genetic studies. Researchers first developed genome mapping techniques on chromosome 7, and in the late 1980s, this chromosome was also the first to be searched by a then-novel technique called positional cloning in the successful hunt for the cystic fibrosis gene.    ""Chromosome 7 has long been of interest to the medical community. Besides containing many genes that are crucial to development, this chromosome also holds the gene for cystic fibrosis and is frequently damaged in some types of leukemia and other cancers,"" said Francis S. Collins, M.D., Ph.D., director of the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), which funded, and also participated in, the study. ""This new analysis, coupled with our commitment to free and unrestricted access to sequence data, should further speed the discovery of genes on chromosome 7 related to human health and disease.""    Among the study's most interesting results was the finding that, compared with previously analyzed human chromosomes, chromosome 7 contains an unusually high amount of duplicated sequence segments, covering roughly 8 percent of its DNA sequence. Researchers do not yet know the mechanism behind this high rate of duplication and also do not know why the duplication is much more extensive on the short arm of chromosome 7 than on its long arm.    However, in their study, researchers noted that this segmental duplication may encourage the type of genetic deletions that cause disease, as appears to be the case with the chromosomal region implicated in Williams-Beuren syndrome. The syndrome, which is characterized by growth deficiency, heart disorders and mild mental retardation, is associated with very large deletions in a region of the long arm of chromosome 7 — a region that the new analysis also found to be a hotbed of duplicated segments. Based on previous, smaller-scale studies, genetic scientists know that such duplicated segments, or duplicons, serve to encourage large-scale deletions and other dramatic rearrangements of genetic material. It is also known that, in addition to their potential to cause disease by disrupting genes, such genetic rearrangements may on rare occasions be beneficial by facilitating the formation of new genes.    Richard K. Wilson, Ph.D., director of the Washington University School of Medicine's Genome Sequencing Center and lead author of the study, said, ""Our findings underscore the dynamic nature of the human genome and reveal how sequence structure may provide us with new insights into the genetic basis of human disease. But this analysis also drives home the fact that we still have a long way to go — that we are just taking our first steps down the pathway to understanding the complicated interplay of genomics and health. Each chromosome that we analyze will likely add a new twist or turn.""   In their analysis of the highly polished reference sequence, Dr.Wilson and his colleagues identified approximately 1,150 protein-coding genes on chromosome 7, about 20 percent less than the 1,455 predicted in a previous study by a different team.   The accuracy and completeness of the human chromosome 7 sequence assembled by the International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium was evaluated in part by Eric D. Green, M.D., Ph.D., and his colleagues at NHGRI's Genome Technology Branch. When they compared the representation of markers called sequence-tagged sites (STSs) in the recently assembled sequence with STSs in previously constructed physical and genetic maps of chromosome 7, the NHGRI researchers found an excellent overall concordance.    Dr. Green, who is NHGRIs scientific director and a co-author of the study, also emphasized the value of comparing the sequence of human chromosome 7 to its recently sequenced counterpart in the mouse. ""Comparing the human sequence to the mouse sequence allowed our team to perform much more rigorous analyses of genes than would have otherwise been possible. The ability to place the human sequence alongside the mouse sequence helped us to swiftly distinguish real, protein-coding genes from pseudo-genes. The power of comparative genomics really sharpened our focus,"" Dr. Green said.    In addition to NHGRI and Washington University, other institutions taking part in the chromosome 7 analysis were: University of Washington Genome Center, Seattle; University of California, Santa Cruz; Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Cleveland; and EMBL, Heidelberg, Germany.    There are 23 pairs of chromosomes in the human genome, which bear the 3 billion DNA letters that carry the genetic blueprint for human life. Chromosome 7 is one of the larger chromosomes, containing about 5 percent of the DNA in the human genome.    The sequencing work on chromosome 7 was carried out at the Genome Sequencing Center at the Washington University School of Medicine as part of the Human Genome Project, which receives substantial funding from NHGRI. The Human Genome Project officially began in October 1990 and was completed in April 2003. The entire project, including genetic mapping, technology development, the study of model organisms, and the ethical, legal and social implications (ELSI) program, was completed more than two years ahead of schedule at a cost that was $400 million less than expected.    The initial analysis of the draft human genome sequence was published in  Nature  in February 2001. With the completion of the Human Genome Project, researchers plan to publish a separate analysis on each completed chromosome over the next year or so. In addition to chromosome 7, researchers with the International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium have already published analyses of chromosomes 14, 20, 21, 22 and Y.

The UROD gene produces an enzyme called uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase.  This enzyme is responsible for the fifth step in heme production.  Heme is the portion of hemoglobin that carries oxygen in the blood from the lungs to the rest of the body.  Each of the steps in heme production is controlled by a separate gene (see below).  Uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase causes the removal of carbon and oxygen from uroporphyrinogen III (the product of the fourth step in the production of heme) to form coproporphyrinogen III.  Three additional enzymes must modify this product before it becomes heme.     The following genes are related to UROD.

Most of these mutations are unique to this type of porphyria, and have not been found in porphyria cutanea tarda.  Mutations that cause hepatoerythropoietic porphyria reduce the activity of the enzyme made by UROD to less than 10 percent of normal.  Low levels of this enzyme prevent heme from being produced normally.  As a result, byproducts of heme production called porphyrins build up in the body, causing the symptoms seen with this type of porphyria.     porphyria cutanea tarda  - caused by mutations in the UROD gene     At least 28 mutations that can cause porphyria cutanea tarda have been identified in the UROD gene.  These mutations usually reduce the activity of the enzyme made by UROD by 50 percent throughout the body.  (In rare cases, the enzyme's activity is reduced only in the liver.)  As a result, byproducts of heme production called porphyrins are allowed to build up in the body, particularly in the liver. This buildup, in combination with nongenetic factors (such as alcohol, smoking, certain hormones, excess iron, and viral infections), causes the symptoms seen in this type of porphyria.

The UROD gene produces an enzyme called uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase.  This enzyme is responsible for the fifth step in heme production.  Heme is the portion of hemoglobin that carries oxygen in the blood from the lungs to the rest of the body.  Each of the steps in heme production is controlled by a separate gene (see below).  Uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase causes the removal of carbon and oxygen from uroporphyrinogen III (the product of the fourth step in the production of heme) to form coproporphyrinogen III.  Three additional enzymes must modify this product before it becomes heme.     The following genes are related to UROD.

Most of these mutations are unique to this type of porphyria, and have not been found in porphyria cutanea tarda.  Mutations that cause hepatoerythropoietic porphyria reduce the activity of the enzyme made by UROD to less than 10 percent of normal.  Low levels of this enzyme prevent heme from being produced normally.  As a result, byproducts of heme production called porphyrins build up in the body, causing the symptoms seen with this type of porphyria.     porphyria cutanea tarda  - caused by mutations in the UROD gene     At least 28 mutations that can cause porphyria cutanea tarda have been identified in the UROD gene.  These mutations usually reduce the activity of the enzyme made by UROD by 50 percent throughout the body.  (In rare cases, the enzyme's activity is reduced only in the liver.)  As a result, byproducts of heme production called porphyrins are allowed to build up in the body, particularly in the liver. This buildup, in combination with nongenetic factors (such as alcohol, smoking, certain hormones, excess iron, and viral infections), causes the symptoms seen in this type of porphyria.

Heme is the portion of hemoglobin that carries oxygen in the blood from the lungs to the rest of the body.  Each of the steps in heme production is controlled by a separate gene (see below).  Uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase causes the removal of carbon and oxygen from uroporphyrinogen III (the product of the fourth step in the production of heme) to form coproporphyrinogen III.  Three additional enzymes must modify this product before it becomes heme.     The following genes are related to UROD.

Most of these mutations are unique to this type of porphyria, and have not been found in porphyria cutanea tarda.  Mutations that cause hepatoerythropoietic porphyria reduce the activity of the enzyme made by UROD to less than 10 percent of normal.  Low levels of this enzyme prevent heme from being produced normally.  As a result, byproducts of heme production called porphyrins build up in the body, causing the symptoms seen with this type of porphyria.     porphyria cutanea tarda  - caused by mutations in the UROD gene     At least 28 mutations that can cause porphyria cutanea tarda have been identified in the UROD gene.  These mutations usually reduce the activity of the enzyme made by UROD by 50 percent throughout the body.  (In rare cases, the enzyme's activity is reduced only in the liver.)  As a result, byproducts of heme production called porphyrins are allowed to build up in the body, particularly in the liver. This buildup, in combination with nongenetic factors (such as alcohol, smoking, certain hormones, excess iron, and viral infections), causes the symptoms seen in this type of porphyria.

The UROD gene produces an enzyme called uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase.  This enzyme is responsible for the fifth step in heme production.  Heme is the portion of hemoglobin that carries oxygen in the blood from the lungs to the rest of the body.  Each of the steps in heme production is controlled by a separate gene (see below).  Uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase causes the removal of carbon and oxygen from uroporphyrinogen III (the product of the fourth step in the production of heme) to form coproporphyrinogen III.

The UROD gene produces an enzyme called uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase.  This enzyme is responsible for the fifth step in heme production.  Heme is the portion of hemoglobin that carries oxygen in the blood from the lungs to the rest of the body.  Each of the steps in heme production is controlled by a separate gene (see below).  Uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase causes the removal of carbon and oxygen from uroporphyrinogen III (the product of the fourth step in the production of heme) to form coproporphyrinogen III.  Three additional enzymes must modify this product before it becomes heme.     The following genes are related to UROD.

Most of these mutations are unique to this type of porphyria, and have not been found in porphyria cutanea tarda.  Mutations that cause hepatoerythropoietic porphyria reduce the activity of the enzyme made by UROD to less than 10 percent of normal.  Low levels of this enzyme prevent heme from being produced normally.  As a result, byproducts of heme production called porphyrins build up in the body, causing the symptoms seen with this type of porphyria.     porphyria cutanea tarda  - caused by mutations in the UROD gene     At least 28 mutations that can cause porphyria cutanea tarda have been identified in the UROD gene.  These mutations usually reduce the activity of the enzyme made by UROD by 50 percent throughout the body.  (In rare cases, the enzyme's activity is reduced only in the liver.)  As a result, byproducts of heme production called porphyrins are allowed to build up in the body, particularly in the liver. This buildup, in combination with nongenetic factors (such as alcohol, smoking, certain hormones, excess iron, and viral infections), causes the symptoms seen in this type of porphyria.

The UROD gene produces an enzyme called uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase.  This enzyme is responsible for the fifth step in heme production.  Heme is the portion of hemoglobin that carries oxygen in the blood from the lungs to the rest of the body.  Each of the steps in heme production is controlled by a separate gene (see below).  Uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase causes the removal of carbon and oxygen from uroporphyrinogen III (the product of the fourth step in the production of heme) to form coproporphyrinogen III.  Three additional enzymes must modify this product before it becomes heme.     The following genes are related to UROD.

Most of these mutations are unique to this type of porphyria, and have not been found in porphyria cutanea tarda.  Mutations that cause hepatoerythropoietic porphyria reduce the activity of the enzyme made by UROD to less than 10 percent of normal.  Low levels of this enzyme prevent heme from being produced normally.  As a result, byproducts of heme production called porphyrins build up in the body, causing the symptoms seen with this type of porphyria.     porphyria cutanea tarda  - caused by mutations in the UROD gene     At least 28 mutations that can cause porphyria cutanea tarda have been identified in the UROD gene.  These mutations usually reduce the activity of the enzyme made by UROD by 50 percent throughout the body.  (In rare cases, the enzyme's activity is reduced only in the liver.)  As a result, byproducts of heme production called porphyrins are allowed to build up in the body, particularly in the liver. This buildup, in combination with nongenetic factors (such as alcohol, smoking, certain hormones, excess iron, and viral infections), causes the symptoms seen in this type of porphyria.

The UROD gene produces an enzyme called uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase.  This enzyme is responsible for the fifth step in heme production.  Heme is the portion of hemoglobin that carries oxygen in the blood from the lungs to the rest of the body.  Each of the steps in heme production is controlled by a separate gene (see below).  Uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase causes the removal of carbon and oxygen from uroporphyrinogen III (the product of the fourth step in the production of heme) to form coproporphyrinogen III.  Three additional enzymes must modify this product before it becomes heme.     The following genes are related to UROD.     ALAD :aminolevulinate, delta-, dehydratase    ALAS1 :aminolevulinate, delta-, synthase 1    ALAS2 :aminolevulinate, delta-, synthase 2 (sideroblastic/hypochromic anemia)    CPO :coproporphyrinogen oxidase (coproporphyria, harderoporphyria)    FECH :ferrochelatase (protoporphyria)    HMBS :hydroxymethylbilane synthase    PPOX :protoporphyrinogen oxidase    UROS :uroporphyrinogen III synthase (congenital erythropoietic porphyria)          What conditions are related to the UROD gene?       hepatoerythropoietic porphyria  - caused by mutations in the UROD gene     At least 11 mutations in the UROD gene have been identified in families with hepatoerythropoietic porphyria.  Most of these mutations are unique to this type of porphyria, and have not been found in porphyria cutanea tarda.  Mutations that cause hepatoerythropoietic porphyria reduce the activity of the enzyme made by UROD to less than 10 percent of normal.  Low levels of this enzyme prevent heme from being produced normally.  As a result, byproducts of heme production called porphyrins build up in the body, causing the symptoms seen with this type of porphyria.     porphyria cutanea tarda  - caused by mutations in the UROD gene     At least 28 mutations that can cause porphyria cutanea tarda have been identified in the UROD gene.  These mutations usually reduce the activity of the enzyme made by UROD by 50 percent throughout the body.  (In rare cases, the enzyme's activity is reduced only in the liver.)  As a result, byproducts of heme production called porphyrins are allowed to build up in the body, particularly in the liver. This buildup, in combination with nongenetic factors (such as alcohol, smoking, certain hormones, excess iron, and viral infections), causes the symptoms seen in this type of porphyria.           Where is the UROD gene located?     1p34   This means that the UROD gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 1 at position 34.

GTP cyclohydrolase is the enzyme produced by the GCH1 gene. This enzyme is responsible for the first of three steps in the manufacture of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4). BH4 is essential for the proper function of phenylalanine hydroxylase, the enzyme that processes the amino acid phenylalanine in the body. GTP cyclohydrolase activity is increased by phenylalanine because more BH4 is needed to process the amino acid.   When BH4 levels are high the enzyme is suppressed because there is already plenty of this substance in the cell.  BH4 also helps produce certain chemicals in the brain, called neurotransmitters, that transmit signals between nerve cells.       What conditions do mutations in the GCH1 gene cause?     Tetrahydrobiopterin deficiency   At least three mutations that cause BH4 deficiency (a lack of BH4) have been identified in the GCH1 gene.  These mutations mostly or completely inactivate the GTP cyclohydrolase enzyme, particularly in the liver and white blood cells.  As a result, BH4 cannot be produced. In the absence of BH4, the body cannot process phenylalanine correctly. Neurotransmitters in the brain are also affected, resulting in delayed development, seizures, movement disorders, and other symptoms.   Other disorders   Low levels of the GTP cyclohydrolase enzyme also cause a disorder called dopa-responsive dystonia.  This condition is characterized by progressive movement disorders similar to Parkinson disease and symptoms that become worse in the evenings.  At least 29 mutations in the GCH1 gene have been identified in patients with dopa-responsive dystonia.  These mutations reduce the activity of the GTP cyclohydrolase enzyme in the liver and white blood cells, but some activity remains in the liver.  Low levels of this enzyme reduce the amount of an important chemical called dopamine in the brain, resulting in the symptoms of the disorder.     Where is the GCH1 gene located?     14q22.1-q22.2   This means that the GCH1 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 14 between positions 22.1 and 22.2.

Two molecules of nucleotide bases held            together by weak bonds. Two strands of DNA are held together in the            shape of a double helix by the bonds between base pairs. The number            of base pairs is used to describe the size of a DNA molecule.                                   Chromosome:             The self-replicating genetic structure of cells containing the cellular            DNA that bears in its nucleotide sequences the linear array of genes.            In prokaryotes, chromosomal DNA is circular, and the entire genome is            carried on one chromosome. Plant genomes consist of a number of chromosomes            whose DNA is associated with different kinds of proteins.                          Clone:             An exact copy made of biological material such as a DNA segment            (a gene or other region), a whole cell, or a complete organism.                                   Cloning            Vector:  A piece of DNA, such as a plasmid, into which a DNA segment            can be inserted, transferred into an organism, and replicated or reproduced.                                     DNA            (deoxyribonucleic acid):  The molecule that encodes genetic information.            DNA is a double stranded molecule held together by weak bonds between            base pairs of nucleotides. The four nucleotides in DNA contain the bases:            adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), and thymine (T). In nature,            base pairs form only between A and T and between G and C; thus the base            sequence of each single strand can be deduced from that of its partner.                                     EST:            Expressed Sequence Tag:  A unique, short DNA sequence derived from            a cDNA library. ESTs are useful for localizing and orienting the mapping            and sequence data reported from many different laboratories and serve            as identifying landmarks on the developing physical map of a plant genome.                                     Expression            Pattern:  Gene expression is the process by which a gene's coded            information is converted into the structures or molecules present and            operating in the cell. Expression pattern refers to a set of genes expressed            under a set conditions (e.g. genes expressed in plants grown under drought            condition).                          Functional            Genomics:  Studies of the relationship between the structure and            organization of the genome and the function of the genome as it directs            growth, development, physiological activities, and other life processes            of the organism.                          GenBank:             A public database where DNA sequences are deposited and made public.            It is operated and supported by the National Library of Medicine, part            of the National Institutes of Health, and is part of an international            consortium of a gene sequence database.                                           Gene:                 The fundamental physical and functional unit of heredity. A                gene is an ordered sequence of nucleotides located in a particular                position on a particular chromosome that encodes a specific functional                product (i.e., a protein or RNA molecule).                                  Genetic                Map:  A map of the relative positions of genetic loci on a chromosome,                determined on the basis of how often the loci are inherited together.                                                 Genetics:                 The study of the patterns of inheritance of specific traits.                                                 Genome:                 All the genetic material in the chromosomes of a particular                organism; its size is generally given as its total number of base                pairs.                                  Genome                Project:  Research and technology development effort aimed at                mapping and sequencing some or all of the genome of human beings                and other organisms.                                  High                Throughput Biology:  An experimental approach that generates                massive amounts of raw data at the production scale using highly                automated technologies such as genome sequencing technology or microarray                technology, and processes the data by a batch method using computational                and other information management tools.                                  Human                Genome Project:  The national effort, led by DOE and NIH, was started in the               late 1980's. It includes several projects to (1) create an ordered                set of DNA segments from known chromosomal locations, (2) develop                new computational methods for analyzing genetic map and DNA sequence                data, and (3) develop new techniques and instruments for detecting                and analyzing DNA. While the ultimate objective is to understand                the structure, organization and function of the human genome, the                Human Genome Project supports studies on several model microbial                and animal genomes. No plant genomes are targeted by the Human Genome                Project.                                  Informatics:                 The study of the application of computer and statistical techniques                to the management of information. In genome projects, informatics                includes the development of methods to search databases quickly,                to analyze DNA sequence information, and to predict protein sequence                and structure from DNA sequence data.                                  Library:                 An unordered collection of clones (i.e., cloned DNA from a particular                organism), whose relationship to each other can be established by                physical mapping.                                  Microarray                Technology:  New approach to the study of how large numbers of                genes interact with each other. This technology provides a quantitative                assessment of how a cell's regulatory networks control extensive                gene sets simultaneously. The method uses a robot to precisely apply                tiny droplets containing functional DNA to glass slides. Researchers                then attach fluorescent labels to DNA from the cell they are studying.                The slides are put into a scanning microscope that can measure the                brightness of each fluorescent dot; brightness reveals how much                of a specific DNA fragment is present, an indicator of how active                it is.                                Physical              Map:  A map of the physical locations of identifiable landmarks              on DNA (e.g., restriction enzyme cutting sites, genes); distance is              measured in base pairs. The highest resolution map would be the complete              nucleotide sequence of the chromosomes.                              Reverse              Genetics:  An experimental approach that begins with information              about the primary DNA or protein sequence and uses this knowledge              to generate targeted mutations (heritable changes) or altered expression              levels. Observation of the resulting effects on the organism (a physical              attribute such as the color of the flower or the shape of the leaf)              yields information about the physiological function of the gene or              protein. This is the reverse strategy to a classical genetics approach              that proceeds from observing a defined genetic trait towards obtaining              sequence information for a specific gene.                              Sequencing:               Determination of the order of nucleotides (base sequences) in              a DNA or RNA molecule or the order of amino acids in a protein.                                         Structural              Genomics:  Studies of the structure and organization of the genome              including DNA sequencing and physical and genetic mapping.                                         Syntenic              Map:  Chromosomal maps showing the collinear relationships between              the genomes of different organisms. Often these chromosomal regions              from related organisms (such as various grass species) contain corresponding              genetic information and similar gene order.                              Technology              Transfer:  The process of converting scientific findings from research              laboratories into useful products by the commercial sector.

GX033-04-2977959	National Plant Genome Initiative (October 1999 Report): Glossary                                                                              Glossary                                     Base            Pair (bp):  Nucleotide bases (adenine, thymine, guanine and cytosine)            are the building blocks of DNA. Two molecules of nucleotide bases held            together by weak bonds. Two strands of DNA are held together in the            shape of a double helix by the bonds between base pairs. The number            of base pairs is used to describe the size of a DNA molecule.                                   Chromosome:             The self-replicating genetic structure of cells containing the cellular            DNA that bears in its nucleotide sequences the linear array of genes.            In prokaryotes, chromosomal DNA is circular, and the entire genome is            carried on one chromosome. Plant genomes consist of a number of chromosomes            whose DNA is associated with different kinds of proteins.                          Clone:             An exact copy made of biological material such as a DNA segment            (a gene or other region), a whole cell, or a complete organism.                                   Cloning            Vector:  A piece of DNA, such as a plasmid, into which a DNA segment            can be inserted, transferred into an organism, and replicated or reproduced.                                     DNA            (deoxyribonucleic acid):  The molecule that encodes genetic information.            DNA is a double stranded molecule held together by weak bonds between            base pairs of nucleotides. The four nucleotides in DNA contain the bases:            adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), and thymine (T). In nature,            base pairs form only between A and T and between G and C; thus the base            sequence of each single strand can be deduced from that of its partner.                                     EST:            Expressed Sequence Tag:  A unique, short DNA sequence derived from            a cDNA library. ESTs are useful for localizing and orienting the mapping            and sequence data reported from many different laboratories and serve            as identifying landmarks on the developing physical map of a plant genome.                                     Expression            Pattern:  Gene expression is the process by which a gene's coded            information is converted into the structures or molecules present and            operating in the cell. Expression pattern refers to a set of genes expressed            under a set conditions (e.g. genes expressed in plants grown under drought            condition).                          Functional            Genomics:  Studies of the relationship between the structure and            organization of the genome and the function of the genome as it directs            growth, development, physiological activities, and other life processes            of the organism.                          GenBank:             A public database where DNA sequences are deposited and made public.            It is operated and supported by the National Library of Medicine, part            of the National Institutes of Health, and is part of an international            consortium of a gene sequence database.                                           Gene:                 The fundamental physical and functional unit of heredity. A                gene is an ordered sequence of nucleotides located in a particular                position on a particular chromosome that encodes a specific functional                product (i.e., a protein or RNA molecule).                                  Genetic                Map:  A map of the relative positions of genetic loci on a chromosome,                determined on the basis of how often the loci are inherited together.                                                 Genetics:                 The study of the patterns of inheritance of specific traits.                                                 Genome:                 All the genetic material in the chromosomes of a particular                organism; its size is generally given as its total number of base                pairs.                                  Genome                Project:  Research and technology development effort aimed at                mapping and sequencing some or all of the genome of human beings                and other organisms.                                  High                Throughput Biology:  An experimental approach that generates                massive amounts of raw data at the production scale using highly                automated technologies such as genome sequencing technology or microarray                technology, and processes the data by a batch method using computational                and other information management tools.                                  Human                Genome Project:  The national effort, led by DOE and NIH, was started in the               late 1980's. It includes several projects to (1) create an ordered                set of DNA segments from known chromosomal locations, (2) develop                new computational methods for analyzing genetic map and DNA sequence                data, and (3) develop new techniques and instruments for detecting                and analyzing DNA. While the ultimate objective is to understand                the structure, organization and function of the human genome, the                Human Genome Project supports studies on several model microbial                and animal genomes. No plant genomes are targeted by the Human Genome                Project.                                  Informatics:                 The study of the application of computer and statistical techniques                to the management of information. In genome projects, informatics                includes the development of methods to search databases quickly,                to analyze DNA sequence information, and to predict protein sequence                and structure from DNA sequence data.                                  Library:                 An unordered collection of clones (i.e., cloned DNA from a particular                organism), whose relationship to each other can be established by                physical mapping.                                  Microarray                Technology:  New approach to the study of how large numbers of                genes interact with each other. This technology provides a quantitative                assessment of how a cell's regulatory networks control extensive                gene sets simultaneously. The method uses a robot to precisely apply                tiny droplets containing functional DNA to glass slides. Researchers                then attach fluorescent labels to DNA from the cell they are studying.                The slides are put into a scanning microscope that can measure the                brightness of each fluorescent dot; brightness reveals how much                of a specific DNA fragment is present, an indicator of how active                it is.                                Physical              Map:  A map of the physical locations of identifiable landmarks              on DNA (e.g., restriction enzyme cutting sites, genes); distance is              measured in base pairs. The highest resolution map would be the complete              nucleotide sequence of the chromosomes.                              Reverse              Genetics:  An experimental approach that begins with information              about the primary DNA or protein sequence and uses this knowledge              to generate targeted mutations (heritable changes) or altered expression              levels. Observation of the resulting effects on the organism (a physical              attribute such as the color of the flower or the shape of the leaf)              yields information about the physiological function of the gene or              protein. This is the reverse strategy to a classical genetics approach              that proceeds from observing a defined genetic trait towards obtaining              sequence information for a specific gene.

The slides are put into a scanning microscope that can measure the                brightness of each fluorescent dot; brightness reveals how much                of a specific DNA fragment is present, an indicator of how active                it is.                                Physical              Map:  A map of the physical locations of identifiable landmarks              on DNA (e.g., restriction enzyme cutting sites, genes); distance is              measured in base pairs. The highest resolution map would be the complete              nucleotide sequence of the chromosomes.                              Reverse              Genetics:  An experimental approach that begins with information              about the primary DNA or protein sequence and uses this knowledge              to generate targeted mutations (heritable changes) or altered expression              levels. Observation of the resulting effects on the organism (a physical              attribute such as the color of the flower or the shape of the leaf)              yields information about the physiological function of the gene or              protein. This is the reverse strategy to a classical genetics approach              that proceeds from observing a defined genetic trait towards obtaining              sequence information for a specific gene.                              Sequencing:               Determination of the order of nucleotides (base sequences) in              a DNA or RNA molecule or the order of amino acids in a protein.

Syntenic              Map:  Chromosomal maps showing the collinear relationships between              the genomes of different organisms. Often these chromosomal regions              from related organisms (such as various grass species) contain corresponding              genetic information and similar gene order.

GX012-21-12421094	NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH     National Human Genome Research Institute                   FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Thursday, June 1, 2000       Contact: Cathy Yarbrough  (301) 594-0954   cyarbrou@mail.nih.gov     April Thompson  (301) 594-2825    thompsoa@mail.nih.gov              Down Syndrome Research Expedited by Decoding of Human Chromosome 21  - Second Human Chromosome Sequenced by                                                    Human Genome Project         Scientists in Japan and Germany will report in an upcoming issue of Nature that they have unraveled the genetic code of human chromosome 21, already known to be involved with Down syndrome, Alzheimer disease, Usher syndrome and Lou Gehrigs disease.    It is the second human chromosome whose DNA has been fully deciphered by the Human Genome Project, the international consortium of scientists dedicated to spelling out, or sequencing, the 3 billion chemical letters of human DNA. These scientists are providing that data immediately at no cost and without restrictions to all scientists in industry and academia. Chromosome 22 was the first human chromosome to be sequenced. An international collaboration of Human Genome Project scientists reported on that milestone in the Dec. 2, 1999 issue of Nature.    The DNA sequences of both chromosomes are finished. The sequence data is highly accurate - since each area of the chromosome has been read about 9 times. The only gaps in the sequence are areas of the chromosome that cannot be deciphered or read with current technology. The scientists have identified the location and size of each of the gaps.    Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Human Genome Research Institute of the National Institutes of Health, applauded the scientists who sequenced chromosome 21 for their achievement.   Knowing the DNA script of chromosome 21, scientists are better equipped to answer the many questions about the origins of Down syndrome, Alzheimer disease and other disorders, said Dr. Collins. People who are born with Down syndrome, characterized by varying degrees of mental retardation, heart defects and immune system deficiencies, have an extra copy of chromosome 21. Most people have two copies of each chromosome. People with Down syndrome have three copies of this chromosome.    Why does having three copies of chromosome 21 cause Down syndrome? And why are some people with Down syndrome minimally affected, while others are more severely retarded?    By looking at the organization of the genes on chromosome 21 and how they and their protein products function, scientists can find clues about Down syndrome as well as other disorders, including Alzheimer disease, certain cancers, and manic depressive illness, which have also been linked to this chromosome, he added.    Each human gene is made up of a series of chemical building blocks represented by letters, A (adenine), T (thymine), G (guanine) and C (cytosine). The number and order of these letters, also called bases, determine the genetic contribution to what we are, how we look, and the diseases to which we may be predisposed.    With the complete sequence of chromosome 21 available, scientists can better understand where genes are located on the chromosome, how they are expressed, how changes that give rise to disease-causing mutations occur, and how chromosomes are duplicated and inherited.    With the complete DNA sequence of multiple chromosomes in hand, scientists can study structural similarities between and among chromosomes as well as shared sequences.    In deciphering chromosome 21, scientists used the strategy that has been developed and widely tested by the Human Genome Project. This strategy involves sequencing overlapping cloned segments of DNA from known locations on the chromosome. Because they know the areas of the chromosomes that are represented in the overlapping clones, the scientists can accurately take the sequence of thousands of A, T, C and Gs that was read from each clone, lay out the data according to locations of the individual clones on the chromosomes and in that way reconstruct the sequence of the entire chromosome.    The Human Genome Project will compile a finished, stand the test of time version of the DNA sequence of all 23 pairs of human chromosomes by 2003 or sooner. A working draft version of the sequence already is 85 percent complete. That data is 99.9 percent accurate based on reading each area of the chromosome 4 to 5 times.

The BRCA1 gene belongs to a class of genes known as tumor suppressors.   Like other tumor suppressor genes, BRCA1 regulates the cycle of cell division by keeping cells from growing and dividing too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way.  In particular, it inhibits the growth of cells that line the milk ducts in the breast.   The protein made by the BRCA1 gene is directly involved in the repair of damaged DNA.  In the nucleus of many types of normal cells, the BRCA1 protein interacts with the protein produced by the RAD51 gene to mend breaks in DNA.  These breaks can be caused by radiation, but also occur naturally when chromosomes exchange genetic material.  BRCA2, which has a function similar to that of BRCA1, also interacts with RAD51.  By repairing DNA, these three proteins play a role in maintaining the stability of the human genome.   Research suggests that both BRCA1 and BRCA2 regulate the activity of other genes and play a critical role in embryo development.  The BRCA1 protein probably interacts with many other proteins, including tumor suppressors and regulators of the cell division cycle.     These genes interact to repair damaged DNA.     BRCA2 :breast cancer 2, early onset    RAD51 :RAD51 homolog (RecA homolog, E. coli) (S. cerevisiae)          What conditions are related to the BRCA1 gene?       breast cancer  - increased risk from mutations in the BRCA1 gene     Researchers have identified more than 600 mutations in the BRCA1 gene, many of which are associated with an increased risk of cancer. These mutations can be changes in one or a small number of DNA base pairs, or, in some cases, large rearrangements of DNA. A mutated BRCA1 gene usually makes a protein that does not function properly because it is abnormally short. Researchers believe that the defective BRCA1 protein is unable to help fix mutations that occur in other genes. These defects accumulate and may allow cells to grow and divide uncontrollably to form a tumor.     other cancers - increased risk from mutations in the BRCA1 gene     In addition to breast cancer, mutations in the BRCA1 gene also increase the risk of ovarian, prostate, and colon cancers.           Where is the BRCA1 gene located?     17q21   This means that the BRCA1 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 17 at position 21.

The ARHI gene is a member of a family of genes called ras.  Genes in this family play an important role in the control of cell growth and the determination of cell type.  Like other members of the ras gene family, ARHI is involved in regulating cell growth.  ARHI differs from other ras family genes, however, in that it probably acts as a tumor suppressor.  (Tumor suppressor genes regulate the cycle of cell division by keeping cells from growing and dividing too fast or in an uncontrolled way.)   The ARHI gene makes a protein called ras homolog I.  This protein is located in the cytoplasm and cell membrane of normal cells in the breasts and ovaries; however, it is not produced in breast or ovarian cancer cells.  The ras homolog I protein probably regulates the growth of cells by interacting with proteins that control the cell division cycle.   One copy of the ARHI gene, the copy inherited from a person's mother, is silent (nonfunctional) throughout life.  Only the copy inherited from a person's father is active.  ARHI is the first tumor suppressor gene with this property known to be involved in adult human cancers.         What conditions are related to the ARHI gene?       breast cancer  - associated with mutations in the ARHI gene     Research has shown that ARHI gene function is often lost in breast cancer cells.  Because one copy of the gene is normally inactive, an error in the single active copy can lead to a nonfunctional gene.  Possible errors include the deletion of a piece of chromosome 1 containing the gene and mutations in the gene itself.  An absent or defective ARHI gene does not produce a functional ras homolog I protein to regulate cell growth.  Potentially, this could cause cells in the breast to grow and divide uncontrollably and form a tumor.     ovarian cancer - associated with mutations in the ARHI gene     The ARHI gene is often nonfunctional in ovarian cancer cells as well.  As in breast cancer cells, this could allow cells in the ovaries to grow and divide uncontrollably and form a tumor.           Where is the ARHI gene located?     1p31   This means that the ARHI gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 1 at position 31.

Alzheimer disease is a degenerative disease of the brain that causes gradual loss of memory, judgment, and ability to function socially.   Genetic factors cause the following types of Alzheimer disease.     Alzheimer disease, type 1   Alzheimer disease, type 2   Alzheimer disease, type 3   Alzheimer disease, type 4     Additional types of Alzheimer disease have been reported, but the responsible mutations have not been adequately described, or the cause is not genetic.   Memory loss is the most common sign of this disease. The loss of memory becomes more than the usual forgetfulness experienced by all older people. Even in familiar settings, a person with Alzheimer disease may get lost or become confused. Normal daily tasks, such as doing simple math and naming objects and people, become challenging. Preparing meals, doing laundry, and performing other household chores can also become difficult. Problems with dressing, eating, and personal care as well as agitation, restlessness, and inappropriate behavior develop as the disease progresses. In addition, personality changes and an inability to interact in a socially appropriate manner are common.  The patient's speech eventually becomes difficult to understand, and the individual may require total care.  The course of the disease is usually 8 to 10 years, but can range from 1 to 25 years.     How common is Alzheimer disease?     Alzheimer disease currently affects about 4 million Americans.  Because more people are living longer, this number is expected to triple in the next 20 years.       What genes are related to Alzheimer disease?                Mutations in the   APP ,   PSEN1  and   PSEN2  genes cause Alzheimer disease.   Mutations in the   APOE  gene increase the risk of developing Alzheimer disease.   About 75 percent of Alzheimer disease cases are classified as sporadic, which means that no other blood relatives are affected.  The cause of these cases is not known at this time, but genetics may play a part.  The risk of developing the condition increases as a person gets older.   The remaining 25 percent of Alzheimer disease cases are hereditary, which means they are caused by mutated genes and tend to cluster in families.  These cases can be divided into early-onset disease (symptoms begin before 65 years of age) and late-onset disease (symptoms begin after age 65).   Researchers have identified three genes that cause early-onset Alzheimer disease.  The amyloid beta precursor protein (APP) gene, presenilin 1 (PSEN1) gene, and presenilin 2 (PSEN2) gene lead to Alzheimer disease types 1, 3, and 4, respectively.   The genetic causes of late-onset Alzheimer disease are less clear.  No gene that definitely causes the condition has been identified.  However, a gene called APOE has been studied extensively as a risk factor for the disease.  In particular, one form (or allele) of this gene seems to increase an individual's risk for developing type 2 Alzheimer disease.       How do people inherit Alzheimer disease?     The early-onset forms of Alzheimer disease (types 1, 3, and 4) are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means only one copy of the altered gene is necessary to cause the disorder. In most cases, an affected person has one affected parent.       Where can I find information about Alzheimer disease?     You may find the following resources about Alzheimer disease helpful.

The APP gene makes a protein called amyloid beta precursor protein. This protein is located on the surface of cells in many tissues and organs.  Researchers believe that the protein may help nerve cells grow and move, and may also act as a switch to turn particular genes on and off; however, its exact functions have not yet been proven.  Amyloid beta precursor protein is anchored across the cell membrane, so part of it is inside and part is outside the cell. Certain enzymes in the cell can cut the protein into three pieces, one of which, the amyloid beta peptide, is released outside the cell. Normally, amyloid beta peptide does not accumulate in excess in the brain to cause the symptoms of Alzheimer disease.   The APP gene produces at least 10 different types of the amyloid beta precursor protein.  Some of these types are more likely than others to be found in specific parts of the body.  For example, the version called APP695 is most common in the brain.         What conditions are related to the APP gene?       Alzheimer disease, type 1  - caused by mutations in the APP gene     Several different mutations in the APP gene can cause type 1 Alzheimer disease; however, these mutations are responsible for a very small percentage of all Alzheimer disease cases.  The most common APP mutation is a substitution of the amino acid isoleucine for valine at position 717, also written as Val717Iso. Mutations in the APP gene lead to the formation of an abnormal version of a protein fragment called amyloid beta peptide.  When this peptide is released from the cell, it can accumulate in the brain to form clumps called amyloid plaques.  These clusters of proteins are characteristic of Alzheimer disease and may be associated with the symptoms of the disorder.           Where is the APP gene located?     21q21   This means that the APP gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 21 at position 21.

Gene : A small stretch              of DNA that directs the production of proteins. A hereditary unit              that occupies a specific position (locus) on the chromosome. This              unit has a specific effect on the physical characteristics of the              organism.             Gene mapping :              Finding the relative positions of genes on a DNA molecule (chromosome)              and of the distance between them.             Genetics : The study              of heredity.             Hereditary  disease:              A physical disorder that is inherited from parents or grandparents              rather than caused by environmental factors.

Consists of not one project, but rather hundreds of separate research              projects conducted throughout the world. The objective is to create              a directory of the genes that can be used to answer questions such              as what specific genes do and how they work.             Inherited trait :              Ways of looking or being that are caused by the genetic make-up or              environment of a living organism.             Learned traits :              Ways of looking or being that are caused by the environment of a living              organism.             Molecule : A chemical              entity consisting of two or more atoms of the same or different elements              chemically bonded together.
