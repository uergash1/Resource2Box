GX049-01-0769511	"The Clamor Over Clams     Uses For Clams      You probably remember seeing clams while fishing, or perhaps you found them to be good skipping stones in your younger days. Most people don't equate the ""skipping stone"" clams with the deepfried ones at local restaurants, but they are closely related.   Are North Dakota clams edible? The answer is a qualified yes. However, eating them may not be without some health risk.   The clams' low position on the food chain and manner of feeding allow for ingestion of unhealthy by-products of human activities, which may be in our lakes, rivers, and streams. When a clam filters out the micro-organisms from sediments, it may also be absorbing toxics such as heavy metals, pesticides, industrial pollutants, and naturally occurring toxics such as arsenic.   If North Dakota clams aren't in demand for their edible qualities, why were they such an interesting subject at coffee shops and in government offices around the state? Are there other uses for clams we may not realize? As a matter of fact there are.   Up until the 1960s, almost everybody in this country used clams on a daily basis. They probably didn't know it, but many buttons were once made of pieces of clam shells. Clam beds in the big rivers of the southern and eastern United States were commercially harvested for their shells, which were used to make pearl buttons. Southern states, in particular, have a long tradition of mussel harvesting and many people made their living picking, selling, and buying shells for the button industry.   With the advent of plastics and other synthetic materials, the demand for mussel shells dropped dramatically. However, in recent years interest in commercially harvesting mussels has boomed. A new use for mussel shells has emerged and the pressure to harvest large quantities of shells has become intense.   The cultured pearl industry has discovered a quick way to make pearls by taking a piece of high quality mussel shell and inserting it into a living oyster. Naturally occurring pearls are deformities inside the shell of a clam or oyster. When a piece of foreign matter, such as a grain of sand, gets lodged between the organism's shell and inner tissues, the oyster covers it with a secretion or nacre called mother-of-pearl. Over the course of several years more layers are laid around the intruding piece of material, forming a hard, white-colored object, known as a pearl. Sometimes these pearls are spherical, others are differently shaped.   Pearls are valuable because they are rare and demand is high. Cultured pearls are desirable because they can be created relatively fast by taking large pieces of mussel shells that are the same color as mother-of-pearl and adding only a layer or two of nacre. This will save up to several years of time, thus more pearls can be produced quicker and cheaper. By using perfectly round pieces of shell, you can get consistently round pearls for a less expensive price so more people can afford to buy them.   Oriental cultures value powdered pearls as a medicinal treatment. Pearls are also used by biological supply houses and for some costume jewelry production.

Jake Wolf Fish Hatchery exhibit.                A new market appeared for shells. The Japanese had discovered in 1909 that a mussel shell nucleus inserted into a pearl oyster produced a much higher quality cultured pearl than the lead beads they had been using. The size of the nucleus (not just the length of the growing period) determines the size of the finished pearl.    As World War II ended, soldiers returned with pearl jewelry from Japan. A demand was created for Japanese pearls. A revival in mussel gathering began during the 1960s when the Japanese who did not have a continuous source of mussel shell in Japan, expanded their search for shell material to use in cultured pearl production for trade with China and the United States. The Japanese bought and shipped train-car loads of Three-ridge, Pig-toe, Warty-back, and Washboard mussel shells from the Midwestern United States. A ton of shells yielded about 60 pounds of nuclei.    The process of making pearl nuclei was to cut small cubes of shell, tumble and pressure-grind them into small balls, and insert them into salt-water oysters. Within a year the oysters had secreted a thin layer of nacre around the mussel shell to create a cultured pearl          . The nacre in the shell nucleus would not crack when the pearl was drilled for stringing.    This new market kept many Illinois musselers in business throughout the 1950s and 1960s digging shells for export. For example, in 1966 almost 2 million pounds of shells were harvested from the Wabash and White Rivers in eastern Illinois for this purpose, and shellers in Pearl, Illinois were still shipping shell to Japan in 1987.

GX048-61-5729137	THE PRESENT STATUS OF SHELLFISH CULTURE IN JAPAN   HISASHI KAN-NO 1  and TOMOO HAYASHI 2    INTRODUCTION    In 1969, shellfish production (including pearl oysters) in Japan was 561,132 tons worth 58,444 million yen ( Table 1 ). Types of shellfish products landed during the past decade have changed because of certain effects on the environment and changes in commercial demands. Shellfish, like  Meretrix,  which live along the coastal area, have decreased remarkably in production because of the loss of their habitat from industrialization. In 1969, the oyster industry in the Seto Inland Sea area was seriously affected because the oysters were heavily fouled by the calcareous tube worm,  Hydroides norvegica.  For the past several years, production in the pearl industry has declined because of reduced demand for pearls. On the other hand, landings of scallops, abalone, and top shell, so-called high grade products, have been increasing yearly both in tonnage and value because of the demand by the consumer for fresh marine products. Production through aquaculture has remained commercially stable in Japan.   In the past, shellfish aquaculture in Japan was limited, strictly speaking, to oysters and pearls. Recently, both scallops and abalone are being grown using aquaculture techniques. In general, aquaculture requires three important techniques: 1) to catch the juveniles in desirable places with collectors, 2) to produce seed for culture using hatchery (artificial) techniques, and 3) to cultivate the seed to market size in the field. Aquaculture techniques are being utilized to grow oysters, pearls, and scallops, and it is expected that abalone will also be produced in the near future through aquaculture.   In my presentation at the first UJNR (United States-Japan Natural Resources) Aquaculture Panel meeting, I would like to explain briefly about the present status of shellfish aquaculture in Japan and its prospects for the future.   OYSTER CULTURE    Production of oysters ( Crassostrea gigas ) has rapidly increased since the 1950's because of the development of hanging culture. Strings of oysters are hung from racks, rafts, or longlines, depending on water depth. Hanging culture makes good use of the water column and is not limited by depth or nature of bottom. In 1969, production was 245,458 tons (including shell) valued at 8,149 million yen ( Table 1 ).   The first operation in oyster culture is to catch the juveniles (seed). Strings of shells are suspended during the summer spawning season from racks placed in coastal areas such as bays and inlets. After setting, the seed is hardened, a process of draping the strings over racks so that they are out of water for a considerable period of time during each tidal cycle. Hardening results in an increased percentage of survival, better growth rates, and less fouling. In northern Japan, almost all commercial oyster seed production takes place in Miyagi Prefecture. At present, oyster seed production supplies not only domestic uses, but also supplies some 30,000 to 50,000 cases of seed per year to the Pacific coast of the United States and to parts of Europe, principally France.   Two methods of hanging oyster culture are usually practiced in southern Japan. In the first method, seed oysters are transplanted to the rafts about 1 mo after setting to grow; no hardening is done. These oysters are harvested at the end of 1 yr. This method is characterized by a short growing period and low labor costs. In the second method, seed oysters are hardened until autumn or early winter. They are then transferred to the rafts to grow and are not harvested until the following year (known as 2-yr culture).   The best oyster producing area in Japan is in the Seto Inland Sea where calm conditions exist. Here there are wide areas which enable the growers to use large size rafts, 20 m long by 10 m wide. The Tohoku region of northern Japan is also favorable for oyster culture and longlines are used in some of the rough water areas. It takes 2 yr for the oysters to grow to market size.   Oyster production is expected to remain stable over the next few years. New species of oysters such as the European flat oyster,  Ostrea edulis,  and the Portuguese oyster,  Crassostrea angulata,  may enter commercial production in the future if the problem of pollution along the coastal areas can be overcome.   SCALLOP CULTURE    The aquaculture of scallops,  Patinopecten yessoensis,  has recently been developed in Japan. The production of scallops on natural grounds has remained poor during the past decade with annual landings fluctuating between 5,000 and 15,000 tons. Since the development of the hanging method for catching seed and culturing scallops, production has increased rapidly during the past few years and will continue to do so. Because considerable quantities of seed are being caught in Aomori and Hokkaido areas of northern Japan, the scallop fishery is currently expanding. The seed is not only being cultured in nets to market size but also released on the bottom where good returns are being obtained 2 to 3 yr later.   In 1969, 14,644 tons worth 1,833 million yen were harvested from natural grounds and approximately 5,000 tons were produced from hanging culture.   Seed scallops are caught in the spring. Several kinds of cultch materials are used: vinyl fibre (used gill net), vinyl film, branches of trees, etc. These are suspended from rafts or longlines. Three months after setting, the young scallops are transferred to nets where they grow to 3-4 cm by autumn. The culture of scallops can then go one of two ways: Either the seed can continue to grow in nets for 1 1/2 yr to market size or they can be released on the natural grounds. As high as an 80% return has been obtained from released seed on the coastal area of Hokkaido.   In the near future, a large-scale bottom farming of scallops can be expected along the coast of Okhotsk Sea, Hokkaido. This project will be made possible because large amounts of scallop seed are available. The site once produced 60,000 tons of scallops annually. To make the program successful, systematic engineering and newly developed harvesting machines such as suction dredges and underwater bulldozers will be utilized.   ABALONE CULTURE    Considerable interest has developed in the culturing of abalone  (Haliotis discus hanai  in cold waters and  H. discus  in warmer waters). These are very important commercial species along the rocky sea bottom both in quantity and quality. Production has remained relatively stable over the past years as a result of good management practices such as the transplanting of natural sets to areas of poor setting. In 1969, abalone landings totaled 6,463 tons valued at 5,692 million yen ( Table 1 ).   Two approaches are planned in the aquaculture of abalone-mass production of seeds in hatcheries and the artificial production of food in the field by seaweed afforestation. Artificial seed production was developed in the 1960's. Seed production is expected to expand as studies are completed on the conditioning of abalone for spawning and as commercial hatcheries are developed. Good returns can be expected from released seeds, 2-3 cm in shell length, when they are harvested 3-4 yr later.   There is a lack of knowledge about the food conditions in the abalone's natural habitat. For this reason, research was initiated in afforestation in the field. Afforestation could produce about 40 tons of food that could feed up to 4 tons of abalone. The seeds for this program will come from hatcheries.   PEARL INDUSTRY    The pearl industry first began in 1906. The industry has developed rapidly after World War II and reached its peak of production in 1967 when 130 tons of pearls were produced by 4,701 culturist (called management units). The increase was related to techniques in artificially collecting seeds and rearing the mother shells  (Pinctada  sp.). The mother shell industry has grown rapidly since 1952. In 1965, 11,000 tons of mother shells were harvested from 69,000 rafts operated by 7,859 management units.   A rapid increase in the number of management units occurred from the postwar era to 1964. These were Mostly small-scale units using less than 30 rafts. In recent years, the number of units has not been increasing and many units are using more rafts, indicating an enlargement of the individual industry units.   The everlasting aim of the industry is to improve the quality of the cultured pearl. In the 1920's, pearls were small but, after developing successful techniques of transplanting mantle pieces in the gonad, bigger pearls were produced. Between 1952 and 1969, the production of small pearls (less than 6 mm) decreased from 67% of the total production to 24%; those in the medium size range (6.0-7.6 mm) and large pearls (7.6 mm) increased in total production from 24 to 58% and from 9 to 18%, respectively.   As the industry developed, culture grounds spread rapidly over the middle and southeastern parts of Japan. These areas were used mainly for the production of mother shells. In 1956, 82% of all pearls produced in Japan came from the middle Pacific region; 73% of these came from rafts. Recently, however, production in this area has declined because of overcrowding and deterioration of culture grounds. In 1964, 20% of the total pearl production came from the Seto Inland region but, recently, production dropped to 10%. On the other hand, production in the southern Pacific and East China regions has been on the increase, and over half of the total Japanese pearl landings now comes from these two areas.   Until 1963, yields from pearl rafts were stable but, thereafter, production per raft has gone down. Reasons for this decline have been related to crowded conditions and to the use of unsuitable culture grounds. In the Seto Inland region, the deterioration of the waters caused by man-made pollution has caused a drop in yields from certain culture grounds. Special provincial laws have been undertaken to regulate production, recover the balance of supply and demand, and effectively utilize suitable culture grounds. The success of these regulations will insure the steady foundation of the industry and the production of better quality pearls.   1   Tohoku Regional Fisheries Research Laboratory, Shiogama, Miyagi-ken, Japan.   2   National Pearl Research Laboratory.

GX049-73-2310771	"SOME IMPRESSIONS REGARDING GENETICS AND THE FISHERIES OF JAPAN   A. CROSBY LONGWELL 1    INTRODUCTION    This report is based on a tour of Japanese laboratories concerned with aquaculture or subjects pertinent to it, 8-13 October 1972; and on attendance at the Second International Ocean Development Conference, Tokyo, Japan, 5-7 October 1972.   Tour included: Oyster Research Institute at Kesen-numa on Mohne Bay; Pearl Research Laboratory of the Fisheries Agency at Kashikojima, Mie-ken (Director, T. Hayashi); Ocean Research Institute of the University of Tokyo; Nikko Branch of Freshwater Fisheries Research Laboratory at Nikko on Lake Chuzenji (Director, K. Onodera); Tohoku University School of Fisheries: Tohoku Regional Fisheries Research Laboratory.     BACKGROUND INFORMATION ON GENETICS IN JAPANESE FISHERIES    There has been, in the past, no overall, concerted effort at applying genetics to the aquaculture endeavors of Japan which are without dispute the most extensive in the world. Now, however, in conjunction with a national research program on aquaculture it appears that some special committee on the application of genetics to aquaculture is being organized.   Since the advent of genetics at the turn of the century, Japan has had a number of highly trained geneticists, many of world renown, invariably prominent at International Congresses of Genetics. Breeding sciences and genetics are regarded important enough for school children to memorize the names of famous Japanese (Kihara) and American (Sears) wheat geneticists. Genetic applications to breeding have, however, been with few exceptions in agriculture not in fisheries, the same situation as in the United States.   Japan has had nothing at least in recent years equivalent to the symposium the Russians held in 1968, ""Genetics, selection, and hybridization of fish,"" published in 1969 (Cherfas, 1969), and translated in 1972 through the auspices of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. (Nor has the United States.) It is relatively in recent years that there has been a reinstatement of Mendelian, ""Western'' genetics in Russia after years of propaganda--serving Lysenkoism (which proposed that most of ""heredity"" was due to environment). Perhaps the Russians, with all vested interests in traditional fields of genetics disbursed, are now more free to address the reestablished discipline of genetics to the new research challenges of the time of which aquaculture is certainly one.   In any comparison of the application of genetics to agriculture and to fisheries, irrespective of what nation's research programs are being discussed, it should be noted that even prehistoric man was working on the cultivation of land crops and domesticating animals. Modern man, on the other hand, is still for the most part content, correctly or incorrectly, with leaving marine organisms wild. University schools of fisheries are dedicated to the advancement of the science and art of fishing wild fish in the wild. No doubt, this is partly the result of man's lack of day-to-day familiarity with aquatic organisms, one measure of his failure to control the seas as he does land. Also, the advance of civilization necessitated the promotion and ultimate success of agriculture as wild crops and animals disappeared in its wake. In the same way pollution of the seas may assure the promotion of aquaculture over the span of the next few decades.   Whatever the background reasons only presently is genetics beginning to be applied to the fisheries in Japan, which rank among the most important industries of this island nation. By contrast triploid seedless watermelons are bred in Japan from sterile crosses made between special lines, and giant, highly polyploid apples are sold at railroad station food stands.   Until now there has been no pressing economic necessity in Japan to employ genetics to produce an organism better able to perform in an intensive aquaculture system. Aquaculture could be inefficient, depend on capture of young wild animals or gravid females for a kind of semifarming, be labor intensive, and still be worthwhile as a means of producing food and obtaining an income. This is no longer the case, and the change may be attributable, in part, to rising labor costs and to increasing demands for high quality seafood by a population with a higher living standard.    EXPANSION OF INTENSIVE AQUACULTURE, A PREREQUISITE FOR GENETIC APPLICATION    Certainly, the genetic study of wild fish populations has some profound implications for fishery management. Genetic knowledge of wild populations, in addition, makes formore judicious selection from such wild populations of the founding populations used to breed hatchery stocks with particular characteristics. The hatchery breeding of special, though still undomesticated, stocks for release to the wild represents still another area of genetics little considered in the fisheries. Such methods have been employed in forestry and grassland management, at least, in the United States. However, the deliberate severe alteration of the genotype of the wild organism, which aquaculturists need to transform the wild fish or invertebrate into a domesticated or cultivated form, requires, to begin with, intensive and fairly successful aquaculture of the organism. For that reason, it is important to note here the current status of aquaculture programs in Japan.   At the opening of the Oceanology Conference in Tokyo (Second International Ocean Development Conference, 1972), it was indicated in a special talk that one of five major projects recommended by a special Council for Ocean Development created in July 1969, as an advisory organ to the Prime Minister, was the development of fish culture with undersea experimental farms. This is, it was explained, because Japan's coastal fishing has declined owing to pollution and overfishing, because of the exclusion of Japan from some fisheries in their part of the world by neighboring nations..and because of an intensification of the world ""fishing race."" New fishing grounds will be developed and underutilized species exploited. Still of great importance, the Council believes, will be the switchover in the fish industry to farming-type endeavors. The necessity of breed improvement for maximum success in such intensive culture under artificial conditions seems to be well understood.   At the same conference Akio Honma from the Fishery Agency, Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, gave a presentation on "" Fish farming in Japan. "" Honma said that in the fishing field, farming, along with concomitant management and breeding, has been applied in the past only to a few freshwater species and to a few species of seaweeds and crustaceans. Over the years 1962-1966 the government's Fishery Agency established five Fish Farming Centers to encourage coastal fishing in the Seto Inland Sea. The entire Seto Inland Sea is being considered as one huge pond. Several important marine species are to be preserved and multiplied. Fry are bred at the centers and released to the prefectures for raising and releasing. In this program for the Seto Inland Sea a certain period of growth will be left to nature eliminating the necessity of using cheaper fish for the farming of more expensive fish.   Catching and releasing fry, as a source of seed, proved entirely inadequate. Seed breeding from artificially spawned animals is now the work of the project. It was found that, on the whole, breeding techniques were inadequate for the scope of the undertakings. (Here, genetic improvement in reproductive performance under artificial conditions could lead to better breeding techniques in the hatcheries as an intermediate step in the total program. Nothing was said of this.) The main work of the center is now accordingly the development of mass production schemes. As the need arises, fishing experiment station and university personnel work together at the center.   It has become the policy of the government to subsidize research work for seed production to some nongovernment public corporation where they believe management is better. Seed production is the area to which most money is now being directed.   Efforts are now being made to rear artificially produced fish to maturity in larger tanks so that they can subsequently be used to breed another generation. When this is accomplished, of course, genetically controlled breeding will be possible.   Systematic work in the release and control of seed has been limited since so much of the project had to be aimed at developing seed and better seedproducing techniques. It was found that, if young prawns are protected for a certain period and released after adapting them to natural water, 5 to 10% of the released numbers can be harvested.   As a result of this program, prawn has been produced on a commercial scale. Also red sea bream, octopuses, globefish, scorpionfish, sea-eel, blue crab, and abalone. The prawn project is emerging from its experimental to a semibusiness stage.   The prawn commonly cultured in Japan is  Penaeus japonicus.  It is one of the most expensive of seafoods in Japan. Artificial culture techniques for this species have been developed over the last 10 yr by fisheries biologists and professional aquaculturists. Despite a number of technical and socioeconomic difficulties in the commercial production of prawn in Japan, it is evident to the Japanese that an increasing demand for prawn and shrimp will stimulate the development of its culture as an industry wherever in the world it is at all feasible. Culture should be particularly promoted in the untouched, widely ranging swamplands in the tropical zones. However, presently in Japan, poor culture techniques, defects in the present system of intensive culture, laborious rearing operations, rising land costs, and unfavorable rearing conditions owing to pollution make for unstable and costly production on prawn farms. A decrease in artificial production is anticipated. Culturists wonder whether prawn farms can even be maintained in Japan in competition with more productive enterprises. Yet, an overwhelming demand continues to exceed production even though at the Tokyo Central Fish Market a kilogram of live prawn has been sold for as much as 8 to 30 U.S. dollars (Second International Ocean Development Conference, 1972).   The prawn fishery, just as the shrimp fishery in the United States, might well be the fishery that would benefit monetarily most quickly from a well-integrated, sensibly supported genetics program.   Experimental studies on the hybridization of the freshwater shrimp are being carried on at the Tokyo Fisheries University (Uno and Fujita, 1972). Crosses of  Macrobrachium nipponense  x  M .  formosense  and reciprocal crosses were reared from the larval stage to sexual maturity. Morphological comparisons of hybrids to each parent were made. These interspecies crosses were achieved by exposing the excised spermatophores to 50% seawater for 15 to 30 min. and then attaching them to the ventral thoracic part of the female of the other species just before she spawned: Such hybrids could have advantages over nonhybrids for intensive aquaculture under artificial conditions, or for ""colonization"" of a new area in the wild.    POLLUTION AND INTENSIVE AQUACULTURE WITH ""SEMIDOMESTICATED"" STRAINS    Possibly, even before breed improvement, with concomitant genetic adaptation to the cultivated state, aquaculture of some ""semidomesticated"" forms will become a success with the disappearance of their wild progenitors from Japan's coastal waters, or when these wild forms accumulate enough contaminants to become unfit for human consumption. Oyster seed production has been eliminated from around the City of Hiroshima with implications for the entire fishery. Yet, while pollution of wild stocks and their demise by marine contaminants may make some aspects of commercial hatchery production more attractive, too widespread pollution would render even artificial production in natural seawater virtually impractical. The Japanese regard the future success of artificial culture to be intimately tied to a resolution of pollution problems.    APPLIED AND BASIC GENETIC RESEARCH TO SUPPORT FISH BREEDING    For many years Japan has emphasized applied research in the fishing fields. A system of extension services for the fisheries is well established. In the United States the Sea Grant Program stresses applied research and extension services, but Japan is looking in the opposite direction. Unlike the Americans, the Japanese have made near maximum and efficient use of applied research. Now, Japanese scientists actually carrying out the work and their research administrators alike are of the opinion that, to increase further the productivity of their fisheries, more basic research is required. In the past, such research has been largely confined to universities where it has not been well funded and to special national institutes. Basic research, they believe, is necessary to develop reliable means of carrying regularly large numbers of fish from egg through sexual maturity, and this in the face of serious pollution. Such work should be deliberately associated with breed improvement programs, and the Japanese recognize this. Even if they did not, some useful genetic selection would occur inadvertently.   Food and disease appear to be presently regarded as more important constraints on aquaculture generally than lack of special breeds. However, the Japanese regard water quality--pollution--as the current most serious point to consider in establishing aqua-farms. In considering this ordering of pollution, nutrition, then disease, then genetics, in terms of priority, it should be noted that:   1) Genetics will not succeed in accomplishing much of anything if the animal, to begin with, is not reasonably easy to culture;   2) but that genetics can in an early stage of aquaculture contribute to the development of types better able to utilize artificial foods, resist disease, be more vigorous, and develop good gametes;   3) so nutrition, disease, and genetics should not be regarded, either in the United States or Japan, as three separate research entities--they overlap.    STORAGE OF STOCKS AND COLLECTIONS FOR BREEDING PURPOSES    A directory prepared for distribution at the Twelfth International Congress of Genetics, Tokyo, 1968, lists important genetic stocks of plants and animals and microorganisms being maintained in national universities (Oshima, 1968) Tohoku University, Faculty of Agriculture, is named as holding oyster stocks, but no other fish stocks are listed. There are plans for establishing future ""storage"" centers to maintain genetic stocks. Fish are not mentioned in these proposals for storage of genetic stocks prepared by classic geneticists. ""Stocks would be managed by an expert geneticist so that uncontrolled, random breeding"" of the closed stocks would not result in genetic changes in the stocks making them unrepresentative of the genotypes of the wild populations or cultured lines from which they were sampled for preservation.    JAPANESE GENETICISTS    In this same directory, names of 944 Japanese geneticists are registered. Only four are cited as involved in research on fish: one was listed at the Nippon Institute of Scientific Research on Pearls, two as working on the genetics of sexuality in fish, and one on the genetics of invertebrate sex-determination. An exhibit, ''Genetics in Asian countries,'' at this Twelfth International Congress of Genetics,"" featured research on the origin, differentiation, distribution, and breeding of a number of plants and animals especially associated with the life of Asian peoples; nothing was included on fish.   Japan was represented by one of six members of the FAO ad hoc Working Party on Genetic Selection and the Conservation of Genetic Resources of Fish, which met in Rome in 1971 (Food and Agriculture Organization, 1972). Their representative was K Suzuki, Chief Fish Culture Section, Ueda Branch of Freshwater Fisheries Research Laboratory, Nagano Prefecture. The report published by this panel is an excellent statement. It is mostly, however, oriented towards freshwater fish. In this report the case for widespread utilization of genetics in the fisheries is put more strongly than presented here where emphasis is on genetics in the total perspective.    JAPAN'S NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENETICS    Japan has an excellent National Genetics Institute, which consists of 10 departments and was established in 1949 as the governmental institute for fundamental studies of genetics. One of its first directors was the now retired H. Kihara, world renowned wheat geneticist. In the November 1972 edition of Nature devoted to ""Science in Japan"" there is an article by Kihara, ""Activities of the National Institute of Genetics.""   One of the most active groups is the Department of Developmental Population Genetics. The work of this group is currently all theoretical and not at all concerned with fish. Training of this staff though could be well utilized in fishery research.   The silkworm is a much used organism for genetic research at this Institute. Genetic mutations interfering with the feeding patterns of the silkworm larvae are being studied. Such mutations no doubt also present themselves in larvae of marine invertebrates, as the oyster, which have delicate larval stages often difficult to culture. Studies on radiation and chemical mutagenesis are being actively pursued using the silkworm. Emphasis is on dose-rate effects. (This is a very important area. There is a necessity internationally to clarify effects or lack of effects at very low doses of radiation, something most difficult to carry out experimentally.) With embryonic death as a criterion, radio-sensitive and radio-resistant strains of silkworms have been isolated, differences being 6- to 9-fold. Using  Drosophila,  induced mutations affecting viability rather than simply inducing lethality have been found to occur 40 times as often as lethal mutations. This work in the field of mutagenesis might be directed toward establishing control standards for marine contaminants as they affect the lethal gene load and reproductive cells of breeding fish populations. Recently, workers at this National Institute of Genetics have developed a very sensitive test system for the detection of chemical mutagens in polluted environments.   The Department of Cytogenetics is studying chromosome polymorphism in populations of the black rat around the world. With emphasis on the Japanese population, the aetiology of Down's syndrome in humans is being studied. Expertise is certainly available then for breeding-related cytogenetic work.   Microbial genetics is also being pursued. Training in such a field could be the basis for studying disease organisms of aquatic plants and animals.   In the Department of Applied Genetics, rice is most extensively investigated - aquatic, marine organisms not at all. A worldwide collection of rice species is maintained; there is a complete collection of wheat and its relative species.    OYSTERS OF JAPAN, SPECIFIC USE OF HYBRIDS AND HYBRID VIGOR    There is a very real separation of  Crassostrea gigas,  commonly called the Japanese oyster, into several distinct races (Imai and Sakai, 1961).   There may even be a variation in the chromosome number in some Japanese populations of C.  gigas.  This is at variance with all the recent reports of American workers (review, Longwell and Stiles, in press). However, all the C.  gigas  sampled in the United States for chromosome analysis derive from seed imported from Japan to the U.S. West Coast, and most of the spat exported from Japan has been taken from one particular region.   C. gigas is  collected widely in Japan in the shallow waters on the coast from Hokkaido to Kyushu. Seed were. until recently, collected most actively in Hiroshima, where oyster culture is said to have begun 400 yr ago. The Miyagi district is next in production to Hiroshima. Main seed-producing beds in Japan are Hiroshima, Miyagi, Mie, and Kumamoto Prefectures. The Miyagi Prefecture is famous for their export of oyster seed. This is most likely where most seed imported to the U.S. West Coast has been originating. Hiroshima culturists seldom bought oyster seed and seldom exported their seed to other prefectures or countries.   There are 30 different species of oysters in Japan, all edible. Only three of these are of direct economic importance, C.  gigas, C. rivuluris,  and  Ostrea nippona.    It is believed that C.  Iaperousi  and C.  ariakensis,  native Japanese oysters, reported some years ago by Kobayashi (1954) to have four more chromosomes than C.  gigas,  are really C.  rivularis.  The species C.  rivularis  is not cross-compatible with C.  gigas  (Imai and Sakai, 1961). Confusing here is the fact that American malacologists regard C.  Iaperousi  and C.  ariakensis  as merely forms of the variable C.  gigas.    C. rivularis,  imported with seed of C.  gigas,  has been planted in Puget Sound and, according to Galtsoff (l964), has established itself there.   Some of this taxonomic confusion in classifying oysters may stem from the existence already of several hybrid-type populations in the wild. Nothing was learned in Japan regarding the opinion of some U.S. workers that C.  angulata,  the Portuguese oyster, and C.  gigas  are the same species.   Lest an understanding of the nature of these species be regarded as esoteric, it should be pointed out that such much publicized benefits of genetics, as miracle rice, resulted from a combination of two species or varieties. The characteristics of each of these types of rice were clearly known and understood by the breeders who test-hybridized them initially along with many others which were not ""miracles"" at all.   Part of the vigor of C.  gigas  relative to the more sensitive commercial East Coast American oyster,  C. virginica,  may derive from a slow though steady rate of introgressive hybridization. That is, by the addition of other species genes to C.  gigas  on a small scale over a long period. It could also derive from larger scale hybridization in various oyster populations in the more distant past. Both of these probabilities can be checked experimentally. This is basic research, of course, but it would provide some information on how important hybridization programs are in developing vigorous hatchery stocks. Such would remove some of the present unavoidable guesswork as to the usefulness of wide species crosses.   Spat of  C. gigas  are now being shipped to France from Japan for planting on oyster beds once populated by C. angulata. There is a chance of natural hybridization on the wild beds in France between imported C. gigas and the remains of the once plentiful C. angulata populations. These two species readily hybridize in the laboratory, the hybrids survive and are fertile (Imai and Sakai, 1961).   It would be hard to overemphasize the importance hybrid vigor will have in developing hatchery lines of oysters, lobsters, scallops, fish and other marine food animals, and algae. Hybrid vigor is so important because, unless artificial seawater is used, water pollution will always be a threat to the commercial success of a hatchery. Because a hatchery must carry its product through its most sensitive larval stages, in smaller numbers than in the wild, and in one spot as opposed to many in the wild, water pollution can have a more disastrous effect in a hatchery than in the field.   Widespread use of artificial seawater would necessitate the breeding of lines commercially productive in such a media. Drastic changes in the genotype would most probably be necessary. This is not a genetic improbability by any means, but aquaculturists do not give the idea much thought.    LABORATORY VISITS    Even though there has been no general, broad program of fish or aquacultural genetics in Japan, some fine genetic research has gone on in various fishery laboratories. This work has not yet had a great deal of impact on the general fisheries. It is related here along with comments and discussions regarding aquaculture-related genetics. The research cited is a sampling of the sort of work that will most likely be conducted in the future on a larger scale.    Oyster Research Institute at Kesen-numa on Mohne Bay-Oyster, Scallop, and Abalone    The Oyster Research Institute at Kesen-numa (chief researchers now H. Kan-no and T. Seki) developed, under the leadership of T. Imai, methods for the artificial rearing of the Japanese oyster, C.  gigas.  This Japanese work paralleled the prior work of Loosanoff and Davis (1963) of the Milford Biological Laboratory, now part of the National Marine Fisheries Service. From the Kesen-numa Laboratory also came a breeding study on C.  gigas,  which included the effects of inbreeding, hybridization between members of different geographic races, and interspecies crosses using the Japanese oyster as one of the species parents (Imai and Sakai, 1961). Additional aquaculture and breeding information is contained in a recent book edited by Imai et al., 1971, ''Through culture in shallow seas (progress in shallow seas culture)."" This book is now being translated from the Japanese through the auspices of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. At least for some considerable period of time adult, fertile hybrids of the cross C.  gigas x C. angulata  were maintained at the Kesen-numa Laboratory.   This Institute is now rearing the European oyster,  Ostrea edulis,  which does well in Japan as a hatchery species. These oysters are sold as spat to growers and marketed. C.  angulata is  also being reared. No genetic studies are now being conducted on the oyster.   The sea scallop,  Patinopecten,  is also being raised. The scallop fishery still depends on the capture of juveniles, not on hatchery rearing. However, at least in Mutsu Bay annual catches of P.  yessoensis  fluctuate widely. This is attributed to a natural instability of the reproduction of this species. Natural reproductive instability would make this scallop an excellent candidate for reproduction in the hatchery. Some of the scallops are known to be functional hermaphrodites. Use could so be made, for both experimental and commercial breeding work, of their rapid inbreeding potential by self-crossing.   Research at the Kesen-numa Laboratory is now concentrating on the abalone. The market for this marine gastropod is excellent, and there is an urgent need to mass produce the young. Unlike the situation for the oyster and scallop, mass collection of wild abalone is fairly difficult. Young abalone escape from the collectors, and in their natural habitat, they shelter themselves under boulders or rocks. To increase production it is, therefore, essential to produce the young artificially.   In Japan 10 species of abalone are found. Only four of these species constitute the staple food products-- Haliotis haliotis discus hannoi, H. discus, H. sieboldii,  and  H. gigantea.  Of the total catch  H. discus hannoi  supplies 58%.   At present, no genetic studies on abalone are being conducted at Kesen-numa. However, there is interest in possible genetic causes of the less than desired percent survival of the young larvae, in the chromosomes of the abalone, and in genetic resistance to disease. Disease is anticipated as a potential serious problem in the very intensive system under which the abalone will be reared. The intensive system includes a period of growth in the heated waters of a nearby power plant at Shiogama. An aboveground running water tank system contains the abalone at this time, and a hatchery with experimental facilities has been built at the power plant near the tank farm.   At the Iwate Prefectural Roes and Fries Distribution Center the gametogenesis of adult abalone was observed, as well as the normal development from fertilized egg to creeping stage larvae (Shibui, 1972).   Once the artificial production of abalone in Japan progressed to the commercial scale, interest developed in the potential of interspecies crosses. At Chikura Branch of Chiba Prefectural Fisheries such hybrids were made and studied. These were between  H. discus  and H.  gigantea;  between  H. discus  and  H. sieboldii;  and between  H. gigantea  and  H. sieboldii  (Oba, Toyama, and Kaneko, 1972). All were reared through metamorphosis in the laboratory. Hatching, fertilization abnormalities, and shell form and structure were compared to the parental characteristics. Such hybrids could have advantages over nonhybrids for intensive aquaculture under artificial conditions, or for colonization of a new area in nature.   Some hybridization work was also conducted at the Kesen-numa Institute (J. W. McBeth). 2    Pearl Research Laboratory of the Fisheries Agency at Kashiko-jima, Mie-ken    Research is confined exclusively to study of those mollusks used to culture pearls. Work is ultimately directed at improving the quality of the cultured pearl. All the research appears to be basic. It seems that, because the science and art of pearl culture are well worked out, these researchers have more freedom to pursue fundamental work. There is a persistent near 40% mortality of the pearl oyster,  Pinctada fucata,  in the trays and racks used to hold them in the pearl farming. Mortality appears to be accepted as part of the business. The demand for pearls has dropped and there is now a government restriction on the amount of pearl farming to be conducted. There are no projects aimed at breeding disease resistant organisms, as those for the commercial  Crassostrea virginica  in the U.S. mid-Atlantic states.   Research is being carried out on the artificial culture of this pearl oyster's mantle (A. Machii, pers. comm.). Mitosis and cell proliferation have been obtained in vitro. American, European, and Japanese workers can all generally attest to the fact that success in invertebrate tissue culture has been most elusive. A persistent measure of culture success would find application in numerous fields of fishery research. It would apply to work on this epidemic MSX disease of the American oyster, which just about devastated the oyster industry of the U.S. mid-Atlantic states a few years ago (Sindermann and Rosenfield, 1967).   Some inbreeding and some hybridization studies are being conducted on the pearl oyster (K. Wada). 3  Also, some studies have been conducted on its chromosomes in spite of technical problems caused by the presence of so much yolky material in the eggs (K. Wada, see footnote 3). This latter work will probably be published soon. It seems that some research effort will be directed in the future towards study of biochemical polymorphisms in the wild stock.    Ocean Research Institute, University of Tokyo--Genetic Polymorphisms of Wild Populations    In the division, Biology of Fisheries Resources, studies are being conducted on enzyme variation in fish populations (Numachi, 1972a).   Shortage of genetic markers has been a handicap in the study of fish genetics. Now variation in different enzymes can be used as genetic markers by employing gel electrophoresis followed by histochemical staining methods. This method makes possible an examination of the structure of a population of fish in genetic terms. Identification of self-sustaining subpopulations of fish is a most basic problem in fisheries management.   Enzyme polymorphisms reflect a mutation in the structural gene of the enzyme concerned. A few years ago variants of enzymes were regarded as rare events. It is now known that such variants are very common in most enzymes in various organisms. An increasing number of electrophoretically distinguishable variants has been discovered in fish, as well as in other organisms. Marine mammals, such as whales, dolphins, and seals, all contain five lactate dehydrogenase forms. Their enzyme ""patterns"" are similar to those of terrestrial mammals, including man.   Numachi (1971, 1972b, c) has specifically reported in the literature on interspecific and intraspecific variation of enzymes in fish species and on analysis of the genetic control of such enzymes in fish--on electrophoretic variants of catalasein black rockfish,  Sebastes inermis;  genetic polymorphisms of tetrazolium oxidase in black rockfish; genetic control and subunit composition of lactate dehydrogenase in  Pseudorasbora parva  (a cyprinoid fish); duplicate genetic loci and variant forms of malate dehydrogenase in chum salmon,  Oncorhynchus beta,  and rainbow trout,  Salmo gairdneri.    Evidence has importantly been provided for the tetraploid condition of salmon. This means that salmon, like many higher plants, basically have four of each chromosome instead of the usual two each found in normal diploid organisms. Diploidy is the common state in the animal kingdom. Further examination of the evolutionary process of salmonids remains to be done. Already though recognition of the tetraploidy of salmonids should be of intrinsic importance in genetic studies. Because of the tetraploid nature of salmon, big salmon obtained by selection are not a good general example of what might be expected by similar programs of breeding using truly diploid species. Tetraploidy lends itself particularly well to gigantism.   Study of enzyme variation in species transplanted and farmed in the not-so-distant future will be an important means of stock identification, and of determining whether desired or unwanted hybridization has occurred in the wild between the local and transplant type. This will be no small job since the present most effective utilization of different genetic characters of various populations is still by transplantation of populations and species suitable for the environmental conditions of the areas intended for farming (Numachi, 1972a).   Another application of enzyme variants to genetic improvement of aquatic organisms may be as markers linked with economic characters. Economic characters are usually polygenic and so are impossible to study by simple Mendelian genetics as are distinct, qualitative, morphological characters.    Nikko Branch of Freshwater Fisheries Research Laboratory on Lake Chuzenji    Breed improvement is now regarded as one of the main problems in the freshwater fish culture in Japan. Some selective breeding is underway at the Nikko Branch of Freshwater Fisheries Research Laboratory (for preliminary work on  Salmo gairdneri  see legato and Sakamoto. 1969: Kato. 1970). Extensive hybridization studies have been carried out and reported in the literature (Suzuki and Kato, 1966; Kato, 1967; Suzuki and Fukada, 1971, 1972). Most likely, such programs will be stepped up as breed improvement is stressed in the future.   It is believed that no fish populated Lake Chazenji until 1873 when some local people volunteered to stock the lake with such fishes as the char and carp. Since that time, many species of salmonid fishes have been stocked frequently in the lake. The eggs of  Salvelinus fontinalis,  the brook trout, were imported in 1901 from the United States and fry released in the lake.   It is well known that distinct species and genera of fishes hybridize frequently in nature. A considerable number of natural hybrids has been reported, especially in the freshwater families--Cyprinidae and Castostomidae; also, in Percidae, Centrarchidae, Poeciliidae, etc; and importantly in Salmonidae. Natural hybrids seem to occur much less frequently in marine fishes. Information about natural crosses is most useful in determining the relationship of groups of fishes.   Natural hybrids between S.  pluvius,  the Japanese char, and S.  fontinalis  were collected from a brook flowing into Lake Chuzenji. They are estimated to constitute about 12% of the population at the area of the headspring.   Growth and survival rates of artificially produced hybrids between S.  pluvius  and S.  fontinalis  were studied from 6 mo after fertilization until they were 2 yr old and compared to the nonhybrid parents. This was to determine their relative suitabilities for pond culture. Best growth was in S.  fontinalis  followed by the hybrid, then by S.  pluvius.  Survival rate was highest in the hybrids. All the hybrids and S.  fontinalis  came to maturity during this time, but a third of S.  pluvius  was still immature. Hybrids were fertile and, in fact, produced a significantly larger number of eggs than did the nonhybrid parents.   With the hope of directly utilizing the information obtained to increase annual trout harvests, hybridization experiments with 62 combinations of Salmonidae have beengoingon since 1965. The purpose of this work was to find F 1  hybrids suitable for pond culture and for stocking lakes or rivers. Until a few years ago the freshwater fishes of Japan were abundant in nature. They were used mostly by rural people as a main protein source. Due to a reduction in their natural habitats, such fish are now less plentiful. At the same time the demand for them has gone up, making them a luxury food. Presumably it was believed that genetic and breeding work would have some bearing on this situation. It was further hoped that some of these hybrid crosses would be sterile. Sterile hybrids might, because of their sterility, have a faster rate of growth or greater ultimate size than fertile nonhybrids.   Hybrid development did occur in all combinations. There were, however, wide differences in survival rates. Hybrids between 32 combinations survived until they reached the free-swimming stage. Nine of these showed survival rates similar or better than those of parental species. Those combinations that did survive are currently being studied at later growth stages.   Among hybrid characteristics already ascertained is a heterosis against disease. This is an important feature since prevention of epidemic disease is a serious problem in trout culture.   Even some intergeneric hybridization was achieved. These hybrids though presented special difficulties in culturing and rearing.    Tohoku University School of Fisheries and Tohoku Regional Fisheries Research Laboratory--Radiation Effects on Oyster; Seaweeds    The effects of ionizing radiation on  Crassostrea gigas  are being studied at Tohoku University (L. Maeda, pers. comm.). This work may be similar in nature to some done on C.  virginica (Longwell  and Stiles, 1972).   Recent advances in cultural techniques for the seaweeds, like  Porphyra  and  Undaria,  have brought substantial benefit to a considerable portion of fishermen engaged in seaweed production in Japan. (At the same time once important nori grounds about Tokyo have been irretrievably lost to pollution, and nori products have come to contain mercury and cadmium.) Little attention though has been given to the possibility of artificially crossing seaweed types to give a more productive, profitable strain. Since 1958, S. Suto has been making interspecies hybrids always using a local commercial species as one parent. This work has been done with a view of obtaining a new seaweed with good characteristics for culture (Suto, 1963; also see Suto, 1972). Fortunately, self-fertilization rates are low, facilitating artificial fertilization. However, much preliminary work had to be done before artificial fertilization could be achieved with certainty. Also, the relationship between  Porphyra  species had to be clarified.   Artificial crosses were attempted between five species of the  Porphyra  genus, including four local forms. Crosses occurred easily between any two species tested. Descendants from crosses of two dioecious parents and from two monoecious parents grew normally. Those from dioecious-monoecious combinations died-in mass at a young stage, but left a few survivors. The three dioecious species studied appear to be very closely related. At least in hybrids of the dioecious species, there is normal reproduction with typical genetic segregation.   Recently, some lines started from an interspecies hybrid have yielded two and three succeeding generations. Some of the lines grow more vigorously than did their native parents.   This work demonstrates that new lavers, more suitable for commercial production than the present wild lavers, can be bred. Probably the F 1  interspecies hybrids will first have to be subjected to a program of artificial selection in the laboratory, or one of natural selection in the wild before being used commercially.   Introduction to Japan of foreign species of  Porphyra,  which may be disease resistant, for field trials and for use in hybrids with Japanese species, is regarded important. High quality species already being utilized are, unfortunately, not the most productive, and disease is a factor in lowering productivity.   There is a likelihood of some natural hybridization occurring on the wild beds between closely related species. The genetic and other implications of this are recognized.   Some cytogenetic studies on P.  yezoensis  have been done elsewhere at Nagasaki University Faculty of Fisheries (Migita, 1967). There are three chromosomes in vegetative and spermatogonial cells in the leaf thalli, and six chromosomes in fertilized carpogonia. The haploid chromosome number of this alga is then three. Meiosis takes place in the cell division of the conchospore at the time of spore formation. Such information is pertinent to the making of artificial crosses. Also for the artificial somatic replication of a single plant for multiplication prior to larger scale commercial production.   Aside from the great commercial value of seaweeds in Japan (their most important fishery), the Japanese probably have here one of the most interesting areas of the future field of marine genetics with most promise of great commercial application. This is because plants, in general, lend themselves so well to genetic study with subsequent genetic manipulation and because so many genetic and breeding techniques are so well worked out for plants.

GX241-85-7094895	Governor Calls For Increased Efforts To Clean Chesapeake Bay        Washington, D.C., OCTOBER 30, 1997 -- In remarks delivered at the annual Executive Council meeting of the Chesapeake Bay Program, Maryland Governor Parris N. Glendening today called for increased efforts to control nutrient pollution on the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries, warning that never before has the need to do more, and do it faster, been put in such sharp relief.  Referencing the outbreak of pfiesteria in Maryland and Virginia tributaries this summer, the Governor stated, we must recognize that our actions on land have resulted in a very unhealthy reaction in the water, and went on to describe the threat to human health, economic vitality and environmental well-being that excesses of phosphorus and nitrogen pose.    Governor Glendening also reviewed actions Maryland has undertaken in the past 12 months to clean up the Bay including Smart Growth and Neighborhood Conservation legislation, the progress made to plant 600 miles of riparian forest buffers by 2010, and the work of Maryland Tributary Strategy Teams.  Additionally, he cited actions taken after the outbreak of pfiesteria to demonstrate his commitment that We will do whatever is necessary to prevent toxic pfiesteria in the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries.    During the meeting, held this year at the Smithsonians Museum of Natural History, in Washington, D.C., the Executive Council of the Chesapeake Bay Program today voted to make Maryland Governor Parris N. Glendening leader of the regional Bay cleanup effort for the next twelve months.  Members of the Council, Pennsylvania Governor Tom Ridge; Virginia Governor George Allen; EPA Administrator Carol Browner, the outgoing Chair; Chesapeake Bay Commission Chairman and Virginia legislator Tayloe Murphy; and Mayor Marion Barry, of the District of Columbia, unanimously agreed that Governor Glendening should take the Bay Program into its next phase, as the partnership faces the need for increased efforts to reduce nutrient loadings to the Bay.    One of the Governors underlying themes, which he cited as a critical component to the successful maintenance of the gains made by the restoration, was Ecosystem Management, and the link between non-point pollution, growth management and habitat restoration.  He called for the need to do evaluations of the capacity of a watershed to absorb growth.  He asked, How much load can a watershed take, how many tons of nitrogen or phosphorus can a river or stream absorb, before it crashes and becomes another victim of ignorance, indifference or greed?  Without answers to questions like these, the Governor warned that we would not be able to sustain our progress or insure the long-term success of our efforts.    The Executive Council also reviewed the preliminary results of a year-long reevaluation, undertaken to measure the progress of the cleanup; signed three Council Directives; received the annual reports of three advisory committees to the Council; and recognized the contribution of noted researcher Dr. JoAnn Burkholder and physician Dr. Glen Morris for their work during the pfiesteria emergency in Maryland.    In summing up the meeting, Governor Glendening stated,  I was gratified to learn that we have made such good progress in our efforts to keep nitrogen and phosphorus from entering our Bay and its tributaries.   He continued, But it is clear to see that there is much, much more that needs to be done.    The Governor outlined seven measures to augment the states basic cleanup blueprint, Marylands Tributary Strategies:    Increased funding for Cover Crops -- this agricultural best management practice, where farmers plant fall grain crops in just-harvested fields,  keeps nutrients from entering waterways during winter months.  National action on nonpoint source pollution:      Introducing the idea of a  level playing field, for agriculture in Maryland, through implementation of national standards for nonpoint source discharges, so manufacturers or producers cant simply move to a another location where they can continue to pollute.   Pointing out that the success of the Clean Water Act of 1972 was significantly due to funding that fixed point sources of pollution.  The Governor suggested similar federal funding to control nonpoint sources of nitrogen and phosphorus is needed nationally.    A three-point education initiative    First, a  Youth Environmental Summit which will bring the high school leaders of tomorrow from all over Maryland together in May 1998 to discuss environmental issues and solutions from their own unique perspective.  Next, a Day on the Bay for every student in Maryland before they graduate from high school.  How can we expect school children to understand the need for strong action, personal responsibility and personal commitment, if the Bay isnt part of their lives?   We need to insure every child in Maryland have a personal understanding of the Bays role in our culture, economy and their own life.  Finally, a Challenge Grant Fund for habitat restoration on school property, so the lessons taught about the Bay and the environment can be experienced first hand.    New water quality goals for the Bay cleanup established with the aid of the Bay Programss updated Water Quality model.  A new ethic of personal responsibility and community stewardship based on the Resolution passed by the Chesapeake Bay Commission.  Implementati on, and expansion, of the Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program, a federal/state cost sharing partnership that will mean many of new buffer and scores of acres of wetlands on agricultural fields and along streams.  A new concept of  Ecosystem Management on all state-owned lands. This new policy will bring the most up-to-date environmental land management techniques, such as BayScapes, green building, and low-impact development to all state property.    The three Directives, signed by the Executive Council members in a public ceremony, are aimed at increasing public and community participation in the cleanup; establishing a goal for wetlands restoration; and  setting the stage for the next phase of the Bay restoration and what happens to the Bay beyond the year 2000.

GX241-80-1359791	GOVERNORS PRESS OFFICE   New Ecotourism Program Links Bay, Travelers   Timely new concept will foster economic development, appreciation for natural resources      Edgemere, MD (June 8, 1998) -- Just in time for the summer travel season, State officials have developed a new way to discover Marylands, culture, history and natural diversity.    Adjacent to a pine forest and a tidal marsh, Governor Parris N. Glendening announced Marylands Bay Link program today at North Point State Park in Baltimore County, one of 29 Bay Link sites.   A project of Marylands Departments of Natural Resources and Business and Economic Development, Bay Link is a network of special, protected areas across the State that showcase the varying kinds of habitats found in the Chesapeake Bay.    Today, we endow the citizens of Maryland and our visitors with a new way to learn about and enjoy the beauty and wonder of, our treasured Chesapeake Bay, Governor Glendening said. We introduce a new concept in recreation and education that exhibits the best of the Bay in terms of forests, wildlife, wetlands, geography and dozens of other factors that contribute to the Chesapeakes overall character.   Joining Governor Glendening to unveil Bay Links colorful, fun pamphlets and the Bay Link Passport were U.S. Senator Paul Sarbanes, DNR Secretary John R. Griffin, students and park volunteers.    This program represents a major step forward in our efforts to protect and enhance the Chesapeake Bay and will pay significant dividends in the years ahead by boosting tourism and improving the quality of life for the residents of Maryland, said Senator Sarbanes, who has introduced legislation to expand the Bay Link concept across the entire Bay watershed.    The more Bay Link sites residents and visitors explore, the greater their understanding of the Bay ecosystem and their connection to the plants and animals that depend on it, added Secretary Griffin.   Bay Link, which is akin in concept to the highly successful childrens Bay Game, is comprised of 29 sites throughout Marylands Coastal Plain. Each site is interesting on its own, but collectively, they contain all the mysteries and wonders that make up the ecology of the Bay. Every site also contributes to the health of the Chesapeake and also raises awareness of the need to protect pristine Bayfront land areas.    Bay Link outings are good for the body and soul because most offer hiking, canoeing, picnicking, wildlife observation and other low impact recreational opportunities. Approximately 50,000 Bay Link brochures and field guides will be available at State parks, welcome centers and local tourism offices in all Maryland counties and the City of Baltimore. The Bay Link Passport is available so travelers can keep track of their experiences.   Partners in the Bay Link effort include: the Smithsonian Institution, the Chesapeake Bay Trust, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Coastal Zone Program of the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Calvert County, the American Chestnut Land Trust, and the Wildlife Trust of North America.

The document contains the   views expressed by the authors acting in their individual capacity and may not necessarily   reflect the views of UNEP.          For bibliographic purposes the printed version of this document may be   cited as:     Barmes, T., K. L. Eckert, and J. Sybesma. 1993. WIDECAST Sea Turtle Recovery   Action Plan for Aruba (Karen L. Eckert, Editor). CEP Technical Report No. 25. UNEP   Caribbean Environment Programme, Kingston, Jamaica. xiv + 58 pp.           PREFACE          Sea turtle stocks are declining throughout most of the Wider Caribbean region; in some areas the trends are dramatic and are likely to be irreversible during our lifetimes. According to the IUCN Conservation Monitoring Centre's  Red Data Book , persistent over-exploitation, especially of adult females on the nesting beach, and the widespread collection of eggs are largely responsible for the Endangered status of five sea turtle species occurring in the region and the Vulnerable status of a sixth. In addition to direct harvest, sea turtles are accidentally captured in active or abandoned fishing gear, resulting in death to tens of thousands of turtles annually. Coral reef and sea grass degradation, oil spills, chemical waste, persistent plastic and other marine debris, high density coastal development, and an increase in ocean-based tourism have damaged or eliminated nesting beaches and feeding grounds. Population declines are complicated by the fact that causal factors are not always entirely indigenous. Because sea turtles are among the most migratory of all Caribbean fauna, what appears as a decline in a local population may be a direct consequence of the activities of peoples many hundreds of kilometers distant. Thus, while local conservation is crucial, action is also called for at the regional level.        In order to adequately protect migratory sea turtles and achieve the objectives of CEP's Regional Programme for Specially Protected Areas and Wildlife (SPAW),  The Strategy for the Development of the Caribbean Environment Programme (1990-1995)  calls for ""the development of specific management plans for economically and ecologically important species"", making particular reference to endangered, threatened, or vulnerable species of sea turtle. This is consistent with Article 10 of the Cartagena Convention (1983), which states that Contracting Parties shall ""individually or jointly take all appropriate measures to protect ... the habitat of depleted, threatened or endangered species in the Convention area."" Article 10 of the 1991 Protocol to the Cartagena Convention concerning Specially Protected Areas and Wildlife (SPAW Protocol) specifies that Parties ""carry out recovery, management, planning and other measures to effect the survival of [endangered or threatened] species"" and regulate or prohibit activities having ""adverse effects on such species or their habitats"". Article 11 of the SPAW Protocol declares that each Party ""shall ensure total protection and recovery to the species of fauna listed in Annex II"". All six species of Caribbean-occurring sea turtles were included in Annex II in 1991.        This CEP Technical Report is the eighth in a series of Sea Turtle Recovery Action Plans prepared by the Wider Caribbean Sea Turtle Recovery Team and Conservation Network (WIDECAST), an organization comprised of a regional team of sea turtle experts, local Country Co-ordinators, and an extensive network of interested citizens. The objective of the recovery action plan series is to assist Caribbean governments in the discharge of their obligations under the SPAW Protocol, and to promote a regional capability to implement scientifically sound sea turtle conservation programs by developing a technical understanding of sea turtle biology and management among local individuals and institutions. Each recovery action plan summarizes the known distribution of sea turtles, discusses major causes of mortality, evaluates the effectiveness of existing conservation laws, and prioritizes implementing measures for stock recovery. WIDECAST was founded in 1981 by Monitor International, in response to a recommendation by the IUCN/CCA Meeting of Non-Governmental Caribbean Organizations on Living Resources Conservation for Sustainable Development in the Wider Caribbean (Santo Domingo, 26-29 August 1981) that a ""Wider Caribbean Sea Turtle Recovery Action Plan should be prepared ... consistent with the Action Plan for the Caribbean Environment Programme."" WIDECAST is an autonomous NGO, partially supported by the Caribbean Environment Programme.

ABSTRACT      Aruba (1230'N, 70W) is located 32 km north of Venezuela and 67 km west of Curaao, Netherlands Antilles. Until recently, Aruba was one of six islands comprising the Netherlands Antilles. As of 1 January 1986, Aruba became an autonomous entity within the Kingdom of the Netherlands. Aruba is very dependent economically on tourism. Tourism is a fast-growing market and is the biggest employer on the island. The major attractions are a favorable climate and extensive white sandy beaches, especially along the western and southwestern shores where most of the largest hotels are situated. Most hotels are built right at the beach edge (or on the beach) and a coastal highway provides easy access to once remote areas. Lighting and general activity may inhibit turtles from coming ashore to lay their eggs in these high density development areas, but nesting appears to be so rare that trends are difficult to quantify.    Very little is known about the distribution or abundance of sea turtles in Aruba. Four species may nest: the loggerhead or (in Papiamento)  cawama ,  Caretta   caretta ; the green turtle or  tortuga blanco ,  Chelonia   mydas ; the leatherback or  driekiel ,  Dermochelys   coriacea ; and the hawksbill or  caret ,  Eretmochelys   imbricata . Low density nesting occurs on the large sandy beaches of the western and southwestern coasts, as well as on selected pocket beaches along the north shore. Offshore, hawksbills and green turtles of varying sizes are present year-around and presumably feed in local waters. Sea grasses and/or coral reefs (providing food and shelter to hawksbills and green turtles) are situated along the relatively calm western and southern coasts; the north shore is characterized by rough seas. The extent to which Aruba provides forage for loggerheads and olive ridleys is not known. The rare leatherback is a seasonal visitor, arriving from northern waters only for the purpose of egg-laying.     Preliminary beach surveys in 1993 indicate that, despite high density commercial development, most nesting may occur on the west coast and on Eagle Beach and Arashi in particular. More in-depth surveys are planned for 1994 to document the timing and distribution of nesting. It is likely that fewer than 30 nests (all species combined) are laid in Aruba each year. Our records indicate that the leatherback is the most common nester, but this may be a reflection of the fact that leatherback tracks are the easiest of all the sea turtles to identify.    All species of sea turtle have been protected in Aruba since 1987; eggs have been protected since 1980. There are no turtle fishermen. An unquantified (but probably low) level of accidental catch occurs, mostly in nearshore nets set along the west coast. The clandestine catch is nearly impossible to quantify since fishermen will not discuss it with Fisheries Officers. Two boutiques in the capital were selling tortoiseshell jewelry during recent market surveys, and 15 whole shells were confiscated by police in September 1993 from a gift shop on the north coast. The jewelry is reportedly fashioned locally, but the shells were imported from Venezuela. A few restaurants are selling turtle meat (mostly purchased from Venezuelan fishing boats selling their wares in Oranjestad Harbor), but this activity is expected to decline since the Prime Minister sent a letter to all local restaurants in April 1993 reiterating that the possession, purchase, and/or sale of sea turtle products was forbidden by law.    The most common threats to sea turtles coming ashore to nest in Aruba are beachfront lights, obstruction of nesting habitat by recreational equipment (lounge chairs, sailboats), and, in some cases, harassment by onlookers. The most common threat to eggs is compaction and embryo death due to vehicles driving on the beach. In the case of hatchlings, beachfront lighting from hotels and the coastal boulevard poses the greatest danger. In at least three cases in 1993, hatchlings were collected from inland sites and returned the sea after having been misdirected by beachfront lighting. At sea, there are indications that turtles are sometimes struck by boats and other pleasure crafts. Coral reefs are damaged by indiscriminate anchoring (especially at popular dive sites) and pollution is significant in some areas, most notably San Nicolas Bay.    Despite a variety of factors that threaten our sea turtles and their habitats, it is clear that Aruba is starting from a very strong position with regard to sea turtle conservation. Full legal protection is already in place, there is no economic dependency on sea turtles or their products, there are plans to designate the entire west and south coasts a Marine Park (including a system of moorings to protect coral reefs), and there is considerable interest on the part of hoteliers to play a positive role in the conservation of turtles and their nest sites. Conservation groups and government agencies are increasingly involved in public awareness campaigns and materials provided by WIDECAST have significantly aided this effort.     The Sea Turtle Recovery Action Plan for Aruba describes the following priorities: (a) to strengthen public awareness initiatives, (b) to encourage greater activism on the part of law enforcement officials in the confiscation of contraband and prosecution of offenders, (c) to deter-mine the distribution and timing of the breeding effort, (d) to eliminate vehicle traffic on the beaches (driving on beaches is already illegal in Aruba), and (e) to promote full involvement of all beachfront hoteliers in reducing beachfront lighting on the nesting beaches and rescuing (and releasing to the sea) disoriented hatchlings.    Table of Contents         SAMENVATTING      Aruba (1230'N, 70W) ligt 32 km. ten noorden van Venezuela en 67 km. ten westen van Curaao, Nederlandse Antillen. Tot voor kort was Aruba n van de zes eilanden van de Nederlandse Antillen. Met ingang van 1 Januari 1986 werd Aruba een zelfstandige entiteit in het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden. Aruba is op economisch gebied sterk afhankelijk van toerisme. Toerisme is een sterk groeiende markt en is de grootste werkgever op het eiland. De grootste attracties zijn het gunstige klimaat en de uitgebreide witte stranden, speciaal aan de west en zuidwest zijde waar de meeste grote hotels zijn gelegen. De meeste hotels zijn gebouwd op de grens van het strand (of op het strand) en een kustweg geeft makkelijke toegang tot gebieden die vroeger moeilijk bereikbaar waren. Verlichting en algemene activiteiten kunnen schildpadden verhinderen in deze sterk ontwikkelde gebieden om aan land te komen en hun eie ren te leggen, maar het komt zo sporadisch voor dat het moeilijk is om de ontwikkeling met zekerheid vast te stellen.    Zeer weinig is bekend over de verdeling of hoeveelheid van zeeschildpadden op Aruba. Waarschijnlijk nesten er vier soorten: de ""loggerhead"" of (in het Papiaments)  cawama ,  Caretta   caretta ; de ""green turtle"" of  tortuga blanco ,  Chelonia   mydas ; de ""leatherback"" of  driekiel ,  Dermochelys   coriacea ; en de ""hawksbill"" of  caret ,  Eretmochelys   imbricata . Een klein aantal nesten wordt gevonden op de zandstranden aan de west en zuidwest kust en ook op de kleine baaistranden langs de noordkust. In de kustwateren zijn gedurende het gehele jaar ""hawksbills"" en ""green turtles"" van verschillende groottes aanwezig, die zich waarschijnlijk in lokale wateren voeden. Zeegras en/of koraalriffen (die het voedsel en de schuilplaats verschaffen aan de ""hawksbills"" en ""green turtles"") liggen aan de betrekkelijk rustige west en zuidkust; de noordkust wordt gekenmerkt door een ruwe zee. De hoeveelheid voedsel die Aruba kan voorzien voor ""loggerheads"" en ""olive ridleys"" is onbekend. De zeldzame ""leatherback"" is een seizoen bezoeker, komende uit noordelijke wateren met als enig doel om eieren te leggen.    Voorlopig strandonderzoek in 1993 geeft aan dat ondanks de grote commercile ontwikkeling, de meeste nesten voorkomen op het Eagle strand en bij Arashi. Verdere studies zijn in voorbereiding voor 1994 om de locaties en verspreiding vast te leggen van de nesten. Het is waarschijnlijk dat er minder dan 30 nesten (alle soorten tezamen) per jaar gelegd worden. Onze gegevens tonen aan dat de ""leatherback"" de meest voorkomende zeeschildpad is die aan land komt om eieren te leggen, maar dit kan zijn omdat haar sporen het makkelijkst te herkennen zijn in vergelijking met de andere soorten.    Alle soorten zeeschildpadden zijn sinds 1987 beschermd in Aruba; de nesten en eieren zijn reeds vanaf 1980 beschermd. Er wordt geen zeeschildpadvisserij beoefend. Een onbekend (maar waarschijnlijk klein) aantal toevallige vangsten komt voor in ringnetten die vanaf de westkust gezet worden. De klandestiene vangst van zeeschildpadden is moeilijk vast te stellen, aangezien de vissers dit onderwerp niet met de visserijcontroleurs van de overheid willen bespreken. Twee boutiques in de hoofdstad verkochten sieraden gemaakt van het schild van deze dieren, tijdens een recent gehouden marktonderzoek, en 15 hele schilden werden in September 1993 in beslag genomen in een souvenirwinkel aan de noordkust. Er werd gezegd dat de sieraden lokaal gemaakt worden, maar dat de schilden uit Venezuela geimporteerd worden. Enige restaurants verkopen schildpadvlees (meestal ingekocht van Venezolaanse vissersboten die hun waren in de haven van Oranjestad verkopen) maar de verwachting is dat deze activiteiten zullen verminderen, aangezien de Minister President in April 1993 een brief heeft gestuurd aan alle lokale restaurants, om er op te wijzen dat het in bezit hebben, het kopen en/of verkopen van zeeschildpadproducten bij de wet verboden is.    De meest voorkomende bedreigingen voor het aan land komen van zeeschildpadden zijn strandverlichting, het belemmeren van toegang tot de nestomgeving door recreatiemateriaal (strandstoelen, zeilboten), en, in sommige gevallen, het lastig vallen van de dieren door het aanwezige publiek. De meest voorkomende bedreiging voor de eieren is het aanstampen van het zand en embryosterfte door het rijden met voertuigen op het strand. In het geval de ""hatchlings"" (pas geboren zeeschildpadjes), zijn de strandverlichting van de hotels en de boulevardverlichting het grootste gevaar. Bij minstens drie gevallen in 1993, werden de ""hatchlings"" landinwaarts aangetroffen en toen teruggebracht naar de zee, nadat zij door strandverlichting verdwaald waren. Er zijn aanduidingen dat op zee, schildpadden soms door boten en andere pleziervaartuigen worden geraakt. Koraalriffen worden beschadigd door het willekeurig ankeren (speciaal op populaire duikplaatsen) en vervuiling is opvallend, vooral in de baai van San Nicolas.    Ondanks de vele factoren die de zeeschildpadden en hun leefomgeving bedreigen, is het duidelijk dat Aruba uitgaat van een sterke positie wat betreft de bescherming van zeeschildpadden. Volledige wettelijke bescherming bestaat reeds, er bestaat geen economische afhankelijkheid van zeeschildpadden en hun producten, er bestaan plannen om de gehele west en zuidkust aan te wijzen als onderwaterpark (inclusief een systeem van vaste boeien om de koraalriffen te beschermen), en er bestaat interesse van de zijde van de hotels om een positieve rol te vervullen bij de bescherming van schildpadden en hun nestgebieden. Natuurbescher-mingsorganisaties en overheidsinstanties zijn steeds meer betrokken bij campagnes met publieke bewustmaking als doel en materiaal verschaft door WIDECAST heeft hieraan een sterke bijdrage geleverd.    De ""Sea Turtle Recovery Action Plan"" voor Aruba omschrijft de volgende prioriteiten: (a) om de publieke bewustmaking te versterken, (b) om de justitie aan te moedigen om smokkelwaar in beslag te nemen en de overtreders te vervolgen, (c) om de verspreiding en tijdsindeling van de broedactiviteiten vast te leggen, (d) het voorkomen van voertuigverkeer op de stranden (het rijden op de stranden is reeds wettelijk verboden op Aruba), en (e) het bevorderen van een volledige inzet van alle hotels om hun strandverlichting te verminderen bij de nestgebieden en het redden (en het loslaten) van verdwaalde ""hatchlings"".         Table of Contents         RESUMEN      Aruba (1230'N, 70W) se encuentra localizada a 32 km al norte de Venezuela y a 67 km al occidente de Curazao, Antillas Neerlandesas. Hasta hace poco, Aruba era una de las seis islas que comprenden las Antillas Neerlandesas. Desde el 1 de enero de 1986, Aruba se convirti en una entidad autnoma del Reino de los Pases Bajos. La economa de Aruba depende mucho del turismo. El turismo es un mercado que aumenta a pasos rpidos y genera la mayor cantidad de empleos en la isla. Las mayores atracciones son un clima favorable y unas playas extensas de arena blanca, especialmente a lo largo de las costas occidental y suroccidental donde estn situados la mayor parte de los grandes hoteles. La mayora de los hoteles se encuentran ubicados a la orilla de la playa (o sobre la playa) y una autopista costera provee acceso fcil a lo que una vez fueron reas remotas. En estas reas de alta densidad de desarrollo, la iluminacin y la actividad general puede inhibir a las tortugas a que vengan a la playa a poner huevos, pero la anidacin parece ser tan rara que es difcil cuantificar las tendencias.    Se conoce muy poco de la distribucin o abundancia de tortugas marinas en Aruba. Pueden anidar cuatro especies: la Caguama o la Cabezona o (en Papiamento)  cawama ,  Caretta   caretta ; la Tortuga Verde del Atlntico o  tortuga blanco ,  Chelonia   mydas ; la Lad o la Tora o  driekiel ,  Dermochelys   coriacea ; y la Carey o  caret ,  Eretmochelys   imbricata . La anidacin de baja densidad ocurre sobre las largas playas arenosas de las costas occidental y suroccidental, as como sobre selectas playas encajonadas a lo largo de la costa norte. En las aguas frente a las costas, las Carey y las Tortugas Verdes del Atlntico de varios tamaos se encuentran presentes durante todo el ao y se alimentan, presumiblemente en las aguas locales. Los pastos marinos y/o arrecifes coralinos, que proveen alimento y cobijo a las tortugas Carey y Verde del Atlntico, se sitan a lo largo de las costas relativamente calmas del occidente y sur; la costa norte se caracteriza por aguas turbulentas. No se conoce en qu grado Aruba proporciona forraje para las Caguamas y las Tortugas Verdes del Atlntico. La rara tortuga Lad es una visitante estacional, que llega de las aguas del norte con el slo propsito de poner huevos.    Encuestas preliminares sobre las playas en 1993 indican que, a pesar de la alta densidad del desarrollo comercial, la mayor parte de la anidacin puede ocurrir sobre la costa occidental y sobre Eagle Beach y Arashi, en particular. Para 1994 hay planes de realizar encuestas ms detalladas con el objetivo de documentar el tiempo y la distribucin de la anidacin. Es posible que en Aruba se hagan menos de 30 nidos (combinadas todas las especies). Nuestros registros indican que la tortuga Lad es la que anida ms comnmente, pero esta puede ser una refleccin del hecho de que las pistas de la tortuga Lad son las ms fciles de identificar.    Desde 1987, estn protegidas en Aruba todas las especies de tortugas marinas; los huevos estn protegidos desde 1980. No hay pescadores de tortugas. No se ha cuantificado (pero es probablemente bajo) el nivel de captura accidental, especialmente en las redes cercanas a las costas a lo largo de la costa occidental. La captura clandestina es casi imposible de cuantificar ya que los pescadores no lo informan a los Oficiales de Pesca. Durante encuestas de mercado recientes, dos ""boutiques"" de la capital vendan joyas de caparazn de tortuga, y en septiembre de 1993 fueron confiscadas por la polica 15 caparazones enteras en una tienda de la costa norte. Se dice que las joyas se fabricaron localmente, pero que las caparazones se importaron de Venezuela. Unos pocos restaurantes venden carne de tortuga (la mayora comprada a las embarcaciones pesqueras de Venezuela que las venden en el Puerto de Oranjestad), pero se espera que esta actividad se reduzca desde que el Primer Ministro envi una carta a todos los restaurantes locales en abril de 1993 reiterando que la posesin, adquisicin, y/o la venta de productos procedentes de tortuga marina se halla prohibido por la ley.    Las amenazas ms comunes a las tortugas que llegan a anidar en las costas de Aruba son iluminacin de la playa, obstruccin de los habitats de anidacin por equipos recreativos (reposeras, embarcaciones), y, en algunos casos, el acoso de los observadores. La amenaza ms comn a los huevos es la muerte del embrin por aplastamiento debido a los vehculos que pasan por la playa. En el caso de las juveniles, el mayor peligro es la iluminacin procedente de los hoteles y las avenidas costeras. En el mar, hay indicaciones de que algunas veces las tortugas son golpeadas por botes y otras embarcaciones de recreacin. Los arrecifes coralinos se daan porque las embarcaciones anclan indiscriminadamente (en especial en los sitios populares de buceo) y la contaminacin es significativa en algunas reas, ms notablemente en San Nicolas Bay.    A pesar de una variedad de factores que han amenazado nuestras tortugas marinas y sus habitats, est claro que Aruba se encuentra en una posicin muy firme con respecto a la conservacin de tortugas marinas. Ya se tiene proteccin legal plena, no existe dependencia econmica con respecto a las tortugas marinas y sus productos, hay planes para designar las costas occidental y sur completas como Parque Marino (incluso un sistema de boyas para proteger los arrecifes coralinos), y existe un inters considerable por parte de los hoteleros para desempear un papel positivo en la conservacin de tortugas y sus lugares de anidacin. Los grupos conservacionistas y las agencias gubernamentales se estn involucrando cada vez ms en las campaas de concientizacin pblica, y los materiales provistos por WIDECAST han contribudo de forma significativa a este esfuerzo.    El Plan de Accin para la Recuperacin de la Tortuga Marina para Aruba describe las siguientes prioridades: (a) fortalecer las iniciativas destinadas a la concientizacin pblica, (b) promover un mayor activismo en la confiscacin de contrabando, as como sancin a los transguesores por parte de los oficiales encargados de hacer cumplir la ley, (c) determinar la distribucin y el tiempo en que se realizan los esfuerzos de procreacin, (d) eliminar el trfico de vehculos sobre las playas (conducir en las playas ya es ilegal en Aruba), y (e) promover la participacin plena de todos los hoteleros de la playa en la reduccin de iluminacin frente a las playas donde ocurre la anidacin y rescatar (y liberar en el mar) a las juveniles desorientadas.         Table of Contents         RESUME      L'le d'Aruba (1230'N, 70O) se trouve dans les Antilles nerlandaises  32 km au nord du Venezuela et  67 km  l'ouest de Curaao. Jusqu' trs rcemment, Aruba faisait partie des six les composant les Antilles nerlandaises. Aruba est devenu, le 1er janvier 1986, une entit indpendante au sein du Royaume des Pays- Bas. L'conomie d'Aruba dpend exclusivement du tourisme qui est un march en croissance acclre et permet le plus grand nombre d'emplois sur l'le. Les plus grands atouts sont le climat favorable et les plages de sable blanc, trs tendues, en particulier le long des ctes ouest et sud-ouest o se situent la plupart des grands htels. La majorit de ces htels sont construits au bord des plages (ou sur la plage mme), une auto-route ctire donnant accs  des zones autrefois loignes. La forte luminosit et l'activit gnrale peuvent empcher aux tortues de sortir de l'eau dans ces zones trs exploites afin de pondre leurs œufs. La nidation semble tre si rare que les tendances sont difficiles  quantifier.    On connait trs peu la distribution ou l'abondance des tortues de mer  Aruba. Quatre espces y font leurs nids: la tortue caouanne ou (en Papiamentou)  cawama ,  Caret ta   caret ta ; la tortue verte ou  tortuga blanco ,  Chelonia   mydas ; la tortue luth ou driekel,  Dermochelys   coriacea  et la tortue imbrique ou  caret ,  Eretmochelys   imbricata . La nidation se fait dans une faible mesure sur les vastes plages sablonneuses sur les ctes ouest et sud-ouest ainsi que sur quelques petites plages de la cte nord. En mer, les tortues imbrique et les tortues vertes de diffrentes tailles sont prsentes toute l'anne et s'alimentent dans les eaux locales. Les bancs d'algues et/ ou les rcifs coralliens (qui servent de nourriture et d'habitat aux tortues  caille et aux tortues vertes) se trouvent tout au long des ctes ouest ou sud qui sont assez calmes. On ignore jusqu' quel point Aruba reprsente une source d'alimentation pour la tortue caouanne et la tortue olivtre. La tortue luth, espce rare, est un visiteur saisonnier, arrivant du nord uniquement pour pondre ses œufs.    Des tudes prliminaires en 1993 indiquent que, malgr la densit du dveloppement commercial, la plupart de la nidation se fait sur la cte ouest et en particulier sur la plage Eagle et  Arashi. Des tudes plus dtailles sont prvues pour 1994 afin de rassembler des documents sur la priodicit et la rpartition de la nidation. Il se peut que moins de 30 nids (toutes les espces combines) soient faits  Aruba chaque anne. Selon les informations disponibles, la tortue luth est celle qui fait le plus souvent un nid; nanmoins, ceci peut sembler parce qu'il est trs facile de suivre les traces de la tortue luth.     Toutes les espces de tortues ont t protges depuis 1987 et leurs œufs depuis 1980. Il n'existe pas de pcheurs de tortues. Un nombre indtermin (mais peut-tre trs faible) de prises accidentelles se produit surtout dans les filets tendus prs des ctes de l'ouest. La prise clandestine est presque impossible  quantifier car les pcheurs ne veulent pas en parler aux responsables de la Division de la Pche. Lors des rcentes tudes de march, deux boutiques dans la capitale vendaient des bijoux en caille de tortue. En septembre 1993, 15 carapaces entires ont t confisques par la police dans une boutique de la cte nord. Les bijoux seraient fabriqus localement mais les carapaces auraient t importes du Venezuela. Quelques restaurants vendent la chair de tortue (achete en grande partie auprs des bateaux vnzuliens vendant leurs marchandises dans le port d'Orenjestad) mais cette activit devrait diminuer grce  la lettre envoye par le premier ministre en 1993 interdisant la possession, l'achat ou la vente de tout produit li  la tortue marine.    L'clairage des plages, l'obstruction de la zone de nidation par les quipements de loisirs (chaises longues et yatch), et dans certains cas, le harclement par les badauds constituent les principales menaces  la monte sur les plages des tortues. En raison des vhicules qui roulent sur les plages, les œufs courent le risque d'tre crass, occasionnant la mort de l'embryon. Les jeunes tortues, elles, sont le plus souvent dranges par l'clairage des plages, et les routes construites sur les ctes. Dans au moins trois cas en 1993, de jeunes tortues ont t ramasses dans des sites  l'intrieur et retournes  la mer car elles ont t mal diriges par l'clairage des plages. En mer, les tortues seraient parfois heurtes par les bateaux de plaisance et autres. Les rcifs coralliens sont dtruits par l'ancrage hasardeux (surtout dans les sites populaires destins  la plonge) tandis que la pollution est importante dans certaines zones, notamment dans la baie de Saint Nicolas.     Malgr les nombreux facteurs qui menacent nos tortues marines et leurs habitats, il est vident que le programme de protection de la tortue marine en Aruba repose sur une structure bien tablie. Une protection juridique totale est dj assure et il n'y a aucune dpendance conomique exclusive sur la tortue marine ou ses produits. Il est prvu que les ctes ouest et sud, soient dsignes comme Parc marin, en y ajoutant un systme d'ancrage pour protger les rcifs coralliens. Les hteliers sont eux-mmes prts  jouer un rle positif dans la protection des tortues et de leurs nids. Les cologistes et les agences gouvernementales participent de plus en plus activement aux campagnes de sensibilisation du public et le matriel fourni par WIDECAST a t trs utile  cet gard.     Le Plan d'action pour la sauvegarde de la tortue de mer  Aruba s'est fix les priorits suivantes: a) renforcer les initiatives de sensibilisation du public; b) encourager une action plus militante de la part de ceux chargs de l'application des lois pour qu'ils confisquent les produits illgaux et poursuivent en justice les dlinquants; c) dterminer la rpartition et la priode de reproduction; d) liminer la circulation de vhicules sur les plages (cette pratique est dj illgale  Aruba); et e) encourager la pleine participation de tous les hteliers ayant des constructions sur la plages pour rduire l'clairage des plages de nidation, rattraper et retourner  la mer les jeunes tortues qui sont dsorientes.    Table of Contents         I. INTRODUCTION      Until recently, Aruba was one of six islands comprising the Netherlands Antilles. As of 1 January 1986, Aruba became an autonomous entity within the Kingdom of The Netherlands. It now has its own constitution based on the same principles as The Netherlands. A Governor appointed by the Queen of Holland for a six year period acts as her representative. Legislative, executive and judicial powers are established along parliamentary democracy guidelines. The parliament, comprised of 21 members elected every four years by universal suffrage, legislates. The party (or parties) obtaining legislative majority is asked by the Governor to form a seven-member Council of Ministers vested with executive powers and headed by a Prime Minister.    Aruba (1230'N, 70W) is located 32 km (19 miles) north of Venezuela and 67 km (42 miles) west of Curaao, Netherlands Antilles (Figure 1). It is situated outside of the hurricane belt and its climate is of a semi-arid type. The average temperature is 27C (81F), annual rainfall and humidity average 43.2 cm (17 in) (mostly in the months of November-January) and 75.9%, respectively. Aruba is a small, flat island measuring 32 km (20 miles) long by a maximum width of 10 km (6 miles); total area is 193 km 2 . Its highest point is Mount Yamanota (190 m). The resident population is about 70,000, but this is considerably increased by the influx of tourists, especially during the winter months (Table 1).    Aruba is very dependent economically on tourism, especially since it became separated from the Netherlands Antilles. Today tourism is a fast-growing market and is the biggest employer on the island (AHATA, unpubl. statistics). The major attractions are a favorable climate and extensive white sandy beaches, especially along the western and southwestern shores where most of the largest hotels are situated. Most hotels are built right at the beach edge (or on the beach) and a coastal highway provides easy access to once remote areas. Lighting and general activity may inhibit turtles from coming ashore to lay their eggs in high density development areas, but nesting appears to be so rare that trends are difficult to quantify.    Along the south shore, small coral islands protect the coastline from rough seas. Surrounding these small islands are fringing coral reefs, although the reefs are less developed than those in Curaao and Bonaire. Unlike its closest neighbors, Curaao and Bonaire, Aruba lies entirely within the confines of the South American continental shelf and the sea separating it from the mainland does not exceed 135 m in depth (average depth is 50 m). To the north, the sea bottom drops off to depths of 200 m and more. A strong east tradewind renders the north coast largely unsuitable for swimming and recreation. Sandy beaches suitable for sea turtles to come ashore and nest were surveyed in 1993 for signs of egg-laying. This was the first time such a survey had been conducted.    In a global review of the status of green turtles ( tortuga blanco ) and hawksbills ( caret ), Groombridge and Luxmoore (1989) concluded that nesting and foraging may occur in Aruba, but there were no data to indicate where such activities might take place. In preparing this Recovery Action Plan we interviewed government officials, conservationists, fishermen, and coastal residents, initiated preliminary habitat surveys, and involved ongoing projects (such as the current UNDP fisheries project) that may yield insight into the distribution of sea turtles. With this information, we have attempted to identify habitats important to sea turtles and factors threatening their survival. While a great deal of effort has gone into preparing the Recovery Action Plan, its publication is only the beginning of our conservation efforts.     Because of our involvement in WIDECAST, sea turtle conservation in Aruba is now a national commitment rooted in an understanding of sea turtle biology and an awareness of conservation techniques and options. This Recovery Action Plan summarizes what is known, identifies important gaps in existing knowledge, and provides policy-makers and non-government groups with detailed information needed to make informed decisions regarding the conservation and recovery of depleted sea turtle stocks. It is clear that our priorities should be to refine our knowledge of important nesting and feeding areas, promote public awareness of the plight of endangered sea turtles, and implement specific management initiatives (such as the protection of eggs in zones of high beach use) to enhance survival prospects.    Table of Contents              II. STATUS AND DISTRIBUTION OF SEA TURTLES IN ARUBA      In the Caribbean Sea, five species of sea turtle are recognized as  Endangered  and a sixth, the loggerhead turtle, as  Vulnerable  by the World Conservation Union (IUCN) (Groombridge, 1982). There is ample evidence that all six species have declined from former levels of abundance in many parts of the region. The factor most clearly responsible for their demise is the relentless commercial harvest for meat, shell, oil, skins, and eggs which has been ongoing for more than a century. In addition, turtles are accidentally captured in active or abandoned fishing gear, resulting in death to tens of thousands of turtles each year. The continued existence of Caribbean populations is also threatened by oil spills, human and industrial waste, garbage dumped at sea, indiscriminate anchoring, beach sand mining, beachfront lighting, and a variety of other factors that degrade important nesting beaches and feeding grounds.    Very little is known about the distribution or abundance of sea turtles in Aruba. Four species may nest: the loggerhead ( cawama ), green turtle ( tortuga blanco ), leatherback ( driekiel ), and hawksbill ( caret ). Nesting is only very rarely reported, and the species is virtually never identified. Low density nesting occurs on the large sand beaches of the west and southwest coasts, as well as on selected pocket beaches along the north shore. Offshore, hawksbills and green turtles of varying sizes are present year-around and presumably feed in local waters. The extent to which Aruba provides forage for loggerheads and olive ridleys is not known. The rare leatherback is a seasonal visitor, arriving from northern waters only for the purpose of egg-laying. The Kemp's ridley is confined to the Gulf of Mexico and temperate north Atlantic and is not reported in Aruba. Figure 2 summarizes diagnostic features of local species.           2.1  Caretta   caretta , Loggerhead Sea Turtle      The loggerhead sea turtle, known as  cawama  in the local language (Papiamento), nests occasionally and is sometimes encountered at sea. The loggerhead is recognized by a large head (to 25 cm wide, according to Pritchard et al., 1983) and thick, somewhat tapered carapace (=shell) with five pairs of lateral plates (=scutes) (Figure 2). The carapace is often encrusted by barnacles. The large head and strong jaws, for which the species was named, are necessary adaptations to an omnivorous diet of mollusks and hard-shelled crabs; tunicates, fishes, and plants are also eaten (Dodd, 1988). Adults attain a straightline carapace length of 120 cm and weigh up to 200 kg (440 lb) (Pritchard et al., 1983). The color is red-brown to brown; hatchlings are sometimes gray. Like hawksbills, loggerhead hatchlings are uniform in color, top and bottom. Frazer and Ehrhart (1985) estimated age at sexual maturity to be 12-30 years, and predicted that the upper estimate was the more realistic value.    Loggerheads are found as far north as Newfoundland (Squires, 1954) and northern Europe (Brongersma, 1972) and as far south as Argentina (Frazier, 1984), but they have a predominately temperate nesting distribution. The greatest numbers of nesting females are recorded along the Atlantic coast of Florida (USA) and at Masirah Island, Oman. In the Wider Caribbean, nesting is reported on the Caribbean coasts of Mexico and Central America, the Atlantic coast from Venezuela to Brazil, and rarely in the eastern Caribbean (summarized by Dodd, 1988). According to the existing paradigm (at least for the large rookeries in the U. S.), hatchlings leave their natal beaches and are carried passively on the North Atlantic subtropical gyre in  Sargassum  seaweed rafts to areas of the eastern North Atlantic, including the Azores. After several years of pelagic existence, the juveniles (typically 50-65 cm shell length) return or are returned by currents to the western North Atlantic to become resident benthic (=bottom) feeders on the continental shelf.    It is not known whether the species is resident or itinerant in the waters of Aruba. There are no data detailing which size classes are most common. Foraging presumably takes place, but important feeding areas have not been identified. In November of 1983, in the vicinity of the Diva Hotel, hatchlings emerged from the sand. Based on an average of two months of incubation, these eggs were laid in September [N.B. nesting typically begins in April or May in the Western Atlantic and ends in September (summarized by Dodd, 1988)]. Roberto Hensen, Managing Director of Marcultura in Bonaire, was given a dozen of the hatchlings. Hensen gave seven of these to the Seaquarium on Curaao (they subsequently died), and kept five. Four are alive to this day and doing well at the Marcultura facility. On 26 April 1993, a loggerhead nested at Eagle Beach between the Manchebo and Costa Linda hotels; hatchlings emerged 26 June (48 hatchlings were counted, 20 unhatched eggs were exhumed). On 17 August 1993, five dead (desiccated) hatchlings were found on northern Arashi Beach. In contrast to the green turtle (section 2.2), the loggerhead leaves an  asymmetrical  nesting crawl (1-1.2 m wide) on the beach because the fore flippers alternate with one another during crawling.    With only three nests reported to LVV in more than a decade, the present level of nesting is sure to be low, perhaps 1-2 females come ashore each year. We have no data as to whether this number has declined over the years. Clutch size and frequency (the number of clutches laid per year per female) are unknown, but based on data collected elsewhere in the Western Atlantic, each female would be expected to deposit 1-6 clutches averaging 120 eggs each at 12-14 day intervals during the nesting season (summarized by Dodd, 1988). Individual turtles do not generally nest every year. Most females return to the nesting beach every second or third year, although remigration intervals as long as seven years have been reported (e.g., Richardson et al., 1978; Bjorndal et al., 1983). The sex of the hatchlings is largely determined by beach sand temperature (e.g., Mrosovsky et al., 1984). Few hatchlings will survive the many years to sexual maturity, but those who do will return to the beaches where they were born to start the cycle anew.    Rebel (1974) reported that eggs were taken opportunistically for personal consumption. Unfortunately, more current information is not available. We are aware of a low level of clandestine harvest of sea turtles in Aruba (section 3.3), but we have no documentation to suggest that loggerheads are involved.           2.2  Chelonia   mydas , Green Sea Turtle      The green turtle, referred to in Papiamento as  tortuga blanco , is one of the two most common turtles seen in the waters of Aruba, the other being the hawksbill turtle. The green turtle is recognized by a single pair of scales on the ""forehead"" between the eyes and a round, blunt beak serrated for clipping sea grasses. The carapace is smooth and the plates (=scutes) do not overlap one another (cf. hawksbill turtle, section 2.4). The carapace is characterized by four pairs of lateral scutes (Figure 2) and is generally devoid of barnacles. The maximum reported weight of adult females nesting in Suriname is 182 kg (400 lb) (Schulz, 1975). Adults generally measure 95-120 cm in straightline carapace length. Adults and juveniles of varying sizes are present in Aruba throughout the year.    It is likely that individual green turtles do not remain in local waters throughout their lives. Hatchlings emerge from their nests, scurry to the sea, orient offshore in a swimming frenzy that persists over a period of days, and ultimately enter an offshore convergence or weed line. It is well known, for example, that  Sargassum  seaweed rafts shelter hatchling green turtles and also harbour a diverse, specialized fauna, including many kinds of little fishes, crustaceans, worms, mollusks, tunicates, and coelenterates; these may provide food for the young turtles (Carr, 1987a). The turtles remain epipelagic (surface dwelling in the open sea) for an unknown period of time (perhaps 1-3 years) before taking up residence in continental shelf habitats. Unlike the loggerhead (section 2.1), the epipelagic years are not likely to involve trans-Atlantic movement.    Upon leaving the open sea existence that characterizes their earliest years, green turtles become herbivores and remain so for the rest of their lives (Bjorndal, 1985). In the Caribbean Sea, green turtles feed primarily on the sea grass  Thalassia   testudinum  (Bjorndal, 1982), commonly referred to as ""turtle grass"". Field studies indicate that individual turtles maintain feeding ""scars"" by returning to the same area of sea grass meadow to forage each day (Ogden et al., 1980, 1983). These scars, or grazing plots, are maintained by regular cropping for several months and the more digestible newer growth (higher in protein, lower in lignin) is preferred (Bjorndal, 1980). When the cropped grasses show signs of stress (blade thinning, increased inter-nodal distance), the turtle apparently abandons the scar and moves on to form another. In Aruba,  Thalassia  is most common in Palm Beach Bay (Figure 3).    Green turtles travel extensively during the first decades of their lives and in the years preceding reproductive maturity take up temporary residence in many locations (Carr et al., 1978). They may travel thousands of kilometers throughout the region before the urge to reproduce impels them to migrate to mating and nesting grounds, the latter presumed to be their natal (=birth) beach. Caribbean green turtles reach sexual maturity at an estimated 18-36 years of age (reviewed by Frazer and Ladner, 1986). After reproducing, there is some evidence that turtles return to resident foraging grounds (=feeding areas). Therefore, the movements of adult turtles are likely to be less extensive than those of juveniles, since adults move seasonally between relatively fixed feeding and breeding areas. Tagging and telemetry studies would be useful to determine residency and movement patterns in the waters of Aruba.    van Buurt (1984) did not report green turtle nesting, but an earlier reference (Rebel, 1974) cited personal communication from Dr. Ingvar Kristensen that ""eggs are taken for local consumption from the three species that nest -- green, hawksbill, and loggerhead."" If green turtles do nest in Aruba, such occurrences may be rare. Egg-laying has never been documented by LVV. Olinda van der Linden-Rasmijn watched a nesting female which she believes was a green turtle (olive-green color, very smooth shell, deep nesting pit) at Dos Playa on 9 May 1993; unfortunately, the eggs were subsequently lost to high seas. In general, green turtles prefer to nest on open beach platforms, as opposed to rocky or densely vegetated areas. Nests are characterized by a deep pit (1.5-2 m wide and 1 m deep) and a symmetrical crawl (1-1.2 m wide) leading to and from the ocean. Elsewhere in the Caribbean, 3-6 clutches of eggs are deposited per female per year. Adults are migratory, leaving the nesting grounds at the close of the breeding season and returning to repeat the ritual on multiple (2-3+) year intervals. Within season nestings are typically separated by 12-14 days and each clutch consists of about 120-150 eggs. Nesting is nocturnal. At the region's largest rookery (Tortuguero, Costa Rica), most nesting occurs between mid-June and mid-September (Bjorndal and Carr, 1989).    Green turtles are occasionally (and incidentally) netted, but the number of turtles taken is believed to be low (section 3.3). There is currently no export of green turtles; those not sold to local restaurants are sold to or shared with members of the community. Until recently, green turtles were quite frequently imported from Venezuela for restaurant sale (Rebel, 1974; J. Sybesma, 30 March 1987,  in litt . to Groombridge and Luxmoore, 1989). The precise origin of the turtles brought into Aruba from Venezuela is not known, but many of them are captured off the east coast of the Peninsula de Paraguana (Guada and Vernet, 1988). Others are believed caught in the Gulf of Venezuela in the area of the Monkey Islands (R. de Kort, pers. comm.). The illegal trafficking is not nearly as common today as it was even a few years ago, yet it does continue on an irregular basis (section 3.3).           2.3  Dermochelys   coriacea , Leatherback Sea Turtle      There are only rare reports of leatherbacks, known locally as  driekiel . Leatherbacks are the largest of all sea turtles. Caribbean-nesting females typically weigh 300-500 kg (660-1100 lb). An adult male weighing a record 916 kg (2015 lb) stranded on the coast of Wales, U. K. in 1988 (Morgan, 1989). Leatherbacks lack a bony shell and the smooth black skin is spotted with white. The carapace is strongly tapered, typically measures 130-165 cm in straightline length, and is raised into seven prominent ridges (hence the name "" driekiel "", meaning ""three ridges"") (Figure 2). Powerful front flippers extend nearly the length of the body. Leatherbacks are excellent divers, having been recorded diving in excess of 1000 m offshore St. Croix, USVI (Eckert et al., 1989). Leatherbacks feed predominately on jellyfish and other soft-bodied prey (e.g., Hartog and van Nierop, 1984; Davenport and Balazs, 1991). Age at maturity is not known.    Leatherbacks are likely to be seasonal visitors, with observations largely confined to peak breeding months March-July. Caribbean island populations are relatively small (comprised of a few dozen to a few hundred females), but Yalimapo-Les Hattes, French Guiana, supports an estimated 14,700-15,300 females (Fretey and Girondot, 1989). The turtles prefer to nest on beaches with deep, unobstructed access; contact with abrasive coral and rock is avoided (Eckert, 1987). Leatherbacks deposit an average of 5-6 clutches per year at 9-10 day intervals. Approximately 80-90 yolked eggs are laid in each nest, along with a variable number of smaller yolkless eggs. Tag returns from females tagged while nesting in the Guianas, Trinidad, and the U. S. Virgin Islands indicate that females return to north temperate waters after nesting. Corroborating evidence is available from studies of barnacle colonization on gravid females in St. Croix (Eckert and Eckert, 1988).    No nesting had been documented on Aruba at the time data were being assembled for the first Western Atlantic Turtle Symposium (van Buurt, 1984). However, in early April 1985, a leatherback with an estimated length of 1.5 m came ashore on Eagle Beach on the west coast of the island. An article in  La Prensa  (9 April 1985) reported that she was scared away by onlookers and had to return to the beach three times before her eggs were successfully laid. Three years later (2 April 1988), a female came ashore at Arashi beach (Figure 4). Nesting may occur regularly in this area but, since the beach is undeveloped, there are no security guards to observe and report nesting activity. In one case, 12 hatchlings from Arashi Beach were transferred to a mariculture facility on Bonaire (Marcultura Ltd.) where they were fed a diet of  Cassiopeia  jellyfish; they died 6-12 months later (Roberto Hensen, Marcultura, pers. comm.). Interviews and habitat surveys conducted for this Recovery Action Plan revealed additional evidence of nesting, but always along the western shore (Table 2).    In some parts of the Caribbean (e.g., French Guiana, Guyana, Trinidad, Grenada, St. Lucia, British Virgin Islands), gravid leatherbacks are killed for meat and/or oil whilst on the nesting beach. The shell and cartilage are boiled down for oil. The oil is often used for medicinal purposes, generally in cases of respiratory congestion (Cambers and Lima, 1990), and is sometimes believed to have aphrodisiac qualities. In addition to harvest, other threats include entanglement (longlines, shrimp trawls, pot lines, nets) and the ingestion of persistent ocean debris, notably plastic bags which are mistaken for jellyfish, the preferred prey item. A leatherback was brought in to the local abattoir in 1968, but subsequently released (section 3.3).           2.4  Eretmochelys   imbricata , Hawksbill Sea Turtle      The hawksbill is known in Papiamento as  caret  and is recognized by the distinctly over-lapping scutes of the carapace, four pairs of lateral scutes, two pairs of scales between the eyes, and a narrow, pointed jaw (Figure 2). Adults rarely exceed 80 kg (175 lb) (Witzell, 1983) and a straight carapace length of about 90 cm; they are brightly patterned in yellow, gold, orange and brown. Hawksbills feed in coral reefs, where they appear to specialize on sponges. Ten sponge species accounted for 79.1% of the dry mass of all sponges identified in the stomachs of hawksbills from seven Caribbean countries, suggesting a degree of dietary selectivity (Meylan, 1988). Gravid females commonly nest on small, isolated beaches (often flanked by exposed coral and rock) that are difficult for biologists to survey on a consistent basis. When ashore for nesting, hawksbills typically retreat into the beach forest, leaving little evidence of the nest aside from a faint asymmetrical crawl (0.7-0.8 m wide) leading to and from the ocean. The asymmetry results because the fore flippers alternate with one anther during crawling.    In a report to the Western Atlantic Turtle Symposium, van Buurt (1984) speculated that hawksbills would be expected to nest on ""various beaches on the north coast"", but no specific records were available. He noted that there were several small sandy beaches on the north shore, including Boca Grandi, Boca Prins, Andicuri, and Druif (Figure 4). Most of these are surrounded by a limestone plateau; some have backbeach vegetation which includes  Suriana   maritima . We believe that the southeastern beaches, including Boca Grandi and Rodger's Beach, also offer favorable nesting habitat to hawksbills and recommend that future survey efforts include these sites. Very broad sandy beaches on the west and southwest shores are less likely to be suitable for hawksbill nesting; further, this habitat is compromised by intense tourist and industrial development. A few offshore islands such as De Palm Island may still have some nesting (none has been reported to date). Elsewhere in the Caribbean hawksbills nest throughout most of the year, but peak nesting activity is observed from July to November. Preliminary survey efforts in Aruba should be concentrated during this time.    Ongoing research on Long Island (Antigua, Eastern Caribbean) has shown that most hawksbills nest 4-6 times per year (averaging about 150 eggs per clutch), each nest separated by an interval of 14-15 days (range 13-18 days) (Corliss et al., 1989). Average clutch size in Mona Island, Puerto Rico, has ranged from 141.0 (1989) to 157.6 (1984); incubation lasts 47-63 days (Richardson, 1990). Females return to the nesting beach (thought to be their natal beach) at remigration intervals of 2-3 or more years and continue to breed throughout their adult lives. As is the case with other species, hatchling sex is largely determined by sand temperature during a 2-month incubation. Hatchlings emerge from their nests at night, scurry to the sea, and dwell in open ocean habitats for the first years of life. They return to coastal waters as young juveniles and may travel widely during the many years (20-30?) prior to sexual maturity (cf. green turtles, section 2.2).    Hawksbills are occasionally netted during nearshore fishing, but the number taken is believed to be low (section 3.3). The exquisite beauty of the shell scutes (known as ""tortoise-shell"") has long played a central role in jewelry and ornamentation in southeastern Asia (especially Japan) and, to a lesser degree, in the Caribbean. Harvest of hawksbills for their shells, while illegal in many nations, continues at a high rate in many parts of the world and is the single largest threat to the survival of the species in the Caribbean and elsewhere. In Aruba, two Oranjestad boutiques were found selling tortoiseshell in May 1993 and again in September 1993 (K. Eckert, pers. obs.) and in both cases the clerk noted that the items were fashioned locally. LVV is not aware of the identity of the supplier, but both stores will be investigated. In addition, Venezuelan suppliers illegally bring whole shells into Aruba whereupon they are sold to local buyers and ultimately to store owners (section 3.3).           2.5  Lepidochelys   kempi , Kemp's Ridley Sea Turtle      There are no records of Kemp's ridleys in Aruba, nor would the species be expected to occur. The diminutive Kemp's ridley is gray in color as an immature and primarily olive-green as an adult (Pritchard et al., 1983). The carapace is round, often as wide as it is long, and carapace scutes do not overlap one another (cf. hawksbill sea turtle, section 2.4). According to Ross et al. (1989), adults weigh 60-90 lb (27-41 kg) and have a shell length of 23-30 inches (58-76 cm). The species is carnivorous and eats mostly crabs, but also preys upon other crustaceans, shellfish, jellyfish, sea urchins, starfish, and fish. With the exception of a single recapture from Caribbean Nicaragua of a ""head-started"" individual (Manzella et al., 1991), which may have displayed altered behavior due to having been held captive during its first year (Woody, 1991), Kemp's ridleys are confined to the Gulf of Mexico and temperate northern Atlantic. The total adult population is thought to number no more than 900 females and an unknown number of males (Ross et al., 1989), making it the world's most endangered sea turtle. The species nests almost exclusively in the state of Tamaulipas, Mexico.     2.6  Lepidochelys   olivacea , Olive Ridley Sea Turtle    There are no records of this species in Aruba, although it may occur. A female was landed by a fisherman in Curaao in July 1991 (Sybesma and Hoetjes, 1992). Olive ridleys are similar in appearance to Kemp's ridleys (section 2.5), having a nearly round carapace (the width about 90% of the length) and an adult color of olive green or brown dorsally and yellowish white ventrally. The turtle rarely exceeds 100 lb (45 kg) (Pritchard et al., 1983). Each front flipper bears a single claw, the horny beak may be finely serrated, and carapace scutes do not overlap one another. The lateral scutes (those to either side of the median on the shell) are divided into 5-9 pairs, considerably more than other sea turtles which typically have 4-5 pairs. The only significant nesting colony in the Western Atlantic is in Suriname, primarily at Eilanti Beach (Schulz, 1975). Olive ridleys nesting in Suriname have declined considerably in recent years, from about 3,000 nests per year in the late 1960's to fewer than 500 nests per year today (Reichart and Fretey, 1993). Diffuse nesting occurs in northwestern Guyana and in French Guiana (Reichart, 1989).    Table of Contents              III. STRESSES ON SEA TURTLES IN ARUBA             3.1 Destruction or Modification of Habitat      Because many beaches suitable for egg-laying are also suitable for recreational tourism, much of the potential historical nesting habitat of sea turtles is now despoiled to a greater or lesser degree by large hotels or hotels under construction, by the activities of growing numbers of tourists and residents, and by a coastal boulevard that provides access to points once remote along the western shore.    Hotel development began with the construction of the Aruba Caribbean Hotel in 1959, followed by the Sheraton in the late 1960's. At the present time, virtually all nesting habitat along the west and southwest coasts has been developed in luxury, high rise hotels. Further north, at Arashi Beach, beachfront development consists of private residences. The capital of Oranjestad is also developed on what was once beachfront property. Vehicles have recently become commonplace on some beaches (e.g., Boca Prins, California Dunes, Eagle Beach) and this has caused noticeable damage (tire ruts, destruction of vegetation). Fortunately there is no history of commercial beach sand mining in Aruba, so this has not been a source of beach destruction. The widespread disposal of waste tar between Boca Grandi and Rincon by the LAGO Oil Company from 1926-1985 is not likely to have affected the beaches themselves; the deposits were cleaned away in 1991.    In some areas, foraging habitat (coral reefs and sea grass) has been adversely modified during the course of the twentieth century. Perhaps the most extreme example is San Nicolas Bay where long-term effects of chronic pollution (industrial harbor, chemical plant) include low coral cover, low coral recruitment, and modified reef species composition (section 4.143). Oil still finds its way into San Nicolas Bay as a result of the multifarious operations of the Coastal Oil refinery (which replaced the LAGO facility), and untreated sewage is also disposed of in the bay. In the past, dredging shoreward of the islands offshore Surfside did considerable damage to sea grass beds there. There is no indication that anchoring has damaged sea grass beds, but the story is different for coral reefs. Damage is particularly apparent at popular dive sites, where coral heads can be observed to be broken and/or overturned. For this reason, among others, most dive operators are keen in their support for the proposed Marine Park (section 4.12) and its system of moorings. Indiscriminate anchoring by fishing boats is also a problem. Some areas popular for skin diving and snorkeling, such as Palm Island on the south shore, receive large groups of tourists off visiting cruise ships and significant damage is visible to fragile shallow water reef formations.    The challenge in Aruba is to identify remaining habitat still important to sea turtles, and then to establish as a priority the safeguarding of this habitat in order to conserve our sea turtle resource. For new development sites, field surveys should be undertaken to assess usage of the site by sea turtles. Mitigation measures should then be required to minimize or eliminate negative effects of anchoring, dredging, sewage and garbage disposal, land reclamation, artificial beach lighting, and the construction of seawalls and jetties, etc. (see sections 4.13 and 4.14). For existing development sites, creative and comprehensive solutions must be explored to re-duce current threats, including artificial lighting, vehicle traffic on the beach, the trampling of nests, etc. (see section 4.12).           3.2 Disease or Predation      There are no data on the extent to which disease affects sea turtles in Aruba. Fibropapilloma, a poorly understood tumor disease in green turtles, is debilitating and can be fatal (Jacobson et al., 1989; Ehrhart, 1991). In some cases the disease has resulted in blindness and starvation. In the southern regions of the Caribbean the disease has affected green turtles in Curaao (Sybesma, 1989), Panama (Jacobson, 1990), Trinidad (Jacobson, 1991), Barbados (Horrocks, 1992), and Venezuela (Guada et al., 1991). It has not been reported in Aruba. Tumors appear as whitish or gray growths, similar to warts, which can be 10 cm or more in diameter.    Predation and other natural causes of mortality differ among life stages. Eggs are lost primarily to beach erosion and domestic animals (i.e., dogs). In general, hatchlings fall prey to dogs, crabs, ants, coastal/sea birds and, once offshore, to reef and pelagic fishes. Juveniles also face dangers from pelagic fishes, but, by the time adulthood is reached, the only non-human predators of any consequence are large sharks and killer whales. The remains of an approximately 28 kg hawksbill turtle were found in the stomach of a 4-meter tiger shark captured off St. Thomas (Boulon, 1984). A similar incident is reported from Nevis by Young (1992). Leatherback remains were found in the stomachs of three killer whales captured off St. Vincent (Caldwell and Caldwell, 1969). Natural levels of predation have not been determined in Aruba, but are assumed to be within tolerable limits.           3.3 Over-utilization      It is painfully difficult to quantify the historical abundance, harvest, and marketing of sea turtles in Aruba. With the exception of abattoir records (Table 3), there are no relevant data on this topic. Earlier reports have confessed facing similar obstacles (e.g., van Buurt, 1984). Sea turtles are certainly a rare sight today, especially on the nesting beaches where perhaps fewer than 30 nests are laid (all species combined) each year. It is difficult to believe that sea turtles have always been rare in Aruba (especially given the seemingly superb nesting habitat that characterizes the west coast; indeed, residents interviewed for this report contend that Eagle Beach was always a ""popular"" nesting area), but it is possible that they were never as common as we might think. It is significant that Aruban people claim no familiar folklore concerning sea turtles (e.g., locating a nesting female by signs in the night sky) and there have not been any turtle fishermen in recent memory. A broken piece of carapace is archived in the Archaeological Museum of Aruba, but there is no information as to where it was collected, the species or estimated age. Regarding eggs, the extent to which they are collected is unknown, but LVV is not aware of any physical evidence (open pits, probing sticks) of poached nests and eggs have not been seen for sale.     There is a long-standing tradition of importing sea turtles from Venezuela and, to a lesser extent, from Colombia. General knowledge holds that they were mostly adult greens, although hawksbills were also included. Guada and Vernet (1988) document the slaughter of green turtles captured along the east coast of the Peninsula de Paraguana (Venezuela) for black-market export to Aruba and Curaao. The trade was lucrative; at that time a 30 cm green turtle shell sold for US$ 10 in Aruba, while in Venezuela the price was but a small fraction of that (Guada and Vernet, 1988). Import volume will never be known but, based on abattoir statistics, fewer than 10 turtles were legally processed in a typical year (1977-1986) (Table 3). Imports apparently diminished in the late 1980's, perhaps as a result of the 1987 legislation banning the take or possession of sea turtles in Aruba. The imported animals were often placed on tires on the ship's deck so as not to damage their shells. Prior to slaughter, turtles were kept in corrals made of loose rocks in front of the Government Building in Oranjestad. By law, they had to be slaughtered at the abattoir whether they were local-caught or imported. Restaurants and hotels bought much of the meat, which was more expensive than fish. A leatherback was brought into the abattoir in 1968, but Veterinary Service staff convinced the fishermen to release the animal. The abattoir stopped processing turtles in September 1986 with the advent of protected status.    In recent memory, turtles caught locally have been snared by nearshore seines (see section 4.27). The catch is opportunistic, and the meat is considered a delicacy. In April 1993, a local diver reported to LVV that he had encountered the shell of a freshly slaughtered turtle on the sea bottom at Blue Reef. Meat also still arrives on small boats that originate in Venezuela and transport fish to the floating market in Oranjestad Harbor. The volume of this trade is unknown and, as turtles are not regular fare on these boats, difficult to control. Restaurants purchase some if not most of the turtle meat. In early May 1993, Fisherman's House Restaurant in Savaneta advertised a Mother's Day Special Menu that included sea turtle meat. Several residents called LVV to report the advertisement and to request enforcement action. LVV officials immediately visited the restaurant and spoke with the proprietor. Ten kilos of green turtle meat had been purchased the day before from the floating market. The proprietor claimed never to have purchased turtle meat before and only wanted to offer ""something different"" for Mother's Day. He willingly agreed to dispose of the meat and not to purchase it again. It is quite clear in cases such as this one that the law protecting turtles is an unfamiliar one, and that a concerted effort at public awareness is needed. Knowledge shared with the community at a LVV/WIDE-CAST slide show at the Public Library at the same time that the restaurant was running the advertisement most likely led to informed residents alerting LVV to the incident. Following this incident, the Prime Minister sent a letter to all island restaurants reminding them that sea turtles are protected by law.    In addition to meat, sea turtle shells are also imported illegally from Venezuela. On 29 September 1993 a tourist reported to LVV that the gift shop at the Natural Bridge (a popular visitation site on the north coast) was selling whole polished shells of endangered sea turtles. LVV notified the Police and on 30 September, two uniformed officers visited the shop and informed the owner that sea turtles are protected in Aruba and the sale of their parts or products is forbidden. Later the same day Karen Eckert visited the shop to document the species involved. In all, 15 shells had been offered for sale to unsuspecting tourists at prices ranging from US$ 10-20. Two of the smallest shells (28-30 cm) were of the hawksbill; the other 13 (up to 65 cm) were of the green turtle. The shop clerk stated that they had not known of the law protecting the turtles and that all the shells had been purchased the previous week from a local importer who had obtained them from a Venezuelan vendor. The contraband was confiscated by the Police; a fine is not likely to be levied for a first offense. A letter from the Prime Minister to all gift shops reminding proprietors of the 1987 law prohibiting import, export, purchase, sale, etc. of sea turtles (including parts or products) would be very useful in curbing these offenses [N.B. a similar letter was mailed to island restaurants on 26 April 1993]. A diplomatic letter from the Government of Aruba to the Government of Venezuela protesting the illegal export (into Aruba) of endangered turtle meat and shell would also be appropriate.    A low level of illegal commerce in tortoiseshell jewelry also continues. In a survey of Oranjestad gift stores conducted by Karen Eckert on 6 May 1993, Potpourri (Sea Port Village Mall) had for sale four pairs of earrings at US$ 8.50 each. The clerk indicated that the items were locally made (not imported). When informed that sale of such items was illegal under Aruban law, the clerk displayed disbelief. When informed that turtles were protected internationally as 'endangered species' and thus any tourist attempting to return home with such items would risk prosecution, the clerk encouraged Eckert to pass them off as ""plastic or goat horn"". At the time of a follow-up survey on 30 September 1993, the store still carried six pairs of earrings at $8.50 each. On 6 May, Cratique Boutique (Harbor Town Mall, now Sea Port Village) had several pair of earrings for $3 each and ""sometimes"" had bracelets which sold for about $6. Again the clerk displayed disbelief when told that it was illegal to sell these items, and offered her assurances that ""everyone eats them and there is certainly no law against it."" On 30 September, this boutique displayed five rings at $3 each. On 6 May, in Anny's Flowershop (Harbor Town Mall), the shell of a small hawksbill (23 cm) hung on the wall. The clerk indicated that a friend had killed it ""a year and a half ago"" and that it was not for sale; the clerk believed that the owner would use it in a special flower arrangement.    The specific examples cited above do not encompass the whole of the problem in Aruba concerning the killing and sale of protected sea turtles, but they illustrate adequately that the Government of Aruba is faced with a variety of challenges in this area and that enhanced public awareness of the status of sea turtles is sorely needed. Much of the sale appears to be aimed at tourists and the image of Aruba as a favorable tourist destination will surely be tarnished the first time an American or European visitor is heavily fined or jailed when attempting to return home with a sea turtle shell. It is noteworthy that 120 nations of the world, including Canada, the U. S., all of Mexico, Central and South America, and all of western Europe, belong to the CITES treaty which prohibits trafficking in sea turtle products across international borders. The maximum fine for attempting to enter the U. S. with a sea turtle shell is $20,000 and/or one year in prison.           3.4 Inadequate Regulatory Mechanisms      Specific legislation exists to protect sea turtles and their eggs (section 4.21), but penalties should be strengthened (section 4.25) and enforcement is problematic (section 4.22). We recommend that the public be made more aware of the laws protecting sea turtles and that citizens be encouraged to report violations. There is a history of importing (mostly green) turtles from Venezuela for sale in restaurants and markets (section 3.3), but this traffic appears to have declined in recent years. Ratification of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) is imminent and will provide a much-needed regulatory tool to curtail trade in many species of internationally protected animals and plants (section 4.31). Ratification of the SPAW Protocol to the UNEP Cartagena Convention (see section 4.32) has not yet been approved, but would strengthen the legal framework for the conservation of sea turtles (and habitat) both domestically and throughout the Caribbean region. With regard to the protection of habitat, there is no explicit coastal zone management legislation but a ""concept law"" (Ruimtelijk Ordenings Plan Kustgebied) developed by a coalition of Government and private agencies was submitted to the Minister in March 1989. This framework sets the stage for comprehensive coastal zoning, land use and physical planning. Additional legislation (Landsverordening houdende regels ter bescherming van de natuur en de daarin voorkomende dier- en plantsoorten) to enable designation and maintenance of marine protected areas is before Parliament as this Recovery Action Plan goes to press (A. Curet, pers. comm.). The political will exists for conservation legislation, but the legislative process is tedious and slow.           3.5 Other Natural or Man-made Factors      Aruba is outside the hurricane belt, but severe erosion, especially of west coast beaches, occasionally results from forceful westerly storms. There are verbal reports of sea turtles struck by boats, 'jetskis', and windsurfers. Some incidents may result in debilitation or death to turtles, but there are no data to evaluate the extent to which this occurs. Natural debris (ocean borne, especially on north coast beaches) and man-made obstacles (especially on west and southwest coast hotel beaches) present a potential threat to the success of sea turtle nesting and hatching. We have not observed turtles ensnared at sea, such as in abandoned fishing gear, netting, or packaging material, but abandoned nets entangled around coral reefs are sometimes encountered by divers. Natural coral ""bleaching"" (a regional epidemic which continues to confound scientists) has been observed offshore Mangel Halto, but the condition is not widespread and the extent to which it has despoiled sea turtle foraging habitat is not known. Other factors reducing the survival prospects of sea turtles in Aruba have not been identified.    Table of Contents              IV. SOLUTIONS TO STRESSES ON SEA TURTLES IN ARUBA             4.1 Manage and Protect Habitat      It is clear that conservation measures aimed at the protection of individual turtles are necessary but ultimately inadequate if the habitats upon which the turtles depend for food, refuge, and breeding are destroyed. Habitats necessary for the survival of endangered sea turtle species include unimpaired sea grass meadows, coral reefs, and sandy beaches. It is noteworthy that these ecosystems are important not only to sea turtles, but to the general productivity and health of Aruba's tourism and fisheries industries.    Sea grass meadows are very important to the ecology of coastal areas, in addition to pro-viding essential foraging grounds for green sea turtles (section 2.2). Sea grass roots stabilize the sea bed and provide foraging habitat for fish, conch, sea urchins, sea stars and many other invertebrates. Sea grass serves as a critical developmental habitat for several commercially important species of fish and invertebrates. Much of the oxygen produced in nearshore water is generated in sea grass beds, and these areas also contribute to the clarity of littoral zones by absorbing animal wastes and stabilizing sediments (UNEP, 1984). Sea grasses are easily degraded by upland deforestation (resulting in nearshore sedimentation), coastal land reclamation, dredging, anchoring, and pollution from sewage and agricultural chemicals. To date we have not observed run-off and sedimentation in nearshore waters, nor, to any large degree, the uprooting of sea grass by indiscriminate anchoring. Past incidents of dredging, such as offshore Surfside, have resulted in only isolated damage. Any potential effects of chronic pollution on sea grasses, especially in the San Nicolas Bay area, have not been studied.    Coral reef communities are also important. Coral reefs provide shelter to sea turtles, as well as food (e.g., hawksbills consume reef-associated sponges, see section 2.4). In order to grow and flourish, coral reefs need clear, clean water and relatively high wave energy (Wilcox, 1989). In return, a healthy reef system protects economic investments along the coast by reducing incoming wave energy and providing a source of beach sand. Coral reefs are also critical habitat for the majority of bottom-dwelling or demersal fish living in nearshore areas of the Caribbean. As such, reefs are vital not only for sea turtles in Aruba, but also for a wide variety of commercially important fishes. More than 300 fish species are found on Eastern Caribbean coral reefs, and approximately 180 of these are used for human consumption (Goodwin et al., 1986). Reefs are easily damaged by indiscriminate anchoring, siltation, specimen collecting, and pollution. Anchoring is a serious concern in some areas and chronic pollution has degraded reefs in the San Nicolas Bay area. A Marine Park and associated mooring system are planned to ameliorate anchor damage, especially at popular dive sites.    In addition to essential marine habitat, sandy beaches are necessary for egg-laying. The protection of sandy beaches is an important component of any effort to conserve and perpetuate Aruban populations of sea turtles. Sea turtles return to the area where they were hatched when the time comes to lay their own eggs. Shoreline development (including beachfront construction, artificial lighting, and the removal of vegetation), coastal armoring, sand mining, and general activity at or proximal to a nesting beach can reduce or eliminate the capacity of the beach to support sea turtle nesting and the successful incubation of eggs. Sound management of the beach resource is imperative; guidelines are provided in section 4.122 and expanded in section 4.13.           4.11 Identify essential habitat      Specific habitats essential to the survival of sea turtles in Aruba have yet to be identified. Nonetheless, it is obvious that habitat both on land (sandy beaches) and at sea (coral reefs, sea grass meadows) is important and should receive significant levels of conservation effort, both to encourage the survival of our sea turtles and to retain the integrity of our economy which depends on fisheries, tourism, and recreation in clean and pleasant surroundings. Surveys to identify specific habitats are recommended below. LVV should initiate this in coordination with local conservation groups such as StimAruba, FANAPA, Accion Ambiental, etc. Other government offices (e.g., VROM) and advisory groups (e.g., Commissie Marien Milieubeheer) are encouraged to participate in efforts to define essential sea turtle habitat.                                            4.111 Survey foraging areas                                              Recently, an offshore inventory of sand sources available for dredging was undertaken and the final report noted concentrations of sea grass offshore the Palm Beach area (Hulsbergen, 1987). The ECNAMP (1980) natural resource atlas for Aruba indicates that Palm Beach has the largest area of sea grass in Aruba and also indicates that sea grasses occur in the protected lagoons shoreward of the southern barrier islands. In addition, ECNAMP (1980) shows coral reef formations along virtually all of the north coast [N.B. the atlas errs in this regard, as true reef formations are found nowhere along the wave-tossed north coast], as well as significant areas of the west coast and offshore the southern barrier islands. A map summarizing existing knowledge of the distribution of sea grass and coral reefs was constructed specifically for this Recovery Action Plan (Figure 3).    Although some survey and biological data are available for the sea grass and reef communities of Aruba (Bak, 1975; Hulsbergen, 1987) there is no information related to the use of these environments by sea turtles. The only information that is available at the present time is anecdotal and fragmentary. For instance, foraging areas for loggerheads ( cawama ), hawksbills ( caret ), and green turtles ( tortuga blanco ) were reported by van Buurt (1984) on both the north and south coasts, but details were not provided. Foraging (presumably by green turtles) has been reported by divers at Rodger's Beach on the east side of the island. Buikhuizen (1993) mentions in his ""Caribbean Story"" that hawksbills are often seen in the coral reef area at the entrance of Oranjestad Harbor, and also at the entrance of Barcadera Harbor (in the latter case, the species was not mentioned).    It is a  recommendation of this Recovery Action Plan  that a program be initiated to assemble information on the distribution and health of potential foraging areas. The implementation of this recommendation has already begun with the efforts of the WIDECAST Coordinator in Aruba to solicit information from the diving and fishing communities. Sander Vellinga (Atlantis Submarines) reports one particular hawksbill regularly seen on the submarine's route outside Barcadera Harbor. In order to seriously gather distribution data, we must work harder to build a sightings network to involve residents in reporting information concerning the distribution, abundance and activities of sea turtles. This might be done through a widely distributed brochure, radio announcements, or by personally soliciting the support of fishermen and divers at meetings convened for this purpose.    A Lead Organization (probably LVV) should initiate a data management system (this could be as simple as a file folder for notes and a large map where sightings can be indicated) so that all observations can be centrally compiled and readily accessible. Standard data/recording sheets are needed. Data should be shared with the CARMABI library in Curaao.                                            4.112 Survey nesting habitat                                              A thorough survey of sea turtle nesting beaches has never been conducted in Aruba. van Buurt (1984) reported to the Western Atlantic Turtle Symposium in Costa Rica that turtles, probably hawksbills, nested on ""various beaches on the north coast""; no information was available as to seasonality. He also reported that there was no nesting on the west coast, a conclusion which we now know to be false (see Table 2). It is a priority  recommendation of this Recovery Action Plan  that a nest survey be conducted. A preliminary survey was carried out by the WIDECAST Coordinator in Aruba and a small group of dedicated residents during the summer of 1993 to assess the feasibility of efforts on a larger scale. Eagle Beach was foot-patrolled daily (23 April to mid-August) from the Aruba Beach Club to Amsterdam Manor, usually between 2200-2400 hr and in the early morning. Selected north coast beaches (Dos Playa, Rincon, Quadiriquiri) were also monitored. Several hotels participated in a meaningful way, especially the Costa Linda which reported three nests and on two occasions collected and released to the sea hatchlings that were disoriented inland by hotel lights.    The positive response to these preliminary efforts have encouraged the Coordinator to expand coverage in 1994. Full coverage will only be possible with the cooperation of a larger group of enthusiasts. Members of ""StimAruba"" (a local conservation group) have indicated their interest in making such an undertaking an official club project, with members agreeing to certain beaches and patrol times. Some FANAPA members have indicated a similar interest, and several non-members are also eager to participate. In all, it should not be difficult to assemble a team large enough to accomplish the task. The most important beaches to cover are indicated in Figure 4. Materials that will enable volunteers to distinguish sea turtle species on the basis of nesting crawls, nest sites, eggs, hatchlings, etc. should be developed with the assistance of WIDECAST. A Lead Organization (probably LVV) should implement a data management system so that all information can be centrally compiled and available for analysis. Standard data/ recording sheets are needed. Data should be shared with the CARMABI library in Curaao.           4.12 Develop area-specific management plans      No specific protected area management plans (relevant to sea turtles) are in place in Aruba. Preliminary surveys conducted in 1993 (section 4.112) indicate that the most important nesting habitat may lie along the western shore. This area is heavily developed by high-rise hotels and the successful implementation of specific management schemes (see section 4.122) will depend heavily on the cooperation of hoteliers. It is a  recommendation of this Recovery Action Plan  that the Minister explore options within the context of current legislation to designate the coast between the Bushiri Beach Hotel and Cudarebe (West Point) a ""Sea Turtle Refuge"". A management plan for the Refuge should be drafted based on recommendations published in this Action Plan -- potentially damaging activities such as vehicles operating on the beach (which is already illegal in Aruba, see section 4.134), the construction of seawalls and jetties, and lights shining on the beach at night should be prohibited or closely evaluated in light of the ecological requirements of endangered turtles.    Offshore, efforts are underway to designate as a Marine Park the west and south shores between Cudarebe and Punta Basora (perhaps seaward to the 40 m contour, this has yet to be determined). Legislation to amend the existing Marien Milieuverordening Aruba (Marine Environment Ordinance) has already been submitted to Parliament to provide a legal basis for such a Park. A system of moorings is envisaged, as well as comprehensive protection to marine re-sources. This same legislation will also provide the legal basis to designate important nesting beaches as reserves, as recommended above.                                            4.121 Involve local coastal zone authorities                                              Management plans such as are called for in section 4.12 cannot be implemented without close involvement by regulatory agencies. The closest thing to a coastal zone management authority in Aruba is VROM within the Ministry of Public Works and Health. There is no comprehensive coastal zone legislation at the present time, but it is noteworthy that the draft Natuurbeschermingsverordening (Nature Conservation Ordinance) calls for an inter-agency Commission empowered to review and evaluate environmental decisions, including those affecting the coastal zone. VROM will be the Lead Agency. It is likely that this Commission will provide the administrative vehicle necessary to propose regulations and submit same to the Minister [N.B. Ministerial approval will be needed, but regulations will not need to be submitted to Parliament]. A more specific discussion follows in section 4.122.                                            4.122 Develop regulatory guidelines                                              It is a  recommendation of this Recovery Action Plan  that development proximal to important nesting beaches carry the requirement that beachfront lighting be designed in such a way as to prevent the disorientation of hatchlings or nesting adults. We recommend that such a requirement be inserted into the permit process for new developments. In the case of existing structures, the Minister should be notified by VROM about options available for mitigation of the most pressing problems, which appear to be beachfront lighting and vehicular traffic on the beach. Beach driving, already illegal, is an enforcement challenge. Options to reduce lighting, which can misdirect hatchlings inland to their deaths, should be evaluated with input from hoteliers. It may be that shielding the lights or extinguishing them during certain periods is more cost-effective than replacing existing fixtures with sodium vapor lights (see section 4.132). Similarly, important feeding areas should be safeguarded from man-induced degradation. Legislation currently before Parliament will provide the legal basis for designation of marine protected areas.    Standard guidelines for the conservation of sea turtle habitat are summarized below and are discussed in further detail in sections 4.13 and 4.14. Several of our recommendations are already included in national law, but oftentimes enforcement is less than adequate. A Division of Environmental Enforcement is highly recommended (see section 4.24).    1)  Sand mining : Commercial mining of beach sand should not be permitted under any circumstances (section 4.131). The persistent removal of beach sand disrupts stabilizing vegetation and exacerbates erosion. Mining pits invite injury to humans and livestock, and accumulate water to serve as breeding areas for mosquitoes and other unwanted insects. Mining sediments offshore should be carefully evaluated for potential effects on coastal beaches, since offshore material is essential for beach maintenance. Preferred extraction sites should be confined to well-studied offshore sites, ravines, and/or interior sites.    2)  Artificial lighting : Sea turtles, especially hatchlings, are profoundly influenced by light. Baby sea turtles, freshly emerged from the nest, depend largely on a visual response to natural seaward light to guide them to the ocean. In zones of coastal development, sources of artificial light distract hatchlings so that they turn away from the sea and crawl landward. It is essential that artificial light sources be positioned so that the source of light is not directly visible from the beach and does not directly illuminate areas of the beach; if lighting must be seen from the beach, it should emit wavelengths (560-620 nm) which are least attractive to sea turtles (Witherington, 1990). Low pressure sodium lights should be used to the maximum extent possible. Low intensity, ground-level lighting is encouraged. Nighttime and security lighting should be mounted not more than 5 m above the ground and should not directly illuminate areas seaward of the primary dune or line of permanent vegetation. Window shading is recommended. No lighting, regardless of wavelength, should be placed between turtle nests and the sea.    Natural or artificial structures rising above the ground should be used to the maximum extent possible to prevent lighting from directly illuminating the beach/dune system and to buffer noise and conceal human activity from the beach. Improving dune height in areas of low dune profile, planting native or ornamental vegetation, or using hedges and/or privacy fences is encouraged. Barriers between 76-85 cm high are generally sufficient to block visual cues from artificial lights (Ehrenfeld, 1968; Mrosovsky, 1970). Ferris (1986) showed that a simple ""fence"" of black polyester material stretched between three posts and positioned between the nest and a lighthouse resulted in the hatchlings orienting correctly to the sea. Balcony lights should be shielded from the beach, decorative lighting (especially spotlights or floodlights) within line-of-sight of the beach should be prohibited, and safety/security lights should be limited to the minimum number required to achieve their functional roles (section 4.132).    3)  Beach stabilization structures : Hard engineering options to beach protection, including impermeable breakwaters, jetties, groynes and seawalls positioned on the beach or in the nearshore zone, should be considered only as a last resort. Throughout the Caribbean region there are numerous examples of beaches lost, rather than secured, as a result of armoring; Aruba is no exception (section 4.133). Sandy beaches are naturally dynamic. The physical characteristics of the coastline should be taken into account prior to coastal construction so that adequate construction setbacks, rather than expensive and often counter-productive armoring, can be used to provide for the long-term conservation of the beach resource.    4)  Design setbacks : If development of land adjoining a sandy beach is planned, construction setback limits should be defined that reflect the damage likely to be caused to the beach and backshore environment during a major storm, and that take into consideration beach and backshore characteristics. Setbacks should provide for vegetated areas including lawns and dunes between hotels, homes and similar structures, and the beach proper. Setbacks of 30-40 m and 80-120 m from the line of permanent vegetation are reasonable guidelines for upland coast development and lowland beach coast development, respectively (section 4.133). Setbacks not only help to protect coastal properties from storm damage, but also reduce over-crowding of the shorezone, lessen the likelihood that local residents will be excluded from the beach, and enhance the probability that artificial lighting will not shine directly on the beach.    5)  Access : The use of motorized vehicles should be prohibited on sandy beaches at all times and parking lots and roadways (including any paved or unpaved areas where vehicles will operate) should be positioned so that headlights do not cast light onto the beach at night. Driving on the beach creates unsightly ruts, exacerbates erosion, and lowers sea turtle hatch success by compacting nests (section 4.134). Tire ruts also present a significant hazard to hatchlings crossing the beach. Where vehicles are needed to transport heavy fishing or recreational equipment, multiple access points should be provided and vehicles parked landward of the line of permanent vegetation. Pedestrian access to beaches should be confined to specific locations and strictly regulated so as to minimize destruction of the beach, including vegetation, by trampling.    6)  Waste disposal : No dumping should be permitted within the nearshore, beach, dune, or wetland environment of the shorezone. Such dumping as has already occurred should be subject to immediate cleanup. The fouling of beaches runs counter to the economic interests of both residents and commercial landowners. Litter can obstruct hatchlings on their journey to the sea, discarded glass and metal can injure turtles, and larger objects on the beach can prevent females from finding a nest site. Visitors should be required to pick up and take with them any garbage or other waste brought to or generated at the beach. Trash cans and regular pickup should be provided at all beaches. To the extent that beach cleanup is necessary, it should be done by hand or using hand tools (section 4.134).    7)  Vegetation cover and fires : All attempts should be made to preserve vegetation above the mean high tide mark. Creeping and standing vegetation stabilizes the beach and offers protection against destructive erosion by wind and waves. The beach forest provides important nesting habitat for the hawksbill turtle and offers natural shielding for the beach from the artificial lighting of shoreline development (section 4.132). Fires, either for recreation or charcoal production, should be prohibited on beaches. Fires are a hazard to the surrounding dry forest, create unsightly scars, may scorch sea turtle eggs and hatchlings beneath the surface of the sand, and can disorient hatchlings. Cooking fires should be restricted to designated grill facilities.    8)  Marine pollution : The dumping of solid or chemical wastes into the sea should be prohibited under all circumstances. In addition to degrading the environment for residents and visitors alike, sea turtles often ingest tar, plastic, rope, and other substances (e.g., Mrosovsky, 1981; Balazs, 1985; Lutz and Alfaro-Schulman, 1991), presumably mistaking these for food, and become weakened or die. It is commonplace for sea turtles to confuse plastic bags with jellyfish and eat them. Polluted effluent, including oil, sewage and landfill overflow, from land-based sources should be eliminated or centrally treated before its discharge into the sea. See sections 4.143 to 4.146.    9)  Anchoring and dredging : Anchor damage is a leading cause of destruction to sea grass meadows and coral reefs throughout the Wider Caribbean. It is essential that yachts and other boats be required to either anchor in designated sand bottom areas, or tie in at approved moorings in coral reef areas. Alternatively, vessels should be required to remain offshore, beyond the zone of living coral and sea grass. Dredging activities should be planned to minimize damage (i.e., sedimentation) to down current coral and sea grass. Severe disruption of the sea bed, especially in living sea grass and coral communities, can ruin actual or potential foraging areas for sea turtles, negatively affect the natural dynamics of the marine environment, and result in the loss of beach sand. See also section 4.147.    10)  Physical destruction of coral and sea grass : In the absence of the sheltering influence of offshore reefs, shorelines are often severely altered, resulting in great economic and environmental losses. Neither coral reefs nor algal ridges should be dynamited or dragged with chains in order to provide boat access. Anchoring should not occur in reef or sea grass areas (see above, and section 4.147). Divers, especially tourists, should be thoroughly coached on diving etiquette so as to preclude trampling, collecting, and touching living coral. The practices of using chemicals or dynamite (sections 4.141, 4.142) for the purpose of stunning fish for harvest are prohibited at all times and under all circumstances and should remain so. The destruction of coral reefs resulting from these practices can be irreversible in our lifetime.                                             4.123 Provide for enforcement of guidelines                                              Enforcement is important to the perpetuation of any management program. Ideally, regulations should be formulated with the needs of the community in mind to ensure a general acceptance on the part of the public toward the management framework. It is a  recommendation of this Recovery Action Plan  that civic groups, proximal residents (including hoteliers), and frequent commercial users (e.g., fishermen, divers) be made thoroughly familiar with the management program and be encouraged to report any observed violations. In this way, limited enforcement personnel will not have additional burdens placed upon them. This does not lessen the importance, however, of familiarizing enforcement officers with the new guidelines and regulations and making sure that all reports of violations (e.g., illegal dredging, anchoring, construction, beachfront lighting, waste disposal) are properly addressed by the appropriate enforcement authority. An enforcement subdivision devoted specifically to natural resources and environmental law would be highly desirable (section 4.24).     At the present time, the police corps' Beach Police is responsible for enforcing laws relating to beaches (e.g., pollution, dangerous situations) and nearshore waters (e.g., boating, sailing) adjacent to public and private beaches. In July 1991, Dr. Karen Eckert (Director, WIDECAST) gave a slide presentation to the officers of the Beach Police about the biology and conservation of sea turtles. Regulations enacted to protect sea turtles (and their eggs and hatchlings) whilst on the nesting beach would be the responsibility of the Beach Police, as well as private hotel security. It is noteworthy, however, that private security officials do not have powers of arrest. Within the proposed Marine Park, enabling legislation should provide for enforcement officials to be designated by the Minister. It is essential that Wardens have adequate transport to facilitate surveillance of Park waters. Ideally, mooring fees and other user fees will contribute substantially to financing Park enforcement activities.                                            4.124 Develop educational materials for each management area                                              It is a  recommendation of this Recovery Action Plan  that materials be developed for each management area to explain why it is an important ecological area. These can include signs or displays on site, fliers or posters placed in public areas (airports, hotels, government offices), books and pamphlets, guided tours or field trips to the area, regular media attention, public forum slide shows or interpretive programs. Revenue can often be generated by offering supervised access to protected areas and developing interpretive programming. Ideally, these efforts should be part of a larger national program to inform residents and tourists about nature conservation in general. A national campaign should be initiated by the Government of Aruba in cooperation with conservation and other interested civic groups for implementation in schools, hotels, etc.           4.13 Prevent or mitigate degradation of nesting beaches                                              4.131 Sand mining                                              The chronic mining of sand from nesting beaches accelerates erosion by removing sand and degrading or destroying stabilizing beach vegetation. In severe cases, entire beaches are lost, having been replaced by saline ponds in unsightly pits left by mining operations. Fortunately, beach sand mining is not and never has been practiced in Aruba. The Wetboek van Strafrecht (Penal Code) prohibits the taking of any sediment or rock from Aruba without a permit from Domeinbeheer (Land Management Office). A permit has never been given for white sand. Construction sand (road fill, foundations) is dredged from a designated offshore site (see section 4.147) and has to be purchased from Dienst Openbare Werken (Public Works Department). Concrete aggregate is available from ravine sand or finely crushed rock from interior sources.                                            4.132 Lights                                              Sea turtle hatchlings are sensitive to light and find the sea by orienting toward a bright, open horizon. In a natural situation, this horizon is the ocean. Beachfront development introduces artificial light that attracts hatchlings away from the sea. They may wander into streets and gardens where they are eaten by domestic animals, run over by cars, or die in the heat of the morning sun. The disorientation of hatchlings was reported several years ago at the Caribbean Hotel (now the Radisson Hotel, Palm Beach) and in 1993 at Costa Linda Hotel (Eagle Beach). Nesting females can also be disoriented by artificial light and sometimes travel inland after nesting rather than returning to the sea. It is important that developments near nesting are-as take into consideration this fact and shield utility, security and decorative lighting from shining on the beach. Street lighting also disorients hatchlings. In 1991, two reports of hatchlings crossing the coastal boulevard at Eagle Beach were received by LVV. Many of the hatchlings (species not identified) were crushed. Virtually the entire beach west of Oranjestad is lit. The boulevard parallels the sea and hotels are usually constructed on the seaward side of the road.    Blair Witherington, examining the problem of artificial lighting on the beaches in Florida (USA) and Tortuguero (Costa Rica), found that the presence of mercury vapor lights all but eliminated nesting on affected beaches; nesting of green turtles and loggerheads on beaches so lit was 1/10 and 1/20 that observed on darkened beaches. With this in mind, some beachfront owners in Florida have switched to low pressure sodium (LPS) vapor lighting, which shines primarily in the 590 nm range and has little if any effect on nesting females. Unfortunately, low pressure sodium lights do not appear to constitute a complete answer to this difficult problem. While they are ignored by loggerhead hatchlings, they appear to mildly attract green turtle hatchlings (though to a much lesser extent than do mercury vapor lights; B. Witherington, Florida Department of Environmental Protection, pers. comm.).    It is a  recommendation of this Recovery Action Plan  that developers be required to construct lighting plans so as not to disturb sea turtles. Lights, even LPS lights, should be shielded from shining directly on the beach. A common and effective method for accomplishing this is to plant a vegetation buffer or hedge between the sea and shoreline developments. Alternatively, shields can be built into the lighting fixture. In some areas, the solution may be lie in extinguishing lights for specified evening hours (e.g., 1900-2400 hr) during the hatching season so as to reduce the effects of disorientation. This may be particularly relevant to high rise hotels, such as occur in Aruba, where ground-level shielding cannot solve the whole problem. In the U. S. Virgin Islands, background materials (e.g., Raymond, 1984) are issued to all developers seeking permits for projects which may have an effect on sea turtle orientation due to lighting. Many developers now include this information in their environmental impact assessments and are designing appropriate lighting systems (Ralf Boulon, USVI Division of Fish and Wildlife, pers. comm.).    Where problem lighting associated with existing hotels presents an insurmountable challenge, hotel staff should be required to be vigilant in their efforts to ""rescue"" hapless hatchlings. In 1992 and again in 1993, a letter was sent by the WIDECAST Coordinator in Aruba to all hotels requesting that evidence of sea turtle nesting or hatching be reported to LVV, and that misoriented hatchlings be collected and returned to the sea. In response, several hotels designated their Chief Engineer to serve as a liaison to LVV in this matter. Twice in 1993 the Costa Linda Hotel reported leatherback hatchlings misdirected inland by hotel lights; in both cases, hotel staff carefully collected the hatchlings and returned them to the sea. Also in 1993, Bucuti Hotel staff collected misdirected loggerhead hatchlings and returned them to the sea.                                            4.133 Beach stabilization structures                                              Beach stabilization structures such as breakwaters, groynes, and solid jetties constructed perpendicular to the shoreline often exacerbate beach erosion and can lead to the loss of nesting habitat. A good example is the pier constructed by Shell Oil prior to WWII on the present site of the Divi Divi Hotel. The pier damaged down-current beaches, especially during periods of westward winds, by obstructing the natural longshore transport of sand along the coast. When the Tamaryn Hotel was constructed just east of this site, construction of a seawall was necessary to retain what was left of the beach. Today more than 200 m of potential nesting beach is fully obstructed to turtles for nesting. In another case, an unfinished jetty near the unfinished Ramada Inn has ruined nearshore water clarity and killed sea grasses because a large volume of fill dirt was mixed with jetty boulders and the dirt subsequently washed away. Fortunately, a pier planned between the Holiday Hotel and the Beta Complex will be of piling construction. This pier will provide local fishermen with a central mooring area, security for their boats, and a landing area.    Beach stabilization structures constructed parallel to the shore can also provoke erosion, especially if they armor the zone of fore dunes. Furthermore, seawalls and riprap (unconsolidated rock and boulders) can prevent access by female sea turtles to the nesting beach. It is a  recommendation of this Recovery Action Plan  that holistic coastal zone regulations be developed that mandate responsible coastal zone development, including setback limits, so that the loss of sandy beach (and the need for stabilizing structures) is minimized. Nothing in existing legislation prohibits construction on the beach, although the general custom law states that 9 m above the high water line shall remain ""unobstructed"". Prior to construction, an environmental impact statement (EIS) should be required by a competent consultant and construction permits granted based on the results of the EIS. This is not now required, but in some cases it has been requested of the developer and in other cases the developer has offered it. At the present time the Government can put conditions on long-term leases (and these can include environment-related regulations), but requiring a comprehensive and mandatory EIS should become standard procedure. A related discussion on beach rebuilding is presented in section 4.135.    Setback limits are especially important to the conservation of nesting beaches. If development of land adjoining a sandy beach is planned, it is a  recommendation of this Recovery Action Plan  that setback limits be defined that reflect the damage likely to be caused to the beach and backshore environment during a major storm, and that take into consideration beach and backshore characteristics. Setbacks should provide for vegetated areas, including lawns and dunes between hotels, homes and similar structures, and the beach proper. Setbacks of 30-40 m and 80-100 m from the line of permanent vegetation are reasonable guidelines for upland coast development and lowland beach coast development, respectively. Setbacks not only help to protect coastal properties from storm damage, but also reduce overcrowding of the shorezone, lessen the likelihood that local residents will be excluded from the beach, and enhance the probability that artificial lighting will not shine directly on the beach.                                            4.134 Beach cleaning equipment and vehicular use of beaches                                              Mechanized beach cleaning equipment can puncture or crush incubating sea turtle eggs. It is a  recommendation of this Recovery Action Plan  that the use of such equipment be avoided. At the present time, most beach cleaning is done by hand in Aruba and presents no threat to nesting sea turtles, their eggs or hatchlings. On the western shore, seaweed accumulates during periods of western swells. To accomplish clean-up, light agricultural tractors with wide tires are loaned by LVV to pull cleaning equipment which consists of drag screens to filter surface litter (e.g., cigarette butts). Tractor cleaning is done at most twice per year and is confined to the water line. The activity would not be expected to damage sea turtle eggs. Beach clean-up should never include the removal of live vegetation. Supralittoral trees and shrubbery provide hawksbills with nesting habitat (e.g., Ryder et al., 1989) and stabilize beach sediments. Even raking and removal of leaves and grasses above the high tide line can increase the probability of wind erosion and degrade nesting habitat.    The operation of motor vehicles on sandy beaches is of considerable concern. About half of all nests (five of nine, all leatherback) reported from Eagle Beach (Amsterdam Manor to Aruba Beach Club) in 1993 appear to have been destroyed/crushed by vehicles. Vehicles are operated by both tourists and residents for ""joy-riding"". Offenders are aware that Beach Police officers only patrol until 2100 hr; thus, most illegal activity occurs at night when the beaches are only periodically checked (using flood lights) by Road Patrol officers. In addition to the serious problem at Eagle Beach, nests laid in 1993 at Andicuri Beach on the north coast were damaged by vehicle traffic (Mr. Yarzagaray, pers. comm.) and driving is a long-standing problem in the sand dune ecosystems of Boca Prins and the California dunes. The WIDECAST Coordinator in Aruba has asked car rental agencies to alert tourists to the laws preventing driving on the beaches and has received a positive response from the agencies regarding sponsoring a bumper sticker to underscore the problem. In addition to public awareness initiatives, an arrest and conviction would be very useful. Article 25 of the 1987 Public Waters and Beaches Law (Landsbesluit Openbare Wateren en Stranden, AB 1987, No. 124) prohibits driving motor vehicles, bicycles, and horses on public beaches [N.B. all beaches are public in Aruba]. Maximum penalty is 60 days in prison or 3,000 Afls. No arrests have ever been made.                                            4.135 Beach rebuilding projects                                              There has not been a need for this type of project in Aruba. Wide sandy beaches are extensive and largely stable. To our knowledge, no rebuilding is planned. Should beach rebuilding (sometimes referred to as ""beach renourishment"") be contemplated in the future, it is a  recommendation of this Recovery Action Plan  that replacement sand have the same physical characteristics (e.g., organic content, grain size) as the original sand, or the beach can become hardened and unusable to nesting sea turtles. Any replacement of sand along the coast should be done outside of nesting and hatching seasons, preferably January-March. In this way, the probability of disturbing nesting females or incubating eggs is minimized. The Airport (Surfside) beach is an artificial beach, but not by design. Dredged fill was brought up during field construction, and sand has blown and accumulated along the shore. At Barcadera, there is an artificial beach, again not by design, that was formed by the dredge fill from the harbor. On Sonesta Island, a small artificial beach was constructed by the owner for recreational purposes.    It is worth noting that there is an imbalance in the system somewhere when sand is lost from an otherwise predictable beach habitat and is not replaced by natural accretion processes. The underlying cause can be as direct as an up-current solid jetty or pier that is literally ""starving"" the down-current beaches by interrupting the longshore transport of sand (section 4.133). Or the impetus may be more subtle, as occurs with the removal of beach vegetation, or when nearshore pollution retards the productivity of calcareous (coralline) algae and other sand sources. If dunes are leveled, vegetation removed and/or jetties constructed, the likelihood of committing the owners to repetitive and increasingly expensive rebuilding is heightened.     Useful information regarding beach rebuilding in sea turtle nesting habitat can be obtained from the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, 19100 SE Federal Hwy, Tequesta, Florida 33469-1712 USA.           4.14 Prevent or mitigate degradation of marine habitat                                              4.141 Dynamiting reefs                                              There is no evidence that the dynamiting of coral reefs to stun fishes or to provide access for marine vessels is practiced in Aruba. The use of explosives in nearshore waters can result in extensive and permanent damage to important foraging and refuge areas. The use of explosives is prohibited by Article 1(f) of the General Fisheries Law (Visserijverordening (Visserijbesluit), AB No. 15, 1993). It is a  recommendation of this Recovery Action Plan  that all relevant legislation be strictly enforced.                                            4.142 Chemical fishing                                              There is no evidence that the dumping of chlorine or other chemicals on coral reefs for the purpose of extracting fishes or lobster is practiced in Aruba. This practice results in the death of a wide variety of reef organisms, can seriously degrade hawksbill sea turtle foraging habitat, and can poison important nursery areas for commercial fishes. The use of chlorine bleach and other chemicals for the purpose of catching fish is prohibited by Article 1(e) of the General Fisheries Law (Visserijverordening (Visserijbesluit), AB No. 15, 1993). It is a  recommendation of this Recovery Action Plan  that all relevant legislation be strictly enforced.                                            4.143 Industrial discharges                                              At the major ports of Oranjestad (the capital) and San Nicolas (the second largest urban area), the latter in particular, a history of industrial discharge is well known. Several reports have documented extensive damage to San Nicolas Bay from the oil refinery, chemical plant, and (now closed) rum distillery (e.g., Hoppe, 1985; Bak, 1986, 1987). The disposal of untreated sewage is also a well-known problem in this bay (section 4.146). The response, especially to oil, has been a deterioration of the spatial structure of the offshore reef, comparatively low coral cover (when compared to reefs upcurrent of the refinery), and low coral recruitment in front of and downcurrent of the refinery. According to Bak (1987), ""the results of chronic oil pollution are, after 60 years, clearly discernible over a distance of 10 to 15 km along the reef."" It is a  recommendation of this Recovery Action Plan  that offshore monitoring of pollutants be initiated in Aruba, and especially in high risk areas such as San Nicolas Bay, in order to secure the health of residents and natural systems alike. In addition, the practice of allowing garbage and residue from the land fill (Parkieten Bos) to be discharged into Barcadera Bay should cease. Under VROM supervision, the landfill has been pushed back from the edge of the bay and dikes are under construction to contain landfill spillage. As the bulging landfill reaches capacity, there is a clear need not only to use landfill space more efficiently, but to practice waste reduction and recycling.                                            4.144 At-sea dumping of garbage                                              Garbage and other substances dumped at sea contaminate the environment and threaten sea turtles. Worldwide, death to marine organisms as a result of ingestion or entanglement is a serious problem (e.g., O'Hara et al., 1986; Laist, 1987; CEE, 1987). Mrosovsky (1981) has summarized data showing that 44% of adult non-breeding leatherbacks may have plastic in their stomachs (plastic bags are mistaken for jellyfish and consumed). Styrofoam and other soft plastics also present a significant health hazard to sea turtles (Balazs, 1985). Debris discarded from cruise ships and merchant ships ultimately washes ashore on windward coasts throughout the Caribbean. This is the case in Aruba where the windward (north) coast, including potentially important nesting areas at Rincon and Boca Grandi (Figure 4), is littered with plastics and other debris. Cruise ship waste was collected from north coast beaches during a recent beach clean-up campaign. In contrast, the wide, sheltered beaches of the west coast receive a smaller volume of debris and a greater proportion of it is shore-based in origin. Hotel personnel make a concerted effort to keep these beaches clean.    Article 30 of the 1987 Public Waters and Beaches Law (Landsbesluit Openbare Wateren en Stranden, AB 1987, No. 124) prohibits littering the beaches and public waters with bottles, packaging materials and other solids [N.B. all beaches are public in Aruba]. Maximum penalty is 1,000 Afls. The disposal of waste at sea (waste generated by ships) is prohibited by the 1993 Prevention of Pollution by Ships Ordinance (Landsverordening ter Voorkoming Verontreiniging Door Schepen, AB 1993), which was only recently approved by Parliament. Penalties include two years in prison and/or 100,000 Afls. Despite legislation, dumping violations by the boating community are difficult to monitor and require a concentrated effort at public education, coupled with convenient places to safely dispose of refuse on shore and sure convictions for offenders. It is a  recommendation of this Recovery Action Plan  that an active public awareness campaign be initiated by the Government of Aruba, beachfront hoteliers, and the professional diving community. Penalties for fouling the sea should be well advertised and offenders should be re-ported to the Police.    It is noteworthy that Aruba joined for the first time in 1993 the International Coastal Clean-up Program sponsored by the Center for Marine Conservation in Washington D. C. On 18 September,  all  Aruba's beaches and bays were cleaned! Roeland de Kort (representing VROM, the Lead Organization for the clean-up in Aruba) served as program coordinator. The work was performed on a voluntary basis mainly by students. This event was of ""utmost importance"", since it was not only for the protection of marine wildlife and the promotion of public awareness about litter (especially persistent marine debris), but also for the tourism industry which is the foundation of the local economy (R. de Kort, pers. comm.). Beachfront hotels showed their support for the clean-up by participating in their areas. Other businesses donated collection bags, gloves, transportation, and refreshments. The island was divided into 58 zones (Figure 5), of which 18 were hotel sites, and each zone had a Zone Captain responsible for guiding the volunteers and assembling data. Eight main categories of trash were recorded: plastic, foamed plastic, glass, rubber, metal, paper, wood, and cloth. More than 12,000 kg of trash were collected on 22 km of coastline (and 2 km in the water) by 1200 volunteers.                                            4.145 Oil exploration, production, refining, transport                                              An oil-contaminated environment can be lethal to sea turtles and incubating eggs. Behavioral experiments indicate that green and loggerhead turtles possess limited ability to avoid oil slicks. Physiological experiments show that the respiration, skin, some aspects of blood chemistry and composition, and salt gland function of 15-18 month old loggerheads are significantly affected by exposure to crude oil preweathered for 48 hours (Vargo et al., 1986). There is some evidence to suggest that hawksbills are also vulnerable to oil pollution. Hawksbills (predominantly juveniles), were only 2.2% (34/1551) of the total sea turtle strandings in Florida between 1980-1984, yet comprised 28.0% of petroleum-related strandings. Oil and tar fouling was both external and internal. Chemical analysis of internal organs provided clear evidence that crude oil from tanker discharge had been ingested (Vargo et al., 1986). Carr (1987b) reported juvenile hawksbills (to 20 cm) ""stranded [in Florida] with tar smeared sargassum""; some individuals had ingested tar.     Because Aruba is on the continental shelf of the mainland of Venezuela, and it is close to the lake of Maracaibo, one of the major oil fields of Venezuela, oil exploration has been initiated at various sites. The results indicate that reserves are not substantial enough to warrant extraction. The refining and transport of oil have caused considerable environmental damage to Aruba. The LAGO (ESSO) refinery was closed in 1986 and reopened by Coastal Oil Company in 1991. The destruction of marine habitat between the refinery and Pos Chiquito that has taken place since prior to WWII will be seen for some time. The pitch (tar) field on land was recently cleaned up, but chronic pollution is quite dramatic in San Nicolas Bay (see section 4.135). Oil is sometimes reported on north coast beaches, including Boca Grandi; the source is assumed to tank cleaning, but spills outside of Aruba's waters may also contribute. Most evidence of oil spills and slicks is reported by local airline pilots.    An Oil Spill Contingency Plan has been drafted by a Dutch government agency, but the Plan has yet to be finalized and adopted. The lead technical organizations are VROM and the Fire Department, but the Government lacks the personnel and equipment to deal with major incidents. As much as practicable, responsibility (both prevention and clean-up) should be placed with the companies themselves and not with the Government of Aruba. The draft Plan articulates the responsibilities of the various parties, public and private. To cope with low level accidents, higher risk areas (e.g., harbors, WEB) should have basic equipment on hand at all times. In addition to national planning efforts, a bilateral agreement between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and Venezuela is in the final stages. The Kingdom of the Netherlands ratified the Cartagena Convention (section 4.32), including the Protocol Concerning Co-operation in Combating Oil Spills in the Wider Caribbean Region, on 16 April 1984, and for Aruba on 1 January 1986. Article 3 of the Protocol states:    a. The contracting Parties shall, within their capabilities, cooperate in taking all necessary measures, both preventive and remedial, for the protection of the marine and coastal environment of the Wider Caribbean, particularly the coastal areas of the islands of the region, from oil spill incidents.    b. The contracting Parties shall, within their capabilities, establish and maintain, or ensure the establishment and maintenance of, the means of responding to oil spill incidents and shall endeavor to reduce the risk thereof. Such means shall include the enactment, as necessary, of relevant legislation, the preparation of contingency plans, the identification and development of the capability to respond to an oil spill incident and the designation of an authority responsible for the implementation of this protocol.                                            4.146 Agricultural run-off and sewage                                              Because of the arid climate of the island, natural runoff occurs only during the wet season. Pollution of nearshore waters by agricultural chemicals is not considered a problem. In contrast, since island-wide sewage treatment is not available, untreated or under-treated sewage is discharged directly into the sea at a number of sites. Perhaps the most notable are St. Nicolas Bay and the Simeon Antonio area, both on the south coast. Until recently, some residents of Savaneta discharged sewage directly into the sea, but the Department of Public Works has mandated the installation of cesspits in this area (A. Curet, pers. comm.). A sewage treatment plant at Bubali serves the hotel community and most of Oranjestad as far as the airport. There are plans to connect the San Nicolas area, as well as a commitment on the part of the government to seek funding to connect all other communities along the south coast road. Inland communities are still served by cesspits and septic tanks.                                            4.147 Anchoring and dredging                                              The full extent of anchor damage to coral reefs and sea grass has not been quantified. There is some west coast (Palm Beach Bay) damage to patch reefs a few kilometers offshore, mostly from tankers seeking sheltered anchorage in calm waters. Popular dive sites are heavily affected by anchoring. Arashi is perhaps the worst example, where the once-beautiful reef is now dead. In addition to anchor impact, considerable damage is caused by the anchor chain. All reef areas show damage to some extent, some worse than others, from fisherman's anchors. The persistent, cumulative damage may not always be dramatic, but is clearly visible in mutilated, broken, and sometimes dying coral (T. Duncan and J. Wardlaw, pers. comm.). Permanent anchorages on the southwest and west coastlines are in place for charter yachts. Moorings are planned for the proposed south coast Marine Park.    In the absence of secure moorings, the demolition of coral reefs and the uprooting of sea grasses by anchors will be quick and can be permanent (e.g., Rogers, 1985; Rogers et al., 1988). Therefore, it is a  recommendation of this Recovery Action Plan  that a national system of moorings be installed to minimize anchor damage to coral reefs and sea grass. Halas (1985) has designed an inexpensive mooring system (US$ 100-200/mooring) which is adequate for holding yachts and live-aboard dive boats <100 feet in length. A demonstration of this technology is available upon request to John Halas, Key Largo National Marine Sanctuary, P. O. Box 1083, Key Largo, Florida 33037; Tel: (305) 451-1644. It is noteworthy that Bonaire, Curaao, and Saba Marine Parks have installed mooring buoy systems that work well. Mooring fees and other user fees in Park waters should be earmarked for Park activities, including maintenance, enforcement, and interpretation. Cruise ships (>200 feet in length) are presently restricted to the Oranjestad Harbor Pier.    Oranjestad Harbor is periodically dredged with barge and crane and the spoils dumped at sea; there is no observed damage to potential sea turtle habitat. Similarly, deep water dredging for construction sand off the west coast has not resulted in significant damage to potential sea turtle feeding areas. In contrast, Bucuti Island seaward of Surfside was severely eroded (at least half the beach disappeared) in the early 1980's as a direct result of dredging undertaken for the construction of the airport and the stockpiling of seabed sand for road building and other construction. Other examples of dredging (e.g., Barcadera, Lago Bay) in years past probably did effect serious damage to nearshore sea grasses and other ecosystems perhaps once important to sea turtles. Destruction of sea grass and coral as a result of dredging in San Nicolas Bay (=Lago Bay) is described briefly by Hoppe (1985).    Table of Contents           4.2 Manage and Protect all Life Stages      If sea turtles are to survive in the waters of Aruba, it is necessary to protect them from harassment and killing. The previous section (section 4.1) concerned itself with the conservation and stewardship of habitat, namely sandy beaches and marine areas important to sea turtles either for food or for refugia. The following discussion will focus on the laws that protect sea turtles themselves and how they can be more fully enforced.                   4.21 Review existing local laws and regulations                All sea turtles and their eggs are protected by Marien Milieuverordening Aruba (Marine Environment Ordinance) AB 1980, No. 18. Article IV states that it is prohibited to disturb sea turtle nests, or to remove, destroy, possess, deliver, transport, buy or sell sea turtle eggs. Article V states that it is prohibited to kill animals and/or plants from the waters of Aruba if such animals and/or plants are so listed by subsequent decree. In addition, it is prohibited to sell, purchase, work (as in fashioning earrings from tortoiseshell), deliver, import, export, or possess such animals and/or their parts or products (living or dead). All Atlantic/Caribbean species of sea turtle were listed by Decree No. 51 in 1987. These species are:  Caretta   caretta ,  Chelonia   mydas ,  Dermochelys   coriacea ,  Eretmochelys   imbricata ,  Lepidochelys   olivacea , and  Lepidochelys   kempi . The law is understood to include protection for turtles at sea, as well as gravid females on the nesting beach. The maximum penalty described for violation of these Articles is one month in prison and/or a fine of 2500 Afls. Equipment used in an offense may be confiscated. A repeat offense within a year doubles the penalty due.           4.22 Evaluate the effectiveness of law enforcement      In the absence of Fisheries or other conservation/natural resource enforcement personnel, sea turtle protection statutes are enforced by the Police. In reality, however, the Police Department is over-extended and under-staffed and crimes against wildlife are not viewed as priorities. There has never been an arrest for possession or sale of sea turtles or their products, even though it is common knowledge that the meat is sold illegally from the floating market in Oranjestad and selected boutiques carry tortoiseshell crafts. In September 1993, police officers investigated a tip received that the gift shop at the Natural Bridge (a popular visitation site on the north coast) was selling whole carapaces. The officers confiscated 15 carapaces on display; no fines were levied (see section 3.3). We applaud this action on the part of the Police Department and hope that media coverage of the case will publicize the protected status of turtles in Aruba.           4.23 Propose new regulations where needed      Sea turtles and their eggs have been protected in Aruba since 1987 and 1980, respectively (section 4.21). There is no need for additional legislation, only more vigilant enforcement of existing statutes. In contrast, several deficiencies exist in the regulatory framework with regard to habitat protection (see section 3.4).           4.24 Augment existing law enforcement efforts      Recognizing that environmental law is becoming increasingly important and increasingly technical in Aruba, it is a  recommendation of this Recovery Action Plan  that a Division of Environmental Enforcement be inaugurated within the appropriate Department, most likely within VROM. Similar proposals have been made in the past, and the idea has the support of Police administrators. A minimum of two officers should be hired (or designated from within the Police Department) to oversee compliance with environmental legislation. These officers should be trained in environmental law and enforcement procedures, be responsible for regulations concerning mining and minerals, pollution, protected species, fisheries and marine resources, boater safety, game and hunting, coastal zone permits and compliance, etc., and have the flexibility to work irregular hours. A Workshop should be convened jointly by the Ministry, the Police, including PB1 (Marine Patrol) and the Beach Police, and Customs/Immigration to better inform all officers of conservation regulations and the urgent need to consistently enforce domestic and international laws protecting sea turtles and other depleted species. A Manual of existing environmental legislation should be developed for public distribution.    Clear and public support from senior Government officials is a prerequisite for effective enforcement of environmental statutes. This would foster a greater sense of confidence among arresting officers that offenders would be prosecuted. The media and the conservation community also have important roles to play in encouraging a national consensus that conservation laws are important. Public participation in law enforcement is crucial. Violations should be reported. Complaints should be aired by the national media when reports of violations are ignored. Divers and fishermen are in unique positions to monitor offshore damage to habitat, report illegal landings, and exert peer pressure to reduce violations. The owners of residential and commercial beachfront property should be enlisted to report turtles caught or eggs collected, and to monitor nesting beaches for poaching and other disturbances. No arrest has ever been made for the harvest of endangered turtles or their eggs, even though such harvest is known to occur. Precedent cases are needed so that news of a ""new attitude"" toward offenders will spread.           4.25 Make fines commensurate with product value      Existing penalties include fines, incarceration, and the confiscation of equipment (section 4.21). The maximum fine should be increased in order to substantially exceed product value. It is a  recommendation of this Recovery Action Plan  that penalties in the proposed Nature Conservation Ordinance (Natuurbeschermingsverordening) be adopted as soon as practicable. These include one year in prison and/or a fine of 100,000 Afls. for killing an animal, such as a marine turtle, protected by law.           4.26 Investigate alternative livelihoods for turtle fishermen      Alternative livelihoods for turtle fishermen are not necessary to contemplate at this time because there are no turtle fishermen in Aruba (and this has been the case throughout recent memory). Local fishermen participate in a multi-species fishery. No one depends on sea turtles for their livelihood. The turtle catch is wholly opportunistic and impossible to estimate. Turtles are occasionally brought ashore after being ensnared in seines ( reda ) drawn in shallow nearshore waters. The use of  redas  is prohibited along the south shore and thus this activity is largely restricted to Palm Beach Bay (West Point to Pelican Rocks, see Figure 4). The catch is clandestine and fishermen will not discuss it with LVV officials. A comprehensive Sea Turtle Fishery Frame Survey is not likely to be feasible in Aruba, but it is a  recommendation of this Recovery Action Plan  that the Fisheries Officer take every opportunity to solicit information about the extent to which illegal take occurs. As appropriate, the following points should be made in discussions with fishermen:               Sea turtles are long-lived, reaching sexual maturity in 20-35 years.       Mortality is high in young juvenile stages, but extremely low for fully armored large     juveniles and adults.       Adult females average five clutches of eggs per year and nest every 2-5 years; under     natural conditions females live for many years and lay thousands of eggs in order that     populations remain stable.       Unfortunately, large turtles have historically been targeted because they provide the     most meat; Fisheries laws usually protect only small turtles.       Egg-bearing adult females are taken in disproportionate numbers because they are easily     obtained from the nesting beach.       Over-harvesting large turtles, especially gravid females, is a sure way to invite     population collapse (this has been observed at rookeries throughout the world and is     easily shown mathematically).       Sea turtle populations cannot sustain the persistent harvest of large juvenile and     adult animals.       Nesting populations have been greatly reduced or exterminated all over the Caribbean,     including Aruba, because adults are not surviving long enough to produce the next     generation (the widespread harvest of eggs only exacerbates this problem).       The fact that nesting populations are crashing but juvenile turtles are still seen in     local waters is not surprising -the two stocks are unrelated.       Juveniles travel widely during the many years prior to maturity -local juveniles are     not residents, they are a shared regional resource.       Adult females return to Aruba at regular intervals to lay their eggs and then leave at     the end of the nesting season to return to feeding areas most likely located in distant     countries.       All nations must work together if this shared resource is to survive.                    4.27 Determine incidental catch and promote the use of TEDs      No shrimp trawling occurs in the waters of Aruba, and thus there is no need for use of Turtle Excluder Devices (TEDs) to mitigate the incidental catch of sea turtles in trawl nets. Venezuelan trawlers used to come into Aruban waters, but this ended with the enactment of 1993 General Fisheries Ordinance (Algemene Visserij Verordening, 1993, No. 15).    With the exception of cast nets (bait nets) thrown from shore, net-fishing is prohibited on the south coast from Seroe Colorado to Punta Brabo by the Towing of Fish Nets Ordinance (Verordening op Het Slepen Met Visnetten, 1992, GT No. 17). The penalty is low, however, for offenders (14 days in prison or 100 Afls.). Seines and gill nets are permitted in all other areas, but fishing is largely restricted to the west coast since the north coast is rough. There are about six nets (about 30 m each) active on a regular basis off the west coast. The nets are set offshore when fish schooling is observed, especially in the northern reaches of Palm Beach Bay and Malmok. Nets are set during daylight hours for about an hour. Turtles are sometimes caught, but not usually drowned. The senior author has witnessed three small hawksbills ( caret ) (40 cm shell length) brought ashore in recent years; the last observation was in 1990. In each case the turtle was released, but this may have been because of the presence of LVV personnel. Turtles are not likely to become ensnared by trap buoy lines in Aruba because most traps do not use a buoy line. Traps are relocated by means of a piece of metal can which is secured to the trap and glints in the sunlight. In general, traps are placed in sandy areas near coral reefs and do not seriously damage reefs.    A potentially expanding longline industry may create an incidental catch problem. Until recently, foreign longline vessels (e.g., Italy, Taiwan, USA, Russia, Cuba) fished for tuna in Aruba from January to March. LVV is not aware of any turtle bycatch by these vessels. The activity of foreign vessels has ceased for the time being because new legislation disallows permits for foreign vessels until a stock assessment has been done and the Government has confirmed that local vessels cannot reach the established quota [N.B. there may still be some foreign fishing in local waters because one police boat cannot possibly undertake the necessary surveillance]. A UNDP project is currently undertaking a feasibility study to determine fish populations, economic viability, and the fisheries zone for a new domestic longlining industry. Current fisheries legislation allows longlining with a 200 hook limit, but preliminary results from the UNDP study indicate that longlining may not be profitable in Aruba.    The capture of leatherbacks by longlines has been documented in the northeastern Caribbean (Cambers and Lima, 1990; Tobias, 1991), the southeastern U. S. (Witzell, 1984), and the Gulf of Mexico (Hildebrand, 1987). Leatherbacks ( driekiel ) and loggerheads ( cawama ) are captured in Antigua (Fuller et al., 1992). Fisheries personnel should be aware that the longlining industry has the potential to accidentally catch and kill sea turtles during normal operations. It is a  recommendation of this Recovery Action Plan  that all cases of sea turtle capture, as well as the fate of the animal, be reported to the Fisheries Officer (LVV). Mitigating measures should be imposed should incidental capture be reported.           4.28 Supplement reduced populations using management techniques      Stringent enforcement of existing regulations banning the harvest of sea turtles and their eggs (section 4.21), enhanced public awareness of the protected status of sea turtles (section 4.41), identification of important foraging and nesting areas (section 4.11), national application of guidelines for the conservation of foraging grounds and nesting beaches (section 4.122), and implementing specific, hands-on management initiatives are  considered by this Recovery Action Plan to be the highest national management priorities . In light of the near complete commercial development of nesting beaches, one useful management option is sure to be the translocation of eggs threatened by erosion, predation, or human interference to more secure habitat. A training session on the subject of relocating sea turtle eggs was provided by WIDECAST for LVV staff in May 1993. Should the adoption of more elaborate strategies, such as tagging programs or the maintenance of an egg hatchery, be deemed desirable, methodology should follow that described in the Manual of Sea Turtle Research and Conservation Techniques (Pritchard et al., 1983). Advice and training is also available from WIDECAST.    The decision to move eggs should be made at the time of egg-laying. If eggs are moved after the first 24 hr, the risk is high of dislodging the tiny embryo from the inner lining of the eggshell and killing it. Thus, beaches should be surveyed for nesting activity on a daily, early morning basis (section 4.291). Sometimes a compromise has to be made. If, for example, eggs are exposed by a storm surge, an attempt to salvage the clutch is prudent. There may be a steep decline in the hatch success of the rescued nest, but this would be preferable to a total loss. Eggs should always be handled with utmost care and reburied on a natural beach, preferably the one where the female made the original nest. In the case that it is not possible to move eggs to a safe location on the original beach, a nursery beach should be selected with the assistance of WIDECAST personnel that exhibits all the necessary conditions for successful incubation. The new nest should be dug to the same depth and diameter as the original nest and in the same type of habitat (open beach, beach forest, etc.) so that the temperature of incubation is not altered.     Nest sites should not be marked. To enable researchers to find the nest two months hence and monitor hatch success, the site should be triangulated from predetermined landmarks. Hatchlings should always be allowed to emerge from the nest naturally and traverse the beach unaided as soon as they emerge. Each hatchling is very important and contributes to the probability that enough turtles will mature to perpetuate the population. Those that survive the 20-30 years to maturity will return to the beaches of Aruba to lay the eggs of the next generation. Fenced hatcheries should be used only if absolutely necessary. The artificial incubation of eggs and the improper handling of eggs and hatchlings can be disastrous. Incubation temperature is largely responsible for determining hatchling sex, so any attempt to artificially incubate eggs may skew the normal sex ratio of the nest. A small, fenced hatchery, if absolutely necessary, might be advantageously placed on the beach of a sympathetic hotel. In this way, financial and security support for the hatchery could be solicited from the sponsoring hotel and the hatchery could serve to educate residents and visitors about sea turtles.           4.29 Monitor stocks      Without adequate stock monitoring, it is not possible to evaluate whether conservation and management programs are having the desired effect; that is, whether these programs are successfully recovering depleted sea turtle populations. It is relatively easier to document trends on the nesting beaches, but it is also important to evaluate trends, positive or negative, at local feeding grounds. Techniques and recommendations are explained in the sections that follow.                                            4.291 Nests                                              Leatherbacks ( driekiel ), green turtles ( tortuga blanco ), hawksbills ( caret ), and loggerheads ( cawama ) are all known or suspected to nest in Aruba (section II). Leatherback nesting is likely to commence in March or April, followed by loggerheads in May, green turtles in June, and hawksbills in July. Elsewhere in the Caribbean, leatherbacks terminate nesting by mid-July, but the other three species may continue to nest into the winter season, with hawksbills potentially active through December or later. Monitoring the deposition of eggs on the beaches of Aruba will provide a wealth of useful information, including the distribution and timing of breeding effort, the species involved, the location of the most important breeding habitats, and the fate (i.e., success or failure) of nests laid. Shifts in habitat use can be monitored, as well as trends in population status. Positive results of nest and habitat protection efforts may not be seen right away, however, since eggs protected today will not mature into breeding adults for two decades or more.    In support of the development of this Recovery Action Plan, a preliminary program to monitor nesting beaches was initiated in May 1993 by the WIDECAST Coordinator in Aruba. Ongoing beach patrol is essential in order to record anticipated increases in nest numbers following concerted efforts to protect habitat and turtles from harm. The number of crawls will be the basis of comparison among beaches and among years because the verification of eggs can be problematic. Discriminating between successful egg-laying (a nesting crawl) and unsuccessful egg-laying (a ""false crawl"") may require monitoring hatching activity. Whether or not eggs are deposited will depend on obstacles (erosion bluffs, fallen trees, beach lagoons) encountered by the female during the course of her time on the beach, the level of disturbance (human activity, dogs, lighting), the physical condition of the site chosen (she may encounter impenetrable roots, buried glass, water; the sand may be too dry to hold a nest cavity), and whether the turtle is injured (e.g., a missing flipper can prevent her from successfully excavating a nest chamber).    With experience, some field workers are able to discern a nest from a false crawl and thus calculate the nest:false crawl ratio needed to convert activities reported to actual nests. Sometimes it will be obvious that a turtle landed on the beach and returned to the sea without ever attempting to dig. This is a ""false crawl"". However, when signs of digging are apparent, the observer needs to have some experience watching sea turtles at night in order to distinguish a true nest from a false nest. Gently probing for the eggs with a sharp stick will sometimes confirm the presence of a nest, but the subsequent bacterial invasion attacking the broken egg(s) may destroy the entire nest. In the case of hawksbills, even finding a site suitable for probing among dense vegetation can be difficult. Thus it is recommended that crawls, rather than nests, be the basis of reporting. Of course crawls that are quite obviously ""false"" (e.g., a turtle encounters a tree or bluff and retreats without any sign of nest excavation) or, alternatively, quite obviously successful (e.g., a dog or crab has exposed the eggs) should be noted as such. When a crawl has been counted, it should be disguised with a palm frond or a gentle sweeping motion of hands or feet in order to dissuade possible poachers from finding the site and also to prevent the crawl from being counted twice.    Identifying a crawl as to species is readily accomplished in most cases, since sea turtles leave either a symmetrical or an asymmetrical track in the sand. In the first case, the pattern is made by the simultaneous movement of both front flippers. In the second case, the pattern alternates like a zipper, a result of the turtle moving her front flippers in an alternating rhythm. Leatherbacks leave a deep, symmetrical crawl about two meters in width. Green turtles also leave a symmetrical crawl, but it is narrower (1.0-1.2 m wide) and the nest site is often characterized by a deep, solitary pit a meter or so in depth and breadth. Hawksbills and loggerheads leave an asymmetrical crawl, the hawksbill about 0.7 m in width and the loggerhead about 1.2 m in width. The hawksbill crawl is often very faint, however, since the animal averages a mere 54 kg (Caribbean Nicaragua: Nietschmann, 1972  in  Witzell, 1983). Loggerheads are typically twice as massive, averaging about 116 kg in Florida (Ehrhart and Yoder, 1978  in  Dodd, 1988). In addition, hawksbills will often make their nests deep within the shelter of  Coccoloba  or other beach vegetation.    Having identified the most important breeding beaches, it would be very useful to implement a nocturnal project on a selected beach (or beaches) whereby biologists or other trained persons patrolled the area at night to tag nesters, observe the ratio of successful nests, count the number of eggs laid, etc.                                             4.292 Hatchlings                                              Any successful management program must be based upon credible estimates of reproductive success. Thus, while nest counts are vital, as described above, follow-up at the hatchling stage is also important. Estimates of mortality, including losses due to erosion, domestic or feral animals (dogs, pigs), natural predators (crabs, mongooses, birds), and poachers should be obtained. Other threats should also be watched for and reported. These might include entrapment in beach debris, entanglement in beach vines, disorientation by artificial lighting, and harassment by onlookers. Some information can be collected on an opportunistic basis; that is, cases of disorientation, depredation, or the spilling of eggs from a bluff created during a storm. However, it is useful if some nests are marked for more systematic study at hatching. It is not recommended that the nest site  per se  be marked, but rather the distance from the nest site to two proximal objects, such as trees or other landmarks, should be recorded so that the site can be found at hatching two months later by triangulation.     Hatchling emergence at the beach surface usually occurs at dusk, and thus, if the timing is accurately predicted, it can be witnessed with relative ease. Predators, disorientation, and/or entanglement at the time of emergence should be noted. If the emergence was missed, it is easy enough to know when the majority of little turtles have escaped to the sea when dozens of tracks are observed at the site. The nest can be excavated at this time and the number of hatchlings can be roughly estimated from the remains of broken egg shells. In addition, unhatched eggs can be opened to determine the proportion of eggs which did not produce hatchlings. If a particular problem recurs, such as nest flooding and the subsequent drowning of embryos, then a conservation program to move eggs either at oviposition or early the next morning to higher ground should be considered. An in-depth analysis of hatch success should be undertaken on an index beach as soon as resources permit.                                            4.293 Immature and adult turtles                                              The monitoring of juvenile and adult turtles at sea requires special preparation and is more difficult than counting nests or evaluating hatchling mortality. In order to monitor foraging populations, systematic surveys to specific foraging grounds must be undertaken. If such survey work is undertaken in conjunction with a tagging program it is possible to evaluate not only foraging behavior, but also the movements of individuals since a tagged turtle may turn up at some point distant from where it was tagged. It is not necessary, however, to tag individuals and valuable information can be garnered by repeated observation of foraging areas and reporting the number of turtles seen. The support of professional divers and other relevant personnel should be solicited for at-sea surveys.    Table of Contents           4.3 Encourage and Support International Cooperation             4.31 CITES      The 1973 Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) is among the most powerful wildlife treaties in the world. With 120 member nations worldwide, the most recent being Korea, it has been very effective at reducing international commerce in endangered and depleted species, including their parts and products. Appendix I lists endangered species (including all species of sea turtle), trade in which is tightly controlled; Appendix II lists species that may become endangered unless trade is regulated; Appendix III lists species that any Party wishes to regulate and requires international cooperation to control trade; Appendix IV contains model permits. Permits are required for species listed in appendices I and II stating that export/import will not be detrimental to the survival of the species. The Netherlands ratified the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Flora and Fauna (CITES) on 18 July 1984, but Aruba is not yet a signatory.    In the interim before CITES is formally signed by Aruba, parts of the provisions of the treaty are executed by the Import and Export of Animals and Plants Decree (Landsbesluit in- en Uitvoerverbod Bedreigde Dieren en Planten, AB 1991, No. 102). As this Recovery Action Plan goes to press, legislation to fully implement CITES has been submitted to the National Advisory Council, the final administrative step before approval. Aruba (represented by Alexander Koolman, Customs Officer; Sylvester Vrolijk, LVV; and Theo Wools, Veterinary Service) attended the Caribbean CITES Implementation Training Seminar held in Trinidad, 14-18 September 1992. This comprehensive seminar, hosted by the Government of Trinidad and Tobago and the CITES Secretariat, was convened to familiarize Eastern Caribbean governments, especially non-CITES parties, with the Convention. It is a  recommendation of this Recovery Action Plan  that Customs officials and other relevant parties be fully supported at all levels of Government in their important and difficult task of implementing the provisions of the CITES treaty.           4.32 Regional treaties      UNEP's Convention for the Protection and Development of the Marine Environment of the Wider Caribbean Region (Cartagena Convention) is the best treaty currently in place for the protection of sea turtles on a regional scale. The Convention is coupled with an Action Plan, known as the Action Plan for the Caribbean Environment Programme (APCEP). The First Intergovernmental Meeting on APCEP was convened by UNEP in cooperation with the Economic Commission for Latin America (ECLA) in Montego Bay, Jamaica, 6-8 April 1981. The representatives of Governments from 22 States in the region, including the Netherlands, adopted APCEP at this meeting and established the Caribbean Trust Fund to support common costs and activities associated with the implementation of the Action Plan.    In March, 1983, a Conference of Plenipotentiaries met in Cartagena, Colombia to negotiate the Convention. Representatives from 16 States participated, including the Netherlands. The Conference adopted both the Convention and a Protocol concerning cooperation in combating oil spills in the region. The Convention describes the responsibilities of Contracting Parties to ""prevent, reduce and control"" pollution from a variety of sources (i.e., pollution from ships, from at-sea dumping of waste, from land-based sources, from sea-bed activities, and from airborne sources). Article 10 is of special interest, urging Contracting Parties to ""individually or jointly, take all appropriate measures to protect and preserve rare or fragile ecosystems, as well as the habitat of depleted, threatened or endangered species, in the Convention area."" The Netherlands ratified the Convention on 16 April 1984.    In January 1990, a Protocol Concerning Specially Protected Areas and Wildlife (SPAW) to the Cartagena Convention was adopted by a Conference of Plenipotentiaries, providing a mechanism whereby species of wild fauna and flora could be protected on a regional scale. The landmark Protocol grants explicit protection to species listed in three categories, or annexes. Annex I includes species of flora exempt from all forms of destruction or disturbance. Annex II ensures total protection and recovery to listed species of fauna, with minor exceptions. Specifically, Annex II listing prohibits (a) the taking, possession or killing (including, to the extent possible, the incidental taking, possession or killing) or commercial trade in such species, their eggs, parts or products, and (b) to the extent possible, the disturbance of such species, particularly during breeding, incubation, estivation, migration, and other periods of biological stress. Annex III denotes species in need of ""protection and recovery"", but subject to regulated harvest.    On 11 June 1991, Plenipotentiaries again met in Kingston, Jamaica, to formally adopt the Annexes. The Conference voted unanimously to include all six species of sea turtle inhabiting the Wider Caribbean (i.e.,  Caretta   caretta ,  Chelonia   mydas ,  Eretmochelys   imbricata ,  Dermochelys   coriacea ,  Lepidochelys   kempi , and L.  olivacea ) in Annex II (UNEP, 1991; Eckert, 1991). The unanimous vote on this issue is a clear statement on the part of Caribbean governments that the protection of regionally depleted species, including sea turtles, is a priority. It is a strong  recommendation of this Recovery Action Plan  that the Kingdom of the Netherlands, for Aruba and the Netherlands Antilles, ratify the SPAW Protocol and its annexes, and that the Government of Aruba adopt enabling legislation to implement the provisions of the treaty at the earliest possible opportunity.    Another international treaty important to the survival of sea turtles in regional waters is MARPOL 1973 (with Protocol 1978). This Convention has five Annexes that give detailed technical specifications regarding the way in which a ship must be built and equipped to prevent major pollution of the marine environment in case of accidents, and also norms and technical requirements to minimize operational discharges. The five Annexes are for oil, chemicals in bulk, packaged chemicals, liquid sewage, and garbage. Regarding Annex 5 (garbage), it has been proposed to the International Maritime Organization (IMO) by the nations of the Caribbean that the Caribbean Region be declared a ""Special Area"". This proposal has been accepted, but will only come into force when the nations have put in place the facilities to receive garbage on shore. The 1993 Prevention of Pollution by Ships Ordinance (Landsverordening ter Voorkoming Verontreiniging Door Schepen, AB 1993) implements MARPOL, but an effective date cannot be established until shore-based reception facilities are put in place.            4.33 Subregional sea turtle management      Sea turtle stocks in Bonaire and Curaao (Netherlands Antilles), as well as in Venezuela and Colombia, are surely shared with those in Aruba. Compatible legal protection should be encouraged in order to prevent illegal trade between nations and burdensome enforcement problems which arise when proximal nations disagree on how best to manage migrating species. In addition, it does not make good long-term management sense to protect sea turtles in the waters of one nation if they continue to be exploited in the waters or on the beaches of another nation. Conformity with regard to the protection of sea turtles will eventually be achieved with the ratification by nations throughout the region of the SPAW Protocol (section 4.32). Joint marine sanctuaries might be proposed to safeguard not only shared turtle resources, but also common marine resources in general. It is a  recommendation of this Recovery Action Plan  that full advantage be taken of the existing quad-lateral committee (""Consultative Mechanism: Working Group on the Environment"") currently working on mechanisms for cooperation between the Kingdom of the Netherlands, the Netherlands Antilles, Aruba and Venezuela in implementing CITES and other regional marine environmental legislation.     Table of Contents           4.4 Develop Public Education             4.41 Residents      It is a  recommendation of this Recovery Action Plan  that concerted efforts be made on the part of both government agencies (such as LVV) and established conservation groups (such as FANAPA and StimAruba) to provide schools and other audiences with conservation material. This would certainly include information on locally important or depleted species such as sea turtles. Some noteworthy individuals, such as Olinda van der Linden-Rasmijn, have made a personal commitment to responding to requests by schools for presentations about the conservation of sea turtles. It is clear that citizen knowledge of sea turtles is very slight, but with our involvement in the WIDECAST project we have access to slides, posters, and other materials which have made the task easier. We believe that the school program is especially important as this may be the most direct way to reach parents.     ""Bumper stickers"" are popular and may be particularly appropriate for messages pertaining to not driving on Aruba's beaches (see section 4.134). StimAruba and Accion Ambiental have newsletters, and these should carry sea turtle articles. A public library exhibition (Oranjestad, San Nicolas) is planned and will make use of photos, confiscated turtle shells (see section 3.3), and other material. Regular radio coverage of pertinent issues should be encouraged. The support of the office of the Prime Minister in sending letters to island establishments informing them that sea turtles are protected by law (see section 3.3) is deeply appreciated.           4.42 Fishermen      The best way to communicate with fishermen is through the Fisheries Officer, although indirect methods, such as educating school children, will surely have an effect as well. Education of fishermen should focus on ways to prevent the incidental catch of turtles in  redas  (seines drawn in shallow waters) and other commonly used gear. Information regarding the safe release of turtles from nets and proper resuscitation techniques would be useful. Fishermen should be encouraged to report incidents of sea turtle injury, stranding, or nesting.           4.43 Tourists      The sale of turtle shell and tortoiseshell items is aimed at tourists. In addition, the negative effects of activities generally associated with high density tourism (irresponsible/inexperienced divers, indiscriminate anchoring, beach and nearshore litter, joy-riding on the beaches, noise and lights on nesting beaches, etc.) may be lessened if tourists were more aware of the implications of their actions. Therefore, we plan to solicit the support of beachfront hotels in establishing information displays in the hotels, as well as designing an ""Endangered Sea Turtles of Aruba"" exhibit at the airport. Brochures and posters available at dive shops and other relevant locales would also be useful.           4.44 Non-consumptive activities that generate revenue      Tourism is appreciated and understood as a primary source of revenue. SCUBA dive clubs could perhaps be rewarded with free promotional help if they feature non-consumptive experiences with sea turtles, such as photography. It should be stressed whenever possible that the value of accessible, visible sea turtles on natural coral reefs is a good investment! Hotels might also consider providing room and board, or other support, to a local biologist in return for leading natural history expeditions to the beach at night to witness sea turtle nesting. While this type of nature-tourism has been very successful in other Caribbean islands, such as Antigua, it cannot be over-emphasized that the project must be supervised by trained personnel and the welfare of the turtles must be considered paramount. Sea turtles are easily frightened and insensitive activity will further erode already depleted populations.    Table of Contents           4.5 Increase Information Exchange             4.51 Marine Turtle Newsletter      The Marine Turtle Newsletter (MTN) is currently received by Tom Barmes, LVV, VROM, Colegio Arubano (high school), Biblioteca Nacional (national library), and interested residents. All interested persons are encouraged to subscribe by writing to the Editors (Karen and Scott Eckert), Hubbs-Sea World Research Institute, 1700 South Shores Road, San Diego, California 92109 USA. The MTN is published quarterly, distributed free of charge in English and Spanish to readers in more than 100 countries around the world, and is one of the best ways to keep informed about sea turtle conservation and research. In addition to features, each issue includes a list of recently published scientific articles and reports.           4.52 Western Atlantic Turtle Symposium (WATS)      Aruba was represented by the Netherlands Antilles National Representative at WATS I (Costa Rica, 1983), but not at WATS II (Puerto Rico, 1987). In 1983, the National Report for the Netherlands Antilles included the island of Aruba, and was prepared by Gerald van Buurt, Department of Agriculture and Fisheries (LVV) in Curaao. In 1987, the Netherlands Antilles National Report was prepared by Jeffrey Sybesma, Caribbean Marine Biological Institute (CARMABI) in Curaao. Because of changes in Aruba's status, pending independence from the Kingdom of the Netherlands, Aruba was not included in Sybesma's 1987 report. Aruba is encouraged to remain informed about this important regional data base and to have representation at upcoming Symposia.           4.53 WIDECAST      The Wider Caribbean Sea Turtle Recovery Team and Conservation Network, known by the acronym ""WIDECAST"", consists of a regional team of sea turtle experts that works closely with in-country Coordinators, who in turn enlist the support and participation of citizens in and out of government who have an interest in sea turtle conservation. The primary project outputs are Sea Turtle Recovery Action Plans (STRAPs) for each of 39 government regions, including Aruba, in the Wider Caribbean. Each STRAP is tailored specifically to local circumstances and provides the following information:              The local status and distribution of nesting and feeding sea turtles.       The major causes of mortality to sea turtles.       The effectiveness of existing national and international laws protecting sea turtles.       The present and historical role of sea turtles in the local culture and economy.       Local, national, and multi-lateral implementing measures for scientifically sound sea     turtle conservation.          The short-term objectives of WIDECAST are to provide Wider Caribbean governments with updated information on the status of sea turtles in the region, to provide specific recommendations for the management and recovery of endangered, threatened, and vulnerable sea turtle stocks, and to assist Wider Caribbean governments in the discharge of their obligations under the Protocol Concerning Specially Protected Areas and Wildlife (SPAW) in the Wider Caribbean Region (see section 4.32). The longer-term objectives are to promote a regional capability to implement scientifically sound sea turtle conservation programs. Specifically, to develop and support a technical understanding of sea turtle biology and management among local individuals and organizations by:              Implementing WIDECAST through resident Country Coordinators.       Utilizing local network participants to collect information and draft, with the     assistance of regional sea turtle experts, locally appropriate sea turtle management     recommendations.       Providing or assisting in the development of education materials (slides, brochures,     posters, pamphlets).       Sponsoring or supporting local or subregional workshops on sea turtle biology and     management.       Assisting governments and non-government organizations with the implementation of     effective management and conservation programmes for sea turtles.          Beyond supporting the local and national efforts of governments and non-governmental organizations, WIDECAST works to integrate these efforts into a collective regional response to a common problem, the disappearance of sea turtles. WIDECAST is supported by the Caribbean Trust Fund of the UNEP Caribbean Environment Programme, as well as by government (e.g., U. S. National Marine Fisheries Service) and non-government (e.g., The  Chelonia  Institute) agencies and groups. Government and non-government entities, biologists, fishermen, educators, developers, and other interested persons are encouraged to join in WIDECAST's efforts. The WIDECAST Country Coordinator in Aruba is Tom Barmes, Assistant Director, LVV, Piedra Plat 114-A, Aruba.           4.54 IUCN/SSC Marine Turtle Specialist Group      The Marine Turtle Specialist Group (Dr. Karen A. Bjorndal, Chair) is responsible for tracking the status of sea turtle populations around the world for the World Resources Union (IUCN) Species Survival Commission (SSC). The Group is a valuable source of information about sea turtles and technical advice on conservation projects. For further information, contact Dr. Karen Bjorndal, Archie Carr Center for Sea Turtle Research, Department of Zoology, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida 32611 USA.           4.55 Workshops on research and management      Prior to the implementation of field surveys or other sea turtle conservation projects, participants should be educated concerning basic sea turtle ecology. This training would logically include the identification of sea turtle species, whether the evidence available was a live turtle, a hatchling, an egg, or a crawl on the beach. Additional detail, provided as needed, could include proper methods to conduct surveys of nesting beaches (section 4.291), transect surveys of foraging areas (section 4.293), the movement of eggs, aerial surveys, etc. Informal local workshops can be arranged upon request by WIDECAST. More formal training has in the past been available from the Caribbean Conservation Corporation (P. O. Box 2866, Gainesville, Florida 32602) at their Sea Turtle Short Course in Tortuguero, Costa Rica. The WATS Manual of Sea Turtle Research and Conservation Techniques (Pritchard et al., 1983) provides instruction and background for many sea turtle research and management techniques. Program managers are encouraged to follow it to the fullest extent when research and conservation projects are designed and implemented.           4.56 Exchange of information among local groups      It is very desirable to have local groups coordinating efforts toward sea turtle research and conservation, in order that personnel and other resources are most efficiently used and data are compatible. StimAruba has been the most involved in issues of sea turtle conservation (monitoring beaches, sponsoring public lectures) to date, but the island's other two conservation groups (FANAPA, Accion Ambiental) have indicated a strong interest in becoming more deeply involved in 1994 and beyond. It is very encouraging to see this enthusiastic response -- there is no question but that there is much to be done! In addition to ongoing efforts (coordinated by Tom Barmes) to monitor nesting beaches, the efforts of conservation groups to promote public awareness and to report violations are sorely needed.    Table of Contents           4.6 Implement a National Sea Turtle Conservation Project             4.61 Rationale      It is clear from the information provided in this Recovery Action Plan that Aruba provides foraging habitat to at least two species of sea turtle (green,  tortuga blanco  and hawksbill,  caret ) and hosts a small number of nesting females each year, perhaps fewer than ten (mostly the leatherback,  driekiel  and loggerhead,  cawama ). Sea turtles and their eggs are fully protected in Aruba by Landsverordening, Marien Milieuverordening Aruba (Marine Environment Ordinance) (AB 1980, No. 18) and penalties for convicted violators include both fines and jail sentences. Nevertheless, enforcement is problematic and an unquantified (but probably low) level of harvest continues on the part of local fishermen and meat and shells are also imported from Venezuela in contravention of both national and international laws. The sale of meat in restaurants and trinkets in tourist-oriented boutiques continues at a persistent but, again, probably relatively low level.    The clandestine harvest and marketing of sea turtles, while not as dramatic in volume as it is in some other countries in the region, is a source of grave concern in Aruba because we have only a handful of turtles remaining in the wild. The take of a single gravid female, for instance, may represent 50% or more of the total nesting population in some years. And our reputation as a favorable tourist destination is certainly tarnished by the blatant sale of species which are recognized around the world to be threatened with extinction. Finally, we have reason to be quite concerned about the integrity of habitats important to the survival of our sea turtles. Most potentially important nesting beaches are heavily developed in high rise hotels, and the tourist industry brings other threats, including beachfront lighting, vehicles joy-riding on the beaches, litter, and increased pressure on reefs by divers.    There is ample rationale for a national commitment to sea turtle conservation, and with the support of WIDECAST and the excellent framework provided by this Recovery Action Plan we are for the first time in a position to move forward with this important agenda.           4.62 Goals and objectives      Restoring living and nesting habitat will only be possible where no permanent changes have been made. The west coast from Bushiri Beach Hotel to Cudarebe (West Point) is the most attractive beach because of its sand structure and the rather calm sea. Its once pristine state, however, has been lost forever to the coastal boulevard and several high-rise hotels. This is not possible to undo, and thus it is necessary to instruct hotel personnel on how to handle the situation when gravid turtles come ashore to lay their eggs and hatchlings subsequently emerge from the sand. We have already solicited the support of hotel staff in collecting and releasing to the sea hatchlings which travel inland after becoming disoriented by beachfront lighting. In light of the particular situation in Aruba, our primary goals will be to (i) safeguard all nests laid and (ii) bring to a halt  all  harvest and commerce in sea turtles and their products, as mandated by national law. In order to accomplish these goals, we are committed to the following objectives:              Monitor nesting beaches and maximize hatchling production.       Enhance public awareness of and participation in sea turtle conservation.       Promote improvements in legislation and law enforcement.                    4.63 Activities      In order to meet the above objectives, the WIDECAST Coordinator in Aruba proposes to undertake the following activities. LVV will be the Lead Organization for the National Sea Turtle Conservation Project, with active support from other government agencies (e.g., VROM, Police), local conservation and interest groups (e.g., StimAruba, FANAPA, dive operators, hoteliers), and international organizations (e.g., WIDECAST).              Assemble and maintain sightings and nesting data bases. Design and distribute standard     record sheets.       Monitor potential nesting beaches on a daily basis throughout the annual nesting season     (April-August, and through November if confirmation of hawksbill nesting is obtained).       Determine primary threats on the nesting beaches and design (and implement) specific     mitigating measures. For instance, work collaboratively with beachfront hoteliers to     modify lighting and clear the beaches of recreational equipment (e.g., beach chairs,     sailboats) at night.       Maintain a small hatchery facility as a last resort if necessary to safeguard eggs laid     in high risk (heavy traffic) zones. Gain hotel sponsorship for this.       Instruct hotel personnel on how to monitor their beaches for sea turtle hatching     activity and how to ""rescue"" hatchlings misoriented inland by hotel lights.       Encourage people to report offenses against sea turtle conservation legislation, and     encourage prosecution of convicted offenders.       Make personal contact with owners of boutiques selling tortoiseshell and restaurants     selling meat, alerting them to the consequences of such commerce.       Design and distribute public awareness materials, including but not limited to     brochures, posters, bumper stickers, and informative displays in restaurants, hotel     lobbies, boutiques, and libraries.       Offer training opportunities, such as workshops, to habitat survey participants and     persons volunteering to provide presentations to schools. Request training materials     and/or instructors as needed from WIDECAST.       Lobby for habitat protection, including Marine Park status for the south coast and Sea     Turtle Refuge designation for west coast beaches.       Involve the media more consistently in coverage of sea turtle conservation issues.                    4.64 Budget      We are a small island with relatively few sea turtles, perhaps fewer than 30 nests laid per year. We do not anticipate that large-scale fund-raising will be necessary to implement a national conservation program. We feel that quite possibly the private sector in Aruba will agree to covering costs incurred by activities outlined in section 4.63. Hotels have already shown admirable interest in protecting sea turtles on their beaches, it is simply a question of organizing and focusing this interest. We will emphasize that protecting nests is not only good ecology, but can potentially serve as a tourist attraction if carefully and thoughtfully executed. With regard to educational materials, WIDECAST has provided us with slides, leaflets, and brochures and will soon have posters available. In addition, a variety of educational materials can be sponsored locally, such as bumper stickers by car rental agencies. Restaurants are likely to be amenable to exhibit plaques or stickers that explain to patrons that sea turtle meat is not offered in deference to the endangered status of these animals. Further, a good deal of information can be disseminated by word of mouth, such as by dive operators and other tour personnel. With regard to monitoring beaches, local volunteers are available and willing to participate in this task. LVV staff will compile and archive relevant data.    Table of Contents              V.

Documented records of sea turtles nesting in Aruba, 1993.  (data courtesy LVV). Prior to 1993, no reliable field surveys had been undertaken, although some anecdotal data are available (see section 4.112 of this Recovery Action Plan). Four species may nest; they are the green turtle or  tortuga blanco  ( Chelonia   mydas ), hawksbill or  caret  ( Eretmochelys   imbricata ), loggerhead or  cawama  ( Caret ta   caret ta ), and leatherback or  driekiel  ( Dermochelys   coriacea ) (see Figure 2). Leatherback nesting is reported the most often, perhaps because the large tracks of this species are the easiest for laymen to identify and west coast beaches were the most thoroughly surveyed (hawksbill and green turtle nesting is likely to be more common along the east and southeast coasts).                   Date       Species       Beach       Comments               April 23       Leatherback       Druif Beach (south coast)       Confirmed crawl, but no hatchlings seen               May 4       Loggerhead       Pirate's Nest, Bucuti Beach Hotel (Manchebo       Beach)       Hatched 25 June, released 50 hatchlings, nest excavation     revealed 20 unhatched eggs               May 9       Green (?)

Wildlife Reserves in the Grenadines         PREFACE              Sea turtle stocks are declining throughout most of the Wider Caribbean region; in some areas the trends are dramatic and are likely to be irreversible during our lifetimes. According to the IUCN Conservation Monitoring Centre's  Red Data Book , persistent over-exploitation, especially of adult females on the nesting beach, and the widespread collection of eggs are largely responsible for the Endangered status of five sea turtle species occurring in the region and the Vulnerable status of a sixth. In addition to direct harvest, sea turtles are accidentally captured in active or abandoned fishing gear, resulting in death to tens of thousands of turtles annually. Coral reef and sea grass degradation, oil spills, chemical waste, persistent plastic and other marine debris, high density coastal development, and an increase in ocean-based tourism have damaged or eliminated nesting beaches and feeding grounds. Population declines are complicated by the fact that causal factors are not always entirely indigenous. Because sea turtles are among the most migratory of all Caribbean fauna, what appears as a decline in a local population may be a direct consequence of the activities of peoples many hundreds of kilometers distant. Thus, while local conservation is crucial, action is also called for at the regional level.            In order to adequately protect migratory sea turtles and achieve the objectives of CEP's Regional Programme for Specially Protected Areas and Wildlife (SPAW),  The Strategy for the Development of the Caribbean Environment Programme (1990-1995)  calls for ""the development of specific management plans for economically and ecologically important species"", making particular reference to endangered, threatened, or vulnerable species of sea turtle. This is consistent with Article 10 of the Cartagena Convention (1983), which states that Contracting Parties shall ""individually or jointly take all appropriate measures to protect ... the habitat of depleted, threatened or endangered species in the Convention area."" Article 10 of the 1991 Protocol to the Cartagena Convention concerning Specially Protected Areas and Wildlife (SPAW Protocol) specifies that Parties ""carry out recovery, management, planning and other measures to effect the survival of [endangered or threatened] species"" and regulate or prohibit activities having ""adverse effects on such species or their habitats"". Article 11 of the SPAW Protocol declares that each Party ""shall ensure total protection and recovery to the species of fauna listed in Annex II"". All six species of Caribbean-occurring sea turtles were included in Annex II in 1991.            This CEP Technical Report is the fourth in a series of Sea Turtle Recovery Action Plans prepared by the Wider Caribbean Sea Turtle Recovery Team and Conservation Network (WIDECAST), an organization comprised of a regional team of sea turtle experts, local Country Co-ordinators, and an extensive network of interested citizens. The objective of the recovery action plan series is to assist Caribbean governments in the discharge of their obligations under the SPAW Protocol, and to promote a regional capability to implement scientifically sound sea turtle conservation programs by developing a technical understanding of sea turtle biology and management among local individuals and institutions. Each recovery action plan summarizes the known distribution of sea turtles, discusses major causes of mortality, evaluates the effectiveness of existing conservation laws, and prioritizes implementing measures for stock recovery. WIDECAST was founded in 1981 by Monitor International, in response to a recommendation by the IUCN/CCA Meeting of Non-Governmental Caribbean Organizations on Living Resources Conservation for Sustainable Development in the Wider Caribbean (Santo Domingo, 26-29 August 1981) that a ""Wider Caribbean Sea Turtle Recovery Action Plan should be prepared ... consistent with the Action Plan for the Caribbean Environment Programme."" WIDECAST is an autonomous NGO, partially supported by the Caribbean Environment Programme.    Table of Contents           ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS              Without the invaluable assistance of many people, this Sea Turtle Recovery Action Plan would not have developed to this final point. We would like to thank the staff of the Fisheries Division, especially Mr. Winston Mulraine (Fisheries Extension Officer), Miss Rowena Kirby (Assistant Fisheries Officer), and Mr. Raymond Ryan (Fisheries Officer). We are grateful to Mr. Jacques Daudin (Union Island), Mr. Louis Errol Ollivierre, Jr. (Bequia), Mr. Yuri Chakalall (MAREMP, UWI postgraduate student), Mr. John Renton (Marriaqua Secondary School), Mr. Kevin Urban (Peace Corps volunteer), Mr. Bentley Browne (Senior Planner, Planning Division), Dr. Len Ishmael (MAREMP, UWI), and numerous fishermen and other residents in St. Vincent and the Grenadines for providing data and other information, as well as making critical comments on earlier drafts. The support and hospitality of the following persons was greatly appreciated: Dr. Robin Mahon and Dr. Susan Singh-Renton (CFRAMP) and Mr. Martin Jennett (Union Island), as was the secretarial assistance of Miss Kay Ferguson. Finally, we would like to thank the WIDECAST regional Sea Turtle Recovery Team /, especially Dr. Karen Eckert, for their ongoing friendship and assistance, and for giving this Recovery Action Plan the benefit of their extensive knowledge of sea turtle biology and conservation. The Recovery Action Plan is dedicated to the next generation of Vincentians.    Table of Contents           ABSTRACT              The multi-island state of St. Vincent and the Grenadines lies between 6105' and 6130' W latitude, and 1230' and 1325'N longitude. Four species of sea turtles, all internationally classified as endangered or vulnerable species, nest on the beaches of St. Vincent and the Grenadines. The most common is the hawksbill ( Eretmochelys   imbricata ), with smaller numbers of green turtles ( Chelonia   mydas ) and leatherbacks ( Dermochelys   coriacea ) and, much less frequently, loggerheads ( Caretta   caretta ). In addition, juvenile and sub-adult green turtles, hawks-bills and occasionally loggerhead turtles can be seen around the islands throughout the year (non-nesting adults are rare). Green turtles are generally more abundant around the Grenadines than around St. Vincent, whilst hawksbills are more common around St. Vincent. This may be because there is more preferred green turtle habitat (i.e., sea grass and algal beds) around the Grenadine islands than around St. Vincent. The leatherback is not a resident species; sightings are restricted to adult females during the nesting season (April-July).            The islands have a history of sea turtle exploitation dating back to the pre-Columbus era. However, it was not until the early colonial period that large numbers of green and hawksbill turtles were harvested, primarily for export of meat and shell to Europe. As the population of St. Vincent and the Grenadines grew following colonisation, sea turtle meat increased in importance as a local source of protein. Today, no fishermen rely solely on sea turtles for income, but there is no denying that there is an active market for any meat (or eggs) that comes available. Until recently, this was also true for sea turtle shell. The consequence of hundreds of years of exploitation is a widely acknowledged decline in the abundance of sea turtles. The decline has implications not only for the livelihoods of fishermen, but also for the developing tourist industry. Tourism in the Grenadines, in particular, is dependent on clean seas and abundant marine life. Sea turtles are an important component of the marine environment, and their rarity is already being noticed by those involved in promoting water-sports tourism. Sea turtles are the central attractions of eco-tourism initiatives elsewhere in the Caribbean. The potential for similar programmes in St. Vincent and the Grenadines can only be realised if populations are protected and allowed to recover.            At present, all species of sea turtle are harvested (in and out of season) either on the beach or in the water, using turtle nets (4-inch mesh gill nets) or spearguns (many of which are unlicensed). Apart from the catch by resident islanders in the Grenadines, many turtles are also taken by fishermen (primarily from Bequia) during ""island-hopping"" fishing trips which target lobster and conch. Many of the green turtles caught around the Grenadines are either sold locally, or transported to restaurants and hotels on neighbouring islands (often in contravention of CITES). Hawksbill and green turtle shells are often sold to passing yachts. Although no official records are kept, St. Vincent export statistics indicate that shell from over 1,000 adult hawksbills was sent to Japan between 1983-1990. The Japanese market for the shell and the relative ease with which hawksbills can be caught relative to other turtles are major factors contributing to the scarcity of this species nesting on the islands today compared to several decades ago. Since Japan declared a zero quota on the import of hawksbill shell in December 1992, the legal export market has effectively disappeared (although inter-island black markets remain).            For sea turtle abundance to return around St. Vincent and the Grenadines, two approaches must be taken. First, sea turtles must be given greater protection. Current legislation is not adequate to permit their recovery. For instance, although there is a closed season between 1 March and 31 July, this does not encompass the peak breeding season for the hawksbill. Until a total moratorium on sea turtle harvest can be put in place, it is a strong recommendation of this Action Plan that Fisheries legislation be amended to give full protection to all species whilst nesting (this will necessitate extending the closed season to 1 April-30 November to protect mating pairs and females approaching and leaving nesting beaches), total protection for hawks-bills, and maximum (as opposed to minimum) size limits during the open season. The existing full protection for eggs in the 1987 Fisheries Regulations should be retained. Secondly, important nesting and feeding habitat must be identified and adequately protected. Data on numbers of sea turtles nesting in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, as well as the distribution and abundance of foraging turtles, are virtually nonexistent. Information collected in this regard will allow selection of Index Beaches and foraging areas where long-term monitoring programmes can be initiated to quantify numbers of turtles, nests, and nest success. In those cases where critical habitats already fall within marine conservation areas or wildlife reserves, more resources are needed to ensure that regulations governing activities within these areas are enforced.            Tourism has not yet developed to the extent that it has in many other Caribbean countries, and thus many of the adverse environmental effects of tourism have not yet been felt. There is ample opportunity to take natural resources, such as sea turtles and their habitats, into account when designing new developments. By conserving its resource base, St. Vincent and the Grenadines will be in a better position to sustain its development. This Action Plan suggests regulatory guidelines that will enable development of the coastal zone to proceed without impacting negatively on sea turtles. Healthy coral reefs and sea grass beds not only benefit sea turtles, but also enhance important near shore fisheries as well as the growing tourist industry. The Government's foresight in this regard is indicated by legislation enabling critical habitats to be fully protected within marine conservation areas, wildlife reserves, forest reserves and, following passage of the National Parks Act, within national parks also. However, the effectiveness of the concept depends on the Government assigning the resources necessary for proper management (including enforcing regulations), and by refusing to allow development with adverse environmental implications to occur in these protected areas. We propose that independent Environmental Impact Assessments become an obligatory component of the development process to enable the government and non-government communities to review the advantages (often short-term) and disadvantages (often long-term) of developments before permission is given to proceed.            A national Sea Turtle Conservation Programme is proposed to enhance public awareness of and participation in sea turtle conservation, monitor the abundance and distribution of sea turtle populations, and promote sustainable, non-consumptive exploitation of the sea turtle re-source.    Table of Contents           RESUMEN              El estado multi insular de San Vicente y las Granadinas se encuentra localizado entre los 6105' y los 6130'de latitud oeste, y los 1230'y los 1325'de longitud norte. En las playas de San Vicente y las Granadinas anidan cuatro especies de tortugas marinas, clasificadas todas internacionalmente como especies vulnerables o en peligro. La ms comn es la Carey ( Eretmochelys   imbricata ), con nmeros menores de tortugas Verdes del Atlntico ( Chelonia   mydas ) y tortugas Lad o Tora ( Dermochelys   coriacea ) y, con mucha menor frecuencia, tortugas Caguama o Cabezona ( Caretta   caretta ). Adems las juveniles y subadultas de las tortugas Verdes del Atlntico, las Carey y ocasionalmente las Caguama pueden verse alrededor de las islas a todo lo largo del ao (son raras las adultas que no anidan). Las tortugas Verdes son generalmente ms abundantes alrededor de las Granadinas que alrededor de San Vicente, mientras que las Carey son ms abundantes alrededor de San Vicente. Esto pudiera atribuirse al hecho de que existen ms habitats preferidos por la tortuga Verde (es decir, praderas de pastos marinos y de algas) alrededor de las islas Granadinas que alrededor de San Vicente. La Lad no es una especie residente; las que se han visto se limitan a hembras adultas durante la temporada de anidacin (abril-julio).            Las islas tienen una historia de explotacin de la tortuga marina que se remonta a la era precolombina. Sin embargo, no fue sino hasta la primera poca de la colonia que se recolectaron un gran nmero de tortugas Verdes y Carey, principalmente para la exportacin a Europa de su carne y su caparazn. Al crecer la poblacin de San Vicente y las Granadinas con la colonizacin, la carne de tortuga creci en importancia como fuente local de protena. Hoy en da, ningn pescador depende solamente de las tortugas para obtener ingresos, pero no se puede negar que existe un mercado activo para cualquier carne (o huevos) que se encuentren disponibles. Hasta hace poco, lo mismo se poda decir de la caparazn de la tortuga. La consecuencia de cientos de aos de explotacin es un descenso ampliamente reconocido en la abundancia de la tortuga marina. Este descenso en el nmero de tortugas marinas acarrea implicaciones no solo para la subsistencia de los pescadores sino para la industria turstica en desarrollo. El turismo en las Granadinas, en particular, depende de las aguas limpias y la abundante vida marina. Las tortugas marinas constituyen un componente importante del medio marino, y su rareza ya se ha notado por aquellos involucrados en la promocin del turismo de deportes acuticos. Las tortugas marinas son la atraccin central de las iniciativas de ecoturismo en otros lugares del Caribe. El potencial para programas similares en San Vicente y las Granadinas solo podr hacerse realidad si se protegen las poblaciones y se les permite recuperarse.             En la actualidad todas las especies de tortugas marinas son aprovechadas (dentro y fuera de temporada) ya sea en la playa o en el agua, a menudo utilizando redes ilegales o harpones sin licencia. Fuera de la caza practicada por los residentes isleos en las Granadinas, muchas tortugas son cazadas por pescadores (principalmente de Bequia) durante viajes de pesca a travs de las islas, cuyo objetivo es la obtencin de langosta y caracol. Muchas de las tortugas Verde que se cazan en las proximidades de las Granadinas se venden localmente, o se transportan a restaurantes y hoteles en las islas vecinas (a menudo en contravencin al Convenio CITES). Los caparazones de las tortugas Carey y Verde del Atlntico se venden a menudo a los yates que pasan. Aunque no se conservan registros oficiales, las estadsticas de exportacin de San-Vicente indican que entre 1983 y 1990 se envi a Japn el caparazn de ms de 1,000 tortugas Carey ( should say ""1000 adult hawksbills"" ). El mercado japons para el caparazn y la relativa facilidad con que se pueden cazar las tortugas Carey con relacin a otras tortugas, son los factores principales que contribuyen hoy en da a la escasez de esta especie que anida en las islas si se compara con dcadas anteriores. Desde que Japn declar una cuota cero para la importacin de caparazn de tortuga Carey en diciembre de 1992, el mercado de exportacin legal ha desaparecido efectivamente (aunque permanence el mercado negro entre las islas).            Para que vuelva a haber abundancia de tortugas en San Vicente y las Granadinas, se deben tomar dos medidas. Primero, se le debe dar mayor proteccin a las tortugas. La legislacin actual no es la adecuada para permitir la recuperacin de las tortugas marinas. Por ejemplo, aunque existe veda del 1 de marzo al 31 de julio, esta no comprende la temporada de mayor reproduccin para la tortuga Carey. Hasta que pueda entrar en vigor una moratoria del aprovechamiento de la tortuga marina, una de las recomendaciones ms firmes de este Plan de Accin es que la Legislacin sobre Pesca se enmiende para dar proteccin plena a todas las especies mientras anidan (ser necesario que se extienda la veda del 1 de abril al 30 de noviembre), que las tortugas Carey gozen de proteccin plena, y que existan lmites mximos de tamao (en vez de mnimos) durante la temporada abierta. Debe conservarse la proteccin plena que existe para los huevos en el Reglamento de Pesca de 1987. En segundo lugar, deben identificarse y protegerse adecuadamente los principales habitats de alimentacin y anidacin. Son prcticamente inexistentes los datos sobre cantidades de tortugas marinas que anidan en San Vicente y las Granadinas, as como la distribucin y abundancia de las tortugas que se alimentan de forraje. La informacin recabada en este sentido permitir la seleccin de playas y reas de forraje donde pueden iniciarse programas de vigilancia a largo plazo con el fin de cuantificar los nmeros de tortugas, nidos y anidaciones exitosas. En aquellos casos en los que habitats crticos caen dentro de las reas de conservacin marina o de las reservas de vida silvestre, se necesitan ms recursos para asegurar que entren en vigor las regulaciones que rigen las actividades dentro de estas reas.             El turismo no se ha desarrollado todava al grado en que se halla en muchos otros pases del Caribe y, por lo tanto, muchos de los efectos ambientales adversos del turismo an no se han hecho sentir. Existe amplia oportunidad para tomar en cuenta los recursos naturales, tales como tortugas marinas y sus habitats, cuando se disean nuevos centros tursticos. Mediante la conservacin de sus recursos bsicos, San Vicente y las Granadinas se encontrar en una mejor posicin hacia el desarrollo sostenible. Este Plan de Accin sugiere directrices reguladoras que permitirn proceder con el desarrollo de la zona costera sin impactar negativamente sobre las tortugas marinas. Arrecifes coralinos y lechos de praderas marinas sanos no slo benefician a tortugas marinas, sino que tambin intensifican la pesca importante cercana a las costas, as como la creciente industria turstica. La visin del Gobierno en este sentido se indica por medio de la legislacin que permite la plena proteccin de los habitats crticos dentro de las reas de conservacin marinas, reservas de vida silvestre, reservas forestales, as como dentro de los parques nacionales despus de la aprobacin de la Ley sobre Parques Naturales. Sin embargo, la efectividad del concepto depende de que el Gobierno destine los recursos necesarios para la gestin apropiada (incluso el cumplimiento de las regulaciones), y que se niegue a permitir el desarrollo que acarree implicaciones ambientales adversas en estas reas protegidas. Proponemos que Evaluaciones de Impacto Ambiental de carcter independiente se conviertan en -un componente obligatorio de los procesos de desarrollo para que permitan a las comunidades gubernamentales y no gubernamentales revisar las ventajas (a menudo a corto plazo) y desventajas (a menudo a largo plazo) de los proyectos antes de que se les conceda permiso para proceder con su desarrollo.            Se propone un Programa Nacional para la Conservacin de la Tortuga Marina que inten-sifique la concientizacin pblica y su participacin del pblico en la conservacin de la tortuga marina, vigile la abundancia y distribucin de las poblaciones de tortugas marinas, y fomente la explotacin sostenible y no destructiva, ni de consumo de la tortuga marina como recurso.    Table of Contents         RESUME            L'Etat de Saint-Vincent et les Grenadines, qui se compose de plusieurs les, est situ entre les longitudes 6105 et 6130 ouest et les latitudes 1230 et 1325 nord. Quatre espces de tortues marines, toutes classes comme menaces ou vulnrables, font leur nid sur les plages de Saint-Vincent et des Grenadines. La plus commune est la tortue  caille ( Eretmochelys   imbricata ), et en nombre moindre des tortues verte ( Chelonia   mydas ), des tortues luth ( Dermochelys   coriacea ) et, beaucoup plus frquemment, la tortue caouanne ( Caretta   caretta ). De plus, les tortues vertes jeunes et jeunes adultes, les tortues  caille et, de temps en temps, les tortues caouannes sont observes autour des les toute l'anne. Il est rare de trouver des adultes qui ne nidifient pas. Les tortues vertes sont en gnral plus abondantes autour des Grenadines tandis que les tortues  caille se trouvent  Saint-Vincent. Ceci peut tre attribu au fait que la tortue verte a des demeures bien plus prfres (comme par example, les herbiers, les bancs d'algues) aux environs des les Grenadines plutt qu'aux environs de St. Vincent. La tortue luth n'est pas une espce rsidente; sa prsence se limite aux adultes femelles au cours de la saison de nidation allant d'avril  juillet.            Les les ont une histoire d'exploitation de la tortue de mer qui remonte  l'poque pr2Dcolombienne. Nanmoins, ce n'est qu'avant la priode coloniale que de grands nombres de tortues vertes et de tortues  caille ont t rcolts, surtout pour l'exportation de leur chair et de leur carapace en Europe. Au fur et  mesure que la population de Saint-Vincent et des Grenadines augmentait  la suite de la colonisation, la chair de la tortue de mer est devenue de plus en plus importante comme source de protine. Aujourd'hui, les pcheurs ne comptent pas uniquement sur le revenu dcoulant de la tortue marine, mais il n'y a aucun doute que le march pour tous les types de chair (ou d'oeufs) disponibles est toujours trs actif. Jusqu' trs rcemment, ceci tait galement vrai pour la carapace de la tortue marine. Les centaines d'annes d'exploitation ont eu comme rsultat la diminution du nombre de tortues marines ce qui a des implications non seulement pour les moyens d'existence des pcheurs, mais aussi pour le dveloppement du tourisme. Le tourisme, surtout aux Grenadines, dpend de mers propres et d'une vie marine abondante. Les tortues marines font partie intgrante du milieu marin et leur raret est dj tres sentie par ceux qui sont charges de la promotion du tourisme bas sur les sports marins. Les tortues de mer constituent l'attrait principal des initiatives d'cotourisme ailleurs dans les Carabes. Le potentiel des programmes similaires  Saint-Vincent et les Grenadines ne peut tre ralis que si les populations sont protges et leur quantit reconstitue.             Actuellement, toutes les espces de tortue sont rcoltes (que les saisons soient ouvertes et fermes) sur la plage ou mer  l'aide de filets ou de fusils sous-marins illgaux. En plus des captures effectues par les habitants des Grenadines, beaucoup de tortues sont prises galement par des pcheurs (le plus souvent de Bequia) au cours de leurs expditions de pche dans diffrentes les  la recherche de homards et de lambis. Beaucoup des tortues vertes captures dans les Grenadines sont vendues sur le march local ou  des restaurants ou htels dans les iles avoisinantes (souvent en contravention avec la CITES). La carapace de la tortue  caille et de la tortue verte est souvent vendue  des yatchs qui passent. Bien qu'il n'ait pas de chiffres officiels sur les prises, les statistiques relatives  l'exportation provenant de Saint-Vincent indiquent que les carapaces de 1 000 tortues  caille adultes ont t envoyes au Japon entre 1983 et 1990. Le march japonais et la facilit de la capture de la tortue  caille sont des facteurs importants qui contribuent  la rduction de cette espce en nidation dans les les aujourd'hui par rapport  des dcennies auparavant. Le march lgal pour ce produit a effectivement disparu (bien que le march noir entre les les persiste), depuis que le Japon a interdit l'importation en dcembre 1992 de la carapace de la tortue  caille.            Pour rtablir l'abondance des populations de tortue marine autour de Saint-Vincent et les Grenadines, deux approches sont  adopter. Premirement, il faut leur accorder une plus grande protection car la lgislation actuelle n'est pas adquate pour assurer cette protection. Par exemple, bien qu'il existe une saison de fermeture allant du 1er mars au 31 juillet, celle-ci ne comprend pas la haute saison de nidation pour la tortue  caille. Jusqu' la mise en place d'un moratoire sur la capture de la tortue  caille, il est vivement recommand dans le prsent plan d'action que la lgislation relative  la pche soit modifie afin d'accorder une protection totale  toutes les espces pendant leur nidation (ce qui impliquera la prolongation de la saison de fermeture jusqu'au 30 novembre). Le plan d'action recommande galement une protection totale pour la tortue  caille et des limites de taille maximales (plutt que des limites minimales) pour les tortues captures. La protection totale existante pour les oeufs dans le Rglement de 1987 sur la pche devraient tre retenues. Deuximement, des habitats importants de nidation et d'alimentation doivent tre identifis et protgs de faon efficace. Il y a trs peu de donnes sur le nombre de tortues marines qui font leur nid  Saint-Vincent et les Grenadines ainsi que sur la rpartition et l'abondance des tortues qui s'y alimentent. Les informations ainsi recueillies faciliteront la selection de plages ""tmoins"" appropries et de zones d'alimentation o des programmes de surveillance  long terme pourront tre mises en place afin d'tablir le nombre de tortues de nids et de jeunes tortues nes. Dans les cas o les habitats importants se trouvent dj dans les zones de protection marine ou dans les sanctuaires de vie sauvage, des ressources supplmentaires sont ncessaires pour s'assurer que la rglementation relative aux activits dans ces zones est applique.             Le dveloppement du tourisme n'a pas encore atteint celui des autres pays des Carabes et par consquent, beaucoup des effets ngatifs sur l'environnement ne sont pas encore ressentis. Il est donc possible de prendre en compte les ressources naturelles, telles que les tortues de mer et leurs habitats, lors de l'laboration de nouveaux projets. En protgant ces ressources de base, Saint-Vincent et les Grenadines sera mieux plac pour assurer un dveloppement durable. Le prsent plan d'action propose des lignes directrices qui permettront le dveloppement de la zone ctire sans qu'il y ait d'effets ngatifs sur les tortues marines. Des rcifs coralliens et des bancs d'algues sains bnficient non seulement aux tortues marines, mais amliorent galement la pche prs des ctes ainsi que le tourisme croissant. La prvision du gouvernement  cet gard se traduite par une lgislation qui permet aux habitats critiques d'tre totalement protgs dans les zones de protection marines, rserves de vie sauvage, rserves forestires et, suite  l'approbation de l'Acte de Parcs Nationaux, dans les parcs nationaux aussi. Nanmoins, l'efficacit de ce concept dpend de l'allocation par le gouvernment des ressources ncessaires  une gestion adquate (y compris l'application des rglements), et de l'interdiction  toute exploitation ayant des implications ngatives dans ces zones protges. Nous proposons que des tudes indpendantes d'impact sur l'environnement soient des composantes obligatoires du processus du dveloppement pour permettre aux communauts gouvernementales et non-gouvernementales de passer en revue les avantages (souvent  court terme) et les inconvnients (souvent  long terme) des projets proposs avant qu'ils soient dfinitivement accepts.             Un Programme national pour la protection des tortues marines a t propos qui visera  amliorer la sensibilisation du public et leur participation  la protection de la tortue, contrlera l'abondance et la distribution des tortues marines et encouragera l'exploitation durable et rationnelle des ressources de tortues marines.    Table of Contents         I. INTRODUCTION            St. Vincent and the Grenadines is a multi-island state which lies between 61E05'-61E30' W and 12E30'-13E25'N (Figure 1), covers a total land area of 344.6 km2, and supports a human population of about 125,000. St. Vincent is the largest island in the nation. The Grenadines once belonged wholly to Grenada, but they were divided by Great Britain in 1791 for administrative purposes. The northernmost Grenadines became part of St. Vincent and the southernmost islands (including and south of Petit Martinque) remained with Grenada. The islands of St. Vincent and the Grenadines were originally inhabited by the Arawaks, who were dispos-sessed by a group of South American Indians known as Caribs. These Caribs supplied European settlers with foodstuffs in exchange for manufactured items. Among these food items was sea turtle meat, which apparently was a favorite among the French and English settlers (Adams, 1980). One of the Grenadine islands, Canouan, was named by the Caribs for its sea turtles, suggesting their particular abundance around this island.            European historians visiting these islands in the 17th and 18th centuries observed that Carib males were skilled fishermen, excellent divers, and fearless seamen. They caught turtles by turning the nesting female on her back, or by harpooning them at sea with a retrievable wooden spear (Adams, 1980). These historians indicated that sea turtles were abundant, of large size, and easy to catch. As a result, they became an important nutritional staple for slaves, poor settlers and seamen in the islands during the colonial period. Two species were extensively exploited: the green turtle, ""tortue franch"" ( Chelonia   mydas ) and the hawksbill turtle, ""caret"" ( Eretmochelys   imbricata ). The most popular for eating was the green turtle. The meat of the hawksbill was less prized but its hard translucent shell was valued for veneers and toilet articles. The hawksbill shell was also used to fashion fish hooks by the Caribs.            Throughout the early colonial period, large quantities of live green turtles and hawksbill shell were exported to Western Europe. Though few, turtle fishermen formed the vanguard of European settlement in the Caribbean. Virtually all of the Lesser Antilles (including St. Vincent and the Grenadines) were inhabited by European fishermen before the arrival of the planters. In the 17th century French fishermen catching turtles in the Grenadines were known as ""verrards"", and they caught turtles at sea using a 2.5 m harpoon called a ""varre"" (J. Daudin, pers. comm., 1993). Thus sea turtle catching is among the oldest forms of commercial fishing in the Grenadines. By the late 18th century, rapid population increases created an increased local demand for turtle meat. While the meat was mainly consumed domestically, the shell was exported. By the 20th century, several Caribbean islands, including Trinidad and Barbados, were receiving turtle products from St. Vincent. Annual export of turtle shell averaged 500 lb (227 kg) during the first quarter of the present century (Adams, 1980).            The commercial trade resulted in significant declines in the abundance of local sea turtle stocks, prompting the passage of legislation in 1901 to protect sea turtles. This was ten years after Grenada had passed similar legislation. Despite legal protection, enforcement was problematic (Adams, 1980). At the present time, three centuries of unrelenting exploitation of sea turtles have left their mark. Fishermen today continue to report declining numbers, yet the harvest persists. Turtle meat is widely consumed locally and, until recently, much of the shell was exported to Japan (though not to the extent that Japanese Customs data suggest, see section 3.3). Sea turtle conservation is a challenge in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, not only because of the economic benefits derived from turtle fishing, but also because ""old habits die hard"". Local people who make their living by fishing have simple rules. To them, the sea will always provide for their needs. This is particularly true in the Grenadines where fishing, tourism or both are the life blood of most people. The issue here is not simply one of resource exploitation, but also of culture and heritage.            Despite the challenges, it is increasingly clear that some form of comprehensive protection is needed. Sea turtles are declining throughout the Caribbean and the world and, while declines cannot be measured with precision in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, the same trends are evident here. If the turtles disappear, this will have profound implications for the livelihoods of fishermen and those who have traditionally benefited from sea turtle exploitation. Furthermore, living sea turtles now have a potentially important role to play in the development of the tourism industry, the economic benefits of which will spread further than could be achieved solely from fishing for sea turtles. Tourism in the Grenadines, in particular, is dependent on a healthy marine environment and abundant marine life. In this context, it is disturbing that during interviews conducted for this Action Plan, a dive operator based in Union Island reported that he had not seen a single turtle whilst diving around Union and in the Tobago Cays in the previous six months, and a turtle fisherman reported that he had not heard of a single nest in Mustique since 1990.            As a result of the efforts of WIDECAST and other organizations, the plight of sea turtles is increasingly recognised in the Wider Caribbean. One result of this increased awareness was the June 1991 unanimous decision by the Conference of Plenipotentiaries for the Adoption of the Annexes to the Protocol concerning Specially Protected Areas and Wildlife (SPAW) in the Wider Caribbean Region to include all six Caribbean-occurring species of sea turtle on Annex II, offering them full protection from harvest (direct and incidental), commercial trade, and, to the extent possible, ""disturbance"", particularly during breeding (Eckert, 1991; UNEP, 1991). St. Vincent and the Grenadines has recently signed this Protocol (see section 4.32). The future for residents of St. Vincent and the Grenadines lies in formulating and adopting creative alternatives to the harvest of depleted species so that the current needs of the people can be met, whilst at the same time these and other coastal resources which are so important to the development of the nation are not irreparably degraded.             This comprehensive Sea Turtle Recovery Action Plan is designed to provide policy-makers and non-government groups with detailed information requisite to make informed conservation decisions. This Action Plan is one of a region-wide series developed by WIDECAST and is tailored specifically to the circumstances of St. Vincent and the Grenadines. Our intentions in developing the plan are to summarise the status and distribution of local sea turtle populations, examine threats to their survival, and recommend conservation and management actions. The Action Plan is well suited to serve as a basis for the sea turtle section(s) of the national Fisheries Management Plan, currently being drafted by the Fisheries Division (in conjunction with CFRAMP and the OECS Fisheries Unit), as called for by the OECS Harmonised Fisheries initiative. The consensus is that sea turtles in St. Vincent and the Grenadines are fewer today than at any time during recorded history. In order to promote the survival of remaining stocks, a detailed national Sea Turtle Conservation Programme is proposed (see section 4.6).    Table of Contents         II. STATUS AND DISTRIBUTION OF SEA TURTLES IN ST. VINCENT            In the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico, five species of sea turtle are recognized as  Endangered  and a sixth, the loggerhead turtle, as  Vulnerable  by the World Conservation Union (IUCN) (Groombridge, 1982). Sea turtles are harvested throughout this region for meat, shell, oil, skins, and eggs. In addition, they are accidentally captured in active or abandoned fishing gear, resulting in the death of tens of thousands of turtles each year (e.g., National Research Council, 1990). Oil spills, chemical waste and persistent plastic debris, as well as the ongoing degradation of important nesting beaches and feeding grounds, also threaten the continued existence of Wider Caribbean populations.            Data on sea turtles in St. Vincent and the Grenadines are almost non-existent. There has never been an in-depth study of these animals under our jurisdiction, and there are no monitoring programmes. A few details are known, however, such as the fact that four species occur (some only on a seasonal basis), populations are depleted, and no fishermen fish exclusively for sea turtles. Most catches are made in the Grenadines, and especially in the Southern Grenadines where turtle meat supplements the otherwise limited variety of protein in the diet and provides a source of income when sold to hotel restaurants (see section 3.3). The following sections provide biological background on the species present, as well as summarise available published and anecdotal data. Please refer to Figures 2a and 2b for locations (e.g., nesting beaches) cited in the text.               2.1  Caretta   caretta , Loggerhead Sea Turtle              The adult loggerhead is recognised by its large head, thick and somewhat tapered cara-pace (=shell), five pair of lateral plates (=scutes) on the carapace (Figure 3), and typically heavy infestation of barnacles, mostly on the head and carapace. The colour is reddish-brown, sometimes tinted with orange. Hatchlings are uniformly brown or grey. The large head and strong jaws, for which the species is named, are necessary adaptations to a diet of mollusks and hard-shelled crabs. Jellyfish, small fishes, and plants are also sometimes eaten (summarised by Dodd, 1988). Pritchard et al. (1983) report that adults reach a size of 120 cm (straightline cara-pace length) and weigh up to 200 kg (440 lb). Based on data collected elsewhere in the Western Atlantic, each female would be expected to deposit 1-6 clutches averaging 120 eggs each at 12-14 day intervals during the nesting season (summarised by Dodd, 1988). Individual turtles do not generally nest every year. Most females return to the nesting beach every second or third year, although remigration intervals as long as seven years have been reported (Richardson et al., 1978; Bjorndal et al., 1983).             Loggerheads have a wide oceanic distribution. In the Atlantic Ocean, they are seen as far north as Newfoundland (Squires, 1954) and northern Europe (Brongersma, 1972) and as far south as Argentina (Frazier, 1984). Nesting grounds are often located in temperate latitudes, with the greatest numbers of nesting females recorded in Florida (USA) and Masirah Island (Oman). An estimated 14,150 females nest annually on the Atlantic coast of Florida (Murphy and Hopkins, 1984; Ehrhart, 1989), where the peak nesting season extends from mid-May to mid-July. Moderate nesting populations are also found in Mexico, where Gulf and Caribbean coasts support some 380-400 females per annum (Ehrhart, 1989). Loggerheads nest occasionally during the summer months on islands in the eastern Caribbean (Rebel, 1974; Dodd, 1988; Ehrhart, 1989). There are only two documented local nestings, both on Palm Island in the Grenadines (verified by Carr et al., 1982, because hatchlings were retained in captivity). In addition, there are verbal reports of nesting on Mahault beach in Canouan. The turtle is sometimes sighted in offshore waters, mainly in the Atlantic Ocean between the months of January and June (Morris, 1987). These sightings are made by local fishermen whose activities on the continental shelf are limited to those months, hence the data should not be construed to indicate that the species is not present in the latter half of the year.             No detailed size or weight data are available for St. Vincent and the Grenadines, nor is there any information concerning size classes present or seasonal distribution and abundance. Carr et al. (1982) noted that subadult loggerheads, seldom less than 70-80 lb (32-36 kg), were ""very common"" in the Grenadines and that juveniles were not seen. In contrast, Rainey and Pritchard (1974) reported that very few loggerheads were caught in the central and southern Lesser Antilles. It is difficult to reconcile these observations. During interviews conducted for this Action Plan, we could not confirm that loggerheads of any size had ever been ""very common"" in Grenadine waters. At the present time loggerheads (known locally in some areas as hammerheads) are rarely seen in the Grenadines. As is the case in nearby Barbados (Horrocks, 1992), loggerheads are considerably rarer than either the green turtle or the hawksbill. Contemporary data indicate that all four locally-occurring sea turtles are harvested, including an occasional loggerhead.    Table of Contents                    2.2  Chelonia   mydas , Green Sea Turtle              The genus  Chelonia  is readily distinguished from other sea turtle genera by a single pair of prefrontal scales (two large scales between the eyes). With very rare exceptions, the carapace (=shell) has four pairs of lateral scutes and five vertebral scutes (Figure 3). The carapace is light to dark brown, sometimes shaded with olive, with radiating wavy or mottled markings of darker colour or with large blotches of dark brown. The plastron (=underbelly) is whitish to light yellow. The upper surfaces of the legs and tail are coloured like the shell above and are yellowish white beneath (Carr, 1952). In contrast to the hawksbill turtle (section 2.4), the cara-pace scutes do not overlap one another. The carapace is generally devoid of barnacles. Green turtles can attain weights of 230 kg (about 550 lb) (Pritchard et al., 1983) and mature adults measure 95-120 cm straightline carapace length (Bjorndal and Carr, 1989). Hatchlings are distinct in that they are jet-black above and pure white on their underbellies.            This species is recorded nesting on St. Vincent and in the Grenadines (Morris, 1984), but occurrences are rare. Indeed, folklore has it that their tracks are seldom seen and their nests seldom found because ""the females nest in the surf"" (Canouan fisherman, pers. comm., 1993). The nesting season appears to extend from April to August (see section 4.112 for details). Both juvenile and adult green turtles are present year around along the west coast of St. Vincent, ""but not in substantial numbers [and] hawksbills are more numerous"" (Carr et al., 1982). The opposite is true in the Grenadines, where green turtles are more abundant than hawksbills (J. Laidlow (Canouan), D. Ollivierre (Union), pers. comm., 1993). Most turtles are taken at sea in turtle nets, by spearguns, by a noose (loop) attached to a pole and line, on the beach, or opportunistically while trolling offshore for large pelagic fishes (Morris, 1987; L. Ollivierre, D. Ollivierre, pers. comm., 1993). Based on questionnaires and interviews with fishermen, Morris (1987) concluded that there has been a decline in numbers of this species in the waters of St. Vincent and the Grenadines, although they are still quite common relative to other species around the Grenadines (J. Laidlow, D. Ollivierre, pers. comm., 1993).            Green turtles are herbivores and in the Caribbean they feed primarily on the sea grass Thalassia testudinum (e.g., Bjorndal, 1982b). Many of the Grenadine Islands have extensive turtle grass meadows and algal beds, perhaps explaining the relative abundance of green turtles compared to hawksbills around these islands. Green turtles are also reported from areas of sea grass/algal beds around St. Vincent (e.g., Blue Lagoon on the southwest coast). Studies indicate that individual turtles maintain ""feeding scars"" by returning to the same area of sea grass meadow to forage everyday (e.g., Ogden et al., 1983). The scars are maintained by regular cropping for several months and the new growth, rich in nutrients and low in lignin, is preferred. When the cropped grasses show signs of stress (blade thinning, increased distance between blades), the turtle abandons the scar and moves on to forage in another area. Individual turtles can be sighted in the same area for many months, and sometimes several years (based on capture-recapture studies in the U. S. Virgin Islands), but green turtles are highly migratory and during their subadult years they may travel several thousand kilometres and feed in many different Caribbean nations. Green turtles require 25-35 years to reach sexual maturity (Frazer and Ladner, 1986).            The following text is taken from Rebel (1974), who based his information on personal communication from L. Errol Ollivierre. ""The fishing season lasts for eight months. During the closed season (May through August) [N.B. today the season is closed 1 March-31 July, see section 4.21], catching turtles and removing eggs are prohibited. Green and hawksbill turtles are the only species on which the fishery is based; other species are rarely caught. ... No fishermen are engaged in the turtle fishery on a full-time basis, so estimating the number of individuals involved is difficult. Most of the turtles are caught with turtle nets, but some hawks-bills are turned while nesting. About 65-70% of the total catch comes from the island of Bequia."" Fewer turtles are now caught around Bequia than in former days and Bequian fishermen now fish throughout the Grenadines as far south as Petit St. Vincent, over periods lasting several months. They sell turtle meat and shells (both green and hawksbill) locally to islanders or to passing yachts, or to boats that export products to Martinique (see section 3.3).    Table of Contents                    2.3  Dermochelys   coriacea , Leatherback Sea Turtle              The leatherback or ""river turtle"", the largest of the marine turtles, is known to nest in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, particularly on the high energy Atlantic beaches of the east and southeast coast of mainland St. Vincent (Morris, 1984). Nesting is also reported occasionally from the leeward (west) coast of St. Vincent (Carr et al., 1982; Morris, 1984); see section 4.112 for details. In the Grenadines, leatherbacks have been reported to nest ""occasionally"" in Pasture Bay, Mustique and Mahault Bay, Canouan. A female was turned on Grand Bay beach, Canouan in June 1993. Sightings of adults have also been made at sea both on the Atlantic and Caribbean side of mainland St. Vincent. They are sometimes harpooned in deep waters by pilot whale (Globicephala macrorhynchus) fishermen from Barrouallie (Carr et al., 1982). Leatherback meat is not favoured because of its oily nature and ""fresh"" smell. However, once salted it apparently tastes similar or better than the meat of humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae), a meat which is very popular with the people of St. Vincent and the Grenadines (S. Laidlow, pers. comm., 1993).             Juveniles have never been reported, but two specimens (19 cm and 28.5 cm straightline carapace length) have washed ashore in neighbouring Barbados (Horrocks, 1987, 1992). Adults are probably seasonal visitors. Local fishermen associate them with periods of heavy flow from the Orinoco River in Venezuela (Carr et al., 1982). Some Vincentian fishermen believe that leatherbacks live in rivers, and are washed into the sea after heavy rains. This is perhaps the origin of the local name, ""river turtle"". In reality, however, the leatherback is entirely marine in habit and does not frequent freshwater rivers. The scenario in other parts of the Caribbean, and it is most likely true for St. Vincent as well, is that the gravid females leave their foraging grounds in northern latitudes (North Atlantic waters off Canada and the USA) and arrive in the Caribbean each year between February and July to lay their eggs (cf. Eckert and Eckert, 1988).            Leatherbacks are easily identified because of their great size (250-500 kg, or 550-1100 lb); males sometimes exceed 900 kg (2000 lb) (Morgan, 1989). The leatherback lacks a hard shell and its smooth, black skin is spotted with white. The moderately flexible carapace is raised into seven prominent ridges and is strongly tapered to enhance streamlining. Powerful flippers extend nearly the length of the body. Nesting females usually measure 130-165 cm straightline carapace length (summarised by Eckert, 1992). Hatchlings are distinct in that they are entirely black with rows of small white scales extending head to tail; the underbelly is mottled black and white. Clutch size and frequency are unknown for St. Vincent and the Gren-adines, but studies elsewhere in the eastern Caribbean indicate that 80-90 yolked eggs are generally laid per clutch, an average of 5-7 clutches are laid per season (March-July) at 9-10 day intervals, and females return to the nesting beach every 2-4 years (Tucker, 1989; Eckert and Eckert, 1990). Age at maturity and life span are unknown.            Leatherbacks are known to feed primarily on jellyfish and other soft-bodied prey (Hartog and van Nierop, 1984; Davenport and Balazs, 1991). The turtles are deep-diving in the Caribbean, with some dives exceeding 1000 m in depth (Eckert et al., 1986, 1989). Eckert et al. (1989) proposed that internesting dive behaviour may reflect nocturnal feeding on vertically mi-grating zooplankton, chiefly siphonophore and salp colonies. Exceptionally deep dives may rep-resent predator escape tactics since adults are preyed upon by killer whales (Orcinus orca) and other large oceanic predators. Caldwell and Caldwell (1969) reported that three killer whales taken simultaneously by a commercial fishing boat on 13 May 1968 off the leeward side of St. Vincent contained pieces of leatherback turtle in their stomachs. Deep diving behaviour may explain why leatherbacks are so seldom seen offshore. At the present time, neither the behaviour nor the distribution of leatherbacks in local waters has been satisfactorily quantified.    Table of Contents                    2.4  Eretmochelys   imbricata , Hawksbill Sea Turtle              This species is the most common nester both on St. Vincent and throughout the Grena-dines. The turtle is often called ""oxbill"", a corruption of the name hawksbill. The hawksbill is distinguished by a narrow, pointed beak with which it presumably pries sponges and other soft-bodied invertebrates from coral reefs. The carapace is often posteriorly serrated and the carapace scutes overlap, like shingles on a roof (Figure 3). Adults rarely exceed 80 kg (176 lb) and a straight carapace length of about 90 cm (Pritchard et al., 1983). Bright mottled colouration (brown, orange, gold) is common in juveniles and adults. Hatchlings are uniformly reddish-brown, brown, or grey above and below. Preliminary studies of growth rate have been undertaken in Caribbean waters, but age at maturity is unknown [N.B. studies in Australia suggest that maturity is reached only after 30-plus years; C. Limpus, Queensland Turtle Research, pers. comm., 1992]. The turtle specialises on sponges in the Caribbean. Sponges contributed 95.3% of the total dry mass of all food items in digestive tract samples from 61 animals from seven Caribbean countries (Meylan, 1988). Hawksbills of all sizes are present year around, particularly along the west coast of St. Vincent, ""but not in substantial numbers""; fewer are encountered in the Grenadines where green turtles predominate in nearshore waters (Carr et al., 1982).             According to Morris (1987), the nesting season extends from March to September. However, recent discussions with fishermen and other residents in Union Island and Canouan suggest that nesting peaks in September-October and continues into December (R. Charters, D. Ollivierre, pers. comm., 1993). Clearly, survey data are needed to resolve this important question. Carr et al. (1982) concluded that hawksbills were the predominant nesters in St. Vincent, emerging ""on nearly every stretch of beach, but everywhere in reduced numbers."" Nesting is also reported from the Grenadines (see section 4.112). Quantitative data are not sufficient to determine which beaches are most important. Behavioural data are lacking, but there is no reason to believe that nesting patterns and nesting seasons for this species in St. Vincent should differ significantly from the situation in neighbouring Barbados, 160 km to the east. Hawksbills in Barbados deposit an average of 127 eggs per clutch (Horrocks and Scott, 1991) and the nesting season peaks June to August (Horrocks, 1992). In Antigua, an intensive tagging programme has shown that hawksbills typically nest 4-6 times per year at intervals of approximately 14 days (Corliss et al., 1989). It is likely that individual turtles do not nest every year, but rather every 2-5 years.            Hawksbills are considered easier turtles to catch than green turtles (D. Ollivierre, pers. comm., 1993), both because they nest in greater numbers than green turtles and because they are slower and easier to approach underwater than green turtles. The meat is eaten locally, although one restauranteur reported that it was generally too tough to sell to tourists in his restaurant (L. Baptiste, pers. comm., 1993). The shells are often polished and sold locally to passing yachts (see section 3.3). Historically, St. Vincent has exported hawksbill shell to Europe, Asia, and to other Caribbean islands. For example, in the early 1970's approximately 1,500 lb (680 kg) of hawksbill shell, derived from hawksbills caught at sea and on the beach, were exported to St. Lucia each year (Rebel, 1974). According to Milliken and Tokunaga (1987), St. Vincent has been a significant supplier of raw hawksbill shell (tortoiseshell, or 'bekko') to Japan in recent decades (see section 3.3 for details).    Table of Contents                  2.5  Lepidochelys   kempi , Kemp's Ridley Sea Turtle            The Kemp's ridley is confined to the Gulf of Mexico and the temperate northern Atlantic. Thus it does not nest in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and has never been documented in these waters. This diminutive turtle is grey in colour when immature and primarily olive green as an adult (Pritchard et al., 1983). According to Ross et al. (1989), adults weigh 60-90 lb (27-41 kg) and have a shell length of 23-30 inches (58-76 cm). The carapace is round, often as wide as it is long, and the scutes do not overlap each other (cf. hawksbill turtles, section 2.4). The species is carnivorous and eats mostly crabs, but also preys upon other crustaceans, shellfish, jellyfish, sea urchins, starfish, and fish. A single nesting ground remains in the Wider Caribbean, and that is at Rancho Nuevo in the state of Tamaulipas, Mexico. This depleted population boasted more than 42,000 adult females nesting during  one day  in 1947 (Ross et al., 1989), but excessive commercial exploitation on the nesting beach and incidental catch (and drowning) in shrimp trawls plying the Gulf of Mexico have reduced the species to fewer than 500 nesting females per year (R. Byles, U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service, pers. comm., 1993).    Table of Contents                    2.6  Lepidochelys   olivacea , Olive Ridley Sea Turtle              This species is not known to nest in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and has never been documented in these waters. However, nesting occurs in the southernmost nations of the Wider Caribbean, notably in Suriname but with diffuse nesting in northwest Guyana and in French Guiana (Reichart, 1989). It is therefore possible that olive ridleys pass through the waters of St. Vincent and the Grenadines occasionally. They are a comparatively small turtle, similar in appearance to Kemp's ridleys, and rarely exceed 45 kg (100 lb) (Pritchard et al., 1983). Olive ridleys nesting at Eilanti, Suriname, range in size from 63-75 cm shell length, are grey-green to olive-green in colour, and can be distinguished from the other sea turtles by a relatively high and often asymmetrical number of lateral scutes, mostly 6-7 on each side and sometimes eight or nine (Schulz, 1975). Carapace scutes do not overlap one another (cf. hawksbills, section 2.4). Olive ridleys nesting in Suriname have declined considerably in recent years, from about 3,000 nests per year in the late 1960's to fewer than 500 nests per year today (Reichart and Fretey, 1993).    Table of Contents         III. STRESSES ON SEA TURTLES IN ST. VINCENT               3.1 Destruction or Modification of Habitat              Habitat important to sea turtles includes nesting beaches, marine foraging grounds, and migratory corridors. Nesting beaches can be spoiled for sea turtles by coastal development that does not take into account the fact that artificial lighting can disorient adults and hatchlings (section 4.132), beach cleaning and general recreation can disrupt incubating eggs (section 4.134), and groynes and jetties built to stabilise beaches can instead lead to serious erosion (section 4.133). Foraging grounds consist mainly of sea grass beds, coral reefs, and hard bottom habitat in general. Sea grass areas and coral reefs are adversely affected by domestic, industrial, recreational and agricultural pollution (sections 4.143, 4.146), the indiscriminate dumping of garbage (section 4.144), anchoring and dredging (section 4.147), etc.            Since tourism development in St. Vincent and the Grenadines is not yet as widespread as in some other countries in the Caribbean, many potential nesting beach problems have so far been avoided. The majority of beaches in St. Vincent and the Grenadines are still undeveloped. However, there are several major developments under construction or being considered. These include Otley Hall Ship Yard, St. Vincent, Ashton Marina Project (Union Island), Bloody Bay Resort (Union Island), and the Canouan Resort Project (Canouan). Land reclamation, hotel and villa construction, and golf courses are involved in some of these projects, and they will have implications for the integrity of sea turtle nesting and foraging habitats. A fisherman interviewed in Mustique was of the opinion that beachfront development had already contributed to the decline in nesting by sea turtles on this island.            Tourism development has been greatly facilitated in some of the islands by the recent construction or enlargement of airstrips (e.g., Canouan, Union, Bequia). Airports in Union and Bequia involved land reclamation and have resulted in some loss of sea turtle foraging habitat (e.g., coral reefs and sea grass beds). At Bequia, the entire airstrip is built on land reclaimed from the sea at the southern end of the island. During its construction, two sea turtles were trapped in large, nearshore enclosures constructed to receive fill-dirt, suggesting that foraging/ refuge habitat of sea turtles had been affected. At Union Island, the airstrip was lengthened and an area of coral reef was destroyed in the process. Unfortunately, since there are few quantitative data on the distribution and abundance of foraging habitat, especially sea grass (CCA/IRF, 1991), and of nesting/foraging habitat use by sea turtles in the St. Vincent or the Grenadines, it is not possible to fully assess the impacts of these developments. It is important that adequate surveys be undertaken (see section 4.11) in time to assess the impacts of such development on sea turtle habitat in the future.            At present there is no evidence that beachfront lighting has led to the disorientation of nesting females or hatchlings (section 4.132). This may result from a combination of factors; namely, there are relatively few turtles nesting and many beaches are still undeveloped. It may also be that the problem exists, but has never been reported due to a lack of awareness on the part of hoteliers. The potential for lighting problems looms largest in the Grenadines; however, the North Leeward Highway currently under construction on St. Vincent may ""open up"" the lee-ward coast (which supports some sea turtle nesting and to date has not attracted beachfront hotels, probably due to poor roads) to coastal development. Another potentially severe disruption to nesting habitat, that of beach sand removal for construction purposes, may have affected countless numbers of nests over the years. This practice is now illegal without a permit, but continues on many isolated beaches with sufficient road access (section 4.131).            Littering of streams, road sides, and beaches is commonplace in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, as is at-sea dumping of garbage. Several islands (e.g., Canouan, Mayreau, Union Island) have no designated disposal sites (CCA/IRF, 1991). This encourages indiscriminate dumping on any unused areas of land. Improved facilities for garbage disposal are perceived by many Vincentians as the highest priority issue for improved environmental management in the country. Petroleum tar occurs on windward beaches throughout St. Vincent and the Grenadines, although the extent of the problem has not been quantified. Litter and tar in the sea pose potentially severe problems for sea turtles, since plastic bags and tar balls can be mistaken for food and ingested. On the beach, litter can create obstacles for newly emerged hatchlings or can prevent hatchlings from emerging at all. Organic matter fouls the sand and encourages fun-gal and bacterial contamination of eggs.            The amount of boat traffic has increased dramatically over the last ten years, particularly in the Grenadines. In 1983, there were 20,000 sea arrival visitors to the Grenadines compared to almost 60,000 in 1987 (CCA/IRF, 1991). Yachts (many registered under the French flag) frequently anchor off nesting beaches, and concern has been expressed that their presence may interfere with the activities of nesting females. However, yacht traffic peaks between January and April, outside of the primary nesting season. Perhaps of more consequence is anchor dam-age to the seabed (primarily to coral reefs) effected by yachts and cruise ships. Princess cruise-liners pull in to Saline Bay in Mayreau once a week during the tourist season, and Club Med, Windstar and Windjammer vessels anchor off the Tobago Cays and/or Palm Island. Disturbance of the seabed caused by the propellers of these ships may increase sedimentation and damage to foraging habitat, and may scare away turtles. 'Jet skis' and aquascooters, which are noisy and occasionally strike turtles elsewhere in the Caribbean, are banned.            In St. Vincent and the Grenadines there is still the opportunity to take important sea turtle habitat into account as the coastline is increasingly developed for commercial and tourist interests. One of the primary objectives of this Sea Turtle Recovery Action Plan is to highlight potential problems, as well as their solutions, and to recommend ways in which St. Vincent and the Grenadines can develop to its potential while not sacrificing its natural and cultural heritage, including its sea turtles.    Table of Contents                    3.2 Disease or Predation              There have been no studies to determine the extent to which disease affects the survival of sea turtles in St. Vincent and the Grenadines. However, there is no evidence of disease among sea turtles sighted locally. The tumor disease known as green turtle fibropapilloma which has affected green turtles (sometimes causing blindness and starvation) elsewhere in the Caribbean has not been reported in St. Vincent and the Grenadines. Fishermen should be alert to this disease. Tumors appear as whitish or gray growths, similar to warts, which can be 10 cm or more in diameter. In the southern regions of the Caribbean the disease is reported in Barbados (Horrocks, 1992), Curaao (Sybesma, 1989), Panama (Jacobson, 1990), Trinidad (Jacobson, 1991), and Venezuela (Guada et al., 1991).            Ghost crabs (Ocypode quadrata) and dogs are likely beach predators on sea turtle eggs and hatchlings. In the Grenadines, predation on hatchlings by laughing gulls (Larus atricilla) has been observed, and it has been suggested that the nocturnal manicou (=opossum) (Didelphis marsupialis) may be a predator of eggs and/or hatchlings (J. Daudin, pers. comm., 1993). Mongooses (Herpestes auropunctatus) are only found on St. Vincent, not in the Grenadines. Whether they are important sea turtle predators in St. Vincent is unknown, but they are well known to be sea turtle egg and hatchling predators in other Caribbean islands (e.g., Boulon, 1984; Zullo, 1986). Mongooses take eggs from nests broken open by the sea in neighbouring Barbados (Horrocks, 1992).            There is still an abundance of reef fish on the reefs around many of the islands of St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and these are likely predators on hatchlings once they have left the nest and entered the sea. Fishermen have reported observations of adult sea turtles with missing flippers, suggesting attacks by larger marine organisms, possibly sharks. Predation on leatherbacks at sea by killer whales (=orcas) caught off St. Vincent has also been reported (Caldwell and Caldwell, 1969) (see section 2.3).    Table of Contents                    3.3 Over-utilisation              The absence of data on sea turtle populations in St. Vincent and the Grenadines prevents the unequivocal use of the term ""over-utilisation"" of sea turtles. However, it is generally agreed among fishermen that there has been a drastic decline in the numbers of nesting turtles, as well as turtles sighted at sea. Most people are of the opinion that the decline is due to over2Dutilisation. The harvest of sea turtles has occurred for generations (see section I), yet at no time has population size or recruitment potential been taken into account. Some older men who formerly turned turtles on the beach believe that the decline is due to the activities of the younger spear-fishermen. Some younger fishermen in the Grenadines believe that the increased yacht traffic and over-night anchoring adjacent to nesting beaches may be deterring nesting females (section 3.1). Both contemporary harvest and habitat alteration, as well as commercial take in past centuries, are likely to have played a role in reducing population sizes. Sea turtles are slow to mature, meaning that a noticeable decline in the number of females coming ashore to nest may manifest itself only after decades of relentless exploitation. Today most turtles are taken at sea in turtle nets (single layered, large mesh 4-inch gill nets), by spearguns (turtles are usually shot through the flipper or neck), by a noose or ""loop"" attached to a pole and line, on the beach, or opportunistically while trolling offshore for large pelagic fishes (Morris, 1987; L. Ollivierre, D. Ollivierre, pers. comm., 1993).             The following paragraphs summarise information available in the literature, as well as what we have learned from interviews conducted with fishermen and other informed observers. It is unfortunate that fisheries statistics have not been kept regarding the legal sea turtle catch. As a result, data tend to be fragmented and anecdotal. To the best of our knowledge, considerably fewer turtles are caught at the present time than were landed in past years. A Fisheries data collection officer working at five landing points on the leeward coast of St. Vincent reported that only one turtle had been landed in the two years (1991-1993) that he had been working. An officer working at windward landing sites since May 1993 reported only three turtles, all large hawksbills (shells were observed in October 1993 at Sandy Bay). When questioned about whether landings were few because catches were hidden from Fisheries personnel or because turtles were scarce, there was unanimous support for the latter explanation.            It is difficult to estimate how many turtles are caught each year, how many people are involved, or what proportion of their annual income is derived from sea turtle products. It is clear, however, that (1) at least 120 (and perhaps many more) turtles are landed each year, (2) the fishery is largely seasonal, (3) the fishery is largely concentrated in the Grenadines, (4) the fishery involves take at sea and on the nesting beaches, (5) green turtles, hawksbills and, to a lesser extent, leatherbacks are taken (loggerheads are rare and thus infrequently caught), and (6) no one depends solely on turtle fishing for a livelihood, although the meat may be a welcome alternative and the income in many cases is surely important. The primary markets are Grenadine residents (meat and shells), restaurants (meat), and yachts (shell). Two new fish markets, financed by the Japanese, are planned for Union and Canouan islands (R. Ryan, pers. comm., 1993). The presence of these facilities may increase information on sea turtle harvest.            There appear to be few conservation techniques used by fishermen who harvest sea tur-tles. Adult females are targeted whilst nesting, usually by older fishermen. Once a hawksbill crawl is spotted on the beach, the fishermen wait the 14-15 days between nests (or 21 days if it is a leatherback crawl) [N.B. in fact, leatherbacks will re-nest after only 9-10 days] and return to capture the female. Some report using ""turtle tracks in the sky"" to guide them to the nesting beach. Adult and immature turtles are caught at sea in turtle nets, as well as by speargun and by noose. The latter methods are usually employed by younger fishermen. Turtles are usually held alive until they can be sold. To achieve this, nets are set so that turtles tangle but can reach the surface to breathe, or nets are regularly checked to remove turtles soon after they have been caught. Attempts are always made to spear the turtle through the flipper or neck to wound rather than kill, and to prevent damage to the shell. In Union Island, ""loops"" are sometimes used, particularly to capture green turtles whilst feeding in open sea grass habitat. The loop consists of a wire noose on the end of a pole that is placed around the turtle's neck and which tightens as it attempts to escape. Once in the boat, the noose can be loosened and the animal kept alive thereafter for several days on its back.            Opportunistic netting (e.g., if a turtle is sighted in an area, a net will be set specifically to catch it) and spearfishing occurs by islanders in their own nearshore waters, but fishermen moving from island to island (particularly Bequian fishermen from Paget Farm) are responsible for a large proportion of the harvest. These fishermen either camp or live in fishermen's quarters on Petit Tabac, Savan, Mustique, Canouan, and Petit St. Vincent and catch lobster, conch, fish and turtle (Y. Chakalall, pers. comm., 1993). Much of the turtle catch apparently comes from waters around Canouan and Union Island. Rebel (1974) reported that 65-70% of the catch once came from Bequia, but this is no longer the case, perhaps because sea turtle populations around Bequia have declined significantly due to over-fishing (diver at Dive Bequia, pers. comm., 1991). [N.B. According to one turtle shell trader, Bequia was a collecting point for shell but was never an important location for harvesting turtles; most hawksbills caught to supply the Japanese shell trade came from Canouan and Balliceaux (J. McDonald, pers. comm, 1993).] It seems likely that undersized turtles or those caught out of season are covertly sold to family and friends, or to tourists unaware or unconcerned about the closed season. Once the turtle season opens, the markets increase and many turtles are sold to restaurants at this time. The Bequian fishermen also return home with substantial numbers of turtles.            Turtle meat is readily available during the open season (1 August - 28 February) in Union Island, but is apparently less accessible in Canouan. In the latter case, most turtles are caught by Bequian fishermen who stay on Canouan and fish around the island for up to several months. Athough they sell some turtle meat to Canouan residents, turtles are carried to other markets by inter-island vessels, or taken back to Bequia for sale. At one time there were as many as eight or nine Bequian fishing boats staying over on Canouan, but in 1993 only a few boats operated from there. Altogether, Bequian fishermen were reported to catch about 20 turtles in Canouan in 1992 (Canouan fisherman, pers. comm., 1993). By the end of September 1993, two months into the turtle open season, Bequian fishermen had already landed about 30 turtles, mainly juvenile green turtles, in Bequia alone (Y. Chakallal, pers. comm., 1993). One large restaurant in Union Island buys 20-30 immature green turtles per season, many of which are caught locally in sea grass beds off Ashton Harbour. There are an additional six smaller restaurants on Union which may purchase about 10 green turtles each per year. In total this rep-resents 80 to 90 green turtles purchased for restaurant sale on Union Island each year.            Since turtle meat fetches about the same price as other fishery products (about EC$ 3-5/ lb) [N.B. US$ 1 = EC$ 2.65], the primary incentive for the harvest in many cases appears to be the price obtained for the shell, primarily the shell of the hawksbill but also that of green tur-tles. In April 1993, a salesman on Mayreau was selling hawksbill shells (ca. 40-65 cm in length) for US$ 55-65 each. This was during the closed season and the turtles were below the minimum weight limit for hawksbills (85 lb, or about 38 kg), illustrating the problems that need to be faced to enforce fisheries legislation on some of the Grenadine islands. Up to the end of 1992, hawksbill scutes were worth up to US$ 60/kg to the fisherman and as much as US$ 100/ kg to the seller. Now that Japan has enacted a zero quota on shell imports (section 4.31), the local market for turtle-shell is restricted to residents and tourists. Nevertheless, the amount of turtle-shell jewelry and whole polished shells on sale is less than in former years. For example, on Union Island during the 1980's whole shells were often offered to tourists for sale at Clifton (J. Horrocks, pers. obs.) but today shells and jewelry are less readily available on the island (M. Jennett, pers. comm., 1993). Whether this is due to declining sea turtle populations or greater awareness of the endangered status of sea turtles amongst sellers and/or tourists is not clear.            In addition to the harvest of turtles, eggs of all species are taken from nests with little regard for conservation, or for the law since sea turtle eggs are protected at all times (see section 4.21). Because harvest of eggs is illegal, they are never sold on the open market, instead they are passed to friends and family. Some fishermen may leave all or a portion of the clutch of eggs when they capture a nesting female, but others take both the eggs and the female. The number of eggs harvested each year is unknown. There is but a single Fisheries Officer in the Grenadines (where most turtle harvest apparently takes place) and enforcement of sea turtle conservation statutes is virtually non-existent.            Export : From about 1900 to 1925, the annual export of turtle shell averaged 500 lb (227 kg); fewer than 100 live turtles were exported each year. In 1923, a typical year, 84 live turtles valued at 25 pounds sterling and 511 lb (232 kg) of shell valued at 315 pounds sterling were shipped to Barbados, possibly for re-export to England (Adams, 1980). Carr et al. (1982) reported exports to Barbados and Japan prior to 1970. In the early 1970's approximately 1,500 lb (680 kg) of hawksbill shell, derived from hawksbills caught at sea and on the beach, were exported to St. Lucia each year (Rebel, 1974). According to Japanese Customs data, St. Vincent supplied Japan with 2,235 kg of 'bekko' (raw hawksbill shell) between 1970 and 1986, with export peaking in 1986 at 470 kg (Milliken and Tokunaga, 1987). After 1986, the volume of trade remained high (Table 1). This may have resulted from an increased reliance upon St. Vincent to move bekko shipments obtained elsewhere in the Caribbean region, to Japan. Although St. Vincent became a signatory to CITES in 1989, the Government took a reservation on the hawksbill turtle (see section 4.31). This means that St. Vincent was (and is) able to legally trade in hawksbill products, a fact that unscrupulous traders may have exploited by naming St. Vincent as country of origin for bekko originating elsewhere.            Falsifying trade records is a serious charge, but appears to have occurred in this case. For example, Japanese Customs data indicate that 1,284 kg of bekko was imported from St. Vincent in 1990 (making St. Vincent one of the largest Caribbean suppliers of hawksbill shell), whilst St. Vincent statistics indicate that only 170 kg were actually exported (Table 1). Based on an average weight of bekko per animal imported into Japan from the Caribbean region (1.34 kg: Milliken and Tokunaga, 1987), Japanese statistics indicate that approximately 2,250 hawks-bills were killed to sustain St. Vincent's bekko trade to Japan between 1983 and 1990 (Table 1). In contrast, domestic trade statistics document the export of some 1,382 kg of shell during this period, representing (based on 1.34 kg shell/turtle) about 1,030 turtles. In spite of inadequate sea turtle population data, it is not generally believed that hawksbill stocks in St. Vincent and the Grenadines could support the trade suggested by Japanese Customs statistics. In any event, regardless which data are used, it appears that within the Eastern Caribbean St. Vincent and the Grenadines has served as a prominent supplier of hawksbill shell in recent decades. This has surely contributed to the decline of hawksbills in national waters. In addition to direct export, it is well known that turtle shell products are sold locally to tourists who subsequently take them out of the country.             As an intriguing footnote, a fisherman from Bequia who fishes for sea turtles, conchs, and lobsters around the Grenadine Islands as far south as Petit Martinique (Grenada) reported that hawksbill carapaces were no longer being bought in Bequia, but that the plastrons (=belly plates) were. He described how he removed the calipee first and then sold the plastrons when he had collected sufficient numbers. He understood that the plastrons were processed in some way, but was unable to supply any further details. Recent reports suggest that plastrons and edges of shells were being bought for resale to Japan. The local buyer was apparently willing to pay up to US$ 83/kg (W. Mulraine, pers. comm., 1993).    Table of Contents                    3.4 Inadequate Regulatory Mechanisms              Fishery Regulations (1987, Section 17), stipulate that it is illegal to (a) disturb, take, sell, purchase or possess sea turtle eggs, (b) interfere with any turtle nest, (c) take, sell, purchase or possess any under-sized turtle, (d) sell, purchase or possess the shell of an under-sized turtle, or (e) take, sell, purchase or possess any turtle or part thereof during the closed season (1 March-31 July). The legislation is adequate regarding eggs, but is wholly deficient to promote the recovery of depleted sea turtle stocks. First, the closed season does not encompass the breeding seasons of all species of sea turtle reported to nest in the country. Indeed, the peak of nesting activity by the species which nests most frequently (i.e., the hawksbill whose breeding peak is reportedly September-October; see section 2.4),  lies entirely within the open season . Second, adult turtles (including gravid females) are not protected during the seven-month open season, despite the fact that survival of large juveniles and breedingage adults is crucial to the recovery of depleted sea turtle populations are (section 4.23).            The Fisheries Regulations (1987) also prohibit the use of tangle nets, designate marine conservation areas where all fishing is prohibited (see section 4.12), and stipulate that permits are required for any speargun used within fishery waters. The tangle net referred to in the Regulations is commonly referred to as the trammel net by the FAO, and is a multi-layered gillnet with each layer having a different hanging ratio and/or mesh size. Turtle nets are single-layered, large mesh (4 inch) gillnets and are not illegal. Turtle nets are set so that ensnared turtles can reach the surface to breathe. This enables fishermen to sort under-sized turtles out of their catch before landing turtles of legal size. Persons convicted of violating any of the Regulations are liable to a fine not exceeding EC$ 5,000. Legislation notwithstanding, the use of unpermitted spearguns is widespread, and it is well known that fishing occurs in marine conservation areas.            The enforcement of fisheries regulations is a major problem in this multi-island state. Enforcement units are often under-staffed and under-equipped, as is the case throughout most of the Caribbean, and thus effective enforcement remains a challenge to the successful recovery of sea turtle populations (see section 4.22). The Fisheries Act of 1986 allows the Minister to ""... designate from time to time ... such persons as he deems fit ... to be authorized officers for the purpose of this Act."" Such authorised officers can stop, search or seize without a warrant any vessel (including gear and cargo) believed to have been used in the commission of an offence against the Act. However, Fisheries Officers do not have powers of arrest and thus have to rely on the security forces.            With regard to the protection of habitats important to sea turtles, there is need for comprehensive national legislation pertaining to coastal zone management and the institutional capacity to enforce coastal zone management statutes. The responsibilities of the proposed Department of National Parks (legislation currently under review) will include management of national parks and other natural resources of St. Vincent and the Grenadines. The country has al-ready made significant progress in the designation of Marine Conservation Areas under the Fisheries Regulations of 1987 (Table 2). Nevertheless, enforcement of restrictions and other provisions within the conservation areas is an unmet challenge. This is partly due to the sheer expanse of territory. Jurisdiction extends from St. Vincent in the north to Union Island in the south, a total distance of about 100 km (Figure 1). An additional problem is the potential for overlapping responsibilities of different institutions under the Fisheries Act (1986), the Wildlife Protection Act (1987), and the proposed National Parks Act.    Table of Contents                      3.5 Other Natural or Man-Made Factors            In addition to habitat destruction (section 3.1) and direct harvest (section 3.3), incidental capture is a problem of unquantified (but probably not large) proportions in St. Vincent and the Grenadines. Virtually all incidental catch would be expected to result from long-lining, since there is no trawling and tangle (trammel) nets are illegal. Drifting gillnets are not considered illegal, but are only occasionally used by Vincentian fishermen; these may result in some incidental catch. One of several new long-lining vessels caught a leatherback turtle in 1992 and brought it back for sale in Kingstown. Leatherbacks are apparently attracted to the bait and lightsticks attached to long-lines. There are several reports of leatherbacks being similarly hooked on long-lines elsewhere in the eastern Caribbean (e.g., BVI: Cambers and Lima, 1990; Antigua: Fuller et al., 1992). The high waves and surges created by tropical storms and occa-sional hurricanes can degrade both the foraging habitats (coral reefs, sea grass beds) and nesting habitat of sea turtles. Other factors affecting the survival of sea turtles in St. Vincent and the Grenadines have not been identified.    Table of Contents         IV. SOLUTIONS TO STRESSES ON SEA TURTLES IN ST. VINCENT               4.1 Manage and Protect Habitat              No systematic surveys have been carried out to date with respect to identifying habitat essential to the continued survival of local sea turtle stocks. It is well known, however, that the waters of St. Vincent and the Grenadines abound with coral reefs and sea grass beds, primarily in the Grenadines and southern St. Vincent. These provide optimum habitats in which hawks-bill, green, and loggerhead sea turtles can forage. Suitable nesting beaches (primarily black sand on mainland St. Vincent, white sand in the Grenadines) are numerous and many of them are undeveloped. In order to recover depleted turtle populations, these habitats must be protected. This can be achieved by designating marine conservation areas (or in the future, national parks under the proposed National Parks legislation), and/or by imposing regulatory guidelines to control potentially harmful activities.            Adverse impacts of inappropriate development could be reduced by adopting legislation through the Town and Country Planning Act (1992) requiring independent environmental impact assessments (EIA) prior to planning permission for all major developments, be they Government or private projects. Currently, it is legislated within the Act that a developer be responsible for conducting an EIA only if requested to do so by the Physical Planing and Development Board. It is a  recommendation of this Recovery Action Plan  that EIA be undertaken by an independent entity approved by the Government. Indiscriminate anchoring, pollution, sand mining, coastal lighting  inter alia  should be regulated within critical areas (see sections 4.13, 4.14 for regulatory suggestions). Ideally, the protection of habitat important to sea turtles should occur within a larger coastal zone management framework.    Table of Contents                      4.11   Identify essential habitat                  Sea turtles emerge from the sea (generally at night) during certain times of the year to lay their eggs in the warm sand of tropical beaches. Nesting used to be much more common in St. Vincent and the Grenadines than it is today, but there are still many beaches where this activity is believed to occur (Table 3). It is essential for the survival of sea turtles in this country that sandy beaches are carefully preserved to retain them as favourable nesting areas. This does not preclude coastal development, but it does mean that foresight is needed with regard to construction setbacks, artificial beachfront lighting, protection of beach vegetation, etc. (see section 4.122 for details). Without adequate surveys, the habitats most important to protect cannot be properly identified.    In addition to nesting areas, it is vital that important feeding areas be identified and adequately safeguarded. Sea turtles forage predominantly on sea grass, algae and on coral reef-associated animals. ECNAMP (1980a,b) provides preliminary data on the distribution of coral reefs around St. Vincent and the Grenadines (Figures 4a,b), but there has been no mapping of sea grass habitat, which is particularly abundant in the Grenadines. In addition to feeding areas, there may be important refuge sites or migratory corridors in the waters of St. Vincent and the Grenadines. The present thrust for coastal tourism development makes it imperative that nearshore marine communities of the country be identified and surveyed. Only in this way will it be possible to identify and appropriately manage nearshore areas that are important to sea turtles.    Table of Contents                           4.111 Survey foraging areas                                Carr et al. (1982) noted that, with the exception of the southeastern coast, the shelf surrounding St. Vincent is narrow and offers relatively little foraging habitat for sea turtles. An exception may be Blue Lagoon, off the southwest coast, which appears to be an important foraging area for green turtles. In contrast, aerial observations indicate that sea turtle foraging grounds (sea grass meadows and coral reefs) are extensive around the Grenadines. Both turtle grass ( Thallasia   testudinum ) and eel grass ( Syringodium   filiforme ) can be found growing in profusion around many of the Grenadine islands. While field surveys are needed to determine precisely which areas are most critical, it is a  recommendation of this Recovery Action Plan  that useful preliminary data be obtained from resident fishermen who are well aware of areas where turtles are routinely encountered.            At the present time, knowledgeable observers report that green turtles are relatively more numerous than hawksbills in the waters of the Grenadines, presumably because of the amount of shallow water supporting lush meadows of sea grasses. Foraging by both greens and hawksbills is reported by local fishermen to occur around Baliceaux (6109'W, 1257'N), Canouan, (6120'W, 1257'N), Union Island (6127'W, 1235'N), and Mustique (6010'W, 1253'N) (Morris, 1984). Particularly important locations mentioned by fishermen interviewed for this Action Plan were Friendship Bay on the southeast coast of Canouan, off Ashton Harbour near to Frigate Island, Big Sand in Union Island, around Palm Island, and around three islets off the northwest coast of Mustique, called the Pillories (Figure 2b). Until more detailed knowledge is available, it should be assumed that all healthy sea grass meadows and coral reefs are potential foraging grounds for sea turtles and, as such, should be managed with care and foresight.             Recognising the difficulty of surveying underwater habitat for sea turtles throughout this multi-island state, it is a  recommendation of this Recovery Action Plan  that full advantage be taken of proposed coral reef monitoring programmes. Such initiatives have been proposed both by the Fisheries Division and by Dive St. Vincent, the latter interested primarily in the health of popular dive sites. Standard sea turtle sightings forms (available from WIDECAST) should be provided to monitoring personnel. Data should be centrally compiled (logically by the Fisheries Division) and made available upon request to interested parties.                       4.112 Survey nesting habitat                                While no comprehensive surveys of beaches for nesting activity have been conducted in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, all beaches on the western coast of St. Vincent are potentially suitable nesting habitats, as are many beaches in the Grenadines (Morris, 1987). Based on interviews with leeward (west) coast residents, Carr et al. (1982) reported that hawksbill nesting (the dominant species nesting in St. Vincent) occurred on the following leeward beaches: Richmond Beach, Rose Bank, Troumaka Bay, Cumberland Bay, Wallilabou Bay, and Barrouallie (Figure 2a). On the windward coast, some hawksbill nesting was reported to occur at Orange Hill, Colonarie Bay, and Stubbs. Leatherbacks were reported to nest occasionally on the leeward coast, especially on Richmond Beach, Dark View, Barrouallie, and Clare Valley; and on the windward coast at Mt. Pleasant. No nesting by loggerheads or green turtles could be documented. In the Grenadines, Carr et al. (1982) reported that hawksbills were the dominant nesters, ""using beaches on nearly all of the islands."" Green turtles nested only rarely; Palm Island (=Prune Island) was cited as one such beach. Loggerheads nested occasionally but documented records existed for Palm Island only. Leatherback nests were also rare; one definite activity was recorded for Richmond Beach on Union Island.            In National Reports prepared for the Western Atlantic Turtle Symposia, Morris (1984, 1987) identified several nesting beaches. Once again, these were considered predominantly hawksbill nesting beaches and included: Richmond Beach, Chateaubelair Bay, Petit Bordel Bay, Troumaca Bay, Cumberland Bay, Wallilabou Bay, Kerton's Bay, Peter's Hope Bay, Mount Wynne Bay, Lowman's Bay, Cablehut Bay, Brighton Bay, Stubbs Bay, Mt. Pleasant Beach, Biabou Bay, North Union Bay, Georgetown Bay, Orange Hill Bay, and Sandy Bay in St. Vincent (Figure 2a). In the Grenadines: North Bay on Baliceaux; Pasture and Obsidian bays on Mustique; Mahault, L'Anse Guyac, Friendship, South Glossy, Dallis, and Carenage bays on Canouan; Petit Tobac on Tobago Cays; Bloody, Miss Irene, Campbell, Raffal, Richmond Beach, Spring Beach and Chatham Bay on Union Island; and Frigate Island were reported as hawksbill nesting beaches (Figure 2b). Green turtles were also reported to nest in the Grena-dines on Frigate Island, as well as on Miss Irene, Campbell, Raffal, Richmond Beach, Spring Beach, and Friendship Bay. Leatherback nests were reported on St. Vincent at Richmond Beach, and at Brighton, Stubbs, Biabou, and Georgetown Bays. In June 1993, a leatherback was poached on Colonarie beach on the windward coast.            Recent qualitative surveys (January, April, July 1993) conducted by the present authors of the Grenadine islands of Mustique, Union, and Canouan revealed the following information (see Figure 2b for locations). Nesting of hawksbills used to occur regularly on Pasture, L'An-secoy, Macaroni, Plantain and Obsidian Bays in Mustique. One turtle fisherman interviewed was of the opinion that no nesting had occurred on Mustique since 1990. In Canouan, most people interviewed were of the opinion that the isolated Mahault Bay beach was the most important nesting beach, with Windward, Glossy, and Friendship bays also supporting occasional nesting. Nesting on these beaches is predominantly by hawksbills but greens, leatherbacks, and perhaps loggerheads were also reported to nest on Mahault beach. Occasional green turtle nesting was reported for Glossy Bay, and a nesting leatherback was killed on Grand Bay Beach in June 1993. All those interviewed acknowledged how few turtles now nest in Canouan compared to previous years. On Union Island, Richmond, Big Sand, and Raffal beaches were considered to still support some hawksbill nesting activity. Finally, informants report that nesting occurs (or once occurred) at Princess Margaret Beach in Bequia.            It is a strong  recommendation of this Recovery Action Plan  that comprehensive surveys be conducted on all the major islands of the country in order to determine which beaches are still used by sea turtles. While data cited above provide a starting point, without exception these data were obtained by interviewing fishermen and local residents. There is no guarantee that species have been consistently correctly identified, or that beaches which once supported sea turtles still support sea turtles. Further, we lack data entirely on the number of turtles that visit the islands each year, the number of nests laid, nest fate, and hatch success. We anticipate that the support of local residents can be solicited in this national effort, with persons living near sandy beaches (including hotel security personnel, who are often on duty through the night) agreeing to walk these beaches in the early morning (1 April - 30 November) and record evidence of nesting. With support from WIDECAST, training materials and informal workshops can be offered to assist in the identification of nesting crawls. After a period of two years, it should become clear which sandy beaches are used by sea turtles and which are relatively more important than others.            In the longer term, because it is neither possible nor necessary to systematically monitor (as opposed to simply survey) all sea turtle nesting beaches in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, it is a  recommendation of this Recovery Action Plan  that Index Beaches be selected for comprehensive study. These areas should encompass important nesting habitat for hawksbills and, to the extent possible, leatherback and green turtles. They should be monitored on a daily basis during the breeding season for nest and hatch success. At least one important nesting beach on each of the main islands should be selected as an Index Beach and protected from activities that compromise the suitability of the habitat to support sea turtle nesting. We suggest that the following beaches be designated for this purpose: Mahault Bay Beach (Canouan), Big Sand Beach (Union), and Pasture Bay and L'Ansecoy beaches (Mustique) (see section 4.291 for monitoring protocol). Additional field work is necessary before such recommenations can be made for St. Vincent and Bequia, although in the latter case Princess Margaret Beach appears a likely candidate.    Table of Contents                   4.12 Develop area-specific management plans                        It is essential that critical nesting beaches and foraging grounds are identified as soon as possible so that area-specific management can proceed. Specific conservation measures may differ among sites and range from designation of an area within which the disturbance or take of turtles and eggs is prohibited, to more elaborate solutions such as the establishment of a hatchery for eggs threatened by erosion, poachers, or animal predators. Visitors to nesting beaches should be supervised at night, lights should not shine on the beach, construction should be set back from the beach (and native vegetation preserved), recreational equipment (sailboats, chairs) should be removed from the beach so as not to obstruct nesting females or emerging hatchlings, beach sand mining restrictions should be vigorously enforced, and the construction of seawalls and jetties should be closely evaluated for negative impacts on resident or migrant sea turtles. In addition to details provided in sections 4.13 and 4.14 of this Recovery Action Plan, useful guidelines are available in the WATS Manual of Sea Turtle Research and Conservation Techniques (Pritchard et al., 1983).            The existing and proposed protected areas in St. Vincent and the Grenadines consist of water catchments, Forest Reserves, Wildlife Reserves, and Marine Conservation Areas (CCA/ IRF, 1991). Although there are no areas set aside for sea turtles specifically, there are 10 Marine Conservation Areas (also known as Fisheries Conservation Zones) designated under the Fisheries Regulations (1987) that include whole islands, island groups, or coastal segments where fishing is prohibited (Table 2; Figures 7a,b). There are also 20 Wildlife Reserves designated under the Wildlife Protection Act (1987) that protect whole islands or coastal areas on islands (Table 2; Figures 7c,d). Within Wildlife Reserves, all wildlife is protected year around. Some islands or coastal segments are designated as Marine Conservation Areas, as Wildlife Re-serves, and as proposed National Parks (e.g., Tobago Cays). Such a large area of the coast of St. Vincent and the Grenadines has been designated for reserves that it may actually hinder their successful establishment, both because of a lack of resources to establish all the areas, and because of the perception that the reserves may restrict other options for development (L. Ishmael, pers. comm.). It is a  recommendation of this Recovery Action Plan  that an early task of the National Parks Department (with advice from the National Parks Advisory Committee which is to be established under the National Parks Act) should be to review all areas that have been designated as reserves to reevaluate the justification for their designation and/or to prioritise them for establishment. It is a strong  recommendation of this Recovery Action Plan  that important sea turtle nesting or foraging habitat be considered in any prioritisation or re-designation process.            Most of the Fisheries Conservation Zones include sea turtle foraging habitat, and some include nesting habitat. Fishing is prohibited in all conservation areas. Anchoring is not specifically restricted in conservation areas. However, it is illegal to ""...destroy any flora or fauna other than fish"", which may make prosecution for anchoring on live coral an option. Legislation has also been drafted to make Mayreau and the Tobago Cays a Marine National Park. Although a management plan was written for this park that includes discussion of garbage and sewage disposal, the construction of an interpretive center on Union Island, etc. (Heyman et al., 1988), it has not been implemented. This is largely because the Fisheries Division, which has been assigned responsibility for management until a National Parks Department is established, is understaffed and personnel are not yet fully trained for effective park management. A priority for the Fisheries Division is to make the Tobago Cays Park a reality, and funding is being sought to send a staff member for training. In the meantime, 60 mooring buoys were placed around the Cays in April 1993 to minimise damage to the reefs caused by heavy yacht traffic.            The east coast of Canouan, including the nearshore waters within the Grand Cois barrier reef was recommended to be designated a National Park by Jackson et al. (1986). This area supports dense sea grass meadows and includes important nesting and foraging habitat for sea turtles. Mahault Bay on the uninhabited north coast is reported to be nesting habitat for leatherback, hawksbill, green, and perhaps loggerhead turtles. Interviews conducted for this Action Plan indicated that Mahault Bay beach is the best nesting beach on Canouan and perhaps one of the best nesting sites in the country. About two-thirds of the island of Canouan has recently been leased to a company for the development of an exclusive resort. The resort will have a ho-tel, low density luxury villas, and a 9-hole golf course. A hotel training college and a technical training college are also to be built (R. Charters, pers. comm., 1993). The developers were required to conduct an EIA prior to the initiation of Phase I, the results of which were favourable. Notwithstanding this EIA, it is a strong  recommendation of this Recovery Action Plan  that the developers be strongly encouraged to plan for the effective long-term protection of the extremely sensitive and virtually pristine nearshore communities and threatened wildlife such as sea tur-tles.            Of particular concern in the Canouan development is the construction of a golf course. The island has no natural source of freshwater, apart from rainwater. In order to meet the demands of the resort (including maintaining golf greens), a second desalination plant is to be built. Apart from irrigation, the golf course will require liberal use of herbicides and fungicides. Polluted run-off can be expected to damage nearshore marine communities unless water can be caught, channelled and recycled. While such development on Canouan may serve to reduce illegal catch of turtles on hitherto isolated beaches (and the potential reduction in poaching due to development is certainly welcomed), it is essential in light of the importance of Canouan (Carib for ""sea turtle"") as sea turtle nesting and foraging habitat that developers tailor their plans to safeguard nesting and foraging habitat. Guidelines for developments adjacent to important sea turtle nesting and foraging habitats are summarised in section 4.122.            In addition to public conservation areas and reserves, quasi-private reserves have also been established. The Mustique Company Limited Act (1989) makes the Mustique Company (the lease-holders of Mustique Island) custodians of the Mustique Conservation Area. The Conservation Area Regulations (1989) of the Act, expand the area of protection to the whole island and to a minimum of 1000 yd offshore. Fishing; taking of turtle eggs; destruction of beach vegetation; dredging; harvest or damage to corals; and disturbance, alteration or destruction of the natural environment is prohibited without written permission from the Company. Enforcement will be similar to that of regulations under the Fisheries Act 1986. It is a  recommendation of this Recovery Action Plan  that whenever this type of area-specific marine protection is legislated, full protection to all species of sea turtle be included. It is further our recommendation that private lease-holders be required to hire surveillance staff to enforce the terms of the lease; i.e., protection to coral reefs, turtles, etc. It is clear that fisheries personnel (who do not have powers of arrest) and under-staffed law-and-order police are not in a position to effectively enforce conservation legislation throughout the Grenadines.            In summary, it is essential that critical nesting beaches and foraging grounds be identified so that area-specific management can proceed. In particular, it is a  recommendation of this Recovery Action Plan  that management plans be developed for all designated Marine Conservation Areas and that park managers and wardens be sufficiently trained and equipped. At the very least, marker buoys should be put in place to advise the fishermen and yachtspeople of the boundaries of conservation areas, as well as signs which inform people of relevant restrictions. Fact sheets recently produced by the Ministry of Tourism for yachtspeople and by the Fisheries Division for fishermen are important steps in disseminating regulatory information. Finally, island lease-holders should be required to take sea turtles into account prior to development.    Table of Contents                           4.121 Involve local coastal zone authorities                                A recommendation of the Environmental Country Profile for St. Vincent and the Grenadines (CCA/IRF, 1991) was that there be an integrated approach to protected areas development. The proposed National Parks Act includes provision for the creation of a National Parks Department which will be responsible for management of national parks, including management plans and enforcement mechanisms. National Parks officers and members of the Police Force will be authorised to enforce the provisions of the Act as well as Fisheries regulations where Marine Conservation Areas fall within national park boundaries.             At present, the Fisheries Division is solely responsible for administering and managing Marine Conservation Areas. Under the proposed National Parks Act, it will also become responsible for overall management of marine national parks until the National Parks Department has been established and officers appointed. The Division currently lacks the financial re-sources and sufficient numbers of trained personnel to undertake additional responsibilities. The Division has put forward a reorganisation plan elevating it to a Department of Fisheries (CCA/ IRF, 1991). The proposal calls for the number of staff to be increased, and includes a management position responsible for conservation. It is a  recommendation of this Recovery Action Plan  that the Fisheries Division receive the resources and training necessary to strengthen its implementing capacity, especially given the additional responsibilities that may ensue following passage of the National Parks Act.                      4.122 Develop regulatory guidelines for management       areas                                A strong recommendation arising from the Country Environmental Profile for St. Vincent and the Grenadines (CCA/IRF, 1991), and a view shared by this Action Plan, is that a comprehensive coastal zone management plan be formulated to regulate development and encourage sustainable use of the coastal zone. Certainly in areas especially critical to the survival of remaining sea turtle stocks, regulatory guidelines need to be drafted and implemented to establish a framework within which appropriate land use and development (commercial, recreational, residential) can occur. Under the Town and Country Planning Act (1992), the Minister may make regulations in relation to the ""proper control of the height, density and setback"" of developments. At present, the standard setback requirement is 40 feet from the high water mark, although this may vary depending on the stability of the beach and its exposure (B. Browne, pers. comm.). The Fisheries Act (1986) also allows for the creation of implementing regulations, and agreements between the Government and island lease-holders (e.g., the Mustique Company Limited Act of 1989) may allow for the issuing of locally applicable controls (in consultation with the Government) to conserve, protect or maintain the environment. It is a  recommendation of this Recovery Action Plan  that the specific recommendations made below should be incorporated into regulations and guidelines.            In terms of nation-wide coastal development and attending regulatory guidelines, a system of zoning to protect sensitive areas should be designed. The country has already moved admirably in this direction with the designation of reserves and conservation areas (Table 2), as well as national parks pending under the proposed National Parks Act. Any regulations, in order to be effective, must be enforceable. This is problematic in St. Vincent and the Grenadines because of the extent of sovereign territory. Nevertheless, it is an issue that must be addressed. In many cases coastal zone management regulations, including recommendations discussed below which are particularly relevant to the conservation of endangered sea turtles, are common sense measures useful not only in defending important habitat for the benefit of sea turtles, but also ensuring that sensitive areas are properly safeguarded for the future.            1)  Sand mining : Commercial mining of beach sand should not be permitted under any circumstances (section 4.131). The persistent removal of beach sand disrupts stabilising vegetation, exacerbates erosion, and can eliminate nesting habitat. Mining pits invite injury to humans and livestock, and accumulate water to serve as breeding areas for mosquitoes and other unwanted insects. Mining sediments offshore should be carefully evaluated for potential effects on coastal beaches, since offshore material is essential for beach maintenance. Whenever possible, extraction sites should be limited to appropriate sites in the interior.            2)  Artificial lighting : Sea turtles, especially hatchlings, are profoundly influenced by light. Sea turtles freshly emerged from the nest depend largely on a visual response to natural seaward light to guide them to the ocean. In zones of coastal development, sources of artificial light distract hatchlings so that they turn away from the sea and crawl landward. It is essential that artificial light sources be positioned so that the source of light is not directly visible from the beach and does not directly illuminate areas of the beach; if lighting must be seen from the beach, it should emit wavelengths (560-620 nm) which are least attractive to sea turtles (Witherington, 1990). Low pressure sodium lights should be used to the maximum extent possible. Low intensity, ground-level lighting is encouraged. Nighttime and security lighting should be mounted not more than 5 m above the ground and should not directly illuminate areas seaward of the primary dune or line of permanent vegetation. No lighting, regardless of wavelength, should be placed between turtle nests and the sea.            Natural or artificial structures rising above the ground should be used to the maximum extent possible to prevent lighting from directly illuminating the beach/dune system and to buffer noise and conceal human activity from the beach. Improving dune height in areas of low dune profile, planting native or ornamental vegetation, or using hedges and/or privacy fences is encouraged. Barriers between 76-85 cm high are generally sufficient to block visual cues from artificial lights (Ehrenfeld, 1968; Mrosovsky, 1970). Ferris (1986) showed that a simple ""fence"" of black polyester material stretched between three posts and positioned between the nest and a lighthouse resulted in the hatchlings orienting correctly to the sea. Balcony lights should be shielded from the beach, decorative lighting (especially spotlights or floodlights) within line-of-sight of the beach should be prohibited, and safety/security lights should be limited to the minimum number required to achieve their functional roles (section 4.132).            3)  Beach stabilisation structures : Hard engineering options to beach protection, including impermeable breakwaters, jetties, groynes and seawalls positioned on the beach or in the nearshore zone, should be considered only as a last resort (section 4.133). Throughout the Caribbean region there are numerous examples of beaches lost, rather than secured, as a result of ar-mouring. Sandy beaches are naturally dynamic. The physical characteristics of the coastline should be taken into account prior to coastal construction so that adequate setbacks, rather than expensive and often counter-productive armouring, can be used to provide for the long-term conservation of the beach resource.            4)  Design setbacks : If development of land adjoining a sandy beach is planned, setback limits should be defined that reflect the damage likely to be caused to the beach and backshore environment during a major storm, and that take into consideration beach and backshore characteristics. Setbacks should provide for vegetated areas including lawns and dunes between hotels, homes and similar structures, and the beach proper. Coastal setbacks of ""at least 50 m"" from the line of permanent vegetation are recommended by CCA/IRF (1991) (section 4.133). Setbacks not only help to protect coastal properties from storm damage, but also reduce over-crowding of the shorezone, lessen the likelihood that local residents will be excluded from the beach, and enhance the probability that artificial lighting will not shine directly on the beach.            5)  Access : The use of motorised vehicles should be prohibited on beaches at all times and parking lots and roadways (including any paved or unpaved areas where vehicles will operate) should be positioned so that headlights do not cast light onto the beach at night. Driving on the beach creates unsightly ruts, exacerbates erosion, and lowers sea turtle hatch success by compacting nests (section 4.134). Tyre ruts also present a significant hazard to hatchlings crossing the beach. Where vehicles are needed to transport heavy fishing or recreational equipment, multiple access points should be provided and vehicles parked landward of the line of permanent vegetation. Pedestrian access to beaches should be confined to specific locations and strictly regulated so as to minimise destruction of the beach, including vegetation, by trampling.            6)  Waste disposal : No dumping should be permitted within the nearshore, beach, dune, or wetland environment of the shorezone. Such dumping as has already occurred should be subject to immediate cleanup. The fouling of beaches runs counter to the economic interests of both residents and commercial landowners. Litter can obstruct hatchlings on their journey to the sea, discarded glass and metal can injure turtles, and larger objects on the beach can prevent females from finding a nest site. Visitors should be required to take with them any garbage or other waste brought to or generated at the beach. Trash cans and regular pickup should be provided at all beaches. To the extent that beach cleanup is necessary, it should be done using hand tools (section 4.134).            7)  Vegetation cover and fires : All attempts should be made to preserve vegetation above the mean high tide mark. Creeping and standing vegetation stabilises the beach and offers protection against destructive erosion by wind and waves. The beach forest provides important nesting habitat for the hawksbill turtle and offers natural shielding for the beach from the artificial lighting of shoreline development (section 4.132). Fires, either for recreation or charcoal production, should be prohibited on beaches. Fires are a hazard to the surrounding dry forest, create unsightly scars, may scorch sea turtle eggs and hatchlings beneath the surface of the sand, and can disorient hatchlings. Cooking fires should be restricted to designated grill facilities.            8)  Marine pollution : The dumping of solid or chemical wastes into the sea should be pro-hibited under all circumstances. In addition to degrading the environment for residents and visitors alike, sea turtles often ingest tar, plastic, rope, and other substances (e.g., Mrosovsky, 1981; Balazs, 1985; Lutz and Alfaro-Schulman, 1991), presumably mistaking these for food, and become weakened or die. It is commonplace for sea turtles to confuse plastic bags with jellyfish and eat them. Polluted effluent from land-based sources should be appropriately treated before its discharge into the sea. Sewage treatment often involves the use of chemicals (e.g., chlorine) which are detrimental to the health of corals, and rarely removes nitrate and phosphate components which are detrimental to both corals and sea grasses. One option therefore is to lightly treat sewage and then deposit the effluent well offshore, away from delicate nearshore habitats. See sections 4.143 to 4.146.            9)  Anchoring and dredging : Anchor damage is a leading cause of destruction to sea grass meadows and coral reefs throughout the Wider Caribbean. It is essential that yachts and other boats be required to either anchor in designated sand bottom areas, or tie in at approved moorings in coral reef areas. Alternatively, vessels should be required to remain offshore, beyond the zone of living coral and sea grass. Dredging activities should be planned to minimize dam-age (i.e., sedimentation) to down current coral and sea grass. Severe disruption of the sea bed, especially in living sea grass and coral communities, can ruin actual or potential foraging areas for sea turtles, negatively affect the natural dynamics of the marine environment, and result in the loss of beach sand. See also section 4.147.            10)  Physical destruction of coral and sea grass : In the absence of the sheltering influence of offshore reefs, shorelines are often severely altered, resulting in great economic and environmental losses. Neither coral reefs nor algal ridges should be dynamited or dragged with chains in order to provide boat access. Anchoring should not occur in reef or sea grass areas (see above, and section 4.147). Divers should be thoroughly coached on diving etiquette so as to preclude trampling, collecting, and touching living coral. The practices of using chemicals or dynamite (sections 4.141, 4.142) for the purpose of stunning fish for harvest are prohibited under all circumstances. The destruction of coral reefs resulting from these practices can be irreversible in our lifetime.                      4.123 Provide for enforcement of guidelines in       management areas                                Enforcement of protected area status is problematic everywhere in St. Vincent and the Grenadines. Despite clear prohibitions against fishing, dredging, waste disposal, destruction of flora and fauna, and the construction of any structure ""on or over any land or waters within such a reserve"" (Fisheries Act, 1986, 22.(2)), it is well known that fishing occurs within established marine reserves and in some cases large-scale development is planned. For instance, sea grass beds off Ashton harbour in Union Island, where green turtles are reported to frequent (section 4.111), are likely to be adversely affected by the construction of a large marina (300 yachts). The development falls within a designated Marine Conservation Area (Ashton Bay Marine Re-serve) off the southeast coast of Union Island (Figure 6) and will involve extensive land reclam-ation that will effectively join Frigate Island to Union Island. Frigate Island itself is a Wildlife Reserve declared under the Wildlife Protection Act. It is a  recommendation of this Recovery Action Plan  that an active and effective central authority (such as the proposed National Parks Department) be inaugurated to manage parks and reserves and to advocate for their health and spatial integrity.            Effective enforcement of Fisheries legislation will involve the strategic placing of more personnel, especially in the Grenadines. At present there is only one Fisheries Extension Officer responsible for all the southern Grenadine islands (Union Island to Canouan); thus, it is too easy for legislation to be ignored. If it is not economically feasible to employ more full-time fisheries officers and extension officers in the Grenadines, then it is a  recommendation of this Recovery Action Plan  that a system of deputies (empowered by the Minister under fisheries leg-islation) be considered. Deputies could consist of senior and/or highly respected fishermen in their own islands, preferably with their own boats, who can supplement their income by working on a part-time basis for the Government. Older men may be more suitable, in that their experience and memory of turtle abundance in previous years will make them more aware of the need for conservation until populations can recover. It is important that they be well-respected people, since they will be enforcing legislation that controls the activities of their friends and families. A tendency to ""look the other way"" when friends or family are involved in illegal activities is a widespread problem in all small communities. A system that employs former turtle fishermen in sea turtle conservation activities, and their families in sea turtle related tourism activities has met with great success in Brazil (M. Marcovaldi, Projet Tamar, pers. comm., 1992). With regard to conditions imposed on beachfront construction projects, such as setbacks and lighting, a registered architect, professional engineer or other authority designated by the Gov-ernment should conduct a site inspection, including a night survey with all beachfront lights on.                      4.124 Develop educational materials for management areas                                It is important to the successful management of any protected area or conservation zone that educational materials be disseminated to the user public explaining the rules and regulations associated with the area. The Ministry of Tourism has produced a fact sheet for yachtspeople summarising the salient points that yachtspeople should know about conservation zones, including waste disposal and anchoring restrictions. Unfortunately, these leaflets do not discuss sea turtle legislation specifically. This information should be added for subsequent printings. The fact sheet is available at customs stations in Wallilabou, Kingstown, Bequia, Union Island, and Mustique. It is a  recommendation of this Recovery Action Plan  that the fact sheet be made more widely available by placement in beachfront restaurants heavily frequented by yachts-people. We further recommend that the conservation zones be demarcated with buoys as soon as possible. Where practical it would be useful to place explanatory signboards at selected sites, construct a pertinent display at the airport, or arrange for local guides to lead tours to protected areas to enable tourists to snorkel and learn about the marine environment.    Table of Contents                   4.13 Prevent or mitigate degradation of nesting beaches                                  4.131 Sand mining                                The chronic removal of sand from nesting beaches accelerates erosion and degrades or destroys beach vegetation by extraction or salt water inundation. In severe cases, saline ponds are formed in unsightly pits left by mining operations, shoreline trees are lost to the sea, and en-tire beach habitats are eliminated. With their loss, the coast's potential to support recreation, wildlife (sea birds, turtles), tourism, and commercial development is reduced. Transport trucks driving on the beach can also accelerate erosion, in addition to scarring the terrain. In the past, coastal sand mining was legal in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, but following passage of the Beach Protection Act (1981), it became illegal to remove sand without permission from the Minister of Agriculture. Unfortunately, regulations were never enacted and the legislation has not been enforced (CCA/IRF, 1991). Moreover, mining is still reported to occur on most isolated beaches with accessibility by road, including nesting beaches (e.g., Colonarie, St. Vincent). Sandstone has been exposed by extensive mining on the turtle nesting beach at Brighton Bay.            To relieve pressure on beaches, sand is imported from Trinidad and regulations have been drafted to restrict commercial mining to designated beaches (i.e., the Diamond and Brighton sand dunes, the Rabacca Dry River, and the Wallibou Dry River). No beaches in the Grenadines are to be designated for sand mining (B. Browne, pers. comm.). In the future, sand mining for construction purposes may be totally prohibited in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and instead sand will be imported from Guyana (OECS Sand Mining Project; B. Browne, pers. comm.). Sand mining is already prohibited in designated Marine Conservation Areas under the Fisheries Act (1986) and in areas under the jurisdiction of the Mustique Company Ltd. Act (1989); further, it will be prohibited under the proposed National Parks Act. Since illegal sand mining still occurs, it is a  recommendation of this Recovery Action Plan  that existing relevant legislation be strenuously enforced. If additional beaches are to be designated for mining under the Beach Protection Act, we urge that sea turtle nesting beaches be avoided (see Table 3).                      4.132 Lights                                Extensive research has shown that sea turtle hatchlings and adults orient from the nesting beach to the sea using light as an important cue. The open ocean horizon is typically considerably brighter than the landward horizon, which often consists of dense vegetation. Using the brightness differential between the land and the sea, the turtles are able to find the water even though, especially in the case of small hatchlings, they cannot see the waves. This orientation mechanism is very sensitive and can be fooled. Consequently, beach lighting (security lights, residential lights, commercial lights) can disorient hatchlings, leading them inland to be eaten by dogs, hit by passing vehicles, or to die in the morning sun. Artificial lighting can also persuade a nesting female to journey inland, or deter her from landing on the beach in the first place.             Fortunately, this does not appear to be a problem (yet) in St. Vincent and the Grena-dines. Beaches are usually not well lit, and many are completely undeveloped. However, development is inevitably going to occur on an increasing number of beaches, and it is essential that this issue be addressed at the time a developer is granted permission to construct. It is generally possible to incorporate ""turtle-friendly"" lighting into coastal development schemes. It is a  recommendation of this Recovery Action Plan  that the Planning Department be fully aware of the problem that beachfront lighting poses to endangered sea turtles and that they impose, in consultation with the developer, an acceptable scheme to preclude lights from shining on nesting beaches, at least from 1 June - 31 December (peak hatching seasons). The WIDECAST Country Coordinator has already been provided with background information on lighting solutions and WIDECAST will continue to make technical materials available to the Coordinator (to share with regulatory agencies) as they become available.            An absence of lighting is the best guarantee that hatchlings will safely find the sea. Where this is not an option, Witherington (1990) proposes several ""next-best"" solutions, including (1) time restrictions (lights extinguished during evening hours when hatching is most likely to occur; e.g., 1900-2300 hrs), (2) area restrictions (restrict beach lighting to areas of the beach where little or no nesting occurs; the effectiveness of this is diminished, however, since sources of light several km away can disrupt hatchling orientation), (3) motion sensitive lighting (sensor-activated lighting comes on only when a moving object, such as a person, approaches the light; this might be effective in low traffic areas), (4) shielding and lowering light sources (low intensity lighting at low elevations can be both attractive and adequate for most purposes; the glow can be shielded from the beach by ornamental flowering hedges or other barriers), (5) using low-pressure sodium vapor luminaires, which emit light in the 590 nm range (yellow) and do not attract hatchlings to the extent that full-spectrum white light does.            It is a  recommendation of this Recovery Action Plan  that owners of existing hotels as well as developers of new resorts on nesting beaches be targeted for education with regard to this potential problem. Letters should be mailed by the WIDECAST Country Coordinator, in collaboration with the Fisheries Division, to all beachfront restaurants and hotels asking that lights be appropriately modified to take sea turtles into account, nesting and hatching be reported, and the grounds be checked each morning to ""rescue"" hatchlings misoriented landward. In some cases it may be possible to station interested residents on the beach during the early evening hours to assist hatchlings to the sea. Even the simple act of shielding the crawling turtles from landward lights with a beach towel may enable them to get their proper bearings. The trek to the water is important, and hatchlings should not be placed directly in the sea but allowed to crawl unassisted towards the water.                      4.133 Beach stabilisation structures                                Most beaches are naturally dynamic. In order to protect commercial investments such as beachfront hotels, beach stabilisation typically involves the use of breakwaters, jetties, impermeable groynes, and/or seawalls. These structures are expensive and rarely effective in the long-term. Because they interfere with the natural longshore transport of sediment, the armouring of one beach segment can result in the ""starvation"" and eventual loss of other beach segments down-current. Stabilisation structures constructed parallel to the shore can hinder natural beach regeneration and prevent access by female sea turtles to the nesting beach. Groynes were built at Young Island and in the Calliaqua and Indian Bays, St. Vincent, following sand loss attributed to the passage of Hurricane Allen in 1980. While such structures are not widespread on the beaches in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, it is important that currents and other oceanographic features be carefully evaluated before permitting such structures. It is a  recommendation of this Recovery Action Plan  that hard engineering options to beach protection, such as breakwaters and groynes, be regarded only as a last resort and that solid structures, be disallowed in favour of permeable structures.             The better solution to beach maintenance is an enforced construction setback adequate to reduce or eliminate the risk of losing coastal buildings to routine erosion or violent storms. Because of the undeveloped nature of most of its coastline, St. Vincent and the Grenadines still has the potential to utilise coastal development control as a low cost solution to coastal erosion. If development of land adjoining a sandy beach is planned, it is a recommendation of this Recovery Action Plan that setback limits be defined that reflect the damage likely to be caused to the beach and backshore environment during a major storm, and that take into consideration beach and backshore characteristics. Setbacks should provide for vegetated areas, including lawns and dunes between hotels, homes and similar structures, and the beach proper. Setbacks of at least 50 m are recommended (as proposed by CCA/IRF, 1991). Setbacks not only protect properties from storm damage, but also reduce overcrowding of the shoreline and lessen the likelihood that local residents will be excluded from the beach. Making exceptions to setback regulations in Barbados has led to the disappearance of ""windows to the sea"" along the south and west coasts, reducing enjoyment of these areas by residents and visitors alike. It has also restricted public access to the beach for recreational and other purposes, such as hauling up boats for repair (J. Horrocks, pers. obs.).                      4.134 Beach cleaning equipment and vehicular use of       beaches                                Damage to incubating eggs (or hatchlings awaiting an evening emergence) is easily caused by compaction or puncture from mechanised beach cleaning techniques. If raking seaweeds by tractor or other heavy machinery is inevitable, it is a recommendation of this Recov-ery Action Plan that this activity be confined to beach zones below the mean high tide line in order to avoid the compaction of sand above incubating eggs. Repeated compaction will kill developing embryos and tyre ruts can trap hatchlings crawling across the beach to the sea. Fortunately, mechanical cleaning using heavy equipment is not done in St. Vincent and the Grenadines. Rather, hand-raking (typically to remove Casuarina needles and pods, leaf litter, etc.) is the normal procedure on beaches adjacent to hotels and there is no evidence that the cleaning effort is detrimental to incubating sea turtle eggs.            Beach-driving is not known to occur in St. Vincent and the Grenadines. In order to prevent future problems, it is a  recommendation of this Recovery Action Plan  that driving cars and trucks on sandy beaches be restricted to designated access points (see section 4.122(5)). Beach-driving exacerbates erosion and can uproot stabilising vegetation. Vehicle weight crushes eggs and can kill developing or newly hatched turtles. In addition, tyre ruts are unsightly and create hazards for hatchlings trying to reach the sea. The tiny turtles fall into the ruts, which generally run parallel to the sea, and because they cannot get out they die in the morning sun or become an easy meal for predators.                       4.135 Beach rebuilding projects                                Although many beaches along the south coast of St. Vincent, and several in the Grenadines have experienced mild to severe erosion over the last twenty years (CCA/IRF, 1991), beach rebuilding apart from groyne construction has not been attempted. If rebuilding is contemplated, it is a  recommendation of this Recovery Action Plan  that replacement sand be similar to that which was eroded, thereby maintaining the suitability of the beach for the incubation of sea turtle eggs. Sand brought to a beach from inland or offshore deposits is often of a different constitution (e.g., grain size, organic content). Experience in Florida, USA and elsewhere suggests that this sediment is easily compacted and can become useless for sea turtle nesting. Rebuilding should be confined to non-nesting or hatching seasons [N.B. this will depend on the species nesting; if hawksbills are expected, rebuilding activities should be planned for March-June]. Heavy equipment and activity can deter nesting and crush eggs, and the new overburden can prevent hatchlings from successfully digging out of the nest.             The presence of nearshore reefs and sea grass beds should also be taken into consideration, since increased sedimentation during the rebuilding activity may damage these habitats. Reefs are often an important source of future sand and protect the beach from wave action. Sea grass beds stabilise nearshore sediments. It is important these habitats not be threatened by beach rebuilding projects. Useful information regarding beach rebuilding in sea turtle nesting habitat can be obtained from the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, 19100 SE Federal Hwy, Tequesta, Florida 33469-1712 USA.    Table of Contents                   4.14 Prevent or mitigate degradation of marine habitat                                  4.141 Dynamiting reefs                                The use of explosives is forbidden under the Fisheries Act (1986). Section 24 reads, ""Any person who permits to be used, uses or attempts to use any explosive, poison or other noxious substance for the purpose of killing, stunning, disabling or catching fish or in any way rendering fish more easily caught; or carries or has in his possession or control any explosive, poison or other noxious substance for any of the purposes referred to in the preceding paragraph is guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding 2,500 dollars.""             According to persons interviewed for this Action Plan, the use of dynamite (typically in coral reefs) for fishing still occurs clandestinely in the Grenadines, though certainly to a lesser extent than in the past. It is a  recommendation of this Recovery Action Plan  that efforts be made to stop this illegal practice whenever and wherever it occurs. The destruction of coral reefs by explosives not only destroys forage and refuge for sea turtles, but also permanently diminishes the capacity of Vincentian waters to support local fishing industries. One of a series of new Fisheries Division posters informs fishermen that it is illegal to use explosives and poi-sons.    Table of Contents                           4.142 Chemical fishing                                The use of chemicals for the purpose of catching fish is illegal in St. Vincent and the Grenadines (see section 4.141). However, it has been reported that deliberate poisoning of St. Vincent (mainland) streams with Sevin (an insecticide) to catch fish and crayfish is widespread (CCA/IRF, 1991). Since polluted stream water ends up in the sea, it may have an adverse impact on nearshore reefs and sea grass beds. It is a  recommendation of this Recovery Action Plan  that the Fisheries Division make every effort to inform the public of the dangers of using poisons in stream and marine habitats, and of the penalties for violations.                      4.143 Industrial discharges                                It is known that effluent from the rum distillery at Georgetown on the east coast of St. Vincent is released into the Caratal river, and ultimately discharges into the sea. This area is not known for its coral reefs, but such effluent could otherwise damage the marine habitat. Other sources of industrial effluent include the coconut oil factory at Arnos Vale (south coast, Figure 5) and waste oil from the diesel power stations and motor vehicle repair garages. Effluent from these industries is discharged into rivers and storm drains and ultimately into the sea. Heated effluent is also released from the hydro-electric power station at Richmond, north of Chateaubelair, on the west coast. Campden Park industrial site reportedly dumps waste dyes and high nutrient wastes into Campden Park Bay (CCA/IRF, 1991). While not strictly industrial in nature, it is important to note that chlorine discharges from hotel swimming pools have probably affected the coral reefs in the Villa-Indian Bay area on the south coast of St. Vincent. It is a  recommendation of this Recovery Action Plan  that baseline surveys be undertaken in order to assess habitat quality in these areas. Of particular concern to sea turtles is the Campden Park Bay area. This area is relatively close to the Lowman's Bay area indicated by Morris (1984, 1987) as a hawksbill nesting site.             There are no known sites of industrial discharge in the Grenadines, although oil leaks from electricity generators reaching the sea are probably not uncommon.                      4.144 At-sea dumping of garbage                                Indiscriminate waste disposal is a widespread problem, both at sea and on land. According to CCA/IRF (1991), ""The proper collection and disposal of solid waste is perceived by many Vincentians, including members of the National Environmental Protection Task Force, to be the highest priority issue for improved environmental management in St. Vincent and the Grenadines.""            Inland dumping of garbage into rivers and streams results in such waste eventually getting into the marine environment. The problem is further complicated by the fact that this is a multi-island state. This means that there is frequent movement of ships between mainland St. Vincent and the islands of the Grenadines, and thus frequent disposal of litter into the sea. Such ships include not only locally owned vessels, but also foreign yachts and cruise liners. St. Vincent and the Grenadines is not alone in this problem; the volume of garbage released into the Wider Caribbean annually by ships, as well as by landfills, general litter, and river transport, is enormous. Fortunately the issue is receiving international attention, prompting governments to implement and support public awareness campaigns, as well as the enforcement of anti-dumping laws. The current OECS Solid Waste Management project will hopefully address these issues. The disposal at sea of plastic bags and discarded fishing gear (line, netting) is particularly harmful to sea turtles, as the bags are mistaken for jellyfish and ingested and the turtles (and other sea creatures) become entangled in the abandoned fishing gear.            The Department of Tourism issues flyers to visitors and inter-island travellers, promoting the proper disposal of garbage. In 1992, the Government passed an Anti-Litter Act (1992); however, enforcement is problematic and improper disposal of garbage continues. Much of the litter dumped at sea returns to the beaches. As a result, beach clean-ups are very important. The Youth Environment Service (YES Club) formed as part of the UNEP effort in collaboration with the JEMS Progressive Youth Organisation has organised beach clean-ups on some south coast beaches near their base in Stubbs. It is hoped that more of these YES clubs will be formed in the secondary schools throughout the country to complement this effort. It is a  recommendation of this Recovery Action Plan  that YES clubs integrate their clean-ups with the International Coastal Clean-up Campaign of the Center for Marine Conservation. In this way, the important information collected can be included in an international database. The WIDE-CAST Country Coordinator (Nigel McA. Scott, P. O. Box 1584, Kingstown) has literature on this subject; further information can be obtained by writing the Center for Marine Conservation, International Beach Clean-up Campaign, 1725 DeSales Street, Washington D. C. 20036 USA.                      4.145 Oil exploration, production, refining,       transport                                There are no known offshore oil deposits in St. Vincent and the Grenadines. However, tar ball deposits have been observed on some beaches. Possible sources include oil tankers washing out their holds at sea, or the washing out of onshore storage tanks located on the south coast of St. Vincent. International cooperation is needed to address the issue of pollution from tankers transporting oil and related products through our waters. At present there is no National Oil Spill Contingency Plan. Since the country is near major oil transportation routes of tankers leaving Trinidad and Tobago and Venezuela, the risk of a spill is high. Indeed, there was a minor oil spill in the region of the Grenadines in early 1993 that resulted in oiled beaches on Mustique. An oil tanker washing out its hold at sea was suggested by some as a possible source of the oil. The Mustique Company Ltd., lease-holders of Mustique, undertook the responsibility of cleaning the beaches. Tar-ball fouling is also very common along windward beaches in St. Vincent and the Grenadines (e.g., Windward Bay, Canouan). It is a  recommendation of this Recovery Action Plan  that a contingency plan be drawn up to cope with a serious spill, and that efforts be made to prosecute offending oil tankers using ""fingerprinting"" of tar balls, perhaps at the National Hydrology Research Institute, Saskatchewan, Canada.                      4.146 Agricultural run-off and sewage                                This is a problem, particularly on mainland St. Vincent. The country's economy has an agricultural base, with bananas being the chief crop. Marketing pressures on this crop to maintain high quantity and quality yields has led to increases in cultivated land area and increased use of pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers. This in turn has resulted in farmers cultivating nearer to rivers and streams, and in the process clearing away previously virgin land. Bananas do not have a very extensive root system and so offer poor soil holding ability. This has meant an increased amount of sediment and chemical run-off into rivers and streams, ultimately running into the sea. This problem is not likely to be remedied soon, as the pressure on the industry will surely be maintained and there are ongoing efforts to bring about agricultural diversification. Since severe damage to nearshore ecosystems is possible as a result of the increasing use of agricultural poisons, it is a  recommendation of this Recovery Action Plan  that monitoring programmes, perhaps as part of a national water quality programme, be implemented.             Sewage treatment in St. Vincent and the Grenadines is an unmet challenge. At present, only some parts of downtown Kingstown and about 40 houses in the Arnos Vale suburbs are sewered (CCA/IRF, 1991). Most households use water closets with a soakaway. In the case of sewered areas, no sewage treatment is done. Raw sewage is pumped directly into the sea; the outfall pipe at Old Women's Point (Kingstown harbour) has been broken twice by storms (Figure 5). Although no studies have been done, there are apparently strong currents in the Kingstown harbour which disperse the effluent from the system quickly (CCA/IRF, 1991). How well sewage effluent disperses from the Arnos Vale area is unknown. The problem of sewage disposal is particularly serious in the Grenadines, where increasing numbers of hotels are being constructed in pristine areas. Already the effects are being felt; e.g., Clifton Harbour (Union) is ""dead"", partly because of sewage, yacht waste, and other effluents (J. Daudin, pers. comm., 1993). With increased population densities and an increased emphasis on coastal tourism, solutions to the problem need to be sought. It is a  recommendation of this Recovery Action Plan  that water quality and habitat quality in nearshore waters be monitored on a routine basis, particularly in regard to the negative effects of untreated sewage on public health and on the health of nearshore marine communities, and that an environmentally-sound sewage disposal strategy be identified and implemented as soon as possible.                      4.147 Others (anchoring and land reclamation)                                A large number of yachts visit the islands every year and damage has been done to reefs due to careless anchoring by yachts and dinghies, especially in the Tobago Cays. The systematic demolition of coral by heavy anchors severely degrades potentially important sea turtle foraging and resting habitats. The damage and threat of damage to the spectacular reefs in the Tobago Cays has led to the placement of 60 permanent moorings. Unfortunately, there are no enforcement authorities on site to ensure that people use the moorings and there are no mooring fees to support the system. It is a  recommendation of this Recovery Action Plan  that a nation-wide system of moorings be developed. Inexpensive and effective mooring systems are currently available (see Halas, 1985). In the British Virgin Islands, Eckert et al. (1992) describe how local dive operators raised the money necessary to install more than 200 Halas-type moorings, donated time and labour toward the installation, and took the lead in drafting supporting legislation. User fees are paid directly to the BVI National Parks Trust and are earmarked for mooring maintenance, as well as conservation and law enforcement in sensitive marine areas. Moorings are not only vital to the protection of coral reef habitat, but can also provide much-needed revenue in support of protected areas. Low-flying private aircraft frequently fly between the islands of St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and it may be possible to devise a scheme whereby pilots report yachts not using moorings in protected areas to relevant enforcement authorities.            Land has been reclaimed and the sea floor dredged in Bequia and Union Island to facilitate the building of an airport and the extension of a runway, respectively. In the case of Bequia, coral reefs and sea grass beds in the area were destroyed (see section 3.1). Apparently a preliminary study had suggested that the reefs and sea grass beds were already dead. However, this was not the case and these important habitats have now been lost. It is not clear how the new airport will affect current movements or other oceanographic features, and hence any adjacent beaches. Reclamation on a large scale is planned in the process of building the marina, golf course and residences at Ashton Harbour in Union Island. This construction will probably impact negatively on the sea grass beds off Ashton and any nesting on Frigate Island. Land rec-lamation has serious environmental implications and, as is the case with any large-scale development in an environmentally sensitive area, it is a  recommendation of this Recovery Action Plan  that a thorough EIA be conducted before permission to reclaim land is given.    Table of Contents             4.2 Manage and Protect all Life Stages                  In addition to managing and protecting habitat, it is necessary to improve national legislation that presently offers only partial protection to sea turtles. In this section, existing legislation will be reviewed and changes proposed to promote the recovery of depleted sea turtle stocks. Since sea turtles are highly migratory by nature, international efforts are also needed; these are discussed in section 4.3. In particular, with regard to international law, it is important that the Government rescind its ""reservation"" on international trade in hawksbill products under the CITES treaty (section 4.31).    Table of Contents                   4.21 Review existing local laws and regulations                        The Fisheries Regulations (1987, Section 17 and schedule 10), stipulate that it is illegal for any person to:        (a)  disturb, take, sell, purchase or have in his possession any turtle eggs;    (b)  interfere with any turtle nest; or    (c)  take, sell, purchase or have in his possession any under-sized turtle;    (d)  sell, purchase, or have in his possession the shell of an under-sized turtle;    (e) take, sell, purchase or have in his possession any turtle or part thereof during the   period of a close season for       that species of turtle (1   March - 31 July).          Minimum weights for sea turtles (schedule 10) are as follows:      1. Leatherback turtle ( Dermochelys   coriacea ) -- 350 lb (158 kg)  2. Green turtle ( Chelonia   mydas ) -- 180 lb (81 kg)  3. Hawksbill turtle ( Eretmochelys   imbricata ) -- 85 lb (38 kg)  4. Loggerhead turtle ( Caretta   caretta ) -- 160 lb (72 kg)            The penalty upon conviction for a first offence is a fine not exceeding EC$ 5,000. There is no provision for the confiscation of gear used in an offence. Most turtles are caught using turtle nets and spearguns. Tangle (trammel) nets are prohibited (see section 3.4), but single layered, large mesh (4-inch) gillnets set for turtles are not. Speargun use is prohibited ""without first having obtained written permission from the Minister"" (Fisheries Regulations, 1987, Section 21). This regulation is, however, not enforced and speargun use is widespread and essentially unregulated.            The Wildlife Protection Act of 1987 prohibits hunting in designated Wildlife Reserves (see Table 2) without a license. ""Hunting"" is defined as seeking, stalking, shooting at, killing, wounding, pursuing, capturing, or molesting by any method. The penalty upon conviction for a first offence is a fine not to exceed EC$ 2,000. The penalty upon conviction for a second or subsequent offence is a fine not to exceed EC$ 4,000 or imprisonment for a term of one year, or both. Wildlife Protection Officers may also seize any equipment, including boats, which they have reasonable cause to suspect was used in connection with commission of the offence. Several Wildlife Reserves (e.g., Prune (=Palm) Island, Petit St. Vincent) encompass sea turtle nesting beaches. Thus it appears that sea turtles are fully protected at all times of the year while within the confines of Wildlife Reserves (e.g., on reserve beaches). This interpretation has never been tested in court.    Table of Contents                   4.22 Evaluate the effectiveness of law enforcement                        Law enforcement agencies do not have the personnel necessary to properly enforce the environmental legislation in this multi-island state. This is particularly true for enforcement of Fisheries legislation. There are no wardens to patrol beaches and word of a turtle catch may reach authorities long after the turtle has been butchered. Also, there are so many secluded beaches that no one need know when or where a turtle was butchered. This problem is compounded in the Grenadines. Since enforcement is largely in the hands of police officers who are also charged with maintaining general law and order, it is unlikely that the presently under-staffed agencies will be able to offer effective enforcement. A lack of understanding about the need to conserve marine resources and an unwillingness to prosecute low-income offenders may be contributing factors to inadequate enforcement.            It is clear that in order to have more effective law enforcement, more resources need to be channeled to the appropriate agencies. Many Caribbean countries have game wardens, fisheries officers, or other natural resource enforcement personnel. While understaffing is a persistent problem, the presence of these officers means that natural resource law is enforced to a greater degree than if over-worked public law and order officers are forced to dedicate time and energy to beach patrol, sea patrol, and other activities necessary to adequately protect sea turtles and their habitats (curb sand mining, reduce marine dumping, enforce mooring rules, etc.). In addition to enforcement personnel, equipment, especially sea-worthy boats to make the rough inter2Disland crossings characteristic of the Grenadines, is badly needed. The Fisheries Division presently has only two boats, one on the mainland and one in the southern Grenadines.            To augment efforts of law enforcers, public awareness campaigns might be very effective in encouraging people to report violations, and the media should give the issue more attention as well. To address the challenge at the institutional level, we recommend that a Division of Environmental Enforcement be created (section 4.24).    Table of Contents                   4.23 Propose new regulations where needed                        Wildlife management laws and regulations pertaining to sea turtles must reflect biological realities. The Fisheries Regulations (1987) do not reflect a current understanding of sea turtle biology and do not respond to the needs of diminishing sea turtle numbers in St. Vincent and the Grenadines. Traditional management view has focussed on the protection of small turtles, permitting harvest only after they have attained a certain size (see section 4.21). Biologists now suggest that sea turtles, like most long-lived organisms, should be managed in just the opposite way (e.g., Crouse et al., 1987; Frazer, 1989). Sea turtle population structure is like a pyramid, with thousands of young turtles at the bottom and only one or two adult turtles at the top. As turtles age (become larger and more armoured), fewer of them succumb to predation. The very few which reach adulthood are in a position to survive for decades, during which time they will produce the thousands of eggs necessary to ensure that, in turn, a sufficent number of turtles in the next generation will survive to maturity.            There are two major deficiencies in the laws as they are now written; first, the closed season does not encompass the breeding season and second, large juveniles and adult turtles (the most important size classes to protect; see sections 4.232 and 4.233) are fair game during the open season. Furthermore, it is necessary to question the wisdom of any continued harvest of migratory species which are clearly declining throughout the Wider Caribbean region. It is a  recommendation of this Recovery Action Plan  that a moratorium be implemented on the capture and sale of sea turtles and their products until such time as there is sufficient information to show that a regulated harvest will not compromise the sustainable recovery of depleted sea turtle stocks [N.B. a ""total moratorium"" was also recommended in CCA/IRF, 1991]. Interim legislation, if needed, is described in section 4.232. In addition, regulations to conserve important breeding and feeding grounds are necessary (see section 4.14).                      4.231 Eggs                                It is illegal to take sea turtle eggs or to disturb a nest (see section 4.21). What is needed is consistent and effective enforcement of existing statutes.                      4.232 Immature turtles                                Considering the decline in sea turtle populations around St. Vincent and the Grenadines, it is a strong  recommendation of this Recovery Action Plan  that all species of sea turtles be protected for a period of time sufficient to allow populations to return to sizes at which they can be harvested sustainably. If a total ban is politically impossible at the present time, we propose two interim options which, while not likely to promote the recovery of depleted stocks in the long-term, will provide an improvement over the current situation. The first is a far better option than the second.  In both cases, the harvest is restricted to green turtles .         Option 1: total protection for all species whilst nesting; total protection for   hawksbills; closed season to encompass the peak breeding season for all species (1   April-30 November); maximum size limit of 60 cm (24 in) shell length for green turtles   during the open season; retain full protection for eggs; single layered, large mesh   (4-inch) turtle nets legal (nets should be checked often and set so that turtles can   surface to breathe, and protected species and size classes can be released unharmed).     Option 2: total protection for all species whilst nesting; total protection for   hawksbills; retain existing closed season (1 March-31 July); remove size limits during the   open sea- son; retain full protection for eggs; single layered, large mesh (4-inch) turtle   nets legal (see Option 1).               We emphasise that banning the catch of hawksbills is a crucial step toward recovery of this species. The decline in hawksbill numbers has been most noticeable to fishermen. The meat is not particularly favoured, Japan placed a zero quota on the import of hawksbill shell as of 1 January 1993, and sale of shells to French-flag vessels passing through the Grenadines is already illegal (since France is a full signatory to CITES). With regard to green turtles, reversing the size limit is not only biologically sensible, but to some extent reflects the realities of the harvest. Discussions with spear-fishermen suggest that the bulk of green turtles currently taken are below 60 cm curved shell length. Adult green turtles are relatively rare in nearshore waters. Thus, our suggestion to impose a maximum size limit will not severely impact upon the activities of those who make up the bulk of fishermen still actively targeting turtles (i.e., the spear-fishermen).  We emphasise that these options are suggested as interim measures only, while the fishing community prepares for a full moratorium .            The success of measures to promote the recovery of sea turtles is contingent upon the strict enforcement of protective measures outlined above. All efforts at environmental education, enhancing the effectiveness of law enforcement, and offering alternatives for fishermen should be with the objective of weaning people from dependence on harvesting these endangered species, at least for a period of time sufficient to allow population recovery. The time has also come for people to appreciate the value of living sea turtles to the country's developing tourist industry. Furthermore, the support of St. Vincent and the Grenadines in strictly conserving remaining sea turtle stocks is important to the Caribbean community of nations as a whole, many of which have already pledged a similar commitment. If turtles are protected in one nation but plundered in another (remembering that turtles are highly mobile), then serious conservation efforts may ultimately come to naught.                      4.233 Nesting females                                  It is estimated that fewer than one percent of hatchlings will survive to maturity some 20-40 years later (age at sexual maturity depends on the particular species; the herbivorous green turtle appears to be the slowest growing species). Natural mortality is high, especially in the youngest age classes. In contrast, once a sea turtle reaches adulthood, he or she is fully armoured and quite a formidable opponent for any natural predator. Survival in adult turtles has been shown to be very high; in other words, the probability that an adult turtle will die of natural causes during the reproductive years is low. As a result, adult turtles, which represent several years of selective survival, are expected to live a long time and produce many thousands of eggs. This is the natural cycle of life for sea turtles. The female has to produce at least enough eggs to replace herself and a mate, or the population will eventually go extinct.             When man preferentially harvests the large turtles, he is doing the worst possible thing for the survival of sea turtles. It is imperative that breeding-age turtles be fully protected. If adult turtles are not adequately protected, the declining populations around St. Vincent and the Grenadines will never recover to their former abundance. Measures to protect habitat and nests are very important, but the protection of adults and large juveniles (see also section 4.232) are also essential. Although legislation protects nesting females during the closed season (1 March - 31 July), there is no protection for nesting females at other times of the year. Given the tremen-dous importance of nesting females to the maintenance of populations, it is a  recommendation of this Recovery Action Plan  that regulations be enacted to protect them on the beach at all times. In the interim before a year-around ban can be enacted, it is further recommended that the existing closed season (March 1 - July 31) be changed to reflect the peak nesting seasons of species present in St. Vincent and the Grenadines (i.e., 1 April - 30 November). At present, peak hawksbill breeding season (reportedly September-October) lies entirely within the open season!                      4.234 Unprotected species                                Fisheries regulations presently cover all species of sea turtles known to nest in St. Vincent and the Grenadines.    Table of Contents                   4.24 Augment existing law enforcement efforts                        Several laws, including the Fisheries Act, Wildlife Protection Act, and proposed National Parks Act, have provisions for the Minister to deputise Officers within the Ministry (or hire enforcement personnel) to enforce regulations. However, primarily because of funding constraints, which are particularly acute for administration of the Fisheries Act, sufficient numbers of officers have not been appointed. Creative approaches to augment official law enforcement capacities are greatly needed. People in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, particularly fishermen and residents in the Grenadines, are very aware of the legislation protecting sea turtles. They are generally supportive of this legislation, especially in light of the declining sea turtle populations. Public involvement in law enforcement is, however, limited. There are persons who live near beaches who sometimes monitor nesting activities, but in the main Vincentians believe that law enforcement is a job for law enforcement officers, not the public. Education is the key to provide information and encourage more public support and involvement. The role of the media will be critical here. The introduction of game wardens or other natural resource enforcement personnel would also be an asset.            Environmental law is becoming increasingly important and increasingly technical in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, as is the case throughout the eastern Caribbean. Therefore, consideration might be given to the creation of a Division of Environmental Enforcement be created within an appropriate Ministry. This initiative could be integrated into the highly visible Government declaration of the 1990's as the 'Decade of the Environment' in St. Vincent and the Grenadines. Division officers should be specifically trained in environmental law and enforcement procedures and be responsible for regulations concerning mining and minerals, pollution, protected species, fisheries and marine resources, boater safety, game and hunting, coastal zone permits and compliance, etc. Officers would logically coordinate closely with other wardens and officers having enforcement responsibility for conservation zones and other protected areas. One option to ensure adequate coverage of the entire territory is to station extension/enforcement officers on each of the major islands. Island offices will need reliable access to marine vessels and other essential transport.             As an alternative to creating a new Division, four officers could be selected from within the Royal St. Vincent and the Grenadines Police Force. These officers would remain part of the police corps, but would be trained as focal points for the investigation of crimes against environmental statutes. Another alternative might be for Government to hire older, respected fishermen to serve as conservation wardens in their islands of residence (see section 4.123). In order to facilitate enforcement of environmental legislation by Police, Customs, Immigration, and other relevant agencies, it is a  recommendation of this Recovery Action Plan  that a concise yet comprehensive manual of existing environmental legislation be developed for public distribution. Finally, divers, fishermen, and other residents should be encouraged to participate in law enforcement. Coastal residents are in unique positions to monitor out-of-season catches, capture of protected species, and offshore damage to habitats  inter alia .    Table of Contents                   4.25 Make fines commensurate with product value                        The fine for contravention of Fisheries Regulations is up to EC$ 5,000. If enforced, the penalty would be a serious deterrent to most fishermen. It could be made even more of a deterrent by stipulating the confiscation of gear (e.g., vehicles, boats, spearguns, nets), as well.    Table of Contents                   4.26 Investigate alternative livelihoods for turtle     fishermen                        Although no one makes a living exclusively from capturing turtles, turtle meat brings important income to some fishermen in the Grenadines who sell the catch to hotel restaurants. Furthermore, the meat offers variety in the diet for people in the Grenadines. Alternative sources of protein often have to be imported and therefore require greater income. However, it is important for fishermen to understand that  living  sea turtles can also be an important revenue-generating resource. As the islands attract more long-stay tourists, former turtle fishermen could lead tourists on tours of important beaches (e.g., Mahault Bay on Canouan, or Big Sand on Union Island). Monitoring of both nesting and foraging populations of turtles will benefit greatly from the involvement of fishermen, and their funded participation should be considered in any management programme.    Table of Contents                   4.27 Determine incidental catch and promote the use of TEDs                        There is no local or foreign shrimping in the waters of St. Vincent and the Grenadines. Commercial trawling does not therefore pose a threat to sea turtles locally and there is no need to promote (domestically) the use of ""turtle excluder devices"" (TEDs). However, trawling elsewhere in the region may threatened conservation measures imposed in St. Vincent and the Grenadines. Since sea turtles visiting our country are vulnerable to drowning in shrimp nets when they venture into the territorial waters of trawling nations, it must be a  recommendation of this Recovery Action Plan  that the Government support measures to encourage trawling nations to use TEDs in their shrimp fleets. A recent study concluded that shrimp trawling killed more turtles in the USA than all other man-induced sources of mortality (National Research Council, 1990). Shrimp trawlers operating in U. S. waters are now required to use TEDs in their nets (Crouse, 1993).            Long-liners operating in St. Vincent and the Grenadines' waters are known to accidentally catch leatherback turtles. In 1992 a leatherback was brought into Kingstown for sale by a long-line vessel. The turtles are apparently attracted to the bait and lightsticks attached to the lines. Similarly, the capture of leatherbacks by long-lines is well documented in the eastern Caribbean (Cambers and Lima, 1990; Tobias, 1991; Fuller et al., 1992), the southeastern U. S. (Witzell, 1984), and the Gulf of Mexico (Hildebrand, 1987). It is a  recommendation of this Recovery Action Plan  that the extent to which long-line vessels capture sea turtles in the waters of St. Vincent and the Grenadines be determined as soon as possible. Data sheets should be provided to captains by the Fisheries Division and reporting should be mandatory in order to qualify for a fishing licence [N.B. under the Fisheries Act (1986), the Minister can ""vary any special conditions attached to any fishing licence.""]. Mitigating measures should be imposed should incidental capture be reported.    Table of Contents                   4.28 Supplement reduced populations using management     techniques                        Identifying and protecting important foraging areas and natural beaches (section 4.11), revising fisheries legislation to include a moratorium on the harvest of sea turtles and their eggs (section 4.23), and initiating long-term population monitoring programmes on selected Index Beaches (section 4.291) are considered by this Recovery Action Plan to be the highest national management priorities. Second priority should be placed on identifying threatened nesting or foraging populations that would benefit from specific, hands-on initiatives. Implementing management options such as moving eggs threatened by erosion, poaching, or predators, or establishing a hatchery for the secure incubation of eggs should be undertaken as needed with advice of sea turtle experts and pursuant to management techniques described in Pritchard et al. (1983).            An individual sea turtle has the capacity to lay thousands of eggs in her lifetime, yet the probability that a given egg will lead to the production of a mature female is less than one percent. Many hundreds of hatchlings must enter the sea for each female that survives to adulthood. Recognising that there will continue to be productivity losses to predators, erosion, natural levels of infertility, etc., it is important that Government take quick steps to protect eggs from ongoing, illegal consumption by humans. Where necessary to protect eggs from poachers or predators, fenced hatcheries may have to be considered. However, hatcheries should be used only if absolutely necessary. The artificial incubation of eggs and the improper handling of eggs and hatchlings can be disastrous. Incubation temperature is largely responsible for determining hatchling sex, so any attempt to artificially incubate eggs may skew the normal sex ratio of the nest.            The occasional erosion-prone nest should be relocated to a safe place on the natural beach. The decision to do so should be made at the time of egg-laying. If eggs are moved after the first 24 hr, the risk is high of dislodging the tiny embryo from the inner lining of the eggshell and killing it. Sometimes a compromise has to be made. If, for example, eggs are being washed away, such as by a storm surge, an attempt to salvage the clutch is prudent. There may be a steep decline in the hatch success of the rescued nest, but this would be preferable to a total loss. Eggs should always be handled with great care and reburied on a natural beach, preferably the one where the female made the original nest. The new nest should be dug to the same depth as the original nest and in the same type of habitat (open beach vs. beach forest) so that the temperature of incubation is not altered. Hatchlings should always be allowed to emerge from the nest naturally and traverse the beach unaided as soon as they emerge.    Table of Contents                           4.281 Sea turtle mariculture                                At the present time there is no need to consider farming, ranching, or headstarting (raising turtles for about one year and then releasing them) as conservation or management options in St. Vincent and the Grenadines. Mariculture projects are expensive, requiring elaborate facilities and trained husbandry and veterinary staff. Keeping hatchlings in captivity for a time before releasing them (ostensibly to ""protect"" them from predators) is especially counter-productive. It is possible that these young turtles will never properly ""imprint"" on their natal beaches (and thus will not return to nest as adults on our beaches), that their physiological and muscular development will be compromised by being raised in a tank or other small enclosure, and/or that they will not participate fully in the complex life cycle that, for most species, involves an epi-pelagic (i.e., surface-dwelling in the open sea) stage lasting from one to several years after leaving the nesting beach. Long-term headstarting projects in Florida and Texas (USA) with green turtles and Kemp's ridleys, respectively, have recently been terminated because there was no evidence that the programmes were benefiting wild populations (Huff, 1989; Williams, 1993; Byles, 1993).            There are no functioning sea turtle ranches in the western Hemisphere (except perhaps in Cuba?). Using the CITES definition, a ""ranch"" is any operation that relies on wild-caught animals or eggs taken from natural beaches and rears them to an appropriate slaughter size (Dodd, 1982) [N.B. a sea turtle ""farm"", on the other hand, is a closed-cycle system such as the Cayman Turtle Farm on Grand Cayman, BWI]. As with any harvest-based scheme, Government should be responsible for accurately determining a sustainable yield so that the ranching initiative does not result in declines in wild populations. In attempting to set a harvest quota, the declining trend in sea turtle populations should be taken into account. With sea turtles already endangered in the Wider Caribbean region (Groombridge, 1982) and nearly everywhere declining, it is not intuitively clear what benefit could be gained by a commercial harvest. As stated earlier (see section 4.23), it is a  recommendation of this Recovery Action Plan  that a moratorium be implemented on the harvest of sea turtles until such time as there is sufficient information to show that a regulated harvest will not compromise the sustainable recovery of depleted wild stocks.            The ""Sea Turtle Conservation Strategy"" adopted by the 1979 World Conference on Sea Turtle Conservation concludes that until definitive answers to questions concerning the impact of commercial turtle culture (farming and ranching) on prices of turtle products, on the creation of new markets, on the capture of turtles from wild populations, and on the trade in products derived from wild-caught sea turtles are forthcoming, the following cautions are necessary: (a) commercial mariculture must be in conformity with all applicable conservation regulations and laws, whether local, national, regional or international, (b) care should be taken that special legal provisions and exemptions for farmed [or ranched] products are not misused by importers and exporters, (c) any effort by commercial mariculture interests to develop markets for new turtle products or to create demand for turtle products where it did not previously exist is insupportable, and (d) the establishment of new commercial mariculture operations must be discouraged until it is certain that such operations will not cause, directly or indirectly, a further decline in turtle populations.            In an earlier treatise, Schulz (1975) described how difficult it would be to assign sustainable harvest quotas (such as would be necessary to provide stock for a sea turtle ranch) because sea turtles are highly migratory. In the absence of data on the long-distance journeys of ""Vincentian turtles"", how can it be known that harvest in our waters will not compromise conservation initiatives in neighbouring countries? Further, how can ""sustainable"" quotas be set when we cannot define even the most basic demographic features (e.g., age distribution, total reproductive output, life span, survivability) of Vincentian sea turtle populations? Answers, even crude answers, to these complex questions are presently unavailable. With this in mind, it is important that the Government of St. Vincent and the Grenadines clearly define why sea turtle mariculture (in any form) is a relevant conservation or economic strategy in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and equally important that the Government be cautious of domestic or foreign commercial interests that may seek to make farming or ranching sound more appropriate or relevant for specific conservation or economic needs in St. Vincent than it is likely to be.    Table of Contents                   4.29 Monitor stocks                                  4.291 Nests                                While some beaches are traditionally known for nesting activity, no comprehensive programme has ever been carried out to monitor the breeding effort. Such a programme is essential to evaluate the effectiveness of conservation measures, including new legislation proposed in section 4.23 [N.B. positive results may not be seen right away, however, since eggs protected today are not likely to mature into breeding adults for two decades or more]. This cannot be achieved without monitoring the number of females nesting each year and the number of nests laid. In addition, it is not possible to effectively design management and conservation programmes if the problems facing nesting turtles on different beaches are not adequately defined. The solutions may differ depending on whether the dominant threat to nests and incubating eggs is erosion, poaching, domestic dogs, litter, vehicular traffic on the beach  inter alia .             Since it is neither practical nor necessary (at least from a data collection perspective) to monitor all sandy beaches, it is a  recommendation of this Recovery Action Plan  that Index Beaches be selected for long-term study. We suggest Mahault Bay (Canouan), Big Sand (Union), and Pasture Bay and L'Ansecoy (Mustique) [N.B. baseline field work is still needed in St. Vincent, Bequia, and the smaller Grenadine Islands in order to identify the most important nesting beaches there]. Alternatively, monitoring of all beaches on one island, possibly Canouan, might be productive. Many local people in the southern Grenadines believe nesting to be most abundant on Canouan. Monitoring the deposition of eggs provides a wealth of useful information, including the distribution and timing of the breeding effort, the species involved, the location of the most important breeding habitats, and nest fate. The assistance of hotel staff, dive clubs, and pleasure-boat operators should be sought to participate in the monitoring effort.            Index Beaches should be carefully protected from activity that will compromise the suita-bility of the habitat to support sea turtle nesting. Since these beaches represent the most important nesting areas for endangered sea turtles in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, it is vital to pre-serve them as focal points for conservation, management, and monitoring. As noted above, the data collected will enable the Fisheries Division to evaluate the success of conservation and recovery measures implemented on behalf of sea turtles. Index Beaches should be monitored on a daily basis for nest and hatch success, by species, during the cumulative peak breeding seasons for all three locally nesting species (i.e., 1 April - 30 November). Data should be centrally compiled, perhaps by the Fisheries Division. Field workers should receive preparatory instruction prior to their survey efforts (see section 4.55).            While it is important, where possible, to reliably differentiate between successful egg-laying (a nesting crawl) and unsuccessful egg-laying (a ""false crawl""), such a determination is problematic after the fact. Whether or not eggs are deposited depends on obstacles (erosion bluffs, fallen trees, beach lagoons) encountered by the female during the course of her time on the beach, disturbance (human activity, dogs, lighting), the physical condition of the site chosen (she may encounter impenetrable roots or water or the sand may be too dry to hold a nest cavity), and injuries such as a missing flipper. A nest:false crawl ratio is best determined from all-night patrols or, if erosion and poaching can be ruled out, by returning to the nest site two months hence and verifying a hatch. Some idea of the nest:false crawl ratio is necessary to estimate nest density from crawl tallies obtained during day census efforts. When a crawl has been counted, it should be disguised with a palm frond or a gentle sweeping motion of hands or feet in order to dissuade possible poachers from finding the site and also to prevent the crawl from being counted twice.            It is usually difficult to confirm eggs during day surveys, but in some cases the outcome is obvious. For example, sometimes it is clear that a turtle returned to the sea without attempting to dig. This is a ""false crawl"" and should be reported as such. Alternatively, when a poacher or predator has exposed eggs, or hatchlings are observed, nesting can be confirmed. When the activity site includes both a crawl and an associated disturbance which may or may not contain eggs, distinguishing a true nest from an unsuccessful attempt is challenging even for an experienced worker. Probing for the eggs with a sharp stick will sometimes confirm the presence of a nest, but this is strongly discouraged because subsequent bacterial invasion of the broken eggs may destroy the entire nest. In the case of hawksbill nests in dense vegetation, even finding a site suitable for probing can be difficult. Thus, while the number of nests laid is the best index of beach productivity, in reality it is more typically the number of crawls (i.e., both successful and unsuccessful attempts) that forms the basis for comparison between years and among beaches.            Identifying a fresh crawl to species is easy in many cases, since sea turtles leave either a symmetrical or an asymmetrical track in the sand. In the first case, the pattern is made by the simultaneous movement of the fore-flippers. In the second case, the pattern alternates like a zipper, a result of the turtle moving her front flippers in an alternating rhythm. Leatherbacks leave a deep, symmetrical crawl about 2 m in width. Green turtles also leave a symmetrical crawl, but it is only about 1-1.2 m in width and the nest site is often characterised by a deep, solitary pit a metre or more in depth and breadth. Hawksbills and loggerheads leave an asymmetrical crawl, the hawksbill about 0.7 m in width and the loggerhead about 1-1.2 m in width. The hawksbill crawl is often faint since the animal averages a mere 54 kg (Caribbean Nicaragua: Nietschmann, 1972 in Witzell, 1983). Loggerheads are typically twice as massive, averaging about 116 kg in Florida (Ehrhart and Yoder, 1978 in Dodd, 1988). Hawksbills will often make their nests deep within the shelter of Coccoloba or other beach vegetation. [N.B. Loggerhead nesting is so rare that species identification should always be verified by examining the hatchlings.]            If the nest:false crawl ratio has been determined and the number of nests laid (per species) is known, a knowledge of the average number of clutches laid per female (which varies slightly amongst species and can be gleaned from well-studied populations elsewhere in the region) can be used to estimate the number of breeding females at that site. As a general rule, leatherbacks average 6-7 nests per summer, hawksbills 5 nests, and green turtles 4-5 nests. As an example, 40 hawksbill crawls on a beach may represent only 30 actual nests, which in turn represent only six adult females. To obtain a more accurate assessment of the number of females nesting per year on a particular beach, all-night patrols must be undertaken by trained personnel. All-night patrols could initiate tagging of nesting females. Tagging, however, is not a technique to be undertaken lightly. It requires careful training so that the few nesting females remaining are not scared away from these important nesting beaches, as well as a long term research commitment in order to gain knowledge beyond that obtained from daily nest counts. Nesting hawksbills are presently being tagged in Barbados and beach patrols and fishermen should be on the alert for flipper tags.    Table of Contents                           4.292 Hatchlings                                In the absence of nest monitoring, hatch success is not possible to assess. Any programme introduced to monitor nests should include a hatchling monitoring programme including hatch success and mortality factors. Hatching occurs some 55-70 days after egg-laying. Hatchlings typically emerge at dusk, so biologists or other trained personnel should be prepared at that time to observe whether or not hatchlings are successfully emerging from their nests and making it to the sea. Subsequent management efforts should be designed to mitigate the dominant threats, including disorientation from artificial lighting shining on the beach, vehicle traffic (creating tyre ruts that trap the small turtles), domestic dogs or other significant predators, litter, etc. Problems must be defined before they can be solved. Hatch success can be estimated by analysis of nest contents following the natural emergence of all hatchlings: estimate the number of hatchlings from the number of broken egg shells in the nest, then estimate total clutch size by factoring in the number of undeveloped eggs, preterm embryos, hatchlings dead in nest, etc.                      4.293 Immature and adult turtles                                Technically, it is less difficult to monitor the number of nesting females arriving on beaches each year than it is to monitor the numbers of juvenile and adult turtles using St. Vincent and the Grenadines' waters. However, given the extremely depleted state of nesting populations here, monitoring of foraging populations becomes very important. Blue Lagoon (St. Vincent), Friendship Bay (Canouan), Ashton Harbour (Union) and the Pillories (Mustique) are considered to be important foraging grounds (section 4.111). Assistance from fishermen and SCUBA dive operators should be solicited for this effort. Study sites should be visited repeatedly and standard sea turtle sightings forms used. Any turtles that can be held should be measured and tagged by trained personnel before being released. If these turtles are subsequently recaptured, spatial and temporal residency patterns and growth rates can oftentimes be determined and/or monitored. Valuable insights on international movements of sea turtles can also be obtained from such tagging programmes (section 4.33). The data collected should be centrally compiled, perhaps by the Fisheries Division.    Table of Contents             4.3 Encourage and Support International Cooperation                    4.31 CITES                        The 1973 Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) is among the most powerful wildlife treaties in the world. With 120 Parties worldwide, it has been very effective at reducing international commerce in endangered and depleted species, including their parts and products. Appendix I lists endangered species (including all species of sea turtle), trade in which is tightly controlled; Appendix II lists species that may become endangered unless trade is regulated; Appendix III lists species that any Party wishes to regulate and requires international cooperation to control trade; Appendix IV contains model permits. Permits are required for species listed in Appendices I and II stating that export/import will not be detrimental to the survival of the species.            It is an urgent  recommendation of this Recovery Action Plan  that St. Vincent and the Grenadines, which acceded to CITES in 1989, join the international community of nations in removing its ""reservation"" on the hawksbill sea turtle ( Eretmochelys   imbricata ) and cease all international commerce in this globally endangered species. Repeal of the reservation is especially important because it appears that some wildlife traders are falsifying shipping documents to indicate this country as the point of origin for sea turtle products illegally exported to Japan from CITES parties. This is seen in the fact that St. Vincent and the Grenadines' export data do not correspond with Japan's import data (Table 1). Because St. Vincent can legally trade hawksbill products under the reservation, the sovereignty of St. Vincent and the Grenadines is being abused by unscrupulous traders. The argument put forward to justify the reservation is that since hawksbills are being caught in the country anyway, why not also supplement the financial income from shell trade as well. While this argument is not totally without merit, the fact is that Japan (the primary market), announced a zero quota for the importation of raw hawksbill shell at the end of December 1992, and will withdraw its treaty reservation in July 1994 (Donnelly, 1991; TRAFFIC International, 1991). Soon, there will be no legal international market for local turtle shells and thus no incentive for the continuing harvest.            In addition to the political aspects, the biological argument for ending the international trade is also a strong one. Hawksbills are endangered and declining the world over. Remaining populations in the Caribbean and elsewhere no longer appear to be able to withstand current levels of either subsistence or commercial harvest. In a recent global review of the status of hawksbill sea turtles, Groombridge and Luxmoore (1989) concluded that about half of the known nesting populations are known or suspected to be in decline; in particular, ""the entire Western Atlantic-Caribbean region is greatly depleted."" In total, since 1970, Japan has imported sea turtles products representing a minimum of 2,250,000 sea turtles, many of them hawksbills caught in Caribbean waters (Canin, 1991). Amongst Eastern Caribbean islands, St. Vincent and the Grenadines has been a major trading partner for Japan over the years, supplying (according to Japanese import data) 2,235 kg of raw hawksbill shell between 1970-1986 (Milliken and Tokunaga, 1987) and a further 2,005 kg between 1987-1990 (data courtesy of TRAFFIC). Based on a Caribbean average of 1.34 kg shell scutes per animal (Milliken and Tokunaga, 1987), more than 4,000 hawksbill turtles may have been killed in the last 20 years to service this trade. While data supplied by our Government indicate lower export volumes, the trade is clearly substantial. Fishermen interviewed for this Action Plan were nearly unanimous in their reports that hawksbills have declined noticeably in the Grenadines during the last few decades.            Since it is the view of WIDECAST that all sea turtles should be fully protected as soon as practicable in all Wider Caribbean countries, and the purpose of this Action Plan is to support St. Vincent and the Grenadines in efforts to design and implement scientifically sound management plans to encourage the recovery of local sea turtle populations, it must be a  recommendation of this Recovery Action Plan  that the Government withdraw its CITES reservation on the hawksbill sea turtle prior to the November 1994 Meeting of Parties.    Table of Contents                   4.32 Regional treaties                        A regional environment Convention that shows great promise is the United Nations Environment Programme's (UNEP) Regional Seas Convention in the Caribbean, known as the Convention for the Protection and Development of the Marine Environment of the Wider Caribbean Region (or, the ""Cartagena Convention""). In March, 1983, a Conference of Plenipotenti-aries met in Cartagena, Colombia to negotiate this convention. Representatives from 16 states participated; St. Vincent and the Grenadines did not attend. The Conference adopted both the convention and a Protocol Concerning Cooperation in Combating Oil Spills in the region. Article 10 is of special interest to sea turtles in that it addresses the responsibilities of contracting parties to ""individually or jointly, take all appropriate measures to protect and preserve rare or fragile ecosystems, as well as the habitat of depleted, threatened or endangered species, in the convention area"". St. Vincent ratified the convention on 11 July 1990.            In January 1990, a Protocol Concerning Specially Protected Areas and Wildlife (SPAW) to the Cartagena Convention was adopted by a Conference of Plenipotentiaries, providing a mechanism whereby species of wild fauna and flora could be protected on a regional scale. The landmark Protocol grants explicit protection to species listed in three categories, or annexes. Annex I includes species of flora exempt from all forms of destruction or disturbance. Annex II ensures total protection and recovery to listed species of fauna, with minor exceptions. Specifically, Annex II listing prohibits (a) the taking, possession or killing (including, to the extent possible, the incidental taking, possession or killing) or commercial trade in such species, their eggs, parts or products, and (b) to the extent possible, the disturbance of such species, particularly during periods of breeding, incubation, estivation or migration, as well as other periods of biological stress. Annex III denotes species in need of ""protection and recovery"", but subject to a regulated harvest.            On 11 June 1991, Plenipotentiaries again met in Kingston, Jamaica, to formally adopt the Annexes. The Conference voted to include all six species of sea turtle inhabiting the Wider Caribbean (i.e.,  Caretta   caretta ,  Chelonia   mydas ,  Eretmochelys   imbricata ,  Dermochelys  coria-cea,  Lepidochelys   kempi i, and L.  olivacea ) in Annex II (UNEP, 1991; Eckert, 1991). The unanimous vote on this issue is a clear statement on the part of Caribbean governments that the protection of regionally depleted species, including sea turtles, is a priority. It is a recommen-dation of this Recovery Action Plan that St. Vincent and the Grenadines ratify the SPAW Proto-col with its Annexes at the earliest possible opportunity, in this way sending a strong signal that the Government stands willing to participate in cooperative efforts to conserve the region's rich natural heritage.             The 1973 MARPOL treaty (with 1978 Protocol) is also important to the survival of sea turtles. This Convention has five Annexes that give detailed technical specifications regarding the way in which a ship must be built and equipped to prevent major pollution of the marine environment in case of accidents, and also norms and technical requirements to minimize operational discharges. The five Annexes are for oil, chemicals in bulk, packaged chemicals, liquid sewage, and garbage. Regarding Annex 5 (garbage), it has been proposed to the International Maritime Organization (IMO) by the nations of the Caribbean that the Caribbean Region be declared a ""Special Area"". This proposal has been accepted, but will only come into force when the nations have put into place adequate facilities to receive garbage on shore. It is a  recommendation of this Recovery Action Plan  that St. Vincent and the Grenadines ratify MARPOL as soon as practicable. The 1978 Protocol was ratified by the Government in September 1984 (UNEP, 1989).    Table of Contents                   4.33 Subregional sea turtle management                        Sea turtles are highly migratory, as evidenced by the fact that tagged turtles are often recovered hundreds and sometimes thousands of kilometres distant from the point of tagging. Hatchlings leaving the beaches of St. Vincent and the Grenadines embark on a journey that will likely take them to dozens of nations over the course of their juvenile years (most sea turtles do not reach sexual maturity for 20 years or more). A comprehensive tagging programme initiated jointly with St. Lucia, Barbados and Grenada would illustrate the extent to which foraging turtles are shared amongst our neighbours. A joint proposal for funding to initiate such a tagging programme was submitted by WIDECAST Country Coordinators in these four countries and forms part of the draft IUCN Global Action Plan for Sea Turtles.             A moratorium on sea turtle harvest has been repeatedly endorsed by member OECS states and is mandated by the SPAW Protocol to the UNEP Cartagena Convention (see section 4.32). The Government could participate meaningfully in the region-wide conservation of sea turtles by ratifying the SPAW Protocol and terminating its trade in hawksbill sea turtle shell (see section 4.31). Hawksbills are a regional resource and their continued capture in St. Vincent and the Grenadines undermines efforts of other Caribbean countries to protect this endangered species.    Table of Contents             4.4 Develop Public Education                    4.41 Residents                        It appears that sea turtle populations have become depleted to such an extent that catches or sightings in some areas are really quite infrequent. One consequence of this is that only the older people remember the former abundance of sea turtles. An educational campaign to heighten awareness of the need to conserve what remains of local sea turtle populations should be initiated. An increased understanding by the public may be necessary before the Government will see strengthening of the legislation protecting sea turtles as a priority, or before existing legislation can be effectively enforced. As one option, it is a  recommendation of this Recovery Action Plan  that the network of YES clubs be extended more widely through the Grenadines, and that the clubs initiate projects on sea turtles. These might include ""adopting"" a nesting beach (keeping it free of garbage), monitoring nesting activity, and/or safeguarding nests.            With the present thrust at environmental preservation (the 1990's having been declared the 'Decade of the Environment' in St. Vincent and the Grenadines), and the increasing recognition of the importance of the marine environment to tourism development, it should be possible to feature sea turtles as part of a campaign to encourage environmental resource preservation. Sea turtles can be used not only to exemplify local endangered species, but also the importance of conserving essential coastal habitat (coral reefs, sea grass beds, sandy beaches) and eliminating garbage on the beach and in the marine environment. The schools must be specific target areas, since children tend to be most responsive to the idea of conservation. Many adults still find it hard to accept the fact that sea turtles are becoming extinct, even if they acknowledge re-duced stock sizes. Education toward adults should seek to emphasise that stock sizes are reduced not just in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, but regionally and globally.             The Fisheries Division has already produced fact sheets, posters and stickers that include sea turtles and which put across messages very effectively. Extension officers on the mainland also regularly visit schools and community groups and talk to the students about sea turtle conservation as part of the activity. Extension officers use WIDECAST species identification sheets which are available from the WIDECAST Country Coordinator, Mr. Nigel Scott (Arnos Vale). It is a  recommendation of this Recovery Action Plan  that extension officers travel more often to the Grenadines to talk to schools and community groups there. Since turtles live for many dec-ades, perhaps about a human life span, the results of our conservation and recovery efforts will be slow in coming. We cannot afford to wait.    Table of Contents                   4.42 Fishermen                        Increasing awareness amongst fishermen is important. It must, however, be borne in mind that given the economic standing of most fishermen, selling turtle products is an attractive proposition. The challenge of convincing fishermen to conserve remaining sea turtles may lessen considerably now that the Japanese market for shells is lost. Japan ceased to import turtle shell at the end of 1992 (see section 4.31). The fishermen should be made aware of the global standing of sea turtles, and of efforts in neighbouring countries to conserve remaining stocks. If agreements were made with Grenada, for instance, that prohibited sea turtle catch on both sides of the border, St. Vincent and the Grenadines' fishermen would feel less like they were sacrificing personal income while fishermen in Grenada continued to harvest all the sea turtles they encounter. The burdens, as well as the benefits, of conservation must be equitably shared. When seeking to inform fishermen of the plight of sea turtles, the following points should be made:              Sea turtles are long-lived, reaching sexual maturity in 20-35 years.       Mortality is high in young juveniles, but comparatively low for fully armoured large       juveniles and adults.       Adult females average five clutches of eggs per year and nest every 2-5 years; under       natural conditions females live for many years and lay thousands of eggs, thus ensuring       population stability.       Unfortunately, large turtles have historically been targeted because they provide the       most meat; Fisheries laws usually protect only small turtles.       Egg-bearing adult females are taken in disproportionate numbers because they are easily       obtained from the nesting beach.       Excessive harvest of large turtles, especially gravid females, is a sure way to invite       population collapse (this has been observed at nesting beaches throughout the world and is       easily shown mathematically).       Sea turtle populations cannot sustain the persistent harvest of large juvenile and adult       animals.       Nesting populations have been greatly reduced or exterminated all over the Caribbean,       including St. Vincent and the Grenadines, because adults are not surviving long enough to       produce the next generation (the widespread harvest of eggs only exacerbates this       problem).       The fact that nesting populations are crashing but juvenile turtles are still seen in       local waters is not surprising -- the two stocks are unrelated.       Juveniles travel widely during the many years prior to maturity -- local juveniles are       not residents, they are a shared regional resource.       Nesting females, which return to St. Vincent and the Grenadines at regular intervals to       lay their eggs on beaches where they were born many years ago, leave our islands at the       end of the nesting season and return to resident feeding areas which are most likely       located in distant countries.       All nations must work together if this shared and endangered natural resource is to       survive.          Table of Contents                         4.43 Tourists                        Up until recently much of the turtle shell obtained in this country was exported to Japan. However, substantial amounts, especially in the form of whole polished shells, are bought by yachts-people passing through the Grenadines (reportedly many of these vessels are French registered). They should be advised about the endangered status of sea turtles and the fact that they could be prosecuted if they return to a country (such as France) that is a signatory to CITES and does not hold reservations with regard to sea turtles (only Cuba, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and Japan have entered CITES reservations on the hawksbill sea turtle). Efforts by the Ministry of Tourism to educate tourists are ongoing (e.g., informative flyers have been placed at customs stations, airports and sea ports). The development of brochures and other information for hotels and dive shops should become a priority. The assistance of WIDECAST in preparing these materials has been solicited.    Table of Contents                   4.44 Non-consumptive use of sea turtles to generate revenue                        Living sea turtles now have a potentially important role to play in the development of the tourism industry in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, the economic benefits of which will spread further than could be achieved solely from fishing for sea turtles. As on-island tourism (as opposed to yacht tourism) becomes more widespread, the demand for water sports will grow. These may include snorkeling, SCUBA, glass bottom boat tours, etc. The importance of living sea turtles as an attraction for tourists, and hence their economic worth, will encourage local people to participate in efforts to conserve them. SCUBA dive operators are frequently requested for dives at sites where turtles may be seen, and many people associate a lack of sea turtles with a disturbed marine environment. At present SCUBA tourists from the Canouan Beach hotel on the south west tip of Canouan and those from Union island are taken to the Tobago Cays to dive in order to enjoy the marine life.    The feasibility of glass-bottom boat trips for less adventurous tourists that pass over deeper sea grass/algal beds to view foraging green turtles could be investigated in both Canouan and Union islands. There is a glass bottom boat operator in Barbados that offers a similar trip, which has given him a competitive advantage over other tours. There is tremendous potential for such activities, but they depend on being able to see turtles on a reliable basis. It may also be an attractive proposition, particularly for hotels in the Grenadines, to have guided ""turtle walks"" as part of their tourist packages. However, until some monitoring of nesting activity has been completed, it will not be possible to identify which beaches this would be most feasible on. It is essential that turtle walks are led by an experienced guide and that appropriate beach etiquette is maintained (i.e., small groups, no bright torches, no flash photography, an atmosphere of quiet observation). WIDECAST is currently preparing a manual for use in establishing ""sea turtle eco-tourism"" programmes.

Chief Fisheries Officer Kerwyn Morris represented this country on both occasions. There is no reason to suggest that this country will not continue to participate in future symposia. An important resource book, the Manual of Sea Turtle Research and Conservation Techniques (Pritchard et al., 1983), was a product of WATS I.    Table of Contents                   4.53 WIDECAST                        The Wider Caribbean Sea Turtle Recovery Team and Conservation Network, known as WIDECAST, consists of a regional team of sea turtle experts that works closely with in-country Coordinators, who in turn enlist the support and participation of citizens in and out of government who have an interest in sea turtle conservation. The primary project outputs are Sea Turtle Recovery Action Plans (STRAPs) for each of 39 government regions, including St. Vincent and the Grenadines, in the Wider Caribbean. Each STRAP is tailored specifically to local circumstances and provides the following information:              The local status and distribution of nesting and feeding sea turtles.       The major causes of mortality to sea turtles.       The effectiveness of existing national and international laws protecting sea turtles.       Present and historical role of sea turtles in local culture and economy.       Local, national, and multi-lateral implementing measures for scientifically sound sea       turtle conservation.                  The short-term objectives of WIDECAST are to provide Wider Caribbean governments with updated information on the status of sea turtles in the region, to provide specific recommendations for the management and recovery of endangered, threatened, and vulnerable sea turtle stocks, and to assist Wider Caribbean governments in the discharge of their obligations under the Protocol Concerning Specially Protected Areas and Wildlife (SPAW) in the Wider Caribbean Region (see section 4.32). The longer-term objectives are to promote a regional capability to implement scientifically sound sea turtle conservation programmes. Specifically, to develop and support a technical understanding of sea turtle biology and management among local individuals and organizations by:              Implementing WIDECAST through resident Country Coordinators.       Utilising local network participants to collect information and draft, with the       assistance of regional sea turtle experts, locally appropriate sea turtle management       recommendations.       Providing or assisting in the development of educational materials (e.g., slides,       brochures, posters, pamphlets).       Sponsoring or supporting local or subregional workshops on sea turtle biology and       management.       Assisting governments and non-government groups with the implementation of effective       management and conservation programmes for turtles.              Beyond supporting the local and national efforts of governments and non-governmental organizations, WIDECAST works to integrate these efforts into a collective regional response to a common problem, the disappearance of sea turtles. WIDECAST is supported by the Caribbean Trust Fund of the UNEP Caribbean Environment Programme, as well as by government and non-government agencies and groups. It would be useful to make all governmental and non-governmental organisations with an interest in conservation, aware of the WIDECAST effort in St. Vincent and the Grenadines. This regional programme is unique in providing assistance to governments seeking support in developing and implementing sea turtle recovery actions. The Country Coordinator is Nigel McA. Scott (P. O. Box 1584, Kingstown). Information can also be obtained from Dr. Julia Horrocks, WIDECAST Regional Sea Turtle Recovery Team, Bellairs Research Institute and UWI Department of Biology, St. James, Barbados.    Table of Contents                   4.54 IUCN/SSC Marine Turtle Specialist Group                        The Marine Turtle Specialist Group (Dr. Karen Bjorndal, Chair) is responsible for tracking the status of sea turtle populations around the world for the World Resources Union (IUCN) Species Survival Commission (SSC). The Group is presently drafting an outline for a global Marine Turtle Action Plan. The Group is a valuable source of information about sea turtles and technical advice on conservation projects. Contact Dr. Karen Bjorndal, Archie Carr Center for Sea Turtle Research, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida 32611 USA.    Table of Contents                   4.55 Workshops on research and management                        Travelling scholarships or fellowships for individuals involved in turtle conservation efforts to join established field conservation projects, such as those at Tortuguero (Costa Rica) or Rancho Nuevo (Mexico), for short periods would be extremely valuable. WIDECAST has supported Caribbean biologists in attending the Tortuguero course in the past, and this kind of support would be very welcome in St. Vincent and the Grenadines. Workshops for sub-regional groups (e.g., small islands with extensive turtle subsistence problems to overcome, or small islands with extensive tourist associated problems to overcome) where practical solutions (e.g., inexpensive limited man power) to problems can be discussed would be useful. WIDECAST would be in a good position to sponsor such workshops. If such an activity were to be planned, St. Vincent and the Grenadines would be interested in participating.    Table of Contents                   4.56 Exchange of information among local groups                        The JEMS Progressive Youth Organisation already has a good track record as a non-government, environmental conservation organisation. Along with the National Trust (a statutory body established in 1969 to conserve and protect the historical and natural heritage) and the Union Island Association for Ecological Preservation, these organisations could provide a clearinghouse for information exchange among other interested local groups. The aforementioned organisations have already indicated an interest in becoming involved in sea turtle conservation. The publication of this Action Plan will significantly enhance the quality and quantity of sea turtle conservation information available to local groups.    Table of Contents             4.6 Implement a National Sea Turtle Conservation Programme           4.61 Rationale                        A long history of exploitation of sea turtles around St. Vincent and the Grenadines suggests that it was, until quite recently, one of the most important sea turtle nesting and foraging areas in the eastern Caribbean region. Four species utilise the waters and sandy beaches of St. Vincent and the Grenadines. The hawksbill, green, and leatherback are classified as Endangered by the World Conservation Union (IUCN), and the loggerhead as Vulnerable. Despite the long history of exploitation of local populations, no population monitoring has occurred. However, fishermen and dive operators throughout the country acknowledge the relative scarcity of sea turtles in the waters and nesting on the beaches today compared to previous years. This Recovery Action Plan has discussed the causes of decline of the different species and proposed steps that should be take as soon as possible if populations are to be saved from complete collapse. Sea turtle conservation in St. Vincent and the Grenadines could be enhanced by the implementation of a national Sea Turtle Conservation Programme based on recommendations in this Action Plan. This programme, articulated below, might be most appropriately integrated with national fisheries management planning.    Table of Contents                   4.62 Goals and objectives                        The primary goals of the Sea Turtle Conservation Programme are to determine the distribution and abundance of sea turtles, to conserve foraging and nesting populations of sea turtles, to enhance public awareness of the need for sea turtle conservation, and to promote the sustainable, non-consumptive use of sea turtles at least until populations have recovered sufficiently for controlled harvest to be resumed. For the goals and objectives of the Programme to be realised, sea turtles and their nesting and foraging habitats must be adequately protected by national legislation.            The specific objectives of the Programme are to:        Determine nest density and nest success on important nesting beaches in the major     Grenadine Islands and St. Vincent over five consecutive years, based on ground surveys.     Determine, as closely as possible, the distribution and abundance of turtles at sea over     five consecutive years using sightings data collected fishermen and dive operators and     during proposed coral reef/sea grass monitoring programme.     Identify critical nesting and foraging habitats, based on the results of field surveys     (see 1. and 2. above) and implement comprehensive conservation/management programmes in     these areas.     Increase understanding of residency patterns and movements of sea turtles (including an     evaluation of the extent to which turtles are shared with neighbouring countries), by     initiating a tagging programme.     Quantify the current annual exploitation of sea turtles, based on user and fish market     surveys. Quantify the number of people currently earning income from sea turtle     exploitation. Evaluate alternative non-consumptive means to generate revenue from sea     turtles for these resource users.     Improve law enforcement by increasing the numbers of trained personnel and boats.     Develop educational materials and training sessions to increase awareness of sea turtle     conservation and promote greater community involvement in enforcement.     Enhance public awareness of the need for sea turtle conservation through the development     of educational materials for schools, fishermen, and other sectors of society.     Develop educational materials for visitors. Encourage active participation of hotels and     visitors in monitoring nesting and hatching and in safeguarding nests.      Table of Contents                   4.63 Activities                        The following activities are proposed to meet the stated goals and objectives:        Appoint/hire a Coordinator for the National Sea Turtle Conservation Programme and     establish a centralised database for assembling, maintaining and updating sea turtle     information. It is our view that if a Conservation Officer (or equivalent) position is     dedicated within the Fisheries Division (see section 4.121), this individual could serve     as the National Sea Turtle Coordinator. The Fisheries Division is also in the best     position to coordinate data.      Implement a monitoring programme on Index Beaches (Action Plan section 4.291) on the     major Grenadine Islands and St. Vincent over five consecutive nesting seasons. WIDECAST     will be asked to provide technical support and train employees and volunteers for this     purpose.     Train employees/volunteers to monitor catch and sale of turtle products whilst turtle     fishing remains legal. This will involve monitoring of fish markets and sales of shells to     local buyers, yachts, etc.     Encourage and facilitate the participation of employees and volunteers in regional     training programmes (e.g., the training course at Tortuguero, Costa Rica), ongoing     research projects (e.g., Jumby Bay-WIDECAST hawksbill research project on Long Island,     Antigua), and/or research and conservation activities at Bellairs Research Institute in     neighbouring Barbados.     Organise a series of workshops targeting sea turtle fishermen, dive operators and hotel     staff on St. Vincent and the major Grenadine islands to inform them of the current state     of knowledge of sea turtle biology and conservation, and to request their assistance in     monitoring nesting and foraging population sizes.     In collaboration with the Fisheries Division, investigate the feasibility and     desirability of employing retired or highly respected fishermen part-time (preferably     using their own boats) as community-based Deputies to enforce Fisheries regulations.     Initiate capture-tag-release studies at important foraging sites. WIDECAST can provide     technical support to train fishermen and dive operators for this purpose. Coordinate     tagging efforts with ongoing tagging programmes in Barbados (contact Dr. Julia Horrocks,     Bellairs Research Institute) and St. Lucia (contact Mr. Crispin d'Auvergne, ENCORE     project, Ministry of Planning).     Develop holistic management plans for critical nesting and foraging habitats within the     context of existing national legislation, taking into account the specific recommendations     of this Recovery Action Plan and encouraging the active participation of resource users.     Conduct ""on-site"" demonstrations for planners, developers and architects to     reinforce the ""sea-turtle friendly"" recommendations proposed in this Action     Plan.     Establish buoys and signs demarcating important sea turtle foraging and nesting beaches     in existing marine conservation areas or wildlife reserves.     Assist hotel staff with training and educational materials to encourage their own and     visitor participation in sea turtle monitoring and conservation activities.     Investigate the feasibility of glass bottom boat tours and nesting beach tours in     selected areas, as carefully designed components of management pans described in 8. above,     and making maximum use of former sea turtle fishermen as key personnel.     Initiate a national public awareness campaign making use of posters, brochures, media     events, ""bumper stickers"", school and library programming, narrated slide shows,     video productions, etc. The campaign will be targeted at specific sectors of society,     including fishermen, divers and yachters, coastal planners and developers, and visitors;     as well as to the general public.      Table of Contents                   4.64 Results and Outputs                    Employees/volunteers active in the Programme will receive formal training in sea turtle     conservation and management, enhancing the nation's ability as a whole to wisely conserve     remaining stocks.     A Manual to complement this Action Plan will be developed describing how to conduct     beach surveys, complete sightings data forms, tag turtles  inter alia .     Data on numbers of turtles nesting, numbers of turtles harvested, and their important     nesting and foraging sites will become available for use in addressing deficiencies in the     Fisheries Act and other environmental and planning legislation, and in identifying     critical habitats needin"

Since Caribbean tourism is primarily associated with beaches and the sea, there have been -and continue to be- impacts from tourism on the coastal environment, including the coral reefs. Tourism impacts on coral reefs include both direct and indirect impacts. Activities with direct impacts are: snorkelling, diving and boating, which can cause direct physical damage to reefs, and fishing and collecting, which can contribute to over-exploitation of reef species and threatening local survival of endangered species. Indirect impacts relate to the development, construction and operation of tourism infrastructure as a whole (resorts, marinas, ports, airports, etc.). Direct physical damage from snorkelling and diving has been the subject of extensive study and is relatively well documented in the literature. The damage inflicted by divers and snorkellers consists mostly of breaking fragile, branched corals or causing lesions to massive corals. Most divers and snorkellers cause little damage, only a few cause relatively much damage. Research indicates that reef degradation and change of community structure occurs once a certain level of use by divers and snorkellers is exceeded. As a rule of thumb it is recommended that the level of 5,000 to 6,000 dives per sites per year should not be exceeded. Training and briefing of divers and snorkellers will greatly help to reduce negative impact. Physical damage from anchors and especially boat groundings can be severe. Anchor damage is proportional to the size of the boat (i.e. weight of the anchor and length of anchor chain) and is further dependent on the type of coral community. Recovery of coral damage from boat groundings is slow. Anchor damage can be avoided to a large extent by installing permanent moorings, designating anchorages and providing adequate information on anchoring and mooring. Although fishing is a cause of decline in reef fish stocks throughout the Caribbean, the direct role of tourism in this decline is most likely not significant. Indirectly, tourism increases the demand for seafood and does have an impact of on reef resources. Collecting of marine souvenirs by tourists is probably insignificant but there still is a market for marine curio in response to a certain tourist demand. The demand can definitely be decreased by increased awareness. Tourism-related sources of sewage pollution include resorts and, to a much lesser extent, recreational vessels. There is evidence that a very large percentage of the sewage generated by hotels is discharged in coastal waters without adequate treatment. The main impact of sewage pollution is nutrient enrichment, which favours certain species (algae in particular) at the expense of corals. The different impacts of nutrient enrichment from sewage pollution on corals in general have been well studied; those from sewage pollution from hotels and recreational vessels have not.  5   The studies indicate that the impact of sewage pollution depends much on the level of treatment before discharge and the degree of flushing at the point of discharge. Tourism is not generally a source of petroleum hydrocarbon pollution, other than at a small scale when oil or fuel spills from recreational vessels and marinas occur. The effects of petroleum hydrocarbons on corals has been studied for quite some time and there is evidence that chronic oil pollution is more harmful than a single exposure, and that dispersants and emulsifiers used to combat spills are more toxic than oil alone. Coastal development and the construction and operation of related tourism infrastructure cause increased runoff and sedimentation. Sedimentation is generally considered one of the main reasons for reef degradation. Increased sediment loading of coastal waters increases turbidity, reduces light levels and leads to stress on corals, usually expressed by ""bleaching"" of corals. Heavy sediment loading may also cause corals to suffocate and die. Other documented impacts of sedimentation on corals include lower growth rates, reduced productivity and reduced recruitment. Tourism is obviously a source of large amounts of solid waste. The impacts of solid waste on coral reefs depend very much on the method of disposal. If disposed of inappropriately, leaching of toxic substances may impact negatively on corals. Of particular concern is the ""accidental"" waste plastics in particular- that is blown into the ocean from beaches or vessels and has a detrimental effect on corals and other marine life. The impacts of tourism on coral reefs are significant, but they are also compounded by other impacting factors that are not easily discernable from those of tourism. This does not mean that we must disregard the impacts of tourism activities. On the contrary, the tourism sector and government agencies involved in tourism development must try to eliminate or reduce those impacts that can be controlled, even if there is no 100% proof that a certain impact is directly related to a tourist activity.  2.2  Key actors  The key actors in the tourism sector are the tourists and those who cater to the tourists, whether directly or indirectly. Caribbean tourists can be roughly divided in those who desire sea, sun and fun as the primary qualities of their destinations and those who are more interested in the natural and cultural qualities of the destination. The level of awareness relating to coral reefs between the two groups is obviously quite different. Among the direct caterers we distinguish three main groups:    Travel agents, tour operators and transport companies; Hotels and restaurants; Water sports operators.  The awareness relating to coral reefs is generally low among the first group and among restaurants. The awareness among hoteliers and water sports operators is much higher, but there appears to be some ""finger pointing"" in that increased 6   awareness is needed in other sectors rather than in their own. The awareness among the water sports operators and their clients in the primary dive destinations is much higher than that in others. Consequently, the benefits of increased awareness will vary, depending on the destination and the size of the operations, but they can be substantial. The marina and yachting sector is somewhat of an exception in this category, with awareness among the marina operators mostly low and higher among yachtsmen, especially among private yacht owners. The indirect caterers include politicians decision makers, private investors and lending institutions that enable tourism development. This is a diverse category, with an awareness level that is not necessarily low, but with interests guided by political, economic and financial incentives, rather than by sound ecological guidelines.  2.3  Awareness campaign  Based on the analysis of impacts and actors, recommendations were formulated for an awareness campaign. The guiding criterion was to target awareness at those groups whose awareness was relatively low and where benefits would be potentially high. This resulted in the selection of three main target groups:    The individual tourist; The water sports operators and their clients; The politicians/decision makers, private investors and financial institutions.  The message to the individual tourist and the operators will attempt to reduce direct physical impacts from tourist activities on coral reefs, while the messages to the latter category will be geared towards incentives that will make a change in behaviour worthwhile economically and politically.  7   8   3.. 3....  IINTRODUCTIION NTRODUCT ON  Coral reefs are under threat. The scientific community is in agreement about it and the press talks about it. Fifty-eight percent of the world's reefs are potentially threatened by human activity. Not counting the Pacific, 70 percent of all reefs are at risk. Overexploitation and coastal development pose the greatest potential threat (Bryant et al. 1998). Coral reefs are not only under threat; they are actually suffering from decline and degradation due to a combination of natural and anthropogenic factors. Some of these anthropogenic factors are related to tourism. At the same time tourism is of great economic importance to most Caribbean states and territories. For some smaller island territories, tourism may well be the mainstay of the local economy. Because tourism in the Caribbean is dependent almost entirely on coastal resources, most development takes place in the costal zone and most of the impacts occur in the coastal zone. Impacts from tourism activities include both direct physical impacts (such as diver damage and anchor damage), as well as indirect impacts from resort development and operation, and development of tourism infrastructure in general. Impacts from tourism can often be reduced by raising awareness and changing behaviour. The purpose of this report is to provide the background information for an awareness campaign that will reduce the negative impacts of tourist activities on coral reefs. This report is organised in three main sections:  Section 4 describes and analyses the impacts of tourism activities on coral reefs. This analysis is entirely based on a literature survey and an extensive bibliography is given in section 7. It becomes apparent that there is a large body of scientific literature on the direct impacts of tourism, and much less literature that links indirect impacts of tourism with coral reef degradation. Nevertheless there is ample evidence of detrimental effects of such indirect impacts that may be associated with tourism. Section 5 provides an analysis of the key actors in the tourism industry. Who are they; what is their respective level of awareness, and what are the potential benefits from increased awareness and changes in behaviour of these actors. The analysis is based on a limited survey, but mostly on the consultant's experience and opinion. Section 6 pulls the results of the two previous sections together and attempts to answer the questions: ""What messages should be sent to the main actors in order to raise awareness and change behaviour, and through which channels should these messages be disseminated?""      9   10   4..

TOUR SM ACT V T ES AND THE R MPACTS ON CORAL REEFS::: DESCRIIPTIION AND ANALYSIIS ON CORAL REEFS::: DESCR PT ON AND ANALYS S 4.1 The tourism sector  The tourism sector is of significant economic importance for most states and territories in the Wider Caribbean region, most notably so in many of the island states. In 1990 Caribbean tourism earned $ 8.9 billion (Holder, 1991). For the seven (island) states in the top 20% of those dependent on tourism (average of 89 rooms per 1,000 inhabitants) average tourism earnings were 59% of GDP. For the seven (island) states in the next 20% (average of 36 rooms per 1,000 inhabitants) average tourism earnings were 48% of GDP (Potter, 1996, using data from Hoagland, et al., 1995 and Caribbean Tourism Organization, 1995). A recent issue of Caribbean Latin American Profile estimates that SCUBA diving in the Caribbean will generate $ 1.2 billion by the year 2005. Some 60% of international SCUBA diving tourists currently choose Caribbean destinations for their holidays (Kelly Robinson, pers. comm.). It is unquestionable that, apart from the climate, the coastal zone with its beaches and adjacent ocean and associated opportunities for relaxation, recreation and inwater activities, are the main factors in attracting visitors to the island states of the Caribbean. The influx of visitors, their activities in the coastal zone and the infrastructure required to cater for these visitors, have diverse and multi-faceted environmental and cultural impacts which are described by many authors (e.g. see UNEP, 1997). This report is restricted to a description and analysis of the tourism activities which impact on coral reefs1.  4.2  Impacts of tourism: overview  In the Caribbean, 25 out of 30 countries have reported tourism as being a factor in the deterioration of reefs (Wells, 1985, cited in Craik et al., 1990). Cortes (1997) notes that tourism is an important source of coral reef degradation and eventual destruction for the coral reefs of Central America. In what ways is tourism contributing to reef degradation? Tourism activities, which have an impact on coral reefs, can be divided in those that have a direct physical impact and those that impact indirectly on coral reefs. Direct impacts include for example breaking of corals by snorkellers and divers, anchor damage, and boat groundings. Indirect impacts are related to tourism development in general and include such aspects as sedimentation from construction, sewage and  The term ""coral reefs"" is used in a broad sense in this report, including both biogenic carbonate structures (bioherms) composed of the skeletons of reef-building corals and other organisms, as well as other structures and assemblages which include reef-building corals and other reef-dwelling organisms.  1  11   solid waste disposal from tourist facilities, increased demand for seafood, etc. An overview of activities and their impacts is given in Tables 1 and 2.

Tourism activities with indirect impacts on coral reefs.  12   4.2.1 Physical damage to corals In this section we will discuss the direct physical damage to corals that can result from snorkelling, SCUBA diving, and motor boating and yachting. 4.2.1.1 Physical damage from snorkelling and diving  Snorkelling is one of the easiest ways to enjoy and admire the shallow coral reef environment. It is available to virtually anyone who is able to swim. A snorkeller will typically ""float"" on the surface above the corals and thereby should have minimal impact on the reef. However, damage from snorkellers tends to occur in shallow water where snorkellers can stand up, and it tends to occur in particular with inexperienced snorkellers who feel uncomfortable with their equipment and behave more ""clumsily"" than experienced snorkellers. The impacts from snorkelling can best be described as:  Trampling of corals by standing up  Fin kicking causing breakage of corals (mostly fragile, branched species) Damage inflicted by SCUBA divers is usually associated with a lack of buoyancy control skills and inadvertency, resulting in accidental interactions with coral such as bumping into coral and kicking coral with fins, causing breakage or lesions depending on the type of coral. Certain behaviour such as standing on coral heads or holding onto corals may be due to ignorance about the fragility of corals and the potential impact of contact. Several authors have researched and documented snorkeller and diver damage. It is often difficult to distinguish such damage from natural damage or other forms of human-induced damage (for example, see Rogers et al., 1988). This points to the need to design research methods that will target a specific issue and eliminate compounding factors. Hawkins and Roberts (1993b) and Scura and Van't Hof (1993) have applied such methods by comparing heavily dived and little dived areas and by looking at gradients of impact along a line of decreasing recreational activity. Rogers et al. (1988a, 1988b) monitored coral breakage at two reefs in the Virgin Islands National Park and Biosphere Reserve (VINP), as well as individual Elkhorn coral colonies (Acropora palmata). They attributed broken coral branches to careless snorkellers, boat strikes and swells. They noticed divers and snorkellers bumping into corals or standing on them, and overturning corals to reach lobster. Even in the absence of major storms or other stresses, only 10 of 50 tagged Elkhorn coral colonies remained undisturbed over a 7-month period of observation. Rogers et al. (1988a) report that at Trunk Bay in VINP, where a snorkelling trail was established in the early sixties receiving 170,000 visitors annually by 1986- "".... the trail has deteriorated substantially as a result of people standing on corals, breaking coral branches while snorkelling, and removing organisms as souvenirs."" Tilmant (1987) and Tilmant and Schmahl (1981) studied the impact of recreational activities on buoyed reefs in Biscayne National Park, Florida. Each buoyed reef received three or more times as much use as its control. The most frequent recreational activities were snorkelling and spear fishing. The mean frequency of damaged coral encounters ranged from 35 to 140 per 30-minute count. Although significant differences in damage between buoyed reefs and controls did occur at 13   some sample points, such differences did not follow a consistent pattern that could be readily attributed to human use. Incidence of damage to soft corals was much higher than that to hard corals. They recognized that, since the level of recreational use on the reefs studied was relatively low (no more than 1,500 people per reef per year), the impacts may be more severe at higher levels of use. Talge (1991) studied the behaviour of snorkellers and SCUBA divers in the Looe Key National Marine Sanctuary, Florida, in terms of the number of interactions between divers and coral. The interactions she observed were: 1) Hand on the coral to steady or help gain control 2) Kicking or brushing with the fins 3) Standing on corals 4) Grabbing corals (especially soft corals) to pull themselves through the water 5) Rubbing against coral with any part of the body 6) Hitting coral with the SCUBA tank or other pieces of equipment 7) Creating sediment clouds The most frequent interactions were ""finning"" and ""push-off"". The average number of interactions per diver is ten per dive. Snorkellers had significantly less interactions than SCUBA divers, divers without gloves had fewer interactions than divers with gloves, and females had fewer interactions than males. Over two-thirds of the interactions were with hard corals. This contrasts with the findings of Tilmant and Schmahl (1981) and may well be due to the selection of the study sites, one being comparatively richer in soft corals than the other. Coral breakage included only 0.6% of all incidents. This author also expressed concern with increase in nitrogen concentration of the water by divers urinating over the reef. This concern has not been substantiated by further research. An experimental study by Talge (1992) in the Looe Key National Marine Sanctuary, Florida, consisted of weekly ""touching and ""finning"" selected corals at two intensities. Weekly touching had no detectable lasting influence on the health of 11 species of corals, either visibly or histologically. Based on an average of 10 interactions per diver, she calculated that 4-6% of the live coral area is touched weekly. However, as a small percentage of divers have much more frequent interactions, she recommended that the touching ban in the Sanctuary be maintained. Scura and Van't Hof (1993) and Dixon et al. (1993) describe diver impact in Bonaire, Netherlands Antilles. A comparison of sites receiving high levels of use, intermediate levels of use and controls (reserve sites closed to diving) indicated that percent hard coral cover is significantly lower at high-use sites than at control sites, while species diversity is higher at high-use sites than at controls. At intermediate-use sites no such differences were found. The study also suggests that impact is decreasing with linear distance from the centre of activity (in the case of Bonaire the dive boat moorings). Percent coral cover and species diversity increase with distance from the mooring. The findings led to the postulation of a ""threshold"" hypothesis that diver impact becomes quickly apparent when use exceeds a level of 4,000-6,000 divers on a dive site per year. Hawkins et al. (1999) repeated the study of Scura and Van't Hof (1993) three years later. They found a decrease in coral cover at both control and dived sites, except at one of the sites labelled as high-use in the 1993 study. Their study showed that dive sites suffered no greater loss of coral cover than control sites in the three-year  14   period. However they found a distinct difference in community structure between high-use and control sites. The proportion of massive corals that make up total coral cover decreased at both high-use and control sites, but the decrease was much greater at high-use sites (19.2% vs. 6.7% decrease). The proportion of branching coral increased 8.2% in high-use sites compared to 2.2% in control sites, with coral diversity and species richness showing a similar pattern. They conclude that there has been an increased disturbance of Bonaire's reefs over the three-year period between the studies, with greater disturbance in high-use areas than at control sites. A reduction in cover by massive species is also reported in Connell (1997) for Buck Island, St. Croix, US Virgin Islands. Although no explanation is offered for the decline, it is noteworthy that Buck Island is a location, which is subjected to heavy recreational use. Several studies on diver and snorkeller damage have been conducted in other parts of the world. Although Indo-Pacific reef structure and species composition are different from that of most Caribbean islands (extensive reef flats and more branching and foliaceous species), the results of these studies are nevertheless of value and useful to relate here. Allison (1996) researched snorkeller damage to reefs in the Maldive Islands. The study showed a positive correlation between the distribution of broken corals and snorkelling activity on the reef at Vihamanaafushi. The study concludes that: ""....the observed breakage is important because of potential reduction of the aesthetic appeal of the reefs to tourists, and degradation of the reefs' ability to sustain the islands they protect and nourish."" The author advocates, amongst others, programmes to educate and train users to reduce damage, and to develop information packages and simple effective data collection methods suitable for amateurs. Networks of dive and tour operators could be used as the implementation vehicle for such programmes. Hawkins and Roberts (1993b) studied the effect of trampling by SCUBA divers and snorkellers on reefs flats of coral reefs in Egypt. They found significantly more damaged corals and loose fragments of live coral in heavily trampled areas than in little-trampled areas. Percentage of bare rock and rubble was significantly higher, while percentage of live coral cover and number of hard coral colonies were lower. Coral colonies were also smaller in trampled areas compared with control areas. In summary, heavy trampling by divers appears to alter the coral population structure of the reef flat. Although the Western Atlantic reefs do not have extensive reef flats as occur in Indo-Pacific reefs, some Caribbean islands have experienced or continue to experience the effect of divers and snorkellers treading on coral. Buccoo Reef in Tobago is probably the most infamous example of the destruction caused by reef walking (see Rogers et al., 1988b). Where shore diving is practiced, divers and snorkellers will also have some impact on shallow reef areas by trampling. Hawkins and Roberts (1992a, 1992b, 1993a, 1993b, 1994) compared heavily dived and un-dived areas in Egypt and found significant differences in levels of damage. Numbers of broken hard coral colonies, live loose coral fragments, reattached fragments, abraded colonies, and part-dead colonies were higher in dived areas. They concluded that divers cause significant damage to benthic communities on the fore-reef slope. Their findings suggest that damage accumulates rapidly when a new site is opened up for diving, with impact stabilising after a certain level of use had  15   been reached. The three study sites received between 5,000 and 13,000 dives per year. Hawkins and Roberts (1994) suggest that dive sites at Sharm-el-Sheik in Egypt can accommodate 10,000 to 15,000 dives per year without serious degradation. Epstein et al. (1999) compared populations of the hard coral Stylophora pistillata at a site that had been closed to the public for six years with two nearby sites, open to the public, in Eilat, Northern Red Sea. The main results of the study indicate that: (1) live coral cover was three times lower at the open sites than at the closed site; (2) there were significantly more small colonies (recruits) at the open sites and significantly less large-size colonies; (3) the average number of broken colonies was three times higher at the open sites. They interpret the lower breakage level in the closed site as a sign of the effectiveness of the closure, but they also conclude that a no-use policy is not sufficient for protecting small reef areas. Jameson et al. (1999) developed a Coral Damage Index (CDI) to assess the extent and severity of physical damage to coral. Sites are characterised as ""hot spots"" if in any transect the percent of broken coral colonies is 4% or more, or if the percent cover by coral rubble is 3% or more. In a study of four diving sites off Hurghada and Safaga, Egypt, in the Red Sea, 40% of the transects surveyed qualified as ""hot spots"". The relatively large number of hot spots in shallow water suggests that most of the damage was caused by anchors dragging across the reef. They conclude that the diving carrying capacity of the sites is being exceeded by large amounts. Muthiga and McClanahan (1997) compared the impact of visitor use (diving and snorkelling) in heavily used sites and less frequented sites. They found no significant differences in coral cover or bare rock and rubble between sites, nor differences in coral species composition and diversity. However, there was significantly more damage to coral in the high-use sites, as evidenced by the number of broken, abraded, and broken and reattached coral colonies. Greater damage as observed in shallow than deep areas, which may indicate that snorkellers have more impact than SCUBA divers. Differences between the results of this study and those in the Red Sea may be explained to a large extent by the much higher visitation levels in the Red Sea. Davis at al. (1995) observed diver interactions in the Julian Rocks Aquatic Reserve in Eastern Australia. Thirty divers were observed for about 30 minutes each. The number of diver contacts ranged from 2 to 121 (average 35 contacts per dive). More than 50% were contacts made with fins. Only 7.2% of contacts resulted in noticeable level of damage. The majority of damaging contacts were with hard corals, with lesser damage inflicted on sponges and turf algae. More experienced divers (those with more than 100 logged dives) made significantly less uncontrolled contacts than less experienced divers. Harriott et al. (1997) conducted a similar study of diver contacts at four other locations in Eastern Australia (Heron Island and Lady Elliott Island in the Southern Great Barrier Reef, and Gneering Shoals and Solitary Islands in sub-tropical Eastern Australia). There was a large range in the total number of contacts per diver per site, with a few divers having a disproportionate impact. This coincides with the findings of Rouphael (1995). The maximum number of contacts ranged from 192 at Gneering Shoals to 304 at Solitary Islands. There was a significant difference between the mean numbers of contacts between sites, ranging from 31.3 at Heron Island to 121.2 at Solitary Islands. The mean number of coral contacts follows more or less the same 16   pattern, but there is no significant difference between sites in coral breakage. The mean number of corals broken per dive ranged from 0.6 at Heron Island to 1.9 at Solitary Islands. Most contacts were made by fins and 78% of coral breakage was caused by fins. Differences between the number of contacts and coral breakage per site were attributed to: 1. Greater awareness among divers at Heron Island and Lady Elliott Island (located within the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park), because of the awareness campaigns by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority and pre-dive briefings at these sites. 2. At Solitary Islands and Gneering Shoals, divers actively explored the small invertebrate fauna and thereby spent more time close to the bottom where they were more likely to make contact with corals. Apart from the direct physical impact from diver and snorkeller contacts, such as breakage of coral and inflicting lesions, there is also some evidence that damaged corals show reduced growth rates (e.g. Liddle and Kay, 1987, and Meesters et al., 1994). The studies on diver impact have given some indications although far from unequivocal- on ecological carrying capacity of reefs for recreational diving. At Julian Rocks Aquatic Reserve in Eastern Australia, with the majority of the 20,000 dives made per year occurring in a small area, it is believed that the ecological sustainability may be exceeded (see Harriott et al., 1997). Hawkins and Roberts (1994) estimated that the most heavily used sites at Sharm-el-Sheik, Egypt, received between 35,000 and 50,000 dives per year and feared that that level was exceeding the carrying capacity of the reefs. They suggest that sites can withstand 10,00015,000 dives per year without serious degradation. Epstein et al. (1999) feel that the number of dives for Eilat and Egyptian reefs far exceed the maximum sustainable diving levels as calculated by Dixon et al. (1993) and Hawkins and Roberts (1997). Scura and Van't Hof (1993) postulated that in Bonaire, Netherlands Antilles, there might be a threshold of 4,000  6,000 dives per site per year, above which reef degradation becomes quickly apparent. In a study comparing diving intensities and impact in Egypt, Bonaire and Saba, Hawkins and Roberts (1997) advocate to maintain use at levels below 5,000  6,000 dives per site per year, which is very close to the estimate of Dixon et al. (1993). Chadwick-Furman (1997) estimates the threshold for diving in the US Virgin Islands at only 500 dives per site per year. As suggested by Hawkins and Roberts (1997), the notion of carrying capacity is elastic rather than fixed and depends on other factors, such as the level of diver education and briefing, or adverse impacts from tourism development practices in general and construction in particular.  17   SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS       Many studies on diver and snorkeller impact on coral reefs have been conducted throughout the world. The results of these studies are not unequivocal, mostly because of differences in methodology and study sites. The majority of divers and snorkellers appear to cause little damage; a few cause a lot of damage. Most damage consists of breaking fragile, branched corals, or causing lesions to less fragile, massive corals. There are indications that, once a new site is opened up for diving and snorkelling, the initial physical damage is high but levels off after some time. Once a certain level of use is exceeded (the level may differ from one place to the next and depend on the type of coral community), degradation of the coral reef and alteration of the community structure becomes evident. As a rule of thumb, the level of 5,000  6,000 dives per site per year should not be exceeded. Adequate training of diving skills and briefing on the fragile nature of the coral reef environment will promote responsible behaviour of snorkellers and divers and helps to minimise damage.    Box 1. Summary and conclusions diver and snorkeller damage.  4.2.1.2  Physical damage from motor boating and yachting  Physical damage to reefs and reef corals from motor boating and yachting can be caused by anchoring or boat groundings and has been described by several authors. Rogers et al. (1988) surveyed 186 boats during a three-month period in 1987 in the Virgin Islands National Park and Biosphere Reserve (VINP). Of those, 32% were anchored in seagrass and 14% in coral communities. Of the anchors found in coral 27% were causing minor damage and 12% were causing moderate to severe damage. The average size of the boats anchored in the park was 44 foot. The authors note, however, that an increasing number of about 200 foot long cruise ships begin to use the park waters with the potential of much more severe anchor damage. Not long after their 1987 boat survey, Rogers (1991) and Rogers et al. (1991) describe an incident whereby a 440-foot ship dropped anchor on a reef, caused a scar of 128 m long and destroyed virtually all living organisms in an area of about 290 m2. Eighteen months after the incident the scar is still very conspicuous. Rogers et al. (1991) also describe another incident whereby a mini-cruise ship of about 200 foot long violated park regulations by anchoring in about 4 m depth and damaged coral communities over an area of 5,300 m2. Since the ship drew almost 3 m, the prop wash dislodged small corals, gorgonians and sponges from the substrate and caused heavy sediment loading. Rogers (1991) estimates that 30,000 boats anchor in the park waters each year. The grounding of the M/V Wellwood on Molasses Reef in Florida in 1984 resulted in a 70-100% loss of live coral cover over a 1,282 m2 area. Half of that area sustained reef framework fracture damage (Hudson and Diaz, 1988). Although the Wellwood 18   was a freighter, the example is nevertheless mentioned here because very similar damage could result from the grounding of a cruise ship. The M/V Vetranic, a 475 foot freighter, went aground in 1998 on Pulaski Shoal, a coral reef in Fort Jefferson National Monument, Dry Tortugas, Florida, affecting an area of 16,000 m2 (mentioned in Rogers et al., 1991). In 1987 the freighter Mari Boeing ran aground on the reefs of Bermuda. Storm waves shifted the ship on the reef during three months before she was salvaged using blasting. The directly damaged area was estimated at 440,000 m2, with a peripheral zone of 25-50 m wide with a reduced population of surviving hard corals (Smith, 1985). Tilmant and Schmahl (1981) report that at least six boat groundings occurred during a three-year study of recreationally used reefs in Biscayne National Park, Florida. These groundings resulted specifically in damage to large coral colonies that reach relatively close to the surface. Reef degradation as a result of anchor damage and/or boat groundings is also a concern in Anguilla, Bahamas, Bermuda, Bonaire, British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Honduras (Roatan), Trinidad and Tobago, and US Virgin Islands (Rogers, 1985). SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS  The impact from anchor damage is dependent on the size of the boat (which determines the weight of the anchor and whether or not a combination of rope and chain or all chain is used). It is furthermore dependent on the type of coral community: branched and foliose corals will be damaged much more easily and by smaller anchors than massive corals. The impact from boat groundings can be severe and not only destroy nearly all living organisms in the affected area, but also fracture the reef framework. Recovery from boat groundings is slow and it is unknown if the original community structure will be restored. Most anchor damage can be avoided by installing permanent moorings and by designating specific anchorages for larger ships, while providing adequate information on such moorings and anchorages to users. Boat groundings can be avoided by navigational buoys and channel markers, but will probably continue to occur as a result of human error.       Box 2. Summary and conclusions boating damage.  4.2.2 Overexploitation of reef resources Overexploitation of reef resources results from unsustainable fishing and collecting practices in general and may not be considered an impact of tourism per se. However, tourists can contribute to the effect by engaging in fishing (usually sport  19   fishing) at their destination, by collecting shells, corals or other reef invertebrates, and by creating an increased demand for seafood and marine curio. 4.2.2.1 Fishing  Bohnsack (1993) reviewed the impacts of fishing on coral reefs. Direct impacts include the removal of organisms and habitat damage from destructive fishing practices. Indirect impacts can result from the removal of important components of the ecosystem, such as predators and herbivores, which can disrupt ecological relationships. Fishing can reduce population abundance, lower average fish size and age structure, and change species composition. Fishing tends to selectively remove the larger individuals because of their greater value for food, income and sport. Although reef fish population declines have been widespread and dramatic in many instances (see for example Bohnsack, 1993; Rogers, 1985), the relative role of tourism in this decline  either from tourist fishing activities or from increased demand for seafood  is unknown. However, it is fairly safe to assume that tourist fishing will hardly target reef fish, but rather pelagic species and will thus have a minimal effect on population decline of reef fish. Increased demand for seafood is a more likely factor impacting on reef fish populations and coral reefs in general. Grouper, snapper, spiny lobster and conch are popular items on the menus of Caribbean hotels and restaurants. Tourists will usually not be aware of local restrictions, such as size limits and closed seasons, and, where those restrictions are insufficiently enforced, tourists may be served undersized or out-of-season produce and thus unknowingly contribute to over fishing and population declines. 4.2.2.2 Collecting  In her review of Caribbean coral reef degradation, Rogers (1985) mentions only one area (the US Virgin Islands) where coral collecting is considered a human-related stress factor. Although the review does not cover all Caribbean states and territories, this is nevertheless an indication that coral collection is not a serious problem in the Caribbean region. Most information on coral and shell collecting is from the IndoPacific region and relates to trade rather than to collecting by tourists. Simmons and Associates (1994) write: ""The collecting of shells and coral souvenirs, either by tourists, or by locals for resale to tourists continues to have an impact on the environment in some destinations. Fortunately this practice is decreasing and is generally discouraged by those working in the tourism industry."" Since most in-water activities of tourists are organized or supervised, we will assume that collecting may occur incidentally but is not a factor of any significance. Marine curio, including species protected by local regulations or international law, continue to be offered for sale at several Caribbean tourist destinations. This demonstrates that there still is a demand for such products. However, with the increasing effectiveness of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of wild fauna and flora (CITES) and with the Protocol on Specially Protected Areas and Wildlife (SPAW) having entered into force, the demand is likely to decline further. Informing tourists on the provisions of CITES and SPAW will be especially effective in this respect.  20   SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS       Fishing is a cause of serious decline of reef fish populations in most of the Caribbean. The direct role of tourist in this decline is probably insignificant. Tourism contributes indirectly to the decline by creating an increased demand for seafood. Collecting of marine curio by tourists is probably insignificant. Tourism continues to create some demand for marine curio, but this demand seems to be decreasing. Greater awareness among tourists about the provisions of CITES and the SPAW protocol will further reduce the demand for marine curio.  Box 3. Summary and conclusions fishing and collecting impacts.  4.2.3 Nutrient enrichment Coral reefs are particularly susceptible to sewage pollution because of the delicate ecological balance maintained among a large number of species. The natural low levels of nutrients in tropical seawater are partly responsible for maintaining that balance. Sewage pollution disturbs that balance by nutrient enrichment, which will favour certain species, usually at the expense of reef corals, and will lead to alteration of community structure (e.g. Marszalek, 1987; Grigg and Dollar, 1990; Maragos et al., 1985). Other effects of sewage pollution include toxicity (from toxic materials or toxic by-products from pesticides, herbicides or heavy metals contained in sewage), sedimentation (suspended solids), high biochemical oxygen demand, and hydrogen sulphide generation (Grigg and Dollar, 1990; Pastorok and Bilyard, 1985). However, most of the impacts from sewage pollution on coral reefs reported in the literature relate to the nutrient enrichment rather than to toxic effects. The literature suggests threshold levels for dissolved inorganic nitrogen of 1.0 mM and for soluble reactive phosphorus of 0.1 mM (see for example Lapointe et al.). Other impacts of sewage pollution include a decline in growth rate of corals (in particular due to high concentration of suspended particulate matter; Tomascik and Sander, 1985), reduced calcification, and reduced settlement of coral larvae (Ward and Harrison, 1997). In her survey of coral reef degradation in the Caribbean, Rogers (1985) identified sewage as one of the human-related stresses in 9 of the 25 islands or areas for which information was available. There are several sources of sewage pollution related to tourism activities, including both point- and non-point sources of pollution, viz. discharges by recreational vessels, discharges of untreated or partially treated sewage by tourist resorts, seepage from septic systems and cesspits, and runoff or seepage of partially treated sewage used for irrigation (the latter may also contain fertilizers and herbicides). Clearly, the level of impact depends on the level of treatment of the discharged sewage and the degree of flushing occurring at the point of discharge.  21   4.2.3.1  Nutrient enrichment from sewage disposal by recreational vessels  Simmons and Associates (1994), in their study of the impact of tourism on the marine environment of the Caribbean, note that ""....the impact of liquid waste from yachts has been poorly studied in the Caribbean region. While it is very likely to have an effect on water quality in lagoons and semi-enclosed bays, its impact is probably small or negligible in open bays with adequate flushing."" Talge (1992) also touches on the issue of nutrient enrichment by diver activities and boat effluents. She raises the question: "".... But are the amounts significant and do they remain over and around the reef long enough to fertilise reef communities?"" These questions have remained unanswered to date. Although there is little doubt that sewage pollution leads to nutrient enrichment, which will favour species that outcompete corals and result in alteration of community structure (see introduction in 4.2.3), there are no scientific studies that demonstrate the link between these negative effects and sewage disposal from recreational boats. This statement must not be interpreted as an encouragement to allow disposal of raw sewage by recreational vessels. On the contrary, nutrient enrichment should be avoided wherever possible. The problem with eliminating sewage disposal from recreational vessels is that there must be a legal requirements for such vessels to have holding tanks, which in turn requires pumpout facilities in ports and marinas as well sewage treatment plants. This problem is exemplified by the situation in the US Virgin Islands. The Department of Planning and Natural Resources expects that in the long term all vessels over a certain size will required to have holding tanks (the legislation is already in place), marinas will be required to have pumpout stations, and live-aboard vessel will be required to dock at marinas. All parties concerned recognize that the problem needs to be addressed, but critics state that before these requirements should be put in place, other factors need to be considered, namely, the relative contribution of vessel-generated waste to overall sewage disposal, the capacity to treat sewage, health hazards, and oceanographic characteristics such as currents and flushing (Simmons and Associates, 1994). Theoretically cruise ships could contribute to nutrient enrichment by illegal discharges of untreated or improperly treated sewage. With the MARPOL Convention entering into force in 1988, this has become highly unlikely, especially while moored or anchored. Also, most cruise ships now have state-of-the-art on board waste processing facilities (see Simmons and Associates, 1994, for a more detailed discussion). Cruise line companies can be expected to do their utmost to maintain a good environmental track record. 4.2.3.2 Nutrient enrichment from sewage disposal by tourist resorts  The general impacts from sewage pollution as described in the introduction (4.2.3) can obviously also result from sewage pollution by resorts. Simmons and Associates (1994) mention that 80-90% of the sewage generated by land-based tourism operations is discharged in nearshore coastal waters without adequate treatment. This shocking figure is mentioned again in a study by the Panos Institute, based on an interview with the Caribbean Tourism Organization, CTO (Panos Institute et al.,  22   1996). However, studies that document the specific impacts of sewage pollution from resorts are limited. Bell (1991) describes the impact of wastewater discharges from tourist resorts in the Great Barrier Reef, Australia. Two of the most visited islands, Hamilton and Green Island, have discharged virtually untreated sewage in the sea for quite some time. The coral communities at Green Island have been largely replaced by algae and seagrasses. He also recognises the impact of discharges of secondary treated sewage and sludge from Townsville on the coral reefs of Magnetic Island, just off Townsville. He expects seepage from sewage on Magnetic Island to be disastrous for the already stressed corals. He concludes that tertiary treatment of sewage will be necessary to achieve acceptable levels of nutrients (after dilution) in the discharged effluent. In comparing these findings with the Caribbean, we must realise that mean background phosphate levels for the waters outside the Great Barrier Reef are higher than those reported for the Caribbean. Van Woesik et al. (1991) examined the response of coral communities to effluent discharge on Hayman Island, Green Island and John Brewer Reef in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. Except in the immediate vicinity of the sewage discharge outfall, they found no impact from discharge of secondary treated sewage from the resort on Hayman Island. On Green Island sewage from septic systems is subject to primary treatment before discharge. They attribute the increase in seagrass beds to nutrient enrichment from sewage discharge. At John Brewer Reef Floating Hotel (removed in 1989) treated sewage was transported and discharged 5 km off the reef and the only effluent discharged was brine from the desalination plant. Overall, coral cover increased in the vicinity of the hotel and the authors conclude that there was no detrimental impact of its placement or operations. They suggest that the impact of sewage discharges on coral communities is mostly dependent on the level and quality of treatment. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS      The most deleterious effect of sewage pollution is nutrient enrichment, which favours certain species (algae in particular) at the expense of corals. Tourism-related sources of sewage pollution include resorts and, to a much lesser extent, recreational vessels. A large percentage of sewage generated by tourist resorts is discharged in coastal waters without adequate treatment. The impact of nutrient enrichment from sewage pollution in general has been well studied, the specific impact of sewage pollution from resorts and recreational vessels only to a limited extent. The impact of sewage pollution depends largely on the level of treatment and the degree of flushing at the point of discharge.  Box 4. Summary and conclusions sewage impact.  23   4.2.4 Petroleum hydrocarbons Pollution by petroleum hydrocarbons (oils and fuel) is not an obvious problem associated with tourism, but small-scale spills may occur during fuelling of recreational vessels at sea or in marinas. Also, recreational vessels may discharge oil or oily bilge water either accidentally or knowingly. Again, there are no studies that link the impact of petroleum hydrocarbon pollution on coral reefs directly to tourist activities, but the literature provides information on such impact in a general sense. Controlled laboratory experiments have been conducted, as well as field studies on the impact of large spills and chronic oil pollution (the latter mainly in the Red Sea). Loya and Rinkevich (1987) and Grigg and Dollar (1990) reviewed the impacts of petroleum hydrocarbons on reef corals. There is evidence that (a) chronic exposure to oil pollution is more detrimental than a single exposure (as in spills)  unless the corals are coated in oil during low tide, which is not a severe threat in the Caribbean region, and (b) that dispersants or emulsifiers used to combat spills, as well as a mixture of dispersants and oil, are more toxic to corals than the oil alone. The impacts of chronic oil pollution include higher mortality rates of corals, a decrease in reproduction, and a reduction in the settlement of coral larvae. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS    Chronic oil pollution is more detrimental than a single exposure. Dispersants and emulsifiers are more toxic than oil alone. Chronic oil pollution increases mortality and affects reproduction and settlement.  Box 5. Summary and conclusions oil pollution impact.  4.2.5 Sedimentation Grigg and Dollar (1990), in their review of natural and anthropogenic disturbances on coral reefs, state: ""The impact of increased sedimentation is probably the most common and serious anthropogenic influence on coral reefs."" Increased sedimentation results primarily from dredging and runoff. Dredging, runoff or siltation were mentioned as one the human-related stresses on coral reef in Barbados, Bermuda, Bonaire, Costa Rica, Curaao, Dominican Republic, Florida Keys, Grenada, Guadeloupe, Jamaica, Panama, St. Lucia, British Virgin Islands and US Virgin Islands (Rogers, 1985). Rogers (1990) associates dredging in the Caribbean with construction of hotels, condominiums, runways, roads, harbours, navigation channels, military installations, and beach replenishment. She states: ""Unprecedented development along tropical shorelines is causing severe degradation of coral reefs primarily from increases in sedimentation."" Occasional concern is also expressed with inexperienced snorkellers kicking up sediment with their fins. Although this may cause a problem in localised areas, the effect has not been documented and is likely to be small compared to sedimentation resulting from dredging and runoff.  24   Background levels of sedimentation on reefs that are not influenced by human activities are between 1 and 10 mg per m2 per day (Rogers, 1990). Sudden exposure to heavy sedimentation may result in burying of corals, expulsion of the symbiotic algae from the coral polyps (""bleaching""), and subsequent death. However, certain species have the ability to actively remove sediment from their tissues. Rogers (1990) summarises the results of field and laboratory studies as follows: 1) Different species have different capabilities of removing sediment or surviving at lower light levels. 2) The coral's ability to remove sediment depends on the amount and type of sediment, which covers the coral colony. 3) Sediment rejection is a function of morphology, orientation and behaviour of a coral colony. Chronic exposure to higher concentrations of sediment can have a variety of negative impacts on corals, many of which can be attributed to reduced light levels. These include (Rogers, 1990): 1) Lower species diversity and absence of certain species. 2) Less cover by live coral. 3) Lower coral growth rates. 4) Greater abundance of branching forms. 5) Reduced coral recruitment. 6) Decreased calcification. 7) Decreased net productivity of corals. 8) Slower rates of reef accretion. Marszalek (1981) monitored the impact of a large-scale dredging operation for beach replenishment in Miami, Florida. He distinguished three types of impact: mechanical damage, sediment loading and increased turbidity. A substantial percentage of coral colonies showed signs of stress such as partial bleaching, polyp swelling and excessive mucus secretion. He suggests that sustained increased turbidity was more detrimental than short-term sediment loading. Van't Hof (1983) describes the effects of dredging and excavation (to construct a canal system and waterfront home sites in a limestone cliff) on the fringing reef in Bonaire. Dredging resulted in sediment loading of almost 100 times the background level, and a decrease in percent of live coral cover on the deep reef from 73% to 32%. Hodgson (1990) determined that sedimentation inhibited settlement of coral larvae on artificial substrate in a common Indo-Pacific coral species, thus potentially affecting coral recruitment under natural circumstances. Finally, reef degradation is also partly responsible for a decline of reef fisheries. Sedimentation can kill major reef-building corals, leading to the eventual collapse of the reef framework. The reduction in the percentage of living coral as well as the decrease in the amount of shelter that the reef provides leads to a decline in the number of reef fish and the number of species (Rogers, 1990).  25   SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS         Increased sedimentation is considered one of the major causes of reef degradation. Increased sedimentation is associated with coastal development in general, of which development of tourism infrastructure and facilities is an important component. Sedimentation results mainly from dredging and runoff associated with construction and beach replenishment. The main effects of sedimentation are increased turbidity (reduced light penetration) and sediment settling on corals. Sediment settling on corals leads to stress, bleaching, and in certain species- to death. Increased turbidity has a variety of negative impacts on corals, such as lower growth rates, reduced productivity, and reduced recruitment. Sedimentation can lead to changes in reef structure that impact negatively on reef fish populations. Developers, investors and decision makers need to be convinced of the trade-offs of stringent development guidelines and building codes as a means to reduce the negative impacts of coastal development on coral reefs.

Summary and conclusions sedimentation impact.  4.2.6 Solid waste There are two existing or potential impacts of solid waste disposal on coral reefs: leaching of toxic substances from landfills and dumps, which include waste from tourist resorts (this effect has not been documented), and accidental disposal of waste from resorts, recreational vessels, and cruise ships. Light plastic and aluminium items (cups, plates, bottles, bags, cans) are frequently blown into the sea by wind. The detrimental effects of plastics in the ocean are well documented (see for example Norse, 1993). In the context of coral reefs, we should mention smothering of corals by plastic bags and sheeting, entanglement of sea turtles and fishes in sixpack rings, and ingestion of plastics by sea turtles. In addition, litter and trash reduce, of course, the aesthetic aspect of the coral reef environment. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS    Leaching of toxic substances from landfills and dumps may impact negatively on corals. Plastics can smother corals; some marine animals ingest plastics or become entangled in plastics. Litter reduces the aesthetic aspect of the coral reef.  Box 7. Summary and conclusions solid waste impacts.  26   4.2.7 Compounded effects Simmons and Associates (1994), in their survey on the impact of tourism on the marine environment of the Caribbean, note that while St. Thomas and St. John, US Virgin Islands, represent one of the best examples to demonstrate that there is a definite negative impact of tourism on the marine environment, it is a compound effect and it is extremely difficult to attribute a decline in environmental quality to a specific tourist activity. They conclude: ""The reefs are generally in poor condition as a result of compound effects, including increased runoff and sedimentation from construction sites, sewage pollution, anchoring and other types of recreational use."" Bak and Nieuwland (1994) describe the decline in coral cover at two shallow depths on leeward reefs in Curacao and Bonaire, Netherlands Antilles. The decline ranged from 16 to 53% (loss of coral cover expressed as percentage of original percent cover) with little sign of recovery over the 19-year study period. In the absence of natural disturbances, the lack of recovery is ascribed to impacts of urbanization and tourism development such as increasing sewage disposal, construction at the shoreline, etc. Connell (1997), in his literature survey of disturbance and recovery of coral assemblages, expresses concern over the lack of recovery from decline in coral cover following both natural and anthropogenic disturbances in the Western Atlantic (as compared with the Indo-Pacific region). He attributes this to the relatively small, compact nature of the Western Atlantic region, which exacerbates the effects of intense human activities, combined with high nutrient runoff and construction from increasing coastal development. Other factors affecting recovery of coral reefs in the Western Atlantic are undoubtedly the occurrence of the white-band disease in the early eighties, which locally caused high mortality among Elkhorn and Staghorn coral (Acropora palmate and A. cervicornis), the massive die-off of the long-spined sea urchin (Diadema antillarum), and a reduction of herbivorous fish due to over-fishing. The lack of herbivores causes an increase in macro-algae and reduces the amount of clean hard substrate needed for coral recruitment. However, Lapointe et al. (1997) demonstrated that massive macro-algal overgrowth of the fore reef in Jamaica, which had been attributed to the reduced grazing due to over-fishing and the Diadema die-off, was clearly linked to increased nutrient levels and difficult to relate temporally to reduced grazing by herbivores. Muzik (1985), describes a dramatic decline in percent coral cover of reefs in the Ryukyu Archipelago, Japan. In the course of a decade the reefs appeared to be mostly dead or dying and the number of species decreased dramatically. The reefs had been heavily affected by predation by the Crown of Thorns starfish in 1974. Subsequent intensive development -not restricted to, but including tourism development- caused heavy sedimentation and runoff and resulted in further deterioration of the coral reefs.  27   4.3  Addressing the problem  Saving coral reefs is not just a matter of controlling or eliminating tourism impacts. Effects very similar to those of tourism are the result of increasing human population and development of the coastline adjacent to coral reefs in general. And these effects are not easily distinguishable from those of tourism per se. In addition there are natural phenomena which impact on coral reefs that also cannot always be distinguished from human impacts. The determination of the carrying capacity of coral reefs for direct and indirect human use is extremely complex and therefore not likely to produce any meaningful guidelines in the short term. Therefore the minimisation of those impacts that can be controlled should be a priority. Sediment loading can be reduced by developing and imposing development guidelines and building codes, nutrient enrichment can be reduced by installing proper sewerage systems and sewage treatment facilities, physical damage can be reduced by installing mooring buoys, designate anchorages and increasing awareness among divers, snorkellers and recreational boaters. Some of these measures are going to be very costly or will limit development options and raise the cost of development and will therefore not be popular with decision makers and investors. Mobilising public support through awareness building can contribute to the effective implementation of these measures.  28   5.... ANALYSIIS OF KEY ACTORS IIN THE TOURIISM 5.. ANALYS S OF KEY ACTORS N THE TOUR SM SECTOR:::: LEVEL OF AWARENESS AND POTENTIIAL SECTOR:: LEVEL OF AWARENESS AND POTENT AL BENEFIITS FROM CHANGE IIN BEHAVIIOUR BENEF TS FROM CHANGE N BEHAV OUR Based on the analysis of tourism activities and their impacts on coral reefs, the following key actors in the tourism sector can be identified:  The individual tourist  Those who cater directly to the tourist  Those who cater indirectly to the tourist Each of these is a composite group, the elements and characteristics of which are described and analysed separately.  5.1  The individual tourist  This group can be divided into two broad categories: a. Sun, sea and fun seekers. This group goes by a series of different names and is presumably by far the largest segment of Caribbean tourism. Cruise tourists are included in this category. Although a survey of this category was beyond the scope of this project, it was assumed that climate, quality of beaches and accommodation, as well as entertainment and shopping opportunities are the main deciding factors in the selection of their destination. It is therefore also assumed that tourists in this category are on average the least environmentally aware. b. Discriminate travellers, travelling divers, nature/heritage tourists. The quality of the natural and cultural environment, the level of crowding and sound environmental practices at the destination, are all important criteria within this category in the selection of their destination. We are therefore assuming that this category includes the most environmentally aware tourists. Irrespective of the level of awareness, any environmentally irresponsible or damaging behaviour among the individual tourist is usually easy to influence. Wrongdoing on the part of tourists is seldom intentional, but rather a result of negligence or ignorance. Raising awareness among this group where needed- will therefore have a relatively high result to effort ratio.  5.2  The direct caterers  This group includes the businesses that bring the tourists to their destination and those who lodge, feed and entertain them while they are at their destination. It can be divided roughly into: a. Travel agents, tour operators, transportation companies. It can be concluded from the available information that healthy coral reefs are important to this sector because 29   of the diving and snorkelling opportunities they provide, which comprises at least part of their business. The level of awareness among the clients (the tourist) as well among management and staff in the sector appears to be generally low. However, travel agents and tour operators readily identify tourism-related activities that impact negatively on coral reefs, such as motorised water sports, diving, breaking or collecting of corals, sewage disposal and construction. It was noted that these impacts are not directly related to the activities of this sector, but a result of the activities of other sectors. The sector also identifies clear benefits from increased awareness including ecological, financial and image-related. b. Hotels and restaurants. Hoteliers appear to be generally aware of the importance of healthy coral reefs for a variety of reasons including: attracting snorkellers and SCUBA divers, providing shoreline and property protection, nourishing beach sand, fish production, and indicators of general environmental health. They rate healthy reefs important to very important to their businesses, even at destinations that are not primarily SCUBA diving destinations. Hoteliers also appear to be well aware of many of the causes of reefs degradation, including sewage and solid waste disposal, runoff of pesticides and fertilizers, impacts of tourist activities including motorised boating, diver and anchor damage, walking on reefs or taking corals, and construction on or near the shoreline. The awareness among the hoteliers is generally higher than that of the guests. Hoteliers see clear benefits from increased awareness both from a perspective of marine ecosystem protection as well as from a business/financial/marketing perspective. Some point to the relation of healthy reefs with beaches and with raising environmental awareness in general. Other derived benefits from increased awareness relate to maintaining the economic value of healthy reefs for fish production and medicinal products. In interpreting these results it should be noted that hoteliers seem to be pointing the finger mostly at others and do not see their own operation as a cause for impact on coral reefs. This implies that, although they are convinced of the benefits of increased awareness, this ""increased awareness"" needs to be someone else's rather then their own. Over the last decade there has been a tremendous change in environmental attitude among hotel operators. In part this change has come about because of higher environmental standards expected by clients, and in part because of incentives offered through the industry (such as environmental audits and ""green"" certifications), which in turn can give the property a competitive edge. The major concern with the impact of hotels, however, remains the sewage disposal issue. It was not possible to confirm nor reject the 1994 and 1996 assertions that 8090% of Caribbean hotels continue to discharge sewage into the nearshore environment without proper treatment (see section 4.2.3.2). This remains a reason for grave concern, as it is not realistic to assume that hotel properties will take costly initiatives to resolve the problem by themselves, unless the authorities approach the sewage issue in a more comprehensive and global manner. Increasing awareness in the hotel sector is unlikely to make a difference here. There is little information on the level of awareness of Caribbean restaurants. As there are not incentives and certification programmes for restaurants, as they exist  30   for hotels, it can be assumed that the restaurants' main objectives will be to serve the client in accordance with the demand. Thus it remains possible that protected, undersized or out of season seafood species are being served and consumed in restaurants. Raising awareness within the restaurant sector is not expected to have significant results unless the awareness of the patrons is raised first. The greatest benefits can therefore be expected from changing the buying behaviour of the client through increased awareness. c. Water sports operators. This is again a diverse group, which includes the small operator who rents out a few jet skis from the beach, the fisherman who takes visitors out snorkelling or on a glass bottom boat trip, as well as the larger operators who offer SCUBA diving, snorkelling trips, day sailing, and a range of other activities. Marina operators and charter boat companies are also included in this group. The level of awareness among this group is clearly directly proportional to the relation of the activity with the coral reef. Activities that are taking place on the water, such as water skiing, jet skiing, wind surfing, and sailing, as opposed to those taking place in the water such as diving and snorkelling, are obviously less connected with coral reefs and the associated level of awareness of the caterers is expected to be less. SCUBA diving and snorkelling operators in the Caribbean generally have a very high level of awareness. While this statement is true for those at the management level in this sector, the awareness at the level of other staff is not necessarily as high, especially in some smaller operations. Dive operators generally give thorough predive briefings, which increase the level of awareness among their clients significantly. The awareness among the operators and the tourist divers depends somewhat on the type of destination; if the destination is primarily known for its diving, the level of awareness will be higher than when it is a ""secondary"" dive destination. Although few direct answers were received in the limited survey among this sector, it can be assumed that dive operators generally agree that reef degradation has occurred in the area of their operation; they attribute this to natural phenomena, sewage pollution and runoff from construction and development, and to a limited degree to diver damage. The tourist diver usually observes reef degradation only when they are experienced and are repeat visitors at a certain destination. Benefits of increased awareness will be both ecological and financial. In some destinations increased awareness will be most effective among government and private sector entities responsible for development, in others also among the dive operations themselves and their clients. Operators in the marina and yachting sector feel that coral reefs are important to them because reefs protect bays and harbours where their businesses are usually located and reefs provide a tourist attraction of economic significance. They are aware of certain negative impacts of marina operations and yachting, such as anchor damage, disposal of untreated sewage and possible toxic effects of anti-fouling paints2. They feel that the level of awareness is high among private yacht owners and lower among chartering yachtsmen and the businesses and operators in the sector. However, some yacht charter companies give thorough briefings to their customers, The owner of a large marine store wants to see a ban on the sale of tin-based anti-fouling paint, as non-toxic alternatives are available and none of his competitors would stop the sale of such paint wihtout a ban. 2  31   which include environmental aspects. Benefits from increased awareness will be ecological as well as financial.  5.3  The indirect caterers  This last group includes those who make political decisions on tourism and tourism development, those who provide the funds to develop the tourism infrastructure, as well as those who actually carry out the development. It includes: Politicians/decision makers (and their advisors), private investors, and financial institutions, such as commercial banks and development banks. This group has perhaps not been considered one of the actors in the tourism sector with impact on coral reefs, but this is certainly an oversight. Political decisions on the development of coastal tourism and the associated private sector investments have been  and continue to be in some island states and territories- the main causes for environmental degradation. This means in some instances totally uncontrolled development, in others ill-guided or ill-planned development. In most cases it means development of tourism infrastructure that has outpaced infrastructure development in general. Although this may be interpreted as a sign that the level of awareness among this sector is low, this is not necessarily true. The awareness may well be present, but tourism development policies in the Caribbean over the past decades have not been guided by sound environmental and ecological principles, but rather by political and economic motives. Whilst that is understandable from a political point of view, it is now beginning to backfire because of the environmental degradation and other changes that uncontrolled tourism development has brought about. Despite all the wonderful ads and deceiving brochures, destinations that have undergone environmental and cultural degradation will soon only appeal to the indiscriminate traveller (whose environmental awareness is low), while those that have opted for a more planned and controlled tourism development will be reaping the benefits of their policy in the 21st century. Almost every destination is trying to get on the eco-tourism bandwagon, irrespective of the product they are offering. The discriminate traveller of the coming decades will be increasingly environmentally conscious and will look for destinations that not only preach these values but also actually live by them. The benefits of increased awareness among this group are potentially very high. However, this group is extremely difficult to target, and, as long as there are no clear political and economic incentives to let tourism development policy be guided by environmentally sound principles, change in awareness will not create any sustained benefits.  32   Tourists  Benefits from increased awareness High; ecological Moderate; ecological Moderate; ecological and financial  Direct caterers  SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS Key actors Level of awareness Sun, sea and fun seekers Mostly low Discriminate traveller Mostly high Travel agents, tour operators, Mostly low transport companies Hotels Mostly high Restaurants Mostly low  Indirect caterers  Moderate; ecological and financial Moderate; ecological High in some sectors, moderate in Water sport operators High in some sectors, low in others others; ecological and financial Politicians/decision makers, private Difficult to assess; seemingly low Potentially high, but difficult to target investors, financial institutions due to opportunistic reasoning  Table 3.

In order to maximise the effectiveness we suggest to target the awareness campaign only to those actors whose awareness is mostly low and for which the potential benefits from increased awareness and change in behaviour are expected to be high. These are: the individual tourist, the water sports operators, and the politicians/decision makers and investors.  6.1  The individual tourist  Based on our assumption that the largest portion of Caribbean tourists has comparatively the lowest coral reef awareness, this group should be targeted as a matter of priority. The best medium to be used is probably a combination of text and graphics, with heavy emphasis on graphics. The messages that need to be conveyed include:   What are coral reefs and why are they important? What can you do as visitor to help protect coral reefs? a) When you go snorkelling or diving: do not stand or walk on corals, do not touch or break corals. b) When you go out on a boat: do not anchor in coral, do not spill any fuel or oil, dispose of litter properly and make sure no litter is blown overboard by the wind. c) When you are on the beach: dispose of litter properly and make sure no litter is blown into the sea by the wind. d) When you go shopping: do not buy any corals, shells, turtle products or black coral products (CITES, etc.). e) When you order food: make sure that you do not order any seafood that is either protected (turtles), under-sized or out of season (many countries have size limits and seasons for lobster and conch).  Nearly 100% of the tourists to whom we want to convey these messages will either stay in beach resorts or travel on cruise ships. The most suitable vehicles for dissemination are therefore the Caribbean Hotel Association, the Florida and Caribbean Cruise Association, the Caribbean Tourism Organization and the Caribbean Action for Sustainable Tourism.  35   6.2  Water sports operators and their clients  The level of awareness in this category varies between sectors and within sectors. We also find varying levels of awareness among the clients of water sports operators. In terms of developing awareness-raising tools this problem can best be addressed by developing a series of ""etiquettes"" that can be used to increase the awareness among both the operators and their clients. Since most of the impacts relate to physical damage from snorkellers or divers and anchoring on the one side, and to emissions of recreational vessels on the other, it seems most useful to develop etiquettes for snorkellers, divers and boaters. The messages to be conveyed are very similar to those described under 6.1 above, but more in depth. In particular the boating etiquette must address the use of permanent moorings, discharge of sewage while anchored or moored, and the use of holding tanks. Several marine parks have developed such etiquettes. Those of the Bonaire Marine Park provide an excellent example. The target audience for these messages include staff of water sports operators as well as their clients. The large dive operators and divers at the major diving destinations, who have the highest level of awareness, need the message much less than others. In order to have maximum effect the messages must get through to the smaller dive operators and their clients, and to water sports operators at destinations where diving is a secondary tourist activity. This complicates dissemination, as there is not a single dissemination vehicle through which all these groups can be reached. Dissemination will therefore need to take place through: a) Local tourism boards; b) Government agencies responsible for licensing water sports operators; c) Local associations of dive operators, water sports operators and boat operators; d) Marina Association of the Caribbean; e) Bareboat charter companies.  6.3 Politicians/decision makers, private investors, financial institutions It has been demonstrated that that coral reef degradation is caused by a number of factors, both natural and anthropogenic, which include tourist activities. There is only limited scientific evidence linking specific tourist activities directly to negative impact on reefs. However, development of the coastal zone in general -and tourism development in particular- with all its associated effects that individually can impact negatively on coral reefs, may well be the single most important factor contributing to coral reef degradation apart from ""natural"" impacts3. The complexity of the group that makes up the key actors responsible for planning, decision-making, and financing tourism development in the coastal zone, makes it quite difficult to develop effective communication tools and find appropriate distribution channels to send messages to them that will raise awareness and above all change behaviour. 3  Natural is placed in quotation marks here, because we are not sure to what extent diseases and disasters are natural or triggered by anthropogenic factors that may have upset ecological balance.  36   The basic message to convey is simple and straightforward: ""Coral reefs are a natural capital that, if used wisely, will yield a fixed interest in the form of sustained income from tourism and fishing. If not used wisely, the interest will go down as the value of the capital is diminished. Tourism development in the coastal zone over the past decades has been responsible for serious reef degradation because insufficient measures were taken to reduce or eliminate the negative impacts of such development. There is little time left to correct previous mistakes and save what is left of the precious capital."" Perhaps the most effective way to convey the message is to present case studies of ""failure"" scenarios in graphic format (video is probably the most effective). The selection of a case study will require some further study and so will the selection of dissemination channels. However, with the ""greening"" of the banking sectors, development banks and commercial banks may well be good vehicles to start with. Addressing this sector in a fully effective way may well be beyond the possibilities of the current awareness building project. As a possible alternative a poster depicting a ""failure"" scenario, widely distributed among government agencies and lending institutions, may have some value.  37   7... 7...

GX027-46-6622625	"Coastal Tourism in the Wider Caribbean Region: Impacts     and Best Management Practices       Report     Contents       Report in Word Format               CEP Technical Report No. 38 1997       All     CEP Technical Reports                  3. DETRIMENTAL IMPACTS OF TOURISM IN THE WIDER CARIBBEAN     Island Resources Foundation (1996a) developed a framework for the   identification of potential tourism impact on coastal resources, based on a combination of   the type of tourist activity and the geographic zone in which these activities occur. The   framework identified 252 potential impacts. If the systemic (planning) inadequacies are   ignored, the direct impacts from tourism on coastal resources result from factors that can   be assembled into five (5) large groups, as shown by Table 4.           Impacts from Waste     UNEP (1994c) identifies pollution as the factor presenting the greatest   threat to marine and coastal ecosystems and human health in the region; typifying those   pollution sources as:           Sewage       Oil hydrocarbons       Sediments       Nutrients       Pesticides       Litter and marine debris       Toxic wastes.         Sewage was identified as the largest single source of pollution. As   Simmons & Associates (1994) points out, 80-90% of the sewage generated across the   region is disposed of in the nearshore coastal waters without adequate treatment. A survey   of 14 CARICOM countries in 1992 found that hotels owned and operated 49% of the sewage   treatment plants (Vlugman 1992). While some hotels are connected to central sewage   systems, many dispose of the sewage effluent through sub-surface means. Additionally, it   is estimated that the water use and consumption by tourists is at least two to three times   larger than local residents.[     Disposal of sewage and sewage effluent in the coastal area contaminates   surface and ground water resources. In many cases, contamination of the marine environment   is immediate, as disposal takes place directly to the sea. Where sewage effluent is   discharged to wetlands (such as in Jamaica and St. Maarten), other resources are affected   before drainage to the marine environment.     Common impacts of sewage contamination include:           Nutrient enrichment of surface and groundwater       Deterioration of bathing and drinking water quality       Outbreaks of disease       Smothering of coral reefs by algal blooms       Increased turbidity and reduced salinity in coastal waters close to outfall pipes and       drains       Fish kills       Deterioration of the aesthetic quality of beaches and wetlands       Health problems       Odour problems         Improper disposal of oils and noxious chemicals create similar impacts   to those above. However, in this case, the remedial actions are more costly, and the   long-term implications for human health more complicated.           Table 4: Detrimental Impacts from Tourism                   Causal Factor         Source         Type of Activity                     Waste                             Hotels                           Cruise ships                           Yachts/boats                           Marinas                           Restaurants                           Laundries                           Shops                           Merchants/ vendors                                             Sewage disposal directly to coastal waters                           Sewage disposal to coastal wetlands                           Sub-surface disposal and irrigation of green areas using sewage effluent                           Solid waste disposal in coastal garbage dumps                           Solid waste disposal in unauthorised areas                           Disposal of used oils in drains and sewage systems                           Boat/engine operation and repair                           Inadequate sourcing of materials (food, products, etc.)                                     Recreation                             Hotels                           Beaches                           Clubs                           Individual operators                                             Water sports                           Nightlife                           Noise                           Illumination of beach                                     Mechanical Action/ Physical Change                             Hotels                           Marinas                           Piers/jetties/wharves                           Groynes / breakwaters                           Airports                           Roads / seawalls                           Boats                                             Landfilling                           Dredging                           Anchor damage and groundings                           Construction of facilities                           Beach construction                           Snorkeling/diving                           Sand mining                                     Resource Over-use/ Misuse                             Construction                           Beach repair/ construction                           Craft production                                             Over-fishing                           Sand mining                           Thatch harvesting                           Coral harvesting                                     Beach Management                             Hotels                           Public bbbeaches                                             Over-crowding of beaches                           Removal of dune vegetation                           Construction of protective structures                           Raking (grading)                           Removal of seagrasses                                            The impacts from solid waste disposal result from both legal and   illegal disposal sites. Illegal dumping of solid waste results in visual impairment of   areas, odour problems, deterioration of bathing and drinking water quality, and flooding   (from blocked drains). If the definition of solid waste is broadened to include abandoned   equipment and old vehicles, then the impact is much greater. In this latter case, resort   areas, wetlands, and recreational sites all contain varying quantities of this form of   solid waste.     In most countries of the Wider Caribbean, solid waste disposal sites   are located in areas with soils of high porosity. As such, leachate from the site,   including chemicals, enters the groundwater; finally reaching surface waters or the marine   environment. In the case of islands, most suffer from a lack of adequate space to site   disposal sites. Most sites are open dumps, and properly managed landfills are almost   non-existent. Due to the above, burning is often practiced. Unfortunately, burning also   creates adverse impacts through the generation of noxious fumes. Additionally, dumps   periodically emit noxious gases, which are produced from the breakdown of organic matter   under anaerobic conditions.     The matter of disposal of hazardous wastes is not given much treatment   in the literature. However, the dumping of hazardous wastes, especially waste from   hospitals, in municipal dumps is obviously cause for concern, for the same reasons outline   in the previous paragraph.     While the issues of the location and management of solid waste disposal sites are   broader than tourism, the industry generates a higher per capita volume of waste than the   domestic residential sector. Simmons & Associates (1994) quotes a number of sources   that indicate that cruise ship-generated waste varied from 0.32-3.5 Kg./person/day. In   contrast, PAHO (1996) estimates the per capita waste generation in Latin America and the   Caribbean as 0.5-1 Kg/person/day. While there is a perception that the solid waste figures   for land-based tourist operations are also higher than the domestic volumes generated,   there is no quantitative evidence on which to base an analysis. However, there is data on   use of water by residents vs. tourists.     Illegal disposal of solid waste from ships, especially cruise ships,   was considered a major problem in the region until the Wider Caribbean Area was declared a   Special Area under Annex V of MARPOL 73/78 in 1993. Solid waste from ships creates a   number of impacts, mainly:           Threats to marine fauna (ingestion, strangulation)       Physical degradation (accumulation in fish sanctuaries, fishing grounds, coral reefs,       etc.)       Visual impairment of beaches and other coastal areas       Problem for commercial and recreational fishing, and       Health (diseases, cuts, etc.).         The problem continues, but corrective efforts have been instituted   through the implementation of a project by the International Maritime Organization for   collection and disposal of ship-generated waste which should result in improvements in the   near future.           Impacts from Recreational Activities     The Caribbean was traditionally marketed as a place of sand, sea and   sun. This created a concentration of activities in the coastal area of each island.   Impacts include:           Concentration of sewage and other waste along coastal strips       Increased accidents in water sports activities       Increased deterioration of coral reefs, including dive sites       Increased conflicts with other resource users, especially traditional users       Erosion of beaches               Physical Change / Mechanical Action     Physical change is a constant feature of tourism projects, as most   concern some form of alteration of the environment to accommodate the desired facility.   These range from construction of airports, hotels, and marinas to creation of beaches,   sand mining, and removal of corals. The impacts of physical change include the following:           Loss of valuable habitats which act as breeding grounds for many species of animals               Scarification of landscapes       Increased flooding of coastal areas through the loss of wetlands               Deterioration of water quality through high sediment loading, interruption of current       movement in bays, and inadequate solid waste disposal       Erosion of beaches through improper placement of structures       Noise pollution       Loss of income by affected properties, enterprises, and resource users         Although permanent features in many cases, the impacts are most   pronounced during the construction phases. As such, many of these impacts can be prevented   by utilising better engineering designs, construction management practices, and improved   public sector planning and development control. However, many of the physical changes,   along with improper siting of structures, combine to increase vulnerability to natural   hazards (UNEP, 1989b, Nurse 1990).           Resource Overuse/Misuse     Resource overuse and misuse results from many causes, and is only   exacerbated by tourism in most cases. Changes in harvesting techniques for some resources   (e.g. mangrove - St. Lucia and Jamaica) and use of alternate materials (e.g. sand   production - Jamaica), should result in an improvement in the use of coastal resources.   Unfortunately, the development of alternate practices is greatly outpaced by the use of   destructive practices, and the resulting loss of coastal resources.     Additionally, misuses related to contamination of water resources, and   social conflicts resulting from increased competition for natural resources are likely to   continue for some time. These issues can only be dealt with through improvements in the   integrated planning and resource management systems.           Impacts from Beach Activities     The constant efforts to make the beaches bigger and more presentable   stem from the marketing of the Caribbean as a place of sand, sea, and sun. This very issue   is reflected in the fact that rooms located on beaches generally cost more than rooms   located elsewhere. In fact, many hoteliers will only develop lands that have direct access   to beaches, natural or man-made. Making beaches larger and more presentable (Table 4)   results in loss of sand, and ultimately beach erosion.     The issue of the carrying capacity of beaches has been debated for a   very long time. The issue of a minimum space requirement for some unspecified ""level   of comfort"" is outdated. Attempts to deal with the matter of carrying capacity on   beaches have highlighted the need for measurements which encompass factors relating to use   intensity (Manning 1996). However, these indicators need to be broadened to include   factors related to site vulnerability (grain size of sand, wave impacts, etc.).     The synergistic effects of the multiplicity of activities and impacts   listed above have only been alluded to, and this is an area which obviously requires more   examination. Additionally, the extent and duration of the impacts resulting from the   above-listed activities depend on the adequacy of the planning and development control   systems, availability of suitable alternatives, management of the operations (facilities   and activities), and consumer patterns, preferences, and expectations of the tourist.           3.1  Most Detrimental Tourism Practices     Any attempt to rank the importance of coastal zone threats will have to   deal with issues of size of the countries, sensitivity of the resources being impacted,   importance to national economy, duration and extent of the impact, reversibility of the   effect, and full cost analysis (revenue losses, expenditure for   prevention/rehabilitation).     The difficulty in ranking general coastal zone threats also holds true   for ranking most detrimental practices from tourism, especially when it is difficult to   separate tourism impacts from the impacts resulting from the activities of other sectors,   as well as the wider systemic inadequacies. An additional limitation to this analysis is   the fact that tourism as a sector is not clearly defined, and as such, its true size and   impact (positive and negative) is extremely difficult to determine. More importantly,   there is no clear sense of the level of degradation attributable to each factor, nor is   there any idea of the assimilative capacity of the Caribbean’s nearshore environment.     As such, this report will attempt to identify the most detrimental   practices without attaching any rank to said practices. The determination of most   detrimental practices will be based on the following factors:           Scale of the impact               Frequency of impact (sporadic versus chronic)               Ecosystem linkages and significance               Cost (lost revenue or rehabilitation costs).         Based on the above factors, the most detrimental practices related to   tourism in the coastal zone are:           Physical change/damage to habitats       Sewage disposal       Solid waste disposal               Physical Change/Habitat Damage     As mentioned above, physical changes to sites accompany the development   of almost every tourist-related facility; ranging from construction of airports, hotels,   and marinas to creation of beaches, sand mining, and removal of corals and seagrasses.   Such changes can have very far-reaching consequences, depending on the area impacted. For   example, loss of wetlands has several levels of impact (see Box 1 also). The immediate   (primary) impact seen includes loss of habitat for species of wildlife, including breeding   areas for fish, and export of sediments to the nearshore coastal environment. Secondary   level impacts could include; less fish recruitment to the reef fisheries due to loss of   nursery grounds, reduced tourism visits to the site because particular wildlife species   are no longer present or have deteriorated (e.g. coral reefs, property damage or erosion   from flooding, and smothering of corals and seagrass beds by the sediment. These secondary   impacts continue the chain of events, as all have resulting cost factors; either because   of lost tourism and fisheries revenues or because of damages from coastal erosion or   flooding.     More frequently, beach and sand dunes are destroyed during or for the   construction of tourism facilities. Inevitably, this results in severe beach erosion,   resulting in loss of amenity and damage to primary infrastructure and property, not to   mention remediation is usually costly, requiring the construction of shore protection   structures, and usually is not as effective as maintaining the sand dune in its natural   state.           Impacts from Sewage      The problems facing sewage disposal systems in the region have been   discussed above. Where those facilities without package plants usually possess systems   approved by the relevant regulatory agency, such systems usually dispose of the sewage   effluent into the soil. As such, both forms of disposal eventually enter the marine   environment. As with other sources of impacts, the impacts of sewage disposal occur in   several forms and at several levels.     Sewage effluent creates impacts from the nutrients (primarily nitrates   and phosphates), suspended organic matter, bacteria, and where there is direct input to   the sea, the fresh water itself. Coral reefs have evolved to thrive in very precise   conditions of low nutrients, normal saline conditions, specific sea water temperatures and   clear water. The sediment increases the turbidity in the water, effectively reducing the   sunlight reaching the corals. Additionally, it also smothers the corals, particularly if   sufficient herbivores are not present. and the decaying organic matter uses up the   available oxygen in the water column. The additional nutrients from the sewage effluent   support the rapid growth of algae, which smother the corals, particularly if sufficient   herbivores are not present. A dead or severely impacted coral reef provides less of a   habitat for fish and other reef-dwelling animals, and may start to break apart. The usual   results are; coastal erosion, reduced fish catch, and reduced tourism earnings from diving   and snorkeling.     In cases where freshwater sources (such as aquifers) are contaminated,   the cost of providing potable water to residents and tourists increase. There is no   information at this time to determine the impact of sewage and other pollutants on the   desalination plants operated by many of the Eastern Caribbean countries, though a number   of professionals have noted it as an area requiring investigation in the near future.           Impacts from Solid Waste           Solid waste disposal problems are pervasive and their effects affect both the national   and physical environment causing losses in wildlife, deteriorated human health, less   aesthetic value of a site and losses in revenue from less tourism. However, their effects   might not be as permanent as the other two priority problems. To a great degree, the   extent of the problem is dependent on the collection, monitoring, disposal and management   (i.e.) recycling, resuse, etc.) systems in place. The more significant impacts relate to   the possibility of leachate from the dumps reaching aquifers and the coastal waters. In   such a case, the problems enumerated for sewage would be compounded by the presence of   hazardous chemicals in the leachate. The second major problem concerns the loss of amenity   and the possibility of outbreaks of disease. Both impact on the local population as well   as on tourists. Marine debris resulting from improper solid waste disposal practices also   result in the loss of wildlife species such as seabirds, sea and marine mammals.

GX241-73-8885047	GOVERNORS PRESS OFFICE   Maryland Chesapeake Bay Grass Recovery Continues   Bay grass acreage increases 15 percent last year      Annapolis, MD (June 2, 1998) -- An important indicator of the Chesapeake Bays health is showing significant overall improvements in Marylands portion of the bay and its tidal tributaries, Governor Parris N. Glendening announced today.  The latest information from the Chesapeake Bay Program shows that 1997 bay grass acreage in Maryland has grown by approximately 5,000 acres, a 15 percent increase over 1996. Overall bay-wide acreage, including Virginia waters, increased approximately 9 percent since 1996.  The 1997 increase brings the total amount of bay grasses in Marylands Chesapeake Bay to nearly 39,000 acres, more than half the initial Bay Program goal to be reached by 2005.   These encouraging findings demonstrate that our long-term Chesapeake Bay restoration effort is working, said the Governor.  Our water quality improvements have allowed bay grasses to return to some of their historical areas and nurture the bays treasured living resources.  However, despite this very good news, the job is not complete.  Further reductions in nutrient pollution from all sources are needed to sustain this trend and meet our goals.   Bay grasses are important because they produce oxygen as well as provide food and habitat for a variety of creatures, including, crabs, fish and waterfowl.  Scientists recently demonstrated that young blue crabs may be up to 30 times more abundant in Chesapeake Bay grass beds than in unvegetated areas. Bay grasses also protect shorelines from erosion by reducing wave action, help absorb nutrient pollutants, and trap sediments that cloud Bay waters.  Nutrient pollution comes from many sources, including urban population centers and rural farmlands, noted Governor Glendening.  Every Maryland citizen can help reduce nutrients, and we encourage participation on locally-based Tributary Teams who are working on the most effective solutions in each area of the State.   Most bay tributary and mainstem areas in Maryland increased or maintained recent bay grass gains during 1997, according to the annual survey by Dr. Robert Orth of the Virginia Institute of Marine Science.  Along the Western Shore, the Gunpowder, Middle, Magothy, Severn, South and Potomac Rivers all showed significant increases.  The bays mainstem, north of Baltimore Harbor, also showed an increase.  Along the Eastern Shore, most of the growth occurred from the Honga River north to the Lower Chester River, especially in the outer embayments adjacent to the bays mainstem, where the 1997 survey showed an increase of more than 3,000 acres.   Additionally, the coastal bays are continuing the upward trend seen over the past several years.  The recently initiated Maryland Coastal Bays Program is ensuring that water quality and living resource issues are considered under a comprehensive management plan to maintain and improve these gains in the future.   A troubling finding was the continued decline in bay grasses in the Tangier Sound - Smith Island region.  This area, which held more than 15,000 acres in 1993, has lost over 7,000 acres since then.     This decline is of particular concern because this area held 44 percent of Marylands bay grasses in 1993, and now this percentage is down to 22 percent said Dr. Robert Magnien, director of Tidewater Ecosystem Assessment for the Maryland Department of Natural Resources (DNR).  We have learned in recent years that the bays recovery has not been even in all areas.  The Lower Eastern Shore has not experienced significant improvements in water quality and, in fact, there are indications that water quality has actually degraded in some areas.   DNR and the Chesapeake Bay Foundation (CBF) recently launched Bay Grasses in Classes, an innovative pilot project that involves elementary, middle and high school students in growing and planting bay grasses.  Nearly 1,000 plants were grown in classrooms by Baltimore and Howard County students and sown in areas along the Patuxent River late last month.  The project is part of DNRs Bay Grass Restoration Partnership, which enlists citizens, watermen, researchers, universities and non-profit organizations to restore bay grasses.  CBF developed the curriculum that teachers use in Bay Grasses in Classes lessons.

GX241-72-7919418	"Bay Clean-Up efforts Produce Results, Bay Grasses Increased in 1996      Annapolis, MD (April 14, 1997) Water quality improvements resulting largely from reductions in nutrient pollution helped Maryland achieve an increase of approximately 3,000 acres, or almost five square miles, in bay grass acreage in the Maryland portion of the Chesapeake Bay this year, Governor Parris N. Glendening announced today.  The 13 percent increase brings the total area covered by bay grasses in Maryland tidal waters to about 29,000 acres, more than doubling the acreage since record keeping began in 1984.   ""Seeing this direct effect underscores the importance of nutrient reduction efforts in improving the health of the Chesapeake Bay,"" Governor Glendening said.  ""Through programs like our Tributary Strategy Teams and our Riparian Forest Buffer Initiative, we are committed to working with farmers, wastewater treatment plants, local governments, and citizens to accelerate our efforts to restore the Chesapeake and help meet the goal of reducing nutrient pollution by 40 percent by the year 2000.""    Bay grasses are essential to the health of the Chesapeake Bay because they produce oxygen, provide food, and afford protection from predators for a variety of Bay creatures, including crabs and fish. Bay scientists recently showed young blue crabs may be up to 30 times more abundant in Chesapeake Bay grass beds then in unvegetated areas. Bay grasses also  protect shorelines from erosion by reducing wave action, absorb nutrient pollutants, and trap sediments.   The Governor pointed to the upper Patuxent river as a good example of how improvements in water quality can translate into more bay grasses. Water quality monitoring by the Department of Natural Resources in this river has shown improving habitat conditions for the grasses. As a result, the upper Patuxent has shown consistent increases in bay grasses since 1993.   The Maryland areas showing the largest acreage increase in bay grasses during 1996 were the upper Bay mainstem (the area between the Gunpowder river and the lower Susquehanna Flats), and the Bush, Gunpowder, Middle, Severn, upper Patuxent, lower Potomac, and lower Choptank rivers. The Maryland areas showing the largest acreage decrease in bay grasses were Tangier Sound, and the Elk, Bohemia, Sassafras, Chester, Manokin, and the Big Annemessex rivers. The areas showing a decline in bay grass acreage generally showed slight reductions in water quality, as well.   This year's increase in Bay grasses reverses a two-year decline, despite high water flows in 1996.  High flows generally send large amounts of sediments and nutrients into the Bay, clouding the water and reducing the amount of light available for underwater grasses.  The excess nutrients which flow into the Bay further reduce the available light by fueling algae blooms.  Fortunately for the bay grasses, the high flows in 1996 came during January and September, both noncritical growing times.   ""These plants are very, very sensitive to small changes in water quality,"" said Dr. Bob Orth, a Bay grass researcher from the Virginia Institute of Marine Science who is responsible for the annual bay grass survey.  ""Over a critical period, if the water quality is good, they are going to .... take off and grow.""    ""Bay grasses are important indicators of the Bay's health and a good measure of our progress,"" said Governor Glendening.  ""This year's increases in bay grasses demonstrate that Maryland's efforts to restore and protect Chesapeake Bay are having positive and dramatic results.""       Posted April 15, 1997"
GX261-23-7322234	MEMORANDUM Background Memo on Cruise Ship Issue From: Conservation Working Group To: Sanctuary Advisory Council Re: Proposed Resolution on Cruise Ship Discharges Date: January 23, 2003 Summary The attached resolution recommends adoption of a Sanctuary regulation prohibiting cruise ship discharges and initiating a Sanctuary education program for cruise line passengers and crew. Overview At its December 2002 meeting, the Sanctuary Advisory Council (SAC) voted unanimously to consider, at its February 2003 meeting, a resolution prohibiting cruise ship discharges within Sanctuary waters. In 2002, three large cruise ships visited Monterey Bay, raising significant community concerns about potential pollution of Sanctuary waters. Prior to the first cruise ship visit in May 2002; Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary (MBNMS) staff raised these concerns with the visiting cruise lines. In response, the three cruise lines (Princess, Royal Caribbean and Crystal) agreed to abide by a voluntary no-discharge policy within Sanctuary waters as well as to use recommended anchoring locations and follow the vessel traffic lanes. At the June SAC meeting in Big Sur, the Advisory Council voted to recommend that Sanctuary staff continue working with all cruise lines planning visits to the MBNMS to ensure continued compliance with a zero discharge policy. Thirteen cruise ship visits are currently planned for 2003 raising concerns about lack of an effective enforcement mechanism for preventing pollution from cruise ships. General Information on Cruise Ship Industry and Pollution The capacity of cruise ships in California grew by 67% between 1990-1998. Many of the ships in California waters transit the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary and a growing number are expected to visit the port of Monterey in coming years. Modern cruise ships, including the three that visited the Monterey Bay in 2002, and the thirteen expected to visit in 2003, are essentially floating cities, carrying thousands of passengers and generating enormous volumes of waste. However, cruise ship wastewater is not subject to the same stringent regulations as similar waste streams coming from land based sources. Unfortunately the cruise line industry has a history of illegal dumping in pristine natural areas around the world. In the past five years alone, major cruise lines have paid more than $50 million in criminal penalties for illegal  1   MEMORANDUM pollution. In recent years, major cruise lines have been convicted of illegal dumping involving raw sewage, oil, and other hazardous waste. Although disposal of oily bilge water and untreated sewage is already prohibited in the MBNMS, discharge of other wastes including graywater, treated sewage, ballast water and deck wash, may contribute to water quality problems in Sanctuary waters and there is strong evidence of cross contamination of waste streams on cruise ships, resulting in otherwise legal waste streams exceeding legal limits for pollutants on a regular basis. Cruise ship wastewater sampling data from Alaska (the only state that currently requires such testing) demonstrates that treated sewage from cruise ships is frequently not in compliance with treatment standards. In addition, the Alaska testing revealed that 75 percent of the samples taken from supposedly benign graywater were over five times the fecal coliform standard for sewage from treatment systems. In response to Alaska's legislation regulating cruise ship discharges (passed in 2001), some vessels have installed advanced wastewater treatment systems for treating black and graywater prior to ocean disposal. Because these systems are new, their ability to function effectively over time is yet untested. Furthermore, advanced wastewater systems require ongoing monitoring and maintenance to be effective. In August 2002, a ship with an advanced wastewater treatment system (Holland American's Ryndam) reportedly released tens of thousands of gallons of partially treated sewage in Juneau harbor when its system failed. Community Support for Prohibition on Cruise Ship Discharges in Sanctuary In recent months, the cities of Monterey, Pacific Grove and Santa Cruz, as well as the Santa Cruz and Monterey County Boards of Supervisors and the Central Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board have all gone on record supporting a prohibition on cruise ship discharges within MBNMS waters. Conservation and community organizations including the League of Women Voters (Santa Cruz, Salinas and Monterey Chapters), Save Our Shores, the Surfrider Foundation, Friends of the Sea Otter, Oceana, and The Ocean Conservancy, also support a prohibition on cruise ship discharges in MBNMS waters.  2   MEMORANDUM  Proposed Sanctuary Advisory Council Resolution Calling for the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary to Adopt a Regulation Prohibiting Discharge of Waste from Cruise Ships Within Sanctuary Waters Whereas, the designation document for the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary acknowledges that water quality is critical to health of its marine ecosystem, and Whereas, since Sanctuary designation, tremendous effort has been made by the Sanctuary, its partner agencies, and local jurisdictions to reduce land based sources of pollution; and Whereas, at the time of Sanctuary designation, vessel discharges (excluding oily bilge wastes and raw sewage) were exempted from the general prohibition on discharging materials into the Sanctuary; and Whereas, with the increase in visitation by large cruise ships to the MBNMS, it has become evident that this exemption may allow large volumes of untreated or inadequately treated wastewaters to be discharged by these types of vessels within the MBNMS with potential adverse impacts to Sanctuary resources and qualities, including the economies of coastal communities; and Whereas, the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary Advisory Council (SAC) believes that routine discharges from cruise ships - - all wastewater (including sewage and graywater), ballast water, water discharged through oil separators (bilge water) and all forms of solid waste - - can cause unnecessary and unacceptable harm to the marine resources of the Sanctuary; and Whereas, there is strong community support for a ban on cruise ship discharges within the Sanctuary; Be it hereby resolved that the Sanctuary Advisory Council recommends adoption of a Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary regulation to prohibit such discharges. The SAC further recommends that an education program be designed for the benefit of cruise lines passengers and crew that would highlight the unique protected resources of the MBNMS. For the purposes of this resolution, a cruise ship is defined as a commercial passenger vessel carrying more than 250 passengers and providing overnight accommodations.  3

LEASING, DEFERRAL, AND LITIGATION HISTORY OF THE PACIFIC OCS REGION The earliest offshore oil production in the United States was off Summerland, California (near Santa Barbara), in 1896, an extension of an onshore discovery made before 1894. The Submerged Lands Act of May 22, 1953, granted the coastal states a belt of submerged lands seaward of their coastlines to a distance of three geographical miles, or more, if there were evidence that the State had been given jurisdiction over a larger area before becoming a State. The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act of August 7, 1953, reaffirmed that, in general, those lands beyond the three geographical mile limit are subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Government for the benefit of the entire Nation. It further authorized the Secretary of the Interior to prescribe necessary regulations and to grant mineral leases for the OCS lands. The Pacific OCS Region has been the subject of twelve OCS sales, which will be briefly described below. Phosphate Lease Sale, December 15, 1961 In January 1961, Collier Carbon & Chemical Corporation requested that phosphate leases be offered offshore San Clemente Island off California. The Navy told the Department of Interior (DOI) that the area proposed was only 10 miles from an explosive dumping area; however, they would consent to the leasing with reservations. The Call for Nominations was issued on July 17, 1961 offering portions of 16 blocks in 600 feet of water, 40 miles off the coast of California between San Diego and San Clemente Island. Collier was the only company that submitted nominations, and the only company that bid at the sale held on December 15, 1961, in Los Angeles. Collier was awarded leases on the six tracts upon which they bid, and began exploration immediately. Officials from the Gulf of Mexico Office and Headquarters conducted the sale; the lease files were then sent to Washington, D.C. In March, 1962, Collier discovA1-3  ered live ammunition from Navy target practice on their leases. They asked the Navy if mining operations could safely be conducted. The Navy responded that unexploded projectiles probably did exist on the ocean floor, but they could not survey the area or remove the ammunition. Collier suspended exploration, and requested they be reimbursed by the Government for the bonuses, lease rentals, and exploration expenses they had incurred. The U.S. Geological Survey stated that Collier should have been aware of the target practice area, and recommended the claim be rejected. BLM then recommended the same to the DOI Solicitor and to the Secretary of the Interior. Collier relinquished the leases in October, 1963, but did not waive their claim. The General Accounting Office disallowed Collier's claim in December, 1963, but Collier appealed, and in April, 1965, the U.S. Comptroller General authorized payment to Collier of $137,120, which covered all bonuses and rentals paid, but no reimbursement for exploration. Later in 1965 and in 1969 two companies expressed interest in phosphorite leasing in Southern California, but the Bureau of Mines stated that it was not economically viable at the time. Sale P-1, May 14, 1963 The Call for Nominations for this 1963 Sale, the first offshore California, was issued from Headquarters in January, 1962, and included approximately 4 million acres offshore Central and Northern California. One hundred seventy-four blocks (approximately 900,000 acres) were nominated. To avoid conflict with San Francisco Bay shipping, no blocks were offered between San Francisco and the Farallon Islands. Also deleted, at the request of the Department of Defense and to avoid conflict with shipping were blocks off Vandenberg Air Force Base and Point Arguello and blocks opposite Arcata and Humboldt Bays. Stipulations were applied to some blocks: a Defense Department Suspension of Operations, one stating no pipelines in the Point R eyes National Seashore area, and one disallowing drilling or   Delineation Drilling Activities Offshore Santa Barbara County  production activities above the ocean bed in the San Francisco Bay Area. A total of 129 tracts were offered, and 57 (312,945 acres) were leased. Seventeen blocks were leased in the Eureka area, 10 in Point Arena, 24 in the San Francisco area, and 6 in the Santa Maria Basin. Twenty exploratory wells were drilled on 17 leases, but the high production and transportation costs determined that Monterey Formation oil would not be economic in the offshore environment at that time. All of the leases from the sale were relinquished prior to the expiration of their five year terms. Sale P-2, October 1, 1964 The Call for Nominations for the first OCS sale in the Pacific Northwest, published August 14, 1963, covered 1,676 blocks (9.5 million acres) offshore Oregon and Washington. There were 650 blocks (3.5 million acres) nominated by six companies. Some blocks nominated in the Cape Flattery, Copalis Beach, and Coos Bay areas were deleted because they fell within Department of Defense concerns, and tracts off northern Washington were not offered because of the disputed international boundary. One hundred ninety-six blocks (1.1 million acres) were offered in the sale; all with the Department of Defense stipulation agreeing to suspend operations at the request of the U.S. Navy. One hundred one blocks were leased. Offshore Oregon in the Tillamook Area 13 were leased, 31 in the Newport Area, and 30 in the Coos Bay Area. Offshore Washington 9 were leased in the Cape Flattery Area, and 18 in the Copalis Beach Area. Eight exploratory wells were drilled offshore Oregon, and 4 offshore Washington, on a total of ten leases but none were deemed to be economically producible. All leases were relinquished between 1966 and 1969. Sale P-3, December 15, 1966 One block in the Santa Barbara Channel was offered in this Drainage Sale, when it was determined that probable drainage of oil and gas was imminent because of production on an adjacent State of California lease. Seven bids were received; the lease was issued effective January 1, 1967, and first production from Platform Hogan was reported June 10, 1968. A second platform, Houchin, reported first production April 28, 1969; and the lease, OCS -P 0166, is still producing.  Sale P-4, February 6, 1968 The Call for Nominations was issued on December 29, 1966, covering 144 blocks (approximately .8 million acres) in the Santa Barbara Channel. All acreage nominated was offered with the following exceptions; 1) a special two-mile ""buffer zone"" along an eighteen mile stretch paralleling the boundary of the State of California's Santa Barbara Sanctuary to protect the sanctuary from drainage, 2) 14 blocks located in waters deeper than 1,200 feet that received only single nominations, and 3) two blocks and portions of two other blocks that might be involved in future jurisdictional questions with the State of California. Of the 110 blocks offered in the Sale, 75 received bids, and 71 leases were awarded. One hundred fortytwo exploratory wells and 392 development wells have been drilled on these leases, and there are eleven producing platforms. There was extensive litigation and suspensions on these leases as a result of the February 1969 oil spill from lease OCS -P 0241. The lease terms of the five leases that were drilling at the time of the oil spill were extended by the number of days their actions had been suspended. As of December, 2000, 26 leases from this sale remain active: 13 are in the producing Santa Ynez Unit, 7 in the producing Santa Clara Unit, 1 in the producing Pitas Point Unit, 2 in the producing Point Hueneme Unit, and 2 leases are not in units but producing. Sale 35 - December 11, 1975 The Call for Nominations, issued in January, 1974, covered 1,424 blocks, approximately 7.7 million acres. The Call area excluded Santa Barbara Channel, but included areas in the San Pedro Channel southward and eastward from Ventura and southward and westward from the Channel Islands. The area extended as much as 110 miles seaward, and included substantial areas of deep water. Seventeen companies nominated 1,350 blocks; however, only 297 blocks, covering approximately 1.6 million acres were studied in the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), the first EIS prepared by the Pacific OCS Region, after enactment of the National Environment Policy Act 1969 (NEPA). All blocks in the Santa Monica Bay were deferred from consideration, as were blocks south of San Miguel Island. A three-quarter mile buffer zone was established adjacent to State waters. The State of California, the Southern California Association of Governments, the County of Los Angeles, and the California Coastal Zone Conservation Commission filed two suits contending that the DOI failed to comply with NEPA in the preparation of the Sale 35 EIS's and that Sale 35 will have direct and A1-4   Appendix for Chapter 1  significant impact upon environmental quality of the coastal zone of Southern California. On December 5, 1975, Judge Williams determined sufficiency of the EIS's challenged, and that it was inappropriate to enjoin Sale 35; Judge Robinson, ruling on the latter issues, stated that his case was bound by Judge Williams' decision. Of the 231 blocks (1,257,593 acres) offered, 70 were bid on, 14 were rejected, and 56 (310,049 acres) were leased. Four leases, on which there are four platforms, remain active within the Beta Unit. One platform is used for processing only, the other three are producing; the first, Ellen, since January, 1981. Sale 48 - June 29, 1979 The Call for Nominations, covering 2,505 blocks (14.1 million acres) in the Southern California Bight Area, extending 190 miles seaward from Point Conception to the Mexican border, was issued on July 16, 1976. Seventeen companies nominated 970 blocks; however, only 217 blocks were studied in the EIS. Three months before the June sale, Secretary of the Interior Andrus deleted 69 blocks: 26 offshore Dana Point and San Diego; 3 off Santa Barbara Island; 21 off northern Channel Islands; and 19 because of conflicts with shipping lines, geologic hazards, and Department of Defense. After the Final Notice of Sale was published, Energy Action Educational Foundation and 13 other individuals and organizations, including the City of Long Beach and the California State Lands Commission, filed suit to prohibit all future OCS lease sales until the Department of Energy (DOE) promulgated regulations implementing alternative bidding systems authorized by the OCSLA Amendments. In a separate action, the group sought a preliminary injunction blocking Sale 48 for the above same reasons. On June 27, 1979 (two days before the sale), District Judge Robinson, Jr. denied the group's motion for a preliminary injunction. The next day the appellants filed a motion to restrain the DOI from awarding cash bonus-fixed royalty leases under Sale 48; this motion was also denied by the District Court. After the lease sale, the appellants again appealed stating that the Secretary of the DOI had failed to experiment with the bidding systems that do not use the size of a cash bonus as the bidding variable. The Court of Appeals ruled in their favor, but the United States Supreme Court reversed the judgment of the Court of Appeals December 1, 1981. Fifty-five of the 148 blocks offered at Sale 48 were bid on; only one of those was rejected. Nine leases remain active and are in four units. Two are in the producing Santa Ynez Unit. One is in the producing Pitas Point Unit. Two are in the producing Point Arguello Unit. Four are in the non-producing Sword, Unit. A1-5  Sale 53 - May 28, 1981 The Call for Nominations and Comments for Proposed Sale 53 offshore Central and Northern California was issued November 29, 1977. The Call area included 2,036 blocks (10.7 million acres), from Eureka in Northern California to Point Conception, seaward to 70 miles in water depths to over 12,000 feet. Of the 1,743 blocks (8.4 million acres) nominated by 27 companies, 242 blocks comprising 1.3 million acres were selected for environmental study. The tracts were in five geologic basins: Eel River Basin offshore Eureka; Po int Arena Basin offshore Mendocino County; Bodega Basin offshore Sonoma and Marin Counties north of the Point Reyes National Seashore; Santa Cruz Basin north of Monterey Bay; and the Santa Maria Basin offshore northern Santa Barbara County and San Luis Obispo County. In October, 1980, Secretary of the Interior Andrus released the Proposed Notice of Sale for Sale 53, offering only 115 tracts in the Santa Maria Basin. However, in February, 1981, the new Secretary of the Interior Watt reissued a Proposed Notice of Sale with all five basins again included for consideration. When the Final Notice of Sale was published, only 111 tracts in the Santa Maria Basin, were offered. Secretary Watt said that a decision regarding the other four basins would be made later. A suit was filed by the State of California and the following California agencies: Coastal Commission, Air Resources Board, Resources Agency, Department of Fish and Game, and Department of Conservation. A similar suit was also filed by the Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., Friends of the Sea Otter, and the Environmental Coalition on Lease Sale 53. The suits sought to prevent 34 of the 115 tracts from being offered in the Sale on the grounds that the leasing of those tracts was inconsistent with California's federally approved Coastal Management Plan, and requested that a consistency determination be conducted by the DOI. Other grounds cited in the suits were deletion of 34 southern tracts to protect the Southern sea otter, and other marine life such as the gray whale, seabirds and fisheries; 31 tracts to protect recreation and tourism; 11 tracts to protect against geological dangers; and 14 tracts based on considerations of marine safety and the potential impacts of tanker accidents. A preliminary injunction was issued May 28, 1981, by the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, enjoining the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) from accepting or rejecting any bids or issuing any leases on 32 tracts in the Santa Maria Basin. The BLM (now MMS) was allowed to receive, open, and conduct internal administrative review of bids on those tracts, as well as on all others. Forty-three companies participated in the sale, submitting a total of 301 bids on 81 tracts. The high-   Delineation Drilling Activities Offshore Santa Barbara County  est bid on a single tract, $333.6 million, is still a National OCS sale record. BLM was enjoined from awarding leases on bids received on 21 tracts in the northern part of the basin pending determination of a Federal Court's Temporary Injunction. Of the 81 tracts receiving bids, 60 were outside the area of litigation, and 54 of those were leased. In July, 1981, the Preliminary Injunction was modified; 2 tracts were withdrawn from the litigation. One of the bids was rejected, the other was leased. A month later, Secretary Watt announced that because of the appeals pending on Sale 53 litigation, the other four basins would not be offered. In May, 1984, the U.S. Supreme Court dissolved the injunction, ruling in favor of the DOI by determining that lease sales are not subject to consistency determinations. By that time, the price of oil had fallen, and the majority of the companies who bid on the litigated tracts decided to forfeit their one-fifth bonuses, rather than pay the four-fifth balances due. The bonuses on twelve leases, amounting to $41,081,734.40, were forfeited by ten companies. Two bids were rejected, and five leases, on the northern edge of the Santa Maria Basin. Twenty-one discoveries have been announced on the other Sale 53 leases. One of the first, in October, 1982, announced a giant offshore oil field 7 miles west of Point Conception, holding at least 100 million recoverable barrels of oil: Of the 33 remaining active leases, 37 are in approved units, three of which are producing. Sale 68 - June 29, 1982 The Call for Nominations and Comments for this proposed Southern California sale was issued December 28, 1979, covering 2,900 blocks (16.3 million acres) seaward 135 miles from Point Conception to the Mexican border. Two areas were specifically deleted from the Call: blocks from 3 to 30 miles offshore Dana Point and San Diego to the Mexican Border, and blocks in the Santa Barbara Channel immediately north of the Channel Islands. Of the 609 blocks nominated, 218 (1.1 million acres) were selected for inclusion in the EIS, and 164 were offered in the Final Notice of Sale. Suits were filed by the State of California, who was joined by the cities of Los Angeles, Santa Monica, Beverly Hills, Manhattan Beach, Torrance, San Clemente, Newport Beach, and Laguna Beach, and the Sierra Club, and by a coalition of independent oil and gas companies, known as the ""Pauley Group,"" made up of Pauley Petroleum, Inc., Derby Refining Co., Mesa Petroleum Co., and Husky Oil Co. Twenty-four blocks were deleted just prior to the sale, after the U.S. District Court and the Appellate Court ruled in favor of the State of California and other A1-6  plaintiffs that certain portions of the sale area were not in accord with consistency requirements of the California Coastal Zone Management Plan, and that ""full and careful consideration"" was not given to the Governor's comments to the Proposed Notice of Sale. This case was pending until the Sale 53 litigation was resolved. That decision, in 1984, by the U.S. Supreme Court, ruled that lease sales are not subject to consistency determinations. Thirty-five of the 140 blocks offered were bid on, 29 were leased, and three remain active. Two have been incorporated into existing units (one of which is the producing Santa Ynez Unit. and the other two make up the Gato Canyon unit. RS -2 (R eoffering Sale) - August 5, 1982 No Call for Nominations and Comments or EIS was required for this second reoffering of OCS tracts not leased in the previous year. Thirty-seven tracts from the Pacific OCS Region's Central California Sale 53 were included in the Proposed Notice of Sale; however, since ten of those tracts were the subject of Sale 53 litigation still unresolved, only 27 blocks were actually offered at the August sale held in Washington, D.C. On July 19, 1982, the State of California and the California Coastal Commission filed suit against the DOI seeking to enjoin the offering of two tracts. They alleged that the Secretary of Interior violated 1) Section 19 of the OCSLA by not adopting all of the Governor's recommendations; and 2) the NEPA and CEQ regulations by failing to discuss and assess new information in the environmental assessment. The court dismissed the suit as moot. Bids were received on twelve of the 27 blocks; two bids were rejected. On the ten blocks leased, only one well has been drilled. That was on one of the leases that have since been relinquished. Two other leasess within an existing unit remain active. Sale 73 - November 30, 1983 When the Call for Nominations and Comments was issued November 28, 1980, the Call area stretched from the California-Oregon border on the north to the United States-Mexico border on the south, approximately 4,500 blocks (24.1 million acres). The following areas were excluded from the Call: the Dana PointSan Diego tracts omitted from Sale 68; the Santa Monica Bay and Federal Ecological Preserve tracts; the recently designated Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary; tracts in the Bodega, Santa Cruz, Point Arena, and Eel River Basins deleted from Sale 53; tracts within three geographical miles of state waters from the town of Big Sur north to the Santa Cruz basin tracts also excluded from Sale 53; and   Appendix for Chapter 1  tracts in the vicinity of the Point Reyes Wilderness Area removed from oil and gas activity by the OCS Lands Act Amendments of 1978. Approximately 2,800 blocks (15.1 million acres) were nominated offshore California; however, in July, 1981, Interior Secretary Watt announced a new proposed five-year oil and gas leasing program at which time Sale 73 was designated as a Central and Northern California sale. In May, 1982, BLM Director Robert Burford said that the Sale 73 environmental impact statement would cover areas from 3 to 75 miles off the California coast, from Point Conception north to the Oregon border, excluding the four Northern California Basins. In December, 1982, however, the Appropriations Bill for Fiscal Year 1983 was approved. This restricted the DOI from any leasing north of the vicinity of Morro Bay, which was the northern border of the Region's active leases. Prior to the Final Notice of Sale, 121 tracts were deferred as a result of consultation with the Department of the Navy, and 22 as a result of the Memorandum of Agreement with the State of California. One hundred thirty-seven tracts covering about 770,000 acres were offered at the Sale; however, a preliminary injunction had been issued preventing the opening of the bids, pending disposition of the State of California's lawsuit regarding ""consistency determination."" This injunction was stayed on December 20, 1983, and the bids were opened and announced. Eight tracts were bid on, none were rejected. On January 11, 1984, the Supreme Court of the United States held that ""Interior's sale of OCS oil and gas leases is not an activity `directly affecting' the coastal zone within the meaning of Sec. 307(c)(1), and thus a consistency review is not required under that section before such sales are made."" The Sale 73 leases were then issued. All Sale 73 leases have been relinquished or terminated. No wells were drilled on any of the leases. Sale 80 - October 17, 1984 The Call for Information and Nominations was issued November 23, 1982, covering 4,100 blocks (22.4 million acres) seaward 130 miles offshore Southern California, between Point Conception and the U.S.Mexico Border. The only areas deleted from the Call were the Santa Barbara Channel Ecological Preserve and Buffer Zone and the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary. Over 2,300 blocks (11.6 million acres) were studied in the EIS. The Appropriations Bill for FY 84, approved November 4, 1983, included a Congressional moratorium that covered from the State's three mile line to 20 miles offshore both San Diego and Orange Counties, and from 3 to 27 miles offshore Los Angeles A1-7  County, including Santa Monica Bay. In addition, some 1,295 whole and partial blocks were excluded because of Department of Defense concerns, and 18 others, at the request of the State of California, near the border of Ventura and Los Angeles Counties and surrounding the southern portion of Santa Catalina Island. Of the 657 blocks (3.1 million acres) offered in Sale 80, 25 blocks were bid on, and 23 were leased. One lease is still active and is part of the Cavern Point Unit. No drilling has occurred on this lease to date.   Appendix 1.2 Ownership Suspension History, Lease Stipulations, and Exploration History.

HISTORY OF STATE OF CALIFORNIA OFFSHORE OIL AND GAS DEVELOPMENT/ LEGISLATION Initial Development Significant California oil development began onshore in the 1860's and expanded rapidly through the turn of the century. The first ""offshore"" development began from wooden piers extending out from a developed onshore oil field in Santa Barbara County. This early coastal oil development was originally ""regulated"" only by the private individuals and companies that owned property along the coast, and suffered from wasteful and polluting drilling practices. Furthermore, onshore and pier development was rapidly draining the oil reservoirs that underlay the submerged lands of the ""marginal sea""-the three-mile wide band of ocean area adjacent to the coast traditionally understood to be the property of the ""sovereign"" coastal states. The first oil well was drilled into the California tidelands at Summerland, Santa Barbara County in 1896. Access leases were acquired from the littoral landowners, and by 1906 approximately 412 wells had been drilled along the beach and from wooden piers extending out into the tidelands. At that time there were no state laws governing the extraction of oil and gas from state-owned lands. The State of California first responded to this coastal oil development in 1915 when the legislature created the Division of Oil and Gas-now the Division of Oil, Gas, and Geothermal Resources (DOGGR)-as a branch of the State Mining Bureau. Tidelands Leasing Act of 1921 The California legislature passed a statute in 1921 that asserted the state's sovereign authority over all minerals on state lands including the marginal sea (Chapter 303, Statutes of 1921). This law allowed the California State Surveyor General to issue prospecting permits and oil development leases with a 5% royalty provision for state lands in coastal waters. State Lands Act of 1938 The legislature closed its coastal waters entirely to new offshore oil and gas development in 1929 beA1-22  cause of continuing pollution and depletion of the oil resources under state waters (Chapter 536, Statutes of 1929). Nevertheless, the drainage of the state's oil resources from preexisting onshore wells continued. In the City of Huntington Beach, town-lot drilling was freely permitted immediately adjacent to the tidelands, and in 1932 a trespass well was directionally drilled from an onshore surface location to a bottom-hole location offshore. The state, in 1934, entered into leases with the operators of the trespass wells in compromise of litigation. The need for a more comprehensive law governing offshore oil and gas development to protect tide and submerged lands against drainage from onshore drilling became increasing apparent, and on June 11, 1938, the State Lands Act became effective (Stats. 1938, Ex. Sess, c.5, p. 38, sec 131). This act created the State Lands Commission and assigned it jurisdiction over all stateowned tide and submerged lands and administrative control over any remaining state interest in granted tide and submerged lands. Another of the more important provisions of the 1938 Act restricted the leasing of tidelands to those lands that were being drained of oil or that were under threat of being drained by wells on adjacent lands not owned by the state. Establishment of Federal Jurisdiction A jurisdictional dispute concerning the ownership of coastal submerded lands arose as new technology for developing offshore oil resources in increasingly deeper waters became available. This dispute was resolved in 1953 by two Congressional statutes that clarified federal and state rights and responsibilities for the ""continental shelf "" (the submerged lands extending from the coastline to the edge of the continental slope). The Submerged Lands Act of 1953 (43 U.S. C sec. 1301 et seq.) affirmed the coastal states' assertion of ownership of the submerged lands and resources within a three mile belt seaward of the line of low tide. The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act of 1953 (OCSLA) established that the submerged lands and resources of the outer continental shelf (OCS) or beyond three miles, ""appertained to the United States and [were] subject to its jurisdiction, control, and power of disposition"" (43 U.S. C. sec. 1331 et seq.). Cunningham-Shell Act of 1955 In 1955 the legislature passed the CunninghamShell Tidelands Act (Chapter 1724, Statutes of 1955). Under the 1938 Act, there was no exclusion of any state property from leasing provided that probable drainage of oil or gas from state lands was established. In contrast, the 1955 Act limited the application of its general leasing provisions to tide and submerged lands   Appendix for Chapter 1  along the coast between the northerly boundary of the City of Newport Beach in Orange County and a point six miles south of the town of Oceano in San Luis Obispo County (i.e. near known onshore productive oil and gas areas in Southern and Central California). Certain scenic lands along the coasts of Los Angeles, Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties and the islands of San Clemente and Catalina were excluded from leasing under the provision except when subjected to probable drainage from wells drilled upon adjacent lands owned by others. The remainder of the coast was excluded from leasing unless threatened by drainage. In 1963 the area available for offshore oil and gas leasing was expanded to include additional tracts as far north as the Oregon border. The 1955 Act and the amendments in 1957 established the basic parameters under which most of the state's offshore leases were issued. For information on the status of State leases ""Report to the State Lands Commission On The Status of State OffshoreOil and Gas Leases"", 9-03-99, is available at http://www.slc.ca.gov/Reports/default.htm.    Ensure the protection of the human, marine, and coastal environments; uitable return for these resources; and   Ensure that the public receives a fair and eq Ensure that free-market competition is maintained. Within the U.S. Department of Interior, MMS is charged with the responsibility of managing and regulating the development of OCS oil and gas resources in accordance with the provisions of the OCSLA. The MMS operating regulations are presented in Chapter 30, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 250. The MMS responsibilities and procedures in this regard are described in Section 1.5.2. The OCS Lands Act extends the authority of the Secretary of the Army through the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to the OCS to prevent obstruction to navigation in U.S. navigable waters. The OCSLA grants authority to the USCG to promulgate and enforce regulations covering lighting and warning devices, safety equipment, and other safety-related matters pertaining to life and property on fixed OCS platforms and drilling vessels. In accordance with the OCSLA (43 U.S.C. 1354) and the Export Administration Act of 1969 (50 App U.S.C. 2405(d), oil that is produced on the U.S. OCS must go to a U.S. port. The National Environment Policy Act and the Council on Environmental Quality The National Environment Policy Act (NEPA) requires all Federal agencies to use a systematic, interdisciplinary approach to protection of the human environment. Such an approach ensures the integrated use of natural and social sciences in any planning and decision making that may have an impact on the environment. The NEPA also requires the preparation of a detailed EIS on any major Federal action that may have a significant impact on the environment. The EIS must address any adverse environmental effects that cannot be avoided or mitigated, alternatives to the proposed action, the relationship between short-term resources and long-term productivity, and irreversible and irretrievable commitments of resources. In 1979, the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) established uniform procedures for implementing the procedural provisions of NEPA. These regulations provide for the use of the NEPA process to identify and assess reasonable alternatives to proposed actions that avoid or minimize adverse effects of these actions upon the quality of the human environment. ""Scoping"" is used to identify the scope and significance of important environmental issues associated with a A1-23  APPENDIX 1.4 REGULATORY AND ADMINISTRATIVE FRAMEWORK This appendix references only those portions of Federal public laws enacted by Congress related directly or indirectly to the Minerals Management Service's (MMS) regulatory responsibilities for mineral leasing, exploration, and development and production activities on leases located in the submerged lands of the outer continental shelf (OCS). It also includes responsibilities and jurisdictions of other Federal agencies and departments that also are involved in the regulatory process of oil and gas operations on the OCS. This is not intended to be a comprehensive summary of all laws associated with proposed exploration and development activities that significantly might affect the OCS. Explanations are merely to acquaint the reader with the law and are not meant as legal interpretations. Readers should consult the entire text of the law for additional requirements and information. 1.4.1 APPLICABLE FEDERAL LAWS AND POLICIES  The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act Under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA), the Department of the Interior is required to:   Manage the orderly leasing, exploration, development, and production of oil and gas resources on the Federal OCS;   Delineation Drilling Activities Offshore Santa Barbara County  proposed Federal action through coordination with Federal, State, and local agencies; the general public; and any interested individual or organization prior to the development of an impact statement. The process also identifies and eliminates from further detailed study issues that are not significant or that have been covered by prior environmental review. The Marine Mammal Protection Act Under the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) of 1972, the Secretary of Commerce is responsible for the protection of all cetaceans and pinnipeds (except walruses) and has delegated authority for implementing the MMPA to the National Marine Fisheries Services (NMFS). The Secretary of the Interior is responsible for walruses, polar bears, sea otters, manatees, and dugongs and has delegated responsibility to USFWS for providing overview and advice to the responsible regulatory agencies on all Federal actions bearing upon the conservation and protection of these marine mammals. The MMPA established a moratorium on the taking of marine mammals in waters under U.S. jurisdiction. The Act defines ""take"" to mean ""hunt, capture, or kill or attempt to harass, hunt, capture, or kill any marine mammal."" ""Harassment"" is defined as any act of pursuit, torment, or annoyance that has the potential to injure a marine mammal or marine mammal stock in the wild (level A); or has the potential to disturb a marine mammal or marine mammal stock in the wild by causing disruption of behavioral patterns, including, but not limited to, migration, breathing, nursing, breeding, feeding, or sheltering (level B). The moratorium may be waived when the affected species or population stock is within its optimum sustainable population range and would not be disadvantaged by the authorized taking, e.g., be reduced below its maximum net productivity level, which is the lower limit of the optimum sustainable population range. The Act directs the Secretary, upon request, to authorize the unintentional taking of small numbers of marine mammals incidental to activities other than commercial fishing (e.g., offshore oil and gas exploration and development) when, after notice and opportunity for public comment, the Secretary finds that the total of such taking during the 5-year (or less) period would have a negligible impact on the affected species. The Act also specifies that the Secretary shall withdraw, or suspend for a specified period of time, permission to take marine mammals incidental to oil and gas production, and other activities if the applicable regulations regarding methods of taking, monitoring, or reporting are not being complied with, or the taking is having, or may be having, more than a negligible impact on the affected species or stock.  In 1994, a new subparagraph (D) was added to Section 101(a)(5) to simplify the process of obtaining ""small take"" exemptions when unintentional taking is by incidental harassment only. Specifically, the incidental take of small numbers of marine mammals by harassment can now be authorized for periods of up to one year without rulemaking, as required by Section 101(a)(5)(A), which remains in effect for other authorized types of incidental taking. To ensure that activities on the OCS adhere to MMPA regulations, MMS must actively seek information concerning impacts of OCS activities on local species of marine mammals. Since 1986, MMS, the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers, and OCS operators have been following strict NMFS recommendations to prevent adverse impacts on endangered marine turtles and avoid the incidental taking of marine mammals. The Magnuson - Stevens Act of 1976 The Magnuson - Stevens Act of 1976 (MFCMA) (16 U.S.C. 1801-1882) established and delineated an area from the States' seaward boundary to approximately 200 nautical miles (nmi) out as a fisheries conservation zone for the United States and its possessions. The Act created eight regional Fishery Management Councils (FMCs) and mandated a continuing planning program for marine fisheries management by the FMCs. The Act, as amended, requires that a Fishery Management Plan (FMP) based upon the best available scientific and economic data be prepared for each commercial species (or related group of species) of fish that is in need of conservation and management within each respective region. The Act was reauthorized by Congress through passage of the Sustainable Fisheries Act of 1996. The reauthorization implements a number of reforms and changes. For example, one change required the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) to designate and conserve Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) for species managed under an existing FMP The intentions . of such changes are to minimize, to the extent practicable, any adverse effects on habitat caused by fishing or nonfishing activities and to identify other actions to encourage the conservation and enhancement of such habitat. The phrase ""essential fish habitat"" as defined in the Sustainable Fisheries Act encompasses ""those waters and substrate necessary to fishes for spawning, breeding, feeding, or growth to maturity."" EFH present within the Pacific OCS fall under the jurisdiction of the Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC). A total of 89 species are covered by three FMP's: Coastal Pelagic Species, Groundfish Species, and Pacific Coast Salmon. FMPs are amended and updated as new information from studies and public input is received and assessed. A1-24   Appendix for Chapter 1  MMS will enter into formal consultation with NMFS for EFH as part of this EIS process. The Endangered Species Act The Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended, establishes protection and conservation of threatened and endangered species and the ecosystems upon which they depend. The Act is administered by U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and NMFS. Section 7 of the Act governs interagency cooperation and consultation. The MMS formally consults with NMFS and FWS to ensure that activities on the OCS under MMS jurisdiction do not jeopardize the continued existence of threatened or endangered species and/or result in adverse modification or destruction of their critical habitat. As a part of the process for developing this EIS, MMS will complete Section 7 consultation with both FWS and NMFS regarding the proposed delineation projects in the Southern California Planning Area of the Pacific OCS. The FWS and NMFS make recommendations regarding modifications of oil and gas operations to minimize adverse environmental impacts; however, it remains the responsibility of MMS to ensure that proposed actions do not impact threatened or endangered species The Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuary Act The Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act of 1972 established the National Marine Sanctuary Program, which is administered by the National Oceanic and Atmosphere Administration (NOAA) of the Department of Commerce. The Southern California Planning Area encompasses all or part of two sanctuaries: Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary (NMS), which was designated in 1980; and Monterey Bay NMS, designated in 1992. National Marine Sanctuary Program R egulations prohibit exploring for, developing, and producing hydrocarbons within the Channel Islands NMS, except pursuant to leases executed prior to March 30, 1981, and except the laying of pipeline, provided specified oil spill contingency equipment is available at the site of such operations (15 CFR 922.71(a)(1)). The Regulations prohibit exploring for, developing, and producing hydrocarbons within the Monterey Bay NMS (15 CFR 922.132(a)(1)). National Historic Preservation Act Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended (16 U.S.C. 470-470t) requires the head of any Federal agency, having direct or indirect jurisdiction over a proposed Federal or federally assisted undertaking in any State and the head A1-25  of any Federal department or independent agency having authority to license any undertaking shall, prior to the approval of the expenditure of any Federal funds on the undertaking or prior to the issuance of any license, as the case may be, take into account the effect of the undertaking on any district, site, building, structure, or object that is included in or eligible for inclusion in the National Register. The historic properties (i.e. archaeological resources) on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) include historic shipwrecks, sunken aircraft, lighthouses, and prehistoric archaeological sites that have become inundated due to the 120-meter rise in global sea level since the height of the last ice age (ca. 19,000 years ago). As the OCS is not federally-owned land, and as the Federal government has not claimed direct ownership of historic properties on the OCS, the MMS only has the authority under Section 106 of the NHPA to ensure that our funded and permitted actions do not adversely affect significant historic properties. Beyond avoidance of adverse impacts, we do not have the legal authority to manage the historic properties on the OCS. The Oil Pollution Act The Oil Pollution Act (OPA 90) establishes a single uniform Federal system of liability and compensation for damages caused by oil spills in U.S. navigable waters. OPA 90 requires removal of spilled oil and establishes a national system of planning for and responding to oil spill incidents. OPA 90 includes provisions to (1) improve oil-spill prevention, preparedness, and response capability; (2) establish limitations on liability for damages resulting from oil pollution; (3) provide funding for natural resource damage assessment; (4) implement a fund for the payment of compensation for such damages; and (5) establish an oil pollution research and development program. The Secretary of Interior is given authority over offshore facilities and associated pipelines (except deepwater ports) for all Federal and State waters, including responsibility for spill prevention, oil-spill contingency plans, oil-spill containment and clean-up equipment, financial responsibility certification, and civil penalties. The Coast Guard is responsible for enforcing vessel compliance with OPA 90. The Clean Water Act The Federal Water Pollution Control Act (FWPCA) of 1972, as amended, commonly referred to as the Clean Water Act (CWA), authorizes the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) to issue National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permits to regulate discharges into waters of the United States. On March 4, 1993, the USEPA   Delineation Drilling Activities Offshore Santa Barbara County  issued revised Effluent Limitations Guidelines and New Source Performance Standards that set more restrictive conditions than were previously applied to discharges on the OCS. Presently, two types of permits exist to regulate offshore oil and gas facility-associated effluents. One type is a General permit and the other is a series of Individual permits The General permit was issued in 1983, reissued in January 1984, and expired in June 1984 with no new General permit (1984 General permit) to take its place. This permit covers 14 of the 23 platforms in the MMS Pacific Region. The remaining nine platforms are presently covered by Individual permits. Two of the Individual permits were issued in 1977 and have never been updated, while the permits for the remaining seven platforms were all applied after the 1984 General permit had expired. All the newer Individual permits are more stringent and cover a wider array of effluents than the General permit. In October 1996, EPA, Region 9 began the process of issuing a new General permit (referred to hereafter as the ""new General permit. In January 2001, the new General permit received California Coastal Commission (CCC) Consistency Certification. At present, EPA is considering how to handle the conditions and how to reissue the changed permit. There is no anticipated date of issuance. The new General permit is more stringent than either the 1984 General permit or any of the Individual permits. The Individual permits are more stringent than the 1984 General permit by decreasing limits on some components of produced water, requiring more frequent monitoring, and monitoring an increased total number of effluents. The 1984 General permit regulated 12 discharges while the new draft permit will regulate those and 10 others. An NPDES permit would be required for delineation drilling discharges. Individual operators or the MODU owner could apply for 1) coverage under the new permit when it becomes effective or 2) an individual permit. Section 404 of the CWA delegates regulatory authority to the Secretary of the Army over discharge of dredged or fill material in wetlands. Permits for structures in State waters must consider environmental requirements before the issuance pursuant to Section 404 of the CWA. The USCG has jurisdiction to enforce the CWA on the OCS. Under the CWA, the USCG approves the procedures to be followed and the equipment used for the transfer of oil from vessel to vessel and between onshore and offshore facilities and vessels. The USCG conducts pollution surveillance patrols to detect oil discharges with territorial sea and contiguous zone and has enforcement authority over violations. The USCG also has strike team responsibilities should an oil spill occur. A1-26  Rivers and Harbors Act Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 requires that permits be issued for all offshore construction, including pipelines, in U.S. navigable waters. Structure permits for exploratory drilling vessels and for fixed and mobile platforms are issued by the Corps. Permits must also be issued for onshore facilities in which dredging and filling of U.S. navigable waters are involved. Clean Air Act The Clean Air Act of 1970 directs the attainment and maintenance of National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). The 1990 Amendments to this Act affect attainment and maintenance of NAAQS (Title I), motor vehicles and fuel reformulation (Title II), hazardous air pollutants (Title III), acid deposition (Title IV), facility operating permits (Title V), stratospheric ozone protection (Title VI), and enforcement (Title VII). Section 328 of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA) transfers authority for air quality on the OC S to the EPA. On September 4, 1992, the EPA Administrator promulgated requirements (40 CFR Part 55) to control air pollution from OCS sources to attain and maintain Federal and State air quality standards and to comply with CAAA provisions for the Prevention of Significant Deterioration. The promulgated regulations require OCS sources to comply with applicable onshore air quality rules in the corresponding onshore area (COA). EPA delegated authority to the corresponding onshore Air Districts on November 5, 1993 to implement and enforce the requirements of 40 CFR Part 55. The full transfer of authority to Santa Barbara County APCD, Ventura County APCD, South Coast Air Quality Management District and San Luis Obispo County APCD to regulate OCS air emissions pursuant to 40 CFR Part 55 transpired on September 4, 1994. The EPA instituted final rules for determining general conformity of federal actions with federal and state air quality implementation plans (SIP) on November 30, 1993. Section 176(c) of the CAA, the General Conformity Rule, requires federal agencies to ensure that actions undertaken in nonattainment or maintenance areas are consistent with the applicable implementation plan. A Federal agency must make a determination that a federal action conforms to the applicable implementation plan before the action is taken. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) provides a framework for the safe disposal and   Appendix for Chapter 1  management of hazardous and solid wastes. Most oilfield wastes have been exempted from coverage under RCRA's hazardous waste regulations. Any hazardous wastes generated on the OCS that are not exempt must be transported to shore for disposal at a hazardous waste facility. Exempt wastes taken from the POCS for disposal are regulated in California. The Coastal Zone Management Act Pursuant to the Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA) and the Coastal Zone Reauthorization Amendments of 1990, all Federal activities must be consistent to the maximum extent practicable with the enforceable policies of each affected State's coastal zone management (CZM) program. Each State's CZM program sets forth objective, policies, and standards regarding public and private use of land and water resources in the coastal zone. A State with an approved CZM plan reviews Exploration Plans (EP's) and Development and Production Plans (DPP's) to determine whether the proposed activities are consistent with that State's CZM plan. The MMS may not approve 1) an Application for Permit to Drill for an EP or 2) a permit for activities described in a DPP unless the State concurs, or is conclusively presumed to have concurred, that the plan is consistent with its CZM plan. The MMS expects the operators proposing delineation drilling to submit revisions to approved EP's in September 2001. MMS will examine the proposed revisions in accordance with 250.203(n)(2). If the revisions could result in a significant change to the impacts previously identified and evaluated or requires additional permits then the revisions would be subject to all of the procedures in 250.203 including review for Coastal Zone Consistency. Ports and Waterways Safety Act The Ports and Waterways Safety Act (33 U.S.C. 1223) authorizes Coast Guard to designate safety fairways, fairway anchorages, and traffic separation schemes (TSSs) to provide unobstructed approaches for vessels using ports. The Coast Guard provides listings of designated fairways, anchorages, and TSSs in 33 CFR 166 and 167. In general, no fixed structures such as platforms are allowed in fairways. Temporary underwater obstacles such as anchors and attendant cables or chains attached to floating or semisubmersible drilling rigs may be placed in a fairway under certain conditions. Fixed structures may be placed in anchorages, but the number of structures is limited. A TSS is a designated routing measure designed to separate opposing streams of traffic by appropriate means and by the establishment of traffic lanes (33 A1-27  CFR 167.5). The Coast Guard published a final rule on July 31, 2000 realigning the San Francisco TSS, extending the Santa Barbara Channel (SBC) TSS 18 nmi and linking the SBC TSS to the San Francisco TSS. The remainder of the TSS through the SBC and the Los Angeles TSS remain the same. Merchant Marine Act of 1920 (Jones Act) The Merchant Marine Act of 1920, commonly referred to as the Jones Act (P 66-261) regulates .L. coastal shipping between U.S. ports and inland waterways. The Act provides that ""no merchandise shall be transported by water, or by land and water...between points in the United States...in any other vessel than a vessel built in and documented under the laws of the United States and owned by persons who are citizens of the United States... "" Therefore, the Act requires that all goods shipped between different ports in the U.S. or its territories must be:   Carried on vessels built and documented (flagged) in the U.S.,   Crewed by U.S. citizens or legal aliens licensed by Coast Guard, and   Owned and operated by U.S. citizens. The rational behind the Jones Act and earlier Cabotage laws was that the United States needed a merchant marine fleet to ensure that its domestic waterborne commerce remains under government jurisdiction for regulatory, safety, and national defense considerations. The same general principles of safety regulations are applied to other modes of transportation in the United States. While other modes of transportation can operate foreign-built equipment, these units must comply with U.S. standards. However, many foreign-built ships do not meet the standards required of U.S.-built ships and thus are excluded from domestic shipping. The U.S. Customs Service has determined that facilities fixed or attached to the OCS for the purpose of oil exploration as described under Section 1333(a) of Title 43, United States Code, are considered points within the U.S. Therefore, OCS oil facilities are considered U.S. sovereign territory and fall under the requirements of the Jones Act. This carries the implication that all shipping to and from these facilities related to oil exploration on the OCS can only be conducted by vessels meeting the requirements of the Jones Act. Therefore, OCS facilities can only be legally served by U.S.-registered vessels and aircraft that are properly endorsed for coastwise trade under the laws of the U.S.   Delineation Drilling Activities Offshore Santa Barbara County  Executive Order 12898: Environmental Justice The environmental-justice policy, based on Executive Order 12898, requires agencies to incorporate into NEPA documents analysis of the environmental effects of their proposed programs on minorities and low-income populations and communities. Scoping and review for the EIS is an open process that provides an opportunity for all participants, including minority and low-income populations, to express concerns that can be addressed in the EIS. 1.5.2 MMS REGULATORY AUTHORITY The MMS is charged with responsibility for managing and regulating the development of OCS oil and gas resources in accordance with the provisions of OCSLA (described in Section 1.5.1). MMS operating regulations are provided in 30 CFR, Chapter 250. The MMS's established regulatory framework (including review, evaluation, and decision-making processes) is applicable to all on-lease activities considered in this EIS. The MMS procedures for managing and regulating OCS activities, including those applicable to Exploration activities, are summarized below. The MMS is responsible for regulating and monitoring the oil and gas operations and activities on the Federal OCS. The MMS has established operating regulations and procedures to ensure that proposed activities are orderly, safe, and pollution-free. These regulations include technical and environmental reviews and evaluations by the MMS to ensure all operations are conducted in a safe and environmentally sound manner. The focus of the regulations is to reduce the risks associated with actions conducted in the offshore environment. The lessee or operator has the primary responsibility for ensuring all operations meet or exceed MMS's regulatory requirements. The MMS operating regulations, 30 CFR 250, are designed to, "". . . regulate all operations conducted under a lease, right of use and easement, or right-ofway to promote orderly exploration, development, and production of mineral resources and to prevent unreasonable harm or damage to, or waste of, any natural resource (including any mineral deposits in areas leased or not leased), any life (including fish and other aquatic life), property, or the marine, coastal, or human environment."" The operating regulations provide requirements and guidance on each phase of offshore operations. The operating regulations incorporate by reference numerous industry practices, methods, codes, and measurements that are accepted as standards in conducting offshore operations. This allows the integration of the most current practices into all aspects of offshore work. A1-28  Prior to commencing exploration, development, or production activities on a lease, operators must submit detailed plans of these activities for MMS review, evaluation, and decision. No activities may occur until approval has been granted by MMS. Proposed activities are evaluated through established technical, safety, and environmental review processes. Specific requirements must be addressed in these plans relative to operating conditions and environmental considerations. Supporting environmental information required may include archaeological, biological, and geohazards surveys and reports. If a plan is approved, operators must still submit applications for specific operations for review and approval prior to commencing operations. Upon approval of activities, lessees must comply with all lease stipulations, operational regulations, permit requirements, mitigation measures, and other applicable Federal laws and regulations. All proposed operations must meet or exceed the safety standards set by MMS. The MMS requires use of the Best Available and Safest Technology (BAST) for OCS operations, which include state-of-the-art drilling technology, production safety systems, completion of oil and gas wells, oil-spill response plans, pollutioncontrol equipment, and specifications for platform/ structure designs. The MMS completes a technical and safety review of all proposed production facility designs and installation procedures. All proposed facilities in the POCS R egion are reviewed for structural integrity. These detailed classical engineering reviews entail an intense evaluation of all operator proposals for fabrication, installation, modification, and repair of all mobile and fixed structures in the POCSRegion. To ensure that new structures are designed, fabricated, and installed using standardized procedures to prevent structural failures, MMS uses third-party (a Certified Verification Agent) expertise and technical input in the verification process. All surface production facilities, including separators, treaters, compressors, headers, and flowlines, must be designed, installed, and maintained in a manner that provides for efficiency, safety of operations, and protection of the environment. Safety systems utilized for drilling, well workover activities, and production operations on the OCS must be designed, installed, used, maintained, and tested in a manner to ensure the safety and protection of the human, marine, and coastal environments. All tubing installations open to hydrocarbon-bearing zones below the surface must be equipped with safety devices that automatically shut off the flow from the well in the event of an emergency (unless the well is incapable of flowing). The MMS evaluates the design, fabrication, installation, and maintenance of pipelines. Proposed pipeline routes are evaluated for potential geologic haz-   Appendix for Chapter 1  ards and other natural or man-made seafloor or subsurface features or conditions that could have an adverse impact on the pipeline. Routes are also evaluated for potential impacts on archaeological resources and biological communities. Operators are required to periodically inspect pipeline routes, and routine overflights are conducted to inspect pipeline routes for leakage. The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA, 90) requires removal of spilled oil and establishes a national system for planning for and responding to oil-spill incidents. MMS mandates that the operator of a lease possess a pro-active spill prevention program, a current viable oil-spill contingency plan, financial responsibility certification, and a system to ensure that the operator can obtain oil-spill containment and cleanup equipment quickly. The MMS regulations (30 CFR 254) require all owners and operators of oil processing and handling, storage, or transportation facilities located seaward of the coastline to submit an Oil Spill Response Plan (OSRP) for approval before an owner/ operator can use a facility. The facility must be operated in compliance with the approved plan. All MMS approved OSRPs are required to be reviewed and updated every two years. A Certificate of Financial Responsibility (COFR Program) is required for every POCS Region drilling, workover, production, and pipeline operation that may involve the accidental release of hydrocarbon liquids into the environment. The MMS determines the amount of financial responsibility required for offshore facilities as prescribed by OPA 90. The OPA agency analysis applies an assessment protocol to estimate the operator's likely liability for a worst-case spill from a facility or class of facility. The responsible party must demonstrate to MMS (or state) that sufficient funds for cleanup and damage liability would be available if needed. All operators on the OCS involved in production of sour hydrocarbons that could result in atmospheric hydrogen sulfide concentrations above 20 parts per million (ppm) are required to file a contingency plan for hydrogen sulfide that includes procedures to ensure the safety of the workers on the production facility. All operators are required to adhere to National Association of Corrosion Engineers (NACE) Standard Material Requirement MRO75-97 for Sulfide Stress Cracking Resistant Metallic Materials for Oilfield Equipment (NACE, 1990). The American Petroleum Institute (API) has also developed ""Recommended Practices for Oil and Gas Producing and Gas Processing Plant Operations Involving Hydrogen Sulfide"" (API, 1995). The MMS issued an NTL titled ""Hydrogen Sulfide (H2S) Requirements"" to provide guidance on sensor location, sensor calibration, respirator breathing time, measures for protection against hydrogen sulfide, requirements for classifying an area for the presence of hydrogen sulfide, requirements for A1-29  flaring and venting of gas containing hydrogen sulfide, and other issues pertaining to operations that involve hydrogen sulfide. The MMS has pollution prevention and control regulations (30 CFR 250.300) to ensure lessees do ""...not create conditions that will pose an unreasonable risk to public health, life, property, aquatic life, wildlife, recreation, navigation, commercial fishing, or other uses of the ocean..."" during offshore oil and gas operations. Control and removal of pollution is the responsibility of the lessee and is performed at the expense of the lessee. Operators are required to install curbs, gutters, drip pans, and drains on structures and deck areas in a manner necessary to collect all contaminants and debris not authorized for discharge. Disposal of any solid waste into the marine environment is prohibited. Fixed and floating structures, drilling rigs, manned production platforms/structures, and support vessels operating under a Federal oil and gas lease are required to develop Waste Management Plans and to post placards reflecting discharge limitations and restrictions. Operational discharges such as produced water, drilling fluids, and cuttings are regulated by USEPA through the NPDES program; MMS may restrict the rate of drilling fluid discharge or prescribe alternative discharge methods. The MMS administers an active civil penalties program. This program provides a high-profile compliance and enforcement tool. A civil penalty in the form of substantial monetary fines may be issued against any operator that commits a violation that may constitute a threat of serious, irreparable, or immediate harm or damage to life, property, or the environment. The MMS may make recommendations for criminal penalties if a willful violation occurs. In addition, the regulation in 30 CFR 250 directs MMS to suspend any operation in the POCS Region if the lessee has failed to comply with a provision of any applicable law, regulation, or order or provision of a lease or permit. Furthermore, the Secretary may invoke his authority under 30 CFR 250 and cancel a lease. The MMS conducts both announced and unannounced on-site inspections of all production facilities facilities to ensure compliance with lease terms, NTLs, and approved plans, and to ensure that safety and pollution-prevention requirements of regulations are met. These inspections focus primarily on the facility's safety equipment and on the records the operator maintains that reflect the periodic testing required by the Operating Regulations. Inspectors may require the activation of some safety equipment on a facility to ensure it is working properly. The MMS encourages all operators to participate in the Safety and Environmental Management Program (SEMP) that is detailed in the American Petroleum Institute's Recommended Practice, API RP 75. This comprehensive environmental and safety program addresses all facets of oil and gas operations.   Delineation Drilling Activities Offshore Santa Barbara County  1.4.3  COAST GUARD REGULATORY AUTHORITY  Primary responsibility for the enforcement of U.S. maritime laws and regulations in GOM waters falls upon Coast Guard. The Coast Guard's responsibilities for regulating activities on the OCS, the continental shelf, and in ports and harbors, as applicable to the proposed action, are presented in Title 33 CFR, chapters 1-199; Title 43 U.S.C. section 1331; Title 46 U.S.C., Part A and B; and OPA 90. The Coast Guard is responsible for managing and regulating provisions for safe navigation of vessels in U.S. waters, as well as the enforcement of environmental and pollution prevention regulations. As such, Coast Guard provides for the regulation and enforcement of hazardous working conditions on the OCS, for the management and regulation of measures for pollution prevention in territorial waters, and for ensuring that the provisions of OPA 90 and the MPPRCA (i.e., MARPOL Annex V) are implemented. 1.4.4 MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING (MOU) BETWEEN MMS AND COAST GUARD  port all operations on board generally fall under the jurisdiction of Coast Guard. These include among others: design of vessels, their seakeeping characteristics, propulsion and dynamic positioning systems, supply and lightering procedures and equipment, utility systems, safety equipment and procedures, and pollution prevention and response procedures. Both agencies will continue to be responsible for accident investigations and will coordinate to minimize duplication of efforts. For those incidents where both agencies have an investigative interest in the systems involved, one agency will assume lead investigative responsibility, with supporting participation provided by the other agency. 1.4.5 MITIGATION MEASURES In each OCS planning area, oil and gas exploration and development activities have the potential for causing adverse environmental impacts. Many measures have been implemented by the MMS to ""mitigate"" or prevent and lessen possible impacts on environmental resources from both OCS and non-OCS activities. Mitigating measures are protective measures designed to prevent adverse impacts and to lessen and mitigate unavoidable impacts. The MMS develops and administers these requirements, which are part of the lease-term conditions at lease issuance. In order to mitigate adverse environmental impacts for actions associated with a specific project (i.e., proposed plans for exploration, development, production, and site-clearance activities in an area located on an OCS lease block), additional mitigation requirements may be necessary. Conditions of plan approval are mechanisms determined by MMS to control or mitigate potential environmental or safety problems that are associated with a specific proposal. Special stipulations that limit operations are in addition to the lease-term stipulations. During the life of the action, these protective measures are specific to the individual activities proposed in a plan and are imposed following environmental reviews (according to the NEPA) of the OCS lease location and potential resources. Lease-Term Stipulations Some of these protective measures are developed and applied to specific blocks in a planning area before leasing a block and are based on the following:  On December 16, 1998, MMS and Coast Guard updated and signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) concerning responsibilities for offshore facilities on the OCS. Given the overlap in jurisdictions of MMS and Coast Guard regarding some issues, the MOU delineates lead responsibilities for managing OCS activities in accordance with OCSLA and OPA 90. Because of jurisdictional overlap and the large array of regulatory provisions pertaining to activities on the OCS, MMS and Coast Guard have established a formal Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) that defines their respective roles. The MOU, dated August 1989 and updated December 1998 (and published in the Federal Register on January 15, 1999), defines the responsibilities of both agencies regarding the management of oil and gas activities in the OCS. The MOU is designed to minimize duplication and promote consistent regulation of facilities under the jurisdiction of both agencies. The MOU assigns both agencies with responsibility for the various aspects of the design, implementation, and operation of OC S facilities. Generally, the MOU identifies MMS as the lead agency for matters concerning the equipment and operations directly involved in the production of oil and gas. These include among others: design and operation of risers, permanent mooring foundations of the facility, drilling and well production and services, inspection and testing of all drilling-related equipment, and platform decommissioning. Issues regarding the safe operation of the facility, its systems, and the equipment needed to supA1-30   existing policies and laws;  knowledge of the resources present in the planning area where the block is being offered for lease by the MMS; and   current industry practices.   Appendix for Chapter 1  If a block is leased as a result of a lease sale, these protective measures are identified as lease-term stipulations and are attached to and become part of the lease and its conditions. These stipulations are designed to protect potentially sensitive resources in the affected block and to reduce possible multiple-use conflicts and are the requirements that the lessee must meet to mitigate adverse impacts. They also may be considered to apply to all activities that occur on the leased area throughout the life of the lease. This EIS evaluates impacts of the proposal, delineation drilling, and cumulative impacts including development of the 36 undeveloped leases. The 36 undeveloped leases include the leases proposed for delineation drilling. The 36 undeveloped leases resulted from Lease Sales P4, 48, 53, 68, RS -2, and 80. The following lease-term stipulations apply, as appropriate, to the 36 undeveloped leases and, as such, are considered as part proposal for delineation drilling and future development.

Sale 48 Stipulation No. 2 Whether or not compensation for such damage or injury might be due under a theory of strict or absolute liability or otherwise, the lessee assumes all risks of damage or injury to persons or property, which occurs in, on, or above the Outer Continental Shelf, to any person or persons or to any property of any person or persons who are agents, employees or invitees of the lessee, its agents, independent contractors or subcontractors doing business with the lessee in connection with any activities being performed by the lessee in, on, or above the Outer Continental Shelf, if such injury or damage to such person or property occurs by reason of the activities of any agency of the U.S. Government, its contractors, or subcontractors, or any of their officers, agents or employees, being conducted as a part of, or in connection with, the programs and activities of the Space and Missile Test Center (SAMTEC), the Pacific Missile Test Center (PMTC), or other appropriate military agency.   Appendix for Chapter 1  Not withstanding any limitations of the lessee's liability in section 14 of the lease, the lessee assumes the risk whether such injury or damage is caused in whole or in part by any act or omission, regardless of negligence or fault, of the United States, its contractors or subcontractors, or any of their officers, agents, or employees. The lessee further agrees to indemnify and save harmless the United States against all claims for loss, damage, or injury sustained by the lessee, and to indemnify and save harmless the United States against all claims for loss, damage, or injury sustained by the agents, employees, or invitees of the lessee, its agents or any independent contractors or subcontractors doing business with the lessee in connection with the programs and activities of the aforementioned military installations and agencies, whether the same be caused in whole or in part by the negligence or fault of the United States, its contractors, or subcontractors, or any of their officers, agents, or employees and whether such claims might be sustained under theories of strict or absolute liability or otherwise. Sale 48 Stipulation No. 3 If the Supervisor., having reason to believe that a site, structure or object of historical or archaeological significance, hereinafter referred to as a ""cultural resource,"" may exist in the lease area, gives the lessee written notice that the lessor is invoking the provisions of this stipulation, the lessee shall upon receipt of such notice comply with the following requirements: Prior to any drilling activity or the construction or placement of any structure for exploration or development on the lease, including but not limited to, well drilling and pipeline and platform placement, hereinafter in this stipulation referred to as ""operation,"" the lessee shall conduct remote sensing surveys to determine the potential existence of any cultural resource that may be affected by such operations. All data produced by such remote sensing surveys as well as other pertinent natural and cultural environmental data shall be examined by a qualified marine survey archaeologist to determine if indications are present suggesting the existence of a cultural resource that may be adversely affected by any lease operation. A report of this survey and assessment prepared by the marine survey archaeologist shall be submitted by the lessee to the Supervisor and the Manager, Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) Office for review. If such cultural resource indicators are present the lessee shall (1) locate the site of such operation so as not to adversely affect the identified location; or (2) establish, to the satisfaction of the Supervisor, on the basis of further archaeological investigation conducted by a qualified marine survey archaeologist or underwater archaeologist using such survey equipment and A1-33  techniques as deemed necessary by the Supervisor, either that such operation shall not adversely affect the location identified or that the potential cultural resource suggested by the occurrence of the indicators does not exist. A report of this investigation prepared by the marine survey archaeologist or underwater archaeologist shall be submitted to the Supervisor and the Manager, BLM OCS Office for their review. Should the Supervisor determine that the existence of a cultural resource which may be adversely affected by such operation is sufficiently established to warrant protection, the lessee shall take no action that may result in an adverse effect on such cultural resource until the Supervisor has given directions as to its preservation. The lessee agrees that if any site, structure, or object of historical or archaeological significance should be discovered during the conduct of any operations on the leased area, he shall report immediately such findings to the Supervisor and make every reasonable effort to preserve and protect the cultural resource from damage until the Supervisor has given directions as to its preservation. Sale 48 Stipulation No. 4 (a) Wells: Subsea well-heads and temporary abandonments, or suspended operations that leave protrusions above the sea floor, shall be protected, if feasible, by a shroud which will allow commercial trawl gear to pass over the structure without snagging or otherwise damaging the structure or the fishing gear. Latitude and longitude coordinates of these structures along with water depths, shall be submitted to the Supervisor. The coordinates of such structures will be determined by the lessee utilizing state-of-the-art navigation systems with accuracy of at least "" 50 feet (15.25 meters) at 200 miles (322 kilometers). (b) Pipelines: All pipelines, unless buried, including gathering lines, shall have a smooth-surface design. In the event that an irregular pipe surface is unavoidable due to the need for valves, anodes or other structures, they shall be protected by shrouds which will allow trawl gear to pass over the object without snagging or otherwise damaging the structure or the fishing gear. Sale 48 Stipulation No. 5 (a) If the Supervisor has reason to believe that areas of special biological interest in the lease area contain biological communities or species of such extraordinary or unusual value (even though unquantifiable) that no threat of damage, injury, or other harm to the community or species would be acceptable, he shall give the lessee written notice that the lessor is invoking the provisions of this stipula-   Delineation Drilling Activities Offshore Santa Barbara County  tion and the lessee shall comply with the following requirements: Prior to any drilling activity or the construction or placement of any structure for exploration or development on lease areas including, but not limited to, well drilling and pipeline and platform placement, hereinafter referred to as ""operation,"" the lessee shall conduct site specific surveys as approved by the Supervisor and in accordance with prescribed biological survey requirements to determine the existence of any special biological resource including, but not limited to: (1) Very unusual, rare, or uncommon ecosystems or ecotones. (2) A species of limited regional distribution that may be adversely affected by any lease operations If the results of such surveys suggest the existence of a special biological resource that may be adversely affected by any lease operation, the lessee shall: (1) relocate the site of such operation so as not to adversely affect the resources identified; (2) establish to the satisfaction of the Supervisor, on the basis of the site-specific survey, either that such operation will not have a significant adverse effect upon the resource identified or that a special biological resource does not exist. The Supervisor will review all data submitted and determine, in writing,.whether a special biological resource exists or may be significantly affected by lessee's operations. The lessee may take no action until the Supervisor has given the lessee written directions on how to proceed. (b) The lessee agrees that if any area of biological significance should be discovered during the conduct of any operations on the leased area, he shall report immediately such findings to the Supervisor, and make every reasonable effort to preserve and protect the biological resource from damage until the Supervisor has given the lessee directions with respect to its protection. Sale 48 Stipulation No. 6 (a) Pipelines will be required, (1) if pipeline rightsof-way can be determined and obtained, (2) if laying of such pipelines is technologically feasible and environmentally preferable, and (3) if, in the opinion of the lessor, pipelines can be laid without net social loss, taking into account any incremental costs of pipelines over alternative methods of transportation and any incremental benefits in the form of increased environmental protection or reduced multiple use conflicts. The lessor specifically reserves the right to require that any pipeline used for transporting production to shore be placed in certain designated management ar-  eas. In selecting the means of transportation, consideration will be given to any recommendation of the intergovernmental planning program for leasing and management of transportation of Outer Continental Shelf oil and gas with the participation of Federal, State, and local government and the industry. Where feasible, and environmentally preferable, all pipelines, including both flow lines and gathering lines for oil and gas, shall be buried to a depth suitable for adequate protection from water currents, sand waves, storm scouring, fisheries' trawling gear, and other uses as determined on a case-by-case basis. (b) Following the completion of pipeline installation, no crude oil production will be transported by surface vessel from offshore production sites, except in the case of emergency. Determinations as to emergency conditions and appropriate responses to these conditions will be made by the Supervisor. Where the three criteria set forth in the first sentence of this stipulation are not met and surface transportation must be employed, all vessels used for carrying hydrocarbons to shore from the leased area will conform with all standards established for such vessels, pursuant to the Ports and Waterways Safety Act of 1972 (46 U.S. C., 391a), as amended. Sale 48 Stipulation No. 7 Exploratory drilling operations, emplacement of structures (platforms) or seafloor wellheads for production or storage of oil or gas, and the emplacement of pipelines will not be allowed within the potentially unstable portions of the lease block unless or until the lessee has demonstrated to the Supervisor's satisfaction that mass movement of sediments is unlikely or that exploratory drilling operations, structures (platforms), casing, wellheads, and pipelines can be safely designed to protect the environment in case such mass movement or faulting occurs at the proposed location. If exploratory drilling operations are allowed, site-specific surveys shall be conducted to determine the potential for mass movement of sediments. If emplacement of structures (platforms) or seafloor wellheads for production or storage of oil or gas is allowed all potential mass movement of sediments in the lease block must be mapped. Down-hole pressure actuated control devices must be located below the base of the potentially unstable sediments located in the area in order to protect the environment in case such mass movement occurs at the proposed location. This may necessitate all exploration for and development of oil and gas be performed from locations outside of the area of instability, either within or outside of this lease block.  A1-34   Appendix for Chapter 1  Sale 48 Stipulation No. 8 (a) The royalty rate on production saved, removed, or sold from this lease is subject to consideration for reduction under the same authority that applies to all other oil and gas leases on the Outer Continental Shelf (30 CFR 250.12(a)). The Director, Geological Survey, may grant a reduction for only one year at a time. Reduction of royalty rates will not be approved unless production has been underway for one year or more. (b) Although the royalty rate specified in Sec.6(a) of this lease or as subsequently modified in accordance with applicable regulations and stipulations is applicable to all production under this lease, not more than 16 2/3 percent of the production saved, removed, or sold from the lease area may be taken as royalty in amount, except as provided in sec. 15 (d) of this lease; the royalty on any portion of the production saved, removed, or sold from the lease in excess of 16 2/3 percent may only be taken in value of the production saved, removed, or sold from the lease area. Sale 48 Stipulation No. 9 To be Included in any leases resulting from this sale for the sliding scale royalty tracts listed in paragraph 4 of this notice.

(b) Although the royalty rate specified in Sec. 6(a) of this lease or as subsequently modified in accordance with applicable regulations and stipulations is applicable to all production under this lease, not more than 16 2/3 percent of the production saved, removed or sold from the lease area may be taken as royalty on any portion of the production saved, removed or solved from the lease in excess of 16 2/3 percent may only be taken in value of the production saved, removed or sold from the lease area. Sale 48 Stipulation No. 13 No producing well may be drilled so that the well bore in the producing intervals is closer than 500 feet to the seaward boundary of the. State except that the 500 feet constraint shall not apply: (a) If oil or gas pools or fields underlying both the Outer Continental Shelf and lands subject to the jurisdiction of California are included in a production A1-35  unit entered into by the relevant lessees and approved by the lessors. (b) If, in the absence of a production unit as described in (a) above, the State of California permits production from State lands from a point closer than 500 feet from the Federal-State boundary. In the event that such production from State lands does occur, the Federal lessee shall be allowed to produce from offset wells equally close to the boundary in the area of Federal jurisdiction. Sale 53 Stipulation No. 1 (a) If the DCMOFO has reason to believe that biological populations or habitats exist and require protection, he shall give the lessee notice that the lessor is invoking the provisions of this stipulation and the lessee shall comply with the following requirements. Prior to any drilling activity or the construction or placement of any structure for exploration or development on lease areas including, but not limited to, well drilling and pipeline and platform placement hereinafter referred to as ""operation,""' the lessee shall conduct site-specific surveys as approved by the DCMOFO and in accordance with prescribed biological survey requirements to determine the existence of any special biological resource including, but not limited to: (1) Very unusual, rare, or uncommon ecosystems or ecotones. (2) A species of limited regional distribution that may be adversely affected by any lease operations. If the results of such surveys suggest the existence of a special biological resource that may be adversely affected by any lease operation, the lessee shall: (1) relocate the site of such operation so as not to adversely affect the resources identified; or (2) establish to the satisfaction of the DCMOFO, on the basis of the site-specific survey, either that such operation will not have a significant adverse effect upon the resource identified or that a special biological resource does not exist. The DCMOFO will review all data submitted and determine, in writing, whether a special biological resource exists and whether it may be significantly affected by the lessee's operations. The lessee may take no action until the DCMOFO has given the lessee written directions on how to proceed. (b) The lessee agrees that if any area of biological significance should be discovered during the conduct of any operations on the leased area, he shall report immediately such findings to the DCMOFO, and make every reasonable effort to preserve and protect the biological resource from damage until the DCMOFO has given the lessee directions with respect to its protection.   Delineation Drilling Activities Offshore Santa Barbara County  Sale 53 Stipulation No. 2 If the DCMOFO, having reason to believe that a site, structure or object of historical or archaeological significance, hereinafter referred to as a ""cultural resource,"" may exist in the lease area, gives the lessee written notice that the lessor is invoking the provisions of this stipulation, the lessee shall upon receipt of such notice comply with the following requirements.

(c) Development and production operations will be required to include the capability to automatically detect the loss of oil and gas at any time. Stipulation No. 10 - Testing Of Oil Spill Containment Equipment The lessee shall conduct semi-annual full-scale drills at the request of the lessor for platforms and  operator-controlled contracted cleanup vessels for deploying equipment in open water to test the equipment and the contingency plan. These drills must involve all primary equipment identified in the oil spill contingency plans as satisfying Outer Continental Shelf Operating Order No. 7. At least two of these drills shall include the primary equipment controlled and operated by the appropriate cooperative. These drills will be unannounced and held under realistic environmental conditions in which deployment and operations can be accomplished without endangering safety of personnel. R epresentatives of the U.S. Coast Guard, Minerals Management Service. and California Coastal Commission may be present as observers. The lessor's inspectors will frequently inspect oil and gas facilities where oil spill containment and cleanup equipment are maintained in order to assure readiness. Stipulation No. 11 - Onshore Oil Processing Any initial processing of oil will be conducted at an onshore facility, if feasible, subject to the granting of necessary permits by local authorities within a reasonable period of time as provided for in State of California law. If after review by local and State authorities these permits cannot be acquired, then the Regional Manager shall determine, in cooperation and participation with the State, what further action needs to be taken in regard to the lessee's development and production plan. Exceptions to the initial onshore processing include standard oil/gas/water separation processes and necessary treatment of oil prior to being pumped from the platform into a pipeline to shore, if pipeline transport is determined practicable. Stipulation No. 12 - Protection Of Commercial Fisheries (a) The lessee, operator(s), subcontractor(s), and all personnel involved in exploration, development, and production operations shall endeavor to minimize conflicts between the oil and gas industry and the commercial fishing industry. Prior to submitting a plan of exploration or development to the lessor. appropriate oil and gas personnel shall contact potentially affected commercial fishermen or their representatives to discuss potential conflicts with the siting, timing, and methods proposed,. Through this consultation the lessee shall assure that, whenever feasible, exploratory and development activities are compatible with seasonal fishing operations and will not result in permanently barring commercial fishing from important fishing grounds. A discussion of the resolutions reached during this consultation process and a discussion of any unresolved conflicts shall be included in the Plan of Exploration or Development/ Production. The lessee shall A1-48   Appendix for Chapter 1  send a copy of the Plan of Exploration or Development/ Production to the fisheries liaison office and the marine extension office at the same time they are submitted to the lessor to allow concurrent review and comment as part of the lessor's plan approval process. In accordance with 30 CFR 250.34-1(b)(1), copies of such plans are sent to appropriate State agencies, such as the California State Lands Commission, California Department of Fish and Game, and the California Coastal Commission. (b) In particular, the lessee shall show in the Plan of Exploration or Development/Production crew and supply boat operation routes which will be used to minimize impacts to commercial fishing, marine mammals, and endangered and threatened species.

A1-50   Appendix for Chapter 1 Appendix 1.5 Information Addressing Issues Raised by the California Coastal Commission in a Letter to MMS.  The following issues were discussed in a letter, dated August 5, 1999, from the California Coastal Commission to MMS. The Commission's primary concern was that ""changed circumstances and new information should be considered in evaluating environmental impacts of the proposed new exploration [delineation] activities."" These issues, raised by the Commission, and MMS's responses, are summarized below along with a reference in the Draft EIS (DEIS) sections where additional detail may be found.  . Issue Issue 1. Proposed activities affect the sea otter population. Responses to the Issue and DEIS Reference   Operator submittals (Project Descriptions) recognized that sea otters have extended their range, that MMS will need to     update endangered species consultations, and that facilities and techniques for sea otter capture, handling, cleaning, and rehabilitation have improved. In addition, the operators will address this issue in the revisions to their plans. Sea otters already coexist with limited OCS oil and gas production activities in the Santa Maria Basin. Studies of recent sea otter movements indicate that the otter range has expanded into the Santa Barbara Channel and coexist with OCS oil and gas production there, as well. The primary potential impact to sea otters from OCS activities is from accidental oil spills. Hypothetical development resulting from delineation drilling activities in the undeveloped leases north of Point Conception is likely to result in a small incremental increase in the probability that an oil spill will occur. Potential impacts to sea otters from the proposed activities will be assessed during the Endangered Species Section 7 consultations with the FWS. Given the probable expansion of the southern sea otter range into the Santa Barbara Channel, this consultation will likely involve the proposed activities on all of the undeveloped leases. This DEIS addresses potential impacts to the sea otter population in sections 5.2.8, 5.2.8.2, and 6.2.8.  Issue Issue 2. Possible effects on the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary, which was not a sanctuary at the time plans were originally reviewed.  Responses to the Issue and DEIS Reference   The southern boundary of the Sanctuary is approximately 45 miles north of the active lease area.  Operator-submitted Project Descriptions discuss the Sanctuary and the operators will address this issue ion revisions           to their plans. The distance from each undeveloped unit or lease to the Sanctuary waters is given below. Cavern Point Unit  over 120 miles Gato Canyon Unit  over 100 miles Sword Unit  over 80 miles Bonito Unit  over 65 miles Rocky Point Unit  approximately 77 miles Santa Maria Unit  over 40 miles Purisima Point Unit  over 40 miles Lease OCS P 409  over 40 miles Point Sal Unit  over 40 miles Lion Rock Unit  over 40 miles   Some potential oil spill threat may exist during certain times of the year since winds and currents along the central California coast make it possible for oil from a spill in the Santa Maria Basin to be carried northward into Sanctuary waters. The risk to the Sanctuary is reduced due to the weathering of the oil that would occur during the time it takes for the oil to travel to the Sanctuary. This DEIS addresses potential impacts to the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary in sections 5.2.11 and 6.2.11.   Issue 3. Changes in State and local air quality regulations and their implementation affect future exploration or development.   Operators recognized the change in the authority and the role of the local air pollution control districts and acknowledge that they will apply to either the Ventura or Santa Barbara County Air Pollution Control Districts.   As a result of a 1990 amendment to the Clean Air Act, all existing and future OCS sources will be permitted by the local air agencies and must be in full compliance with local air quality rules and regulations.   Under New Source Review provisions contained within the local air regulations, all new or modified projects must  result in a ""net air quality benefit."" This requires the applicant to provide emission offsets in greater levels than emissions expected for the project. This DEIS addresses potential impacts to air quality in sections 5.2.1, 5.2.1.2, and 6.2.1.  A1-51   Delineation Drilling Activities Offshore Santa Barbara County  Appendix 1.5 Information Addressing Issues Raised by the California Coastal Commission in a Letter to MMS (continued).  Issue Issue 4. Changes in water quality regulations and anticipated further changes in those regulations.  Responses to the Issue and DEIS Reference   MMS and the operators recognize the need for a new General permit.  The General permit has been finalized, incorporating public comment, and the CCC issued a Consistency Certification with conditions. EPA is currently working with CCC to meet the conditions. EPA plans to publish the permit in final form in the Federal Register sometime in the summer of 2001. The new General permit will replace a 17-year old General permit, two Individual permits that have existed, unchanged, since 1977, and six Individual permits, all issued between 1993 and 1995. This DEIS addresses potential impacts to water quality in sections 5.2.2, 5.2.2.2, and 6.2.2.   Issue 5. New information concerning the impacts of drill muds and cuttings on hard bottom habitat.   New information on impacts of drilling muds and cuttings comes, primarily, from the California Monitoring Program (CaMP) studies, conducted near Point Arguello between 1984 and 1994.   CaMP results indicated that biological changes were identified as far away as 1,000 m; impacts were from smothering, not toxicity, of the drilling muds.   Shallow hazards information collected in the 1970's and 1980's indicate the presence of hard bottom areas near some proposed delineation well sites.   In 1991, the Hard Bottom process was established to identify, avoid, and/or mitigate impacts to hard bottom habitats.     Issue 6. New information concerning the effects of undersea noise on marine mammals and other marine life. If potential hard bottom is identified within 1,000 m of a wellsite, the operator either develops an avoidance plan or a biological data collection and mitigation plan. MMS, along with other agencies, fishermen, and area experts, are working with the operators in developing plans to avoid or survey and mitigate impacts to hard bottom habitats. New sea floor survey information will likely be required, including high-resolution side scan sonar, which will clearly depict locations of hard bottom. If avoidance of potential hard bottom habitat is not possible, given existing or new information, a biological survey will be needed to identify hard bottom habitat. This DEIS addresses potential impacts to hard bottom habitats in sections 5.2.4, 5.2.4.2, and 6.2.4.   Operators recognize the changes in available information concerning the effects of noise on marine mammals and covered these issues in their Project Descriptions.   Drilling rigs and seismic surveys can generate noise levels that may have an effect on marine mammals.  MMS, in conjunction with various State, Federal, and local agencies, the geophysical and oil industry, and  environmental groups, agreed on a set of guidelines for mitigation of potential impacts to marine mammals from highenergy seismic surveys (HESS). No high-energy seismic surveys are currently proposed for the undeveloped leases. This DEIS addresses potential impacts to marine mammals from noise in sections 5.2.8, 5.2.8.2, and 6.2.8.  Issue Issue 7. Changes in technology since review of earlier plans.  Responses to the Issue and DEIS Reference   The use of new technology is required to be addressed in the revised EP's via MMS's operating regulations. Operators will need to comply with changes in the regulations, including compliance with any revised standards.   Generally, operators identified advances in geological and geophysical data acquisition and processing, and improvements in extended-reach drilling capability.   Advances in technology including computers and automation can be seen in various areas. These advances may change activities and associated impacts in several ways:   New technology may allow the operator to change the fundamental activity being proposed (e.g., extended-reach drilling from an existing facility rather than drilling from a MODU or the installation of a new platform);   New technology can reduce the risk associated with a given activity (e.g., improved equipment such as blowout     preventers); New and existing mitigation may be more effective (e.g., improved oil skimming and response capability); Exploration and delineation of a reservoir can be completed with fewer wells; New technology may decrease the MODU's time-on-location. Where appropriate, new technology is implicitly included in the DEIS. For example, discussions in Chapters 2 and 3 describe the Proposed Action and the equipment necessary. Also, as noted above, oil-spill clean up capability has improved and that is implicitly included, where appropriate, in Chapters 5 and 6.  Issue 8. Changes in operators, and their compliance with environmental protections required under current Federal, State, and local regulations, since the submittal of the original EP's. Issue 9. Cumulative impacts of the exploration and development of the 36 leases.   New operators have acquired all the units since the original EP's were submitted.  In the early 1990's, offshore properties in the Pacific Region began to shift ownership from the major companies,     which had originally held the resource rights and often constructed offshore production and onshore processing facilities, to small and medium-size companies. MMS strictly holds all new operators to all laws and regulations pertaining to offshore oil and gas operations. By law, all companies must meet the same requirements to become operators. MMS sees that all operators demonstrate financial responsibility and requires addition bonding, if needed. This issue is not addressed in the DEIS   Chapter 5 contains cumulative discussions for each of the resources, associated with the Proposed Action, as required by NEPA, for the years 2002 through 2006.   Chapter 6 contains an expanded cumulative discussion for each of the resources, that also includes the potential for cumulative impacts from development of the 36 undeveloped leases for the years 2002 through 2030.

GX241-69-15679884	MARYLAND GOVERNOR PARRIS N. GLENDENING   TESTIMONY BEFORE SENATE COMMITTEE ON AGRICULTURE,   NUTRITION AND FORESTRY   Thursday April 2, 1998 -- 9:00 A.M.        Thank you, Mr. Chairman for inviting me to talk with you and members of the Committee today about Marylands recent experience with toxic Pfiesteria, the importance of water quality and the pressing need for NATIONAL agricultural standards regarding animal waste pollution.    As I drove in to the city this morning, I noticed several cars with Maryland license plates with the words Treasure the Chesapeake emblazoned on them.  A not so subtle reminder that while I am here today as the Governor of Maryland, and as a guardian of the Chesapeake Bay, I am also here as an avid fisherman, as someone who loves seafood, and like millions of Marylanders, indeed, like millions of Americans, I am here today as someone who sees the Chesapeake Bay as a true national treasure.    All across Maryland, this region and this nation, there are thousands of families like mine for whom our waterways are places to work, to live, and to play. While other states have faced similar challenges with  toxic Pfiesteria-like organisms, Marylands experience is unique in two respects.  First, Maryland is Maryland because of the Chesapeake Bay.  Indeed, while the Bay literally divides our State geographically, it is also a powerful unifying force in the lives of many Marylanders.  Second, Maryland was the first state in the nation to link toxic outbreaks of Pfiesteria to concerns about public health.     Last Summer, Maryland faced an unprecedented challenge to the health and vitality of our waterwaysand the health of our citizens.  The Pocomoke River, a creek of the Manokin River watershed  and part of the Chicamacomico River, experienced outbreaks of toxic Pfiesteria.  The reports of large fish kills and the images of small fish disfigured by sores were horrific.  Even worse were the reports that several of my fellow Marylanders experienced health problems after prolonged exposure to toxic Pfiesteria.  Our experience last Summer sharply reminded us of the link between our land and our water and the effect of water quality on our health and livelihoods.  Clearly, what we put on the land ultimately ends up in the water.   We are fortunate in Maryland that when we have such a challenge, it does not matter if you live on the Pocomoke or on the Potomac, on the Eastern Shore or the Western Shore, or whether you are a Democrat or a Republican, we are all Marylanders first.  Last year, in response to the  toxic Pfiesteria crisis, we took bold steps. We quickly closed parts of several waterways to protect the health of our citizens. We worked closely with our outstanding Congressional delegation to secure a Federal research appropriation to study toxic Pfiesteria. And I thank Senators Sarbanes and Mikulski and Congressmen Hoyer and Gilchrest for their rapid action in securing this much needed federal support.   We also recognized early on that--in all likelihood--toxic Pfiesteria will return this Summer. That has been the experience in other states and it is the opinion of medical and environmental experts.  Therefore, we worked quickly and aggressively to develop a fair and comprehensive program  to combat toxic Pfiesteria long-term.  Marylands plan is based on the best available science. It is based on our knowledge that excessive nutrients are harmful to the Bay and its tributaries. And, it is based on the knowledge that if we do not change our behavior, outbreaks of toxic Pfiesteria will continue year after year after year.    I stress from the outset that our plan does not blame farmers for the outbreaks of toxic Pfiesteria.  Nor does it in any way make farmers entirely responsible for solving the problem.  Our approach is intended to be a true partnership, with the state making significant investments ($45 million over three years) and working with farmers to alter those behaviors that we know have contributed to the degradation of our water quality.    While the details of our original proposal are currently being resolved in a conference committee, I briefly will touch on the key elements that will certainly be included in whatever version of our plan is ultimately approved.     First, the plan will feature mandatory nutrient-management levels that limit the amount of nutrient runoff on our farms--both phosphorus and nitrogen.  We currently have in Maryland an outstanding program of voluntary nutrient management.  I am extremely proud of the many farming families who go the extra mile to protect our environment with these voluntary programs.  Unfortunately, our experience last year and our expectations for this year indicate the voluntary programs simply do not have a wide enough impact.  A mandatory program with a firm implementation date is the only approach that will ensure success.     The second feature of our program directs over $15 million this year alone to assist farmers and to address other nutrient problems.  We realize that we must work closely with our farmers and supply much-needed financial and technical support so that our goals will be meet.     Finally, as I mentioned, we are targeting other sources of nutrients, such as sewage treatment plants and the use of commercial fertilizers.  As we move forward with this plan, we will have made significant strides towards improving water quality and stopping outbreaks of toxic Pfiesteria.   Last Fall I had the opportunity to testify before the House Government Reform & Oversight Subcommittee on Human Resources.  I pointed out last time that by some measures Pfiesteria has been around anywhere from 10 million to 400 million years.  Of course, my primary question at the time was why did something that had been around for so many millions of years have to go toxic in the middle of my Administration!  Seriously, we need to conduct the research as to why Pfiesteria went toxic.  I appreciate Congress and the Administration stepping up and providing funds for additional research.  But the fact is, the science is clear: Nutrient run-off is causing problems with water quality.  And water quality is what this is really all about.    I have focused on Marylands experience with toxic Pfiesteria, but other states are experiencing similar problems.  At a recent meeting of the National Governors Association I spoke with Governor Voinovich about water quality problems in the Great Lakes; recently we have seen news of fish kills in Florida; Pfiesteria-like organisms have been found in Virginias Rappahannock River; North Carolina has struggled with this problem for over seven years.  The fact is, large-number fish kills have increased from about 10 per year to close to 50 per year across the country over the past 20 years.  We must address the issue of Water Quality on a larger scale.   Water quality, and the impact of toxic Pfiesteria on animal life and human life, ARE  problems in Maryland...but they are NOT Maryland problems.  Maryland--and Marylands waterways--do not exist in a vacuum.  The fact is, over half the water of the Chesapeake Bay flows from the Susquehanna River starting in New York State, through Pennsylvania, and into the Bay.  A journey of over 450 miles.  Agricultural practices in New York, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Delaware, and Virginia ALL impact water quality in Maryland and the Chesapeake Bay.     Clearly, water quality and Pfiesteria know no geographic boundaries.   That is why one of our first steps last summer was to assemble my fellow governors from throughout the region.  We were able to enter into a partnership with Governor Carper of Delaware; Governor Underwood of West Virginia; Governor Hunt of North Carolina; Governor Ridge of Pennsylvania; and then-Governor Allen of Virginia (Governor Gilmore has also committed his support for our efforts). We pledged to pool our talents and resources and work together to overcome this challenge.   Unfortunately, the ability of some multi-State corporations to locate anywhere in the country and, in some cases, anywhere in the world, can hinder an individual states ability to realize progress in this area.  This underscores the fact that the issue of clean water cannot be addressed State-by-State, or region-by-region.  I strongly support the Administrations National Clean Water effort that was announced in Baltimore in February.   We now know we must have a strong, clear, national standard for managing animal waste and national standards for achieving and measuring water quality.  Our water does not recognize State boundaries.  Toxic Pfiesteria does not recognize State boundaries.  We are all in this together.   In Maryland, we chose to address animal waste and nutrient management planning because we have been entrusted with one of the most precious natural resources in the world--the Chesapeake Bay.  We need to do our part to keep the Bay and its tributaries clean and safe for future generations.  We will continue to reach out to our surrounding states to seek their help in this effort.  But the fact is, no mater what steps Maryland--or ANY individual  State--takes,  unless these internal steps are complemented by real and meaningful national regulations, only incomplete solutions to the problem will ever be achieved   In closing, I am proud of the leadership role Maryland has taken in addressing this issue.  On behalf of the 5 million citizens of Maryland, and the countless millions of people across the country and across the world who enjoy the beauty, the recreational opportunities, and the bounty of Maryland Chesapeake Bay, I express my appreciation of the bi-partisan support we have received from Congress.  I am also encouraged by the continued interest that the issue of clean water and public health continues to receive.  The fact is, it is the duty of the Federal Government to act when a problem is national in scope and when fair and effective measures can be implemented through the regulatory process.  The management of animal waste to protect water quality is one area where Federal action is clearly needed.  Thank you.    Posted on April 2, 1998
GX254-82-0987448	Culture of Abalone History  P  ioneering efforts to mass cultivate abalone in California began about 35 years ago. Three abalone species, the red (Haliotis rufescens), the green (H. fulgens), and the pink (H. corrugata) have been farmed, and research into cultivation techniques has been conducted on the black (H. cracherodii) and white abalone (H. sorenseni). The red abalone, however, is the mainstay of the industr y and comprises more than 95 percent of total production. Abalone are grown in either land-based tanks or in cages suspended in the water column. The cages are typically tethered from a raft but have also been suspended beneath a whar f. Aquaculturists that operate these inwater systems typically obtain small seed abalone from land-based hatcheries for grow-out. In a typical hatcher y operation, ripe brood stock abalone are induced to spawn using hydrogen peroxide or ultraviolet light treated seawater. Fertilized eggs that successfully develop to the veliger swimming stage are transferred to through-owing lar val rearing tanks. In about six days at 59 F, lar vae are ready to settle from the planktonic to the benthic stage. They are transferred to nurser y tanks, and commence to feed on diatoms. After six months of growth, half-inch abalone are then transferred to plastic mesh baskets suspended in larger tanks. At this point, the abalone begin feeding on macroalgae. An additional six to eight months are required before they reach the size where they are transferred to grow-out tanks or in-water systems. After growing in these tanks or in-water systems for 20 months or longer, they attain the typical three- to four-inch shell length preferred by the market. The number of participants in this industr y and their total production have increased through time, peaking in 1996. In 1991, 15 registered abalone aquaculturists in California produced an estimated 175,0 0 0 pounds of abalone in the shell. By 1996, 27 registered abalone aquaculturists produced over 292,0 0 0 pounds of product. Participation and  production then declined slightly through 1998 when 22 aquaculturists produced 162,0 0 0 pounds of product valued at $2.4 million. Only 13 of the 22 abalone aquaculturists registered in 1998 were actively producing abalone and most of the production came from four or ve growers. The decline in participation and production since 1996 is attributable, at least in part, to disease impacts exacerbated to some extent by a signicant El Nio event. Until recently, cultivated abalone had been considered relatively disease-free. The bacterium Vibrio sp. infected lar val cultures, but it was typically suppressed by using ltered, ultraviolet treated seawater. That perspective changed with the introduction of a parasitic sabellid polychaete worm from South Africa. By the mid-1990s, the parasite had spread to virtually ever y abalone aquaculture facility in the state. The worm induces the infested abalone to form a tube for it out of nacreous material. With heav y infestations, the abalone shell is brittle and ver y deformed and abalone growth is stunted. Impacts to the industr y included loss from voluntar y stock destruction and reduced income from marketing deformed product. Cooperative efforts by the industr y, the Department of Fish and Game (DFG), and Sea Grant sponsored university researchers have almost completely eradicated the worm from California. Unfortunately, the industr y also started experiencing elevated losses of cultured product from withering syndrome (WS) during this same time frame. This disease, caused by a rickettsia-like prokar yote, is characterized by a drastic shrinkage of the abalones' foot and is always fatal. However, red abalone can be infected by the bacterium without showing clinical signs of disease. Research suggests that a stress trigger is necessar y to induce clinical signs of the disease in this specie. The only recognized stress trigger is elevated water temperature. With the El Nio event, many facilities experienced elevated water temperatures that triggered WS, resulting in elevated mortality in their cultured stock. The dedicated entrepreneurs at the core of this industr y have achieved their successes despite these challenges and interest in abalone aquaculture remains high, prompted in part by the closure of the commercial abalone sher y in 1997. Presently, abalone are available to meet market demands only through importation or the purchase of cultured abalone. Consequently, there is a high market demand and a good price to growers for the farmed product. A more recent positive development in abalone aquaculture is the production of cultured abalone pearls. The product is produced by inserting a nucleus into the abalone. Given time, nacre is laid over the nucleus to form a semi-spherical pearl that has all the lustrous hues of the shell interior. Once extracted, these pearls are set in  Re d a b a l o n e b e i n g g ro w n o u t o n p l a s t i c s u b s t r a t e.  494  California's Living Marine Resources: A Status Report  CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND GA ME December 2001   jewelr y and the meat is processed for sale to restaurant trade as either a fresh or frozen product.

C u l t u r e o f A b a lo n e  Status of Biological Knowledge  A  considerable amount of research on abalone aquaculture has been accomplished by the private sector, particularly with respect to systems design and overall technology. University and DFG scientists have also made major contributions. Sea Grant-funded research has greatly increased our understanding of abalone developmental biology. Spawning induction procedures, lar val settlement inducers, and lar val rearing systems were developed by researchers funded through this program. Sea Grant-funded research has also contributed signicantly to our understanding of abalone diseases. The DFG began abalone culture investigations in 1971 at its Granite Canyon Laborator y near Monterey. That effort led to the development of a through-owing lar val rearing system and the development of a ush-ll tank system that have been adopted by the industr y. The DFG subsequently developed a pilot production hatcher y at Granite Canyon that provided training opportunities and resulted in the production of seed abalone for enhancement research. The DFG's Marine Region shellsh pathology laborator y in Bodega Bay has expanded our knowledge of the biology of the parasitic sabellid worm that has contributed signicantly to the success that has been achieved in the cooperative eradication efforts. That laborator y also identied the causative agent for WS and has conducted extensive research into questions related to transmission and control of this pathogen. Two principle areas for research, nutrition and genetics, may provide signicant benets to the industr y in the future. Prepared diets have been developed and are being used widely for juvenile stages. However, most prepared feeds are expensive and not readily accepted by adult abalone in comparison to giant kelp. Less progress has been made in genetics research. Most growers use a selection process where brood stock is selected based on growth rates. Wild broodstock is also used to maintain genetic diversity in cultured stocks. Some research has been done with triploidy as a means of enhancing abalone growth rates. While encouraging, the results have not been applied broadly within the industr y. E a rl Eb e r t US Abalone  McBride, Susan C. 1998. Current status of abalone aquaculture in the Californias. Jour.

(RCCL), one of the world's largest cruise lines, for conspiracy to dump waste oil in U.S. waters from five of its cruise ships and for making false statements about its practices to the Coast Guard.  The ten-count indictment, unsealed today, also charges RCCL and two high level employees with obstruction of justice for tampering with witnesses and destroying evidence that a cruise ship was bypassing pollution control procedures.       On October 25, 1994, as part of a proactive U.S. Coast Guard surveillance operation designed to detect and deter the intentional dumping of waste oil, the Coast Guard observed RCCL's flag ship, the Sovereign of the Seas, discharging waste oil from the vessel's bilges in U.S. territorial waters off the coast of Puerto Rico.  The Coast Guard boarded the ship to investigate.  The indictment alleges that following the boarding, but prior to a follow-up inspection, the ship's First Engineer ordered the removal and destruction of a pipe used to bypass the ship's oil water separator, a required pollution control device.       The indictment charges that cruise ship engineers routinely dumped oily bilge waste overboard from the Soveriegn of the Seas and other cruise ships, instead of processing the waste through the separator and discharging waste oil to a reception facility in port.  RCCL employees allegedly falsified oil record books on various ships to conceal the discharge practices from the Coast Guard.  The crew of the ship allegedly referred to the log as the ""Eventyrbok,"" after a popular Norwegian fairytale book.       ""This indictment is a shot across the bow of ships that would intentionally foul our coastal waters and lie about it to federal investigators.  As a port and coastal nation, the United States has a great interest in assuring that vessels using our ports and waters protect our environment and tell the truth,"" said Lois J. Schiffer, Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Justice Department's Environment and Natural Resources Division.  ""Charges that one of the largest cruise lines in the world was deliberately polluting the environment was lying to regulators is very serious.  The case represents a reasonable exercise of port state and coastal state enforcement authority.""       ""This prosecution sounds a fog horn to ship companies and crew members that vessels using the waters adjacent to Puerto Rico had better comply with the law.  Lying to the Coast Guard is a serious crime that will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law,"" said U.S. Attorney Guillermo Gil.       RCCL Chief Engineer Henry Ericksen and First Engineer Svenn Rikard Roeymo also were charged in today's indictment.  Ericksen allegedly ordered a crew member to lie to the Coast Guard and a federal grand jury in San Juan.  Roeymo allegedly ordered that the bypass pipe be removed following the Coast Guard boarding.        The indictment also charges that the engineers on at least five RCCL cruise ships -- Sovereign of the Seas, Monarch of the Seas, Song of America, Nordic Prince and Nordic Empress -- maintained false documents to conceal overboard discharges of oily bilge waste from the Coast Guard.  Additional acts in the conspiracy include:      The Song of America oil record book contained false entries      and failed to disclose that sludge oil as well as oil      contaminated bilge waste were routinely dumped overboard      from the ship;      The Nordic Prince oil record book contained false entries      and failed to disclose that oily bilge waste was discharged      in the summer of 1994 on cruises between Canada and Alaska;      and,      An RCCL engineer was ordered to make false entries in the      Nordic Prince oil record book during a 1994 Coast Guard      inspection in Alaska in order to create the false impression      that the Oil Water Separator was used.       RCCL is incorporated in Liberia and headquartered in Miami, Florida.  Major U.S. ports used by RCCL include New York, Miami, San Juan, St. Thomas, Los Angeles, and Juneau, Alaska.         The case was investigated by the U.S. Coast Guard Investigative Service, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Environmental Protection Agency Criminal Investigative Division, and is being prosecuted by Justice Department Environmental Crimes Section Trial Attorneys Richard A. Udell and Michael J. Woods in conjunction with the U.S. Attorney's Office in San Juan.       An indictment represents charges brought by a federal grand jury and is not itself evidence.  The government has the burden of proving the charges at trial beyond a reasonable doubt.  The investigation is continuing.                                ### 96-602"

The coral reefs and seagrass beds support a high diversity of fishes, endangered sea turtles, and other organisms. Damage to marine      habitats occurs from natural processes (hurricanes, disease outbreaks) and human activities such as sediment runoff from increased clearing and development of privately held lands, damage from boats running aground and cruise ships running into the island, and nutrient input from over 1.2 million visitors a year (VINP) and increasing numbers of charter and  cruising boats.       To provide information on natural rates of change and recovery following disturbances, permanent long-term monitoring sites were established at the three parks: in VINP on 3 reefs (Lameshur-1989, Newfound-1990, and Windspirit reef-1991); on the fringing reef at BUCK (1988); and 5 reef sites at Dry Tortugas National Park (1989).

GX238-53-2981382	Free Car-Trip Environmental Game Ends the Time-Honored Car Trip Question, Are We There Yet?          ANNAPOLIS, MD (May 21, 2002) - Back and better than ever, Maryland's 2002 Bay Game features new games, including puzzles, mazes and bingo, as well as new sites along the drive to the beach.    The Bay game helps turn an ordinary ride to the beach into an valuable environmental learning experience, said Governor Parris N. Glendening. It is a great way for families to spend time together while also teaching children about Maryland, its environment and the Chesapeake Bay.   The Maryland Bay Game, the first educational tool of its kind in the nation, is designed for children to pass the time while riding to the Eastern Shore beaches via U.S. 50 and MD 404.    This years Bay Game also introduces two new characters, Cooper and Hanna, two water droplets who meet while traveling through the Chesapeake Bay watershed and tell the story of their journey.   The game is available FREE while supplies last from toll collectors at the William Preston Lane, Jr. Memorial Bridge (Bay Bridge) from Memorial Day thru Labor Day. Games are also available at county tourism offices.   Last year, more than 300,000 families picked up the Bay Game at the Bay Bridge. This is the sixth summer the Bay Game has been offered: a million copies of the game have been printed and distributed to date.   Designed for children ages 3 and up, the Bay Game helps increase awareness of how our surroundings relate to the Chesapeake Bay. In addition, the game helps keep children occupied during long car rides.    This year's 24-page booklet encourages children to locate 14 sites, which are marked with Bay Game site highway signs on the way to the beach. The game booklet also contains a Walk Smart detachable bookmark, a word search, crossword puzzle, math quiz, secret code message, a stump-the-grownups game, a full page of color stickers and much more.   Along with being a valuable resource for parents and children traveling to the beach each summer, the Bay Game provides environmental tools for thousands of teachers across the state, said Lt. Governor Kathleen Kennedy Townsend.    DNR provides thousands of copies of the Bay to Maryland teachers every year, who use it to educate students about environmental issues and the Chesapeake Bay. In addition, private and governmental environmental organizations across the nation who are interested in developing a program and product similar to Maryland's Bay Game have also requested copies.   Maryland's Bay Game is made possible through contributors and sponsors including Chesapeake Bay Trust, Constellation Energy Group, Dairy Queen of Kent Island, Forman, Inc., Giant Food, Inc., Henry H. Lewis Contractors, Inc., Maryland Department of Natural Resources, Maryland Department of Transportation, State Highway Administration, Maryland Port Administration, Maryland Department of Agriculture, Maryland Transportation Authority, NOAA Chesapeake Bay Office, PEPCO, Town of Ocean City, and the US Fish and Wildlife Service Chesapeake Bay Office    For more information about the Bay Game, visit the DNR Web site at  www.dnr.state.md.us/baygame .

GX238-51-6252378	By studying and understanding the impacts of our past action, and working to repair and restore out waterways today,  we are helping to shape their future and the quality of life of  future generations.        Goal 1  >  2   >  3   >  4   >  5   >  6   >  7   >  8    Time for renewal:         a landmark agreement for the chesapeake bay     History was made in 1987, when the Chesapeake Bay Agreement became a model for estuary restoration around the world.  Thirteen years later, the State of Maryland and DNR were again at the helm, with Governor Parris N. Glendening leading development of new specific guidelines that will serve  as a regional blueprint for Bay restoration  over the next decade.   Chesapeake 2000  was signed by the Governor, Chair of the Chesapeake Executive Council, and state and federal representatives of neighboring watershed jurisdictions in a Bayside ceremony on June 28, 2000.    Formulated with a better understanding of how the Bay works, and increased awareness of the critical steps necessary to ensure its healthy future, the  new Bay Agreement  calls for: a tenfold increase in oyster populations; expansion of Bay grass beds and wetlands; removal of the Bay from the impaired waters list; enhanced cooperation with local governments; a 30 percent reduction in sprawl development; preservation of 20 percent of the watershed's land area from development; and leadership by example for government agencies.          Strategically speaking           Conducting public forums, workshops and field trips for citizens, school groups and legislators are all in a day's work for  Maryland's Tributary Strategy Teams  -- 10 distinct groups working to stem Bay pollution at its source by cleaning up the streams, creeks and rivers that feed into the Chesapeake.  Since 1995, this first of its kind program has united Maryland farmers, citizens, environmental groups, businesses and local jurisdictions in a common cause: To improve water quality in their own back yards -- the Bay's 10 sub-watersheds -- through educational programs, nutrient reduction projects and habitat improvement activities.   During fiscal years 2000 and 2001, Trib Teams supported new Bay Agreement goals with multifaceted programs focusing on  policy, education and hands-on activities , organizing water quality wade-ins, tree grow-out stations, an urban tree nursery, riparian buffer plantings and natural resource inventories.     On the Eastern Shore, team-created task forces examined options for reducing  septic system and public drainage impacts , while the Lower Western Shore team's Air Committee helped develop the Governor's Executive Order on Green Power and Energy Efficiency.  In partnership with DNR experts and state, federal and local agencies, teams worked to develop basin summaries and management priorities to improve impaired waters, and  new Chesapeake Bay water quality criteria  to protect living resources.           One fish, two Fish           Maryland's vast fishery resources help sustain our regional economy as well as the Chesapeake way of life.  As in years past, the news and the bounties have been mixed...        Continuing signs of decline, the state's 2001  blue crab commercial harvest  is estimated to be about 20 million pounds, about 60 percent of the long term average of 34 million pounds.  Efforts to develop a long term integrated management strategy continue, coordinated by the Chesapeake Bay Commission Bi-state Blue Crab Advisory Committee. The commission approved overfishing and overfished thresholds in January, and Maryland and Virginia took initial action as a part of a three-year plan to reduce the crab catch by 15 percent.  2001 actions include shorter seasons and workdays in the commercial fishery and reduced catch limits in the recreational fishery.      Reducing fishing pressure by 15 percent is the preferred short term strategy to reach the agreed upon target. By leaving a larger percentage of legal crabs in the Bay each year, spawning potential will improve, leading to long term rebuilding and protection of Chesapeake Bay crab stocks.   Management options for further reductions in 2002 are being developed.  Leading  oyster restoration  efforts, DNR's shellfish team worked with commercial watermen and citizen conservation groups to:  plant 3.3 million bushels of oyster shells to improve habitat; plant 271,000 bushels of seed oysters to increase  populations; build 13 shell mounds as oyster reef habitat; and experimentally clean 172 acres of bottom.  The number of oyster sanctuaries grew from 19 to 24 this year, well ahead of the 2002 goal of 25.  At the  Paul S. Sarbanes Cooperative Oxford Laboratory  -- a joint venture between DNR and NOAA (National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration) --  public service and research focuses on the health of fish, shellfish, marine mammals, sea turtles and wildlife.  Special 2001 accomplishments included electronic mapping of Chesapeake Bay oyster habitat, a Bay wide assessment of oyster populations, new studies of oyster and clam diseases, and improved understanding of striped bass and menhaden diseases.   Progress continued toward another Bay Agreement goal, to  reopen 388.65 miles of upstream habitat to migratory fish by 2003 .  More than 349 miles of streams and rivers have been reopened to date through fishway construction, blockage removal or structure modification.    The resounding  success story of Maryland's striped bass  stock continued, with the 2001 juvenile index of abundance at 50.8 -- the second highest measured in the survey's 48-year history.  Close monitoring of harvest and other data, such as the young of the year survey, are ensuring responsible, effective management of the fishery.  Maryland's annual sample of striped bass spawning stock in the Potomac River and Upper Chesapeake Bay areas indicated a slight increase in the proportion of female striped bass over age eight.  Short and long term planning are integral to managing Maryland's fisheries resources for the long term.  Exploring  important issues such as aquaculture, ecosystem and multi species management, habitat, importation and mortality rates: reviews of or revisions to Atlantic sturgeon,  American shad, black drum, bluefish, weakfish and yellow perch Fishery Management Plans (FMPs)  were completed; the Coastal Bays FMP was established; the blue crab FMP was completed with adoption anticipated for 2002; a hard clam FMP was developed; and the Chesapeake Bay Program FMP workgroup was expanded.  Our natural treasures belong to all of us, shaping our history, enhancing our present and, in some ways, forecasting our future.  Along with teaching citizens how to enjoy our resources safely, responsibly and within the law, Maryland's  Natural Resources Police (NRP)  also work to protect those resources from those who violate state and federal law.  During the past two  years, the NRP completed several  major investigations into illegal fishing  -- including a collaboration with federal agents and a five-year undercover operation.  Illegal pound net fishing, false catch reporting, checking station misuse, and undersize and overlimit catches resulted in thousands of charges and tens of thousands of dollars in fines being levied.         Quality Counts           Critical to the health of the Chesapeake Bay ecosystem, underwater grasses improve water quality and provide food and shelter for waterfowl, fish and crabs.  Setting the foundation for the broader effort called for in the new Bay Agreement, DNR scientists are guiding  submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV)  protection and restoration activities  across the state --  identifying suitable planting areas, refining planting techniques and developing growing methods and facilities.  Through a unique partnership with the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, established in 1998, students at 200 participating Maryland schools are this year growing  Bay Grasses in Classes  for transplanting into local waterways.  DNR's resource assessment team continues to head Maryland efforts to monitor and respond to  harmful algae blooms   in the Chesapeake and Coastal Bays, including Pfiesteria, mahogany tides, blue-green algae and browntides.     In response to outbreaks this year, the team conducted sampling, laboratory analyses and data management while collaborating with state and local agencies, citizens and the media to protect public health, fish populations, water quality  and economic interests.        Reducing Nutrient Loads           DNR worked with the Maryland Department of the Environment, marinas, and boating and conservation groups to identify candidate  no discharge zones ; in September, the two agencies jointly submitted applications to the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for Herring Bay and the northern Coastal Bays.  If approved, beginning in 2002 it will be illegal for boaters to discharge sewage in these areas -- even if it has been treated by a certified marine sanitation device.  (It is already illegal to discharge raw sewage.)  More than 300 of Maryland's 600 marinas now provide  pumpout services , resulting in the proper disposal of about one million gallons of boat waste each year.  Most of these were completely funded by a DNR-administered grant utilizing federal Clean Vessel Act funds and state Waterway Improvement funds.  Our long range goal -- in accordance with the new Bay Agreement  is to increase the number of pumpouts to 450.   During FY '01, 22 facilities were certified environmentally-responsible  Clean Marinas  -- more than during the program's first two years combined!  There are now 36 certified Clean Marinas and six certified Clean Marina Partners (boat ramps and other boating facilities).  If Maryland can certify 25 percent (150) of its marinas by 2004 through this voluntary program, we expect to avoid additional regulations.        A shore thing           Shore erosion  is a major contributor of sediments and nutrients to our waterways, destroying land, buffer areas and habitat.   In response to recommendations from  Governor Glendening's January 2000 Shore Erosion Task Force , a new comprehensive plan has identified project priorities along with Maryland's three highly susceptible counties (St. Mary's, Dorchester and Anne Arundel), control strategies, and long-term funding mechanisms; a structural project component has been reestablished; and program restructuring will enhance our ability to respond to local erosion control needs.    Work toward a list of 65 potential projects in 11 counties is underway, beginning with highest priorities.  Since 1968, Maryland's  Shore Erosion Control Program  has established more than 1,200 projects, stabilizing approximately 75 miles of eroding tidal shorelines and streambanks.        Along the Coast           Since the  Coastal Bays  were established as a National Estuary Program site in 1996, our coastal zone management team has worked with staff across the agency to coordinate and track activities focusing on watershed planning, riparian buffers, macroalgae research and fisheries management.    This year's noteworthy efforts included work to develop and implement a  comprehensive monitoring program ; completion of a Sea Level Rise Response Strategy with recommendations for research, education, and potential management and policy options; establishment of a  new fisheries management planning process  for setting new goals, objectives and commercial and recreational regulations;  development of navigation and dredging recommendations; and mapping of sensitive aquatic areas .

The enabling legislation of Virgin Islands National Park (VINP), Buck Island Reef National Monument (BUCK), and Dry Tortugas National Park (DTNP) all recognize the significance of the marine resources. The coral reefs and seagrass beds support a high diversity of fishes,endangered sea turtles, and other organisms. Damage to marine habitats occurs from natural processes (hurricanes, disease outbreaks) and human activities such as sediment runoff from increased clearing and development of privately held lands, damage from boats running aground and cruise ships running into the island, and nutrient input from over 1.2 million visitors a year (VINP) and increasing numbers of charter and cruising boats.        Because VINP, BUCK and DTNP contain a large part of the protected coral reefs in the United States and participate in a coordinated research program, they were chosen in 1996 to be an NPS/NBS Inventory and Monitoring (I&M) prototype park cluster. The seven years of coral reef research at VINP, BUCK and DTNP will form the basis for developing and fine-tuning protocols for coral reef work worldwide.

GX048-01-12658866	"RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN SHELLFISH CULTURE ON THE U.S. PACIFIC COAST   JOHN B. GLUDE 1    OYSTERS    Two species of oysters are produced in the States of Washington, Oregon, and California in the bays shown in  Figure 1 . The small native oyster,  Ostrea lurida  Carpenter, 1863, is found in all three states, but is raised commercially only in the southern part of Puget Sound, Wash. Production is low, but prices are extremely high since this oyster is served as a specialty in seafood restaurants.   The major species produced on the West Coast of the United States is the ''Pacific"" oyster,  Crassostrea gigas  Thunberg, 1793, which was first introduced from Japan about 40 yr ago. Except for the period 1941-46 seed oysters have been imported from Japan each year. Periodically local reproduction occurs and U.S. growers are able to augment their seed supply by collecting spat locally.   Major oyster producing areas are Willapa Bay, Grays Harbor, and Puget Sound in Washington; Tillamook, Yaquina, and Coos Bays in Oregon; Humboldt Bay, Tomales Bay, Morro Bay, and Drakes Estero in California.   The major part of U.S. West Coast production comes from Washington, as shown in  Figure 2 . Peak production of over 10 million pounds of shucked meats was reached in 1954 to 1956. Since that time production has decreased to a mean of 6.4 million pounds for the period 1966-70.   Oyster production in California increased rapidly from 1954 to 1957, exceeded I million pounds of meats from that time until 1965, and decreased somewhat in the following years, but again exceeded 1 million pounds in 1970.   Oyster production in Oregon reached nearly 1 million pounds per year in 1950 to 1952 and then dropped to about one-half million per year, and continues at about that level.    CLAMS    Several species of clams are harvested commercially on the U.S. Pacific coast. The razor clam,  Siliqua patula  (Dixon, 1788), and the Pismo clam,  Tivela stultorum  (Mange, 1823), occur on the open wave-swept ocean beaches. Although both of these species were originally harvested commercially, the growing trend toward recreational fisheries has resulted in a disappearing commercial fishery. Only a few areas remain on the Washington coast where commercial harvesting of razor clams is still permitted; but each weekend during the open season up to 25,000 recreational diggers attack the beaches hoping to obtain their limit of 18 clams each.   Other species grouped in the category of ""hard"" clams found in protected bays and inlets provide a significant commercial fishery. Species include the native littleneck or rock clam,  Protothaca staminea  (Conrad, 1837); the butter clam,  Saxidomus nuttali  Conrad, 1837; and the introduced Japanese littleneck or ""Manila'' clam,  Tapes semidecussata  ( Reeve, 1864).   The commercial demand for hard-shell clams is very good and prices are high in comparison to oysters. Production does not meet the demand and significant quantities of hard-shell clams are imported from British Columbia, Canada. There is very little ""farming'' of these clams and production is based on harvesting natural populations, principally upon privately-owned or privately-leased intertidal lands.   Clam production on the U.S. Pacific coast is centered in Washington with production ranging from 400,000 to nearly 1 million pounds of meats per year, as shown in  Figure 3 . Although production has varied during the past 20 yr, no clear production trend is evident from these records which include all species of clams. Decreases in commercial production of razor clams are largely offset by increased harvests of hard clams.   The few protected bays and inlets along the Oregon coast produced between 100,000 and 200,000 pounds of clam meats per year for the period 1948-55 and have since dropped to a relatively low level.   Commercial clam production in California was never great and has been negligible in recent years.   In both Oregon and California the tourist demand for hard-shell clams, as well as razor and Pismo clams, has utilized an increasing proportion of the available supply.    ANALYSIS OF TRENDS IN OYSTER PRODUCTION    There are several factors which help to explain the decrease in production of Pacific oysters during the past decade, as shown on  Figure 4 . A major factor is the limited U.S. market for oysters. The United States per capita consumption of fishery products generally has remained nearly static for a number of years at about 11 pounds, and per capita consumption of oysters during this period has actually decreased. There has been little or no market promotion by the oyster industry which is poorly organized and made up of many small companies.   Although the quality of oysters produced and marketed as a refrigerated, raw, shucked product is generally good at the time the oysters leave the plant, the delay in the distribution, especially to more distant areas, results in a significant decrease in quality.   Distribution to the Rocky Mountain and MidWest states from the Pacific coast is more difficult now because Railway Express, which utilized rapid passenger trains, has become less available as trains are being discontinued because of the general trend toward air travel. Transportation of oysters by air to many of these locations is not economical because of the small volume to be shipped. All of this has resulted in curtailment of oyster markets in a large portion of the United States.   Another factor is the competition for the fresh-oyster market from East Coast or Gulf of Mexico, the American oysters,  Crassostrea virginica  Gmelin. Much of the production in these areas is from public beds which results in a low price when oysters are abundant, and a high price when oysters are scarce.   Oyster production on the Atlantic coast was generally low for several years following the major mass mortalities of oysters caused by the Haplosporidian  Minchinnia nelsoni  which began in Delaware Bay in 1957 and spread to Chesapeake Bay during the following 2 or 3 yr. During this period the demand for Pacific oysters expanded and prices increased during the years 1960-61 and again between 1966 and 1967. More recently, production of low-priced oysters on the East Coast has increased, causing a reduction in market demand for Pacific oysters. Market price of oysters on the Pacific coast has remained static for the past 4 yr even though costs generally have increased during this period, as indicated by  Table 1  and  Figure 4 .   The price per gallon of oysters shown in Table 1 is somewhat misleading since this is the price paid by wholesalers for shucked oysters delivered to Seattle, Wash., for the fresh-oyster trade. During recent years when supplies have exceeded the market demand for fresh oysters, it has been necessary to divert a part of the production into canned oysters, smoked oysters, or oyster stew. The price of oysters for a processed product must necessarily be  lower  than the price for fresh oysters. Therefore, the average price received by many growers was significantly less than that indicated on  Table 1 .   Efficient growers have reduced production during this period and now use only their best land. This reduces their costs by increasing the yield per unit area and by reducing the time required for a crop to reach marketable size.   Another factor which has increased costs has been the lack of local setting during the past 3 yr. Locally produced seed is generally less costly than imported seed, especially for those growers who are able to collect their own seed from natural reproduction. Also, the price of imported seed has increased recently and many growers hesitate to invest in seed because of the squeeze between increasing costs of production and limited demand at static prices.   In summary, production of Pacific oysters has decreased to fit the present market. Marginal producers have dropped out, and efficient producers have curtailed production. Prices have remained generally static, whereas costs have increased producing a generally unfavorable profit picture for the Pacific coast oyster industry. Given increased demand at profitable price levels, production could be greatly increased.    NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN OYSTER PRODUCTION    Specialty Products    Hidden in the statistics, because of low volume, is a newly developed market for ""specialty"" oysters. These are partially grown Pacific oysters, usually marketed under the trade name ""yearling"" oysters. These oysters are about 3 inches in length, similar to the size marketed in Japan, and are suitable for the raw half-shell trade, oyster cocktails, stews, sauteed oysters, etc. This product has a much better market acceptance than large Pacific oysters which must be blanched and cut into pieces before cooking.   The market for yearling oysters is rather limited, production costs are high and volume is low, but these oysters sell for two to three time the price of standard-sized oysters. Turnover is rapid because of the short time required to grow marketable-sized oysters. All factors considered, several small companies have been able to improve their profit picture by producing this specialty product.   Another development is a patented process which reportedly produces superior frozen oysters. This process consists of hand-shucking, partial cooking, breading, and rapid freezing. This product retains the flavor wel! and resists oxidation during frozen storage. Although relatively expensive to produce because of the costs of hand-shucking, this product is finding good market acceptance. Frozen oysters can be shipped by surface transportation which is cheaper than the air shipment required to deliver fresh shucked oysters to distant markets.    Increasing Use of Off-bottom Culture    Although off-bottom culture of Pacific oysters has been used in Japan for many years, this method has only recently gained acceptance on the Pacific coast of the United States. This is mainly because extensive intertidal areas have been available for oyster culture and production of oysters on bottom is less costly than production off-bottom.   Within the past 3 yr, however, several oyster growers have begun oyster culture using rafts or racks, and those who have been able to market a specialty product at a higher price have been quite successful. One company has constructed simple rafts using Styrofoam for flotation and suspends seed oysters on wires below the rafts in a protected part of Puget Sound, Wash. After 15-18 mo those oysters which have reached commercial size are marketed, and the rest are placed on-bottom for another growing season. These small oysters are well accepted in the Seattle market at higher than average prices, and it appears that this production method will be economical.   Several Oregon growers in Yaquina Bay near Newport, Oreg., suspend Fiberglas 2  trays of oysters below rafts and market these oysters at a small size in restaurants in Portland, Oreg. These growers have found that tray culture is somewhat more expensive than ""string"" culture, and they may discontinue the use of trays.   One company at Eureka, Calif., has an extensive system of racks placed along the banks of channels in Humboldt Bay. Oysters raised on these racks grow faster than those on bottom and are generally in better condition.   It has also been observed that mortality of oysters suspended from racks is lower than that of oysters placed directly on the tide flats. Oyster mortality on the beds in Humboldt Bay in 1971 was recorded as 40% by pathologists of the California Department of Fish and Game, whereas mortality of oysters suspended from racks was 10%.   Although rack culture generally is more costly than ""on-bottom"" culture and requires special locations, there is a belief that Pacific oysters raised off-bottom have a milder flavor than those raised on-bottom. An organoleptic test to compare the flavor of oysters reared under various conditions will be conducted by the Washington State Department of Fisheries and the National Marine Fisheries Service in Seattle during November 1971.   Raft culture has many of the advantages of rack culture and also provides more latitude in selection of locations since rafts can be anchored in waters of various depths. The principal requirements for raft culture are 1) shelter from storms, 2) sufficient depth. and 3) permits from local zoning authorities and Corps of Engineers for anchoring rafts.   An anticipated development is a system of growing oysters on submerged rafts or racks. This system will probably be necessary in areas where recreational use of the water surface for fishing, boating, etc. would make it difficult to obtain permission for raft culture. Engineering designs for structures needed for this type of culture have not yet been completed, but might be patterned after the submerged racks which are used in French Polynesia for pearl oyster culture to avoid storm damage and fouling.    Use of ""Unattached"" or ""Cultchless"" Seed    Pacific Mariculture, Inc. near San Francisco, Calif., has patented a process of producing individual seed oysters which have several advantages. This seed is readily available at any time of the year and can be shipped economically by air freight. Survival during shipment and after planting has been excellent and the individual oysters develop a uniform shape which makes a very attractive product.   Disadvantages of ""unattached"" seed are that it requires special handling in screen trays, and this requires a large amount of hand labor. Growth is generally poor in trays unless there is adequate circulation of water which contains adequate food supplies. These individual oysters must be quite large before they will stay in place on oyster beds which are exposed to waves, currents, or storms. This limits the use of this seed for traditional oyster farming and requires development of new aquacultural systems. It appears that ""unattached"" seed will become an important factor during the next few years, provided specialty markets can be developed for the product.   During March 1971, I made experimental plantings of ""unattached""  Crassostrea gigas  seed from the Pacific Mariculture hatchery at several locations inthe Fiji Islands. Survival of this seed was excellent and growth was satisfactory after the spat were cemented to fiberboard (Masonite or asbestos hoard) squares strung on wire or rope and suspended below rafts. It appears that this method will be applicable any place where hydrographic conditions permit the use of rafts or racks and where laborcosts are low.    Air Shipment of Anesthetized Oyster Larvae    Pacific Mariculture, Inc. has recently patented a method for temporarily suspending activity of mature oyster larvae. With this method it is possible to air ship large quantities of mature oyster larvae in small containers from California to oyster culture areas. At these locations larvae are placed in tanks of warm water with suitable cultch materials. Attachment is completed within 2 hr. This method avoids the cost of shipping heavy ""mother"" shells or other cultch materials since one-half million larvae can be shipped in a Yz-liter bottle. Oyster growers can then ""set"" the larvae on desired cultch materials and plant them on their oyster beds. This method needs further development to improve its reliability, but it appears probable that this will be accomplished in the near future and that this method will find application in many places.    Investigation of Causes of Oyster Mortality on the Pacific Coast    Mortalities of 10-70% during the second or third summer after planting Pacific oyster seed has been observed at several locations along the Pacific coast. The most severe mortalities have occurred in southern Puget Sound and part of Willapa Bay in Washington, and Humboldt Bay in northern California. Negligible mortality levels have been observed in British Columbia, northern Puget Sound and Hood Canal in Washington, Oregon bays, and elsewhere in California.   Generally, heavy mortalities occur near the heads of bays which are warm and muddy with high nutrient levels, abundant phytoplankton, where oysters grow rapidly and fatten well. Mortalities generally occur during a few weeks in midsummer when the oysters are in spawning condition. It has been observed that mortalities have been more severe during warmer years.   Investigations during the past 5 yr by state fisheries agencies of Washington, Oregon, and California and by the laboratory of the National Marine Fisheries Service in Oxford, Md., have failed to detect a specific cause for this mortality. Tests for  Labyrinthomyxa marina  which causes extensive losses of oysters in the Gulf of Mexico and  Minchinnin nelsoni  which kills oysters in Chesapeake and Delaware Bays have proved negative. Although numerous microorganisms have been observed in the thousands of oysters examined from the Pacific coast, none have occurred consistently enough to indicate that they are associated with the observed mortalities.   In a new project, a graduate student at the University of Washington College of Fisheries in Seattle is investigating the relationship between the bacterium  Vibrio anquillarum  or V.  parahaemolyticus  and oyster mortalities. He has observed that  Vibrio  can kill oysters at elevated temperatures in laboratory experiments, but field tests have not yet been made.   Efforts of Washington State Department of Fisheries have recently been reoriented to develop new oyster culture techniques which will circumvent or offset mortalities. For example, transplanting partially grown oysters to low mortality areas before the second summer when heavy mortalities begin seems to be a practical solution. Also, improvement of handling methods for seed to reduce losses would help to offset mortality which might occur during the second summer.   In summary, mass mortalities significantly reduce production and profits in specific locations, but other areas remain unaffected. Research to determine causative factors is still in progress.    NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN CLAM PRODUCTION    Ocean beaches on the Pacific coast are owned by the states and held for public use. This prevents the private commercial development of farming for species such as the razor clam or Pismo clam which occur only in this habitat.   The intertidal zone in bays or estuaries is also owned by the states, but much of this land, especially in the State of Washington, has been sold to individuals who are usually the owners of the adjacent upland. Large areas of intertidal zone have also been leased by the states to individuals or companies for special purposes, such as oyster and clam culture. Subtidal bottoms also can be leased to individuals or companies for aquaculture.   Farming of clams has not reached the stage of development attained by oyster culture. The few commercial clam farms on the U.S. Pacific coast still depend upon natural setting to restock their beds. Clam farming is still only selective harvesting of a natural crop to obtain the greatest yield.   Until recently there has been no source of ""seed"" clams which might be used for planting on private lands and this has been a major deterrent to clam farming. Now a commercial hatchery in California has successfully produced large quantities of young Manila clams and has offered these for sale. Test plantings have been made in Willapa Bay, Wash., and in some other locations, but it is too soon to evaluate the success of these ventures.   I had the opportunity in March 1971 to obtain a small quantity of these seed clams from California and to plant them in trays in the Fiji Islands. Survival of clams was excellent, but growth was not outstanding. This experiment is still in progress, but it is already apparent that the first step in the development of commercial farming for clams, availability of seed, has been accomplished. With the large demand for clams and the limited supply, it is likely that a new clam farming industry will develop in Washington State within the next few years.   Three new developments in the utilization of natural stocks of mollusks occurred in Washington. Exploratory diving and population assessment by scientists of the Washington State Department of Fisheries have shown that less than 5% of the geoduck clam,  Panope generosa  Gould, 1850, are exposed at extreme low tide. Before this discovery it was thought that the geoduck was a scarce species which needed stringent regulation to prevent overharvesting. No commercial digging had been permitted and the recreational or personal use limit was set at three clams per day.   Now Washington has surveyed subtidal beds and established a system for leasing areas for commercial harvest by scuba divers using suction pumps. The product is now achieving market acceptance and a new industry has been established.   Another species of clams,  Mya arenaria  Linnaeus, 1758, known as the soft-shell clam in New England and Chesapeake Bay, is present in Washington but has not been utilized commercially. This clam has a somewhat less attractive appearance than the local littleneck and butter clams, and traditionally it has not been marketed in the Pacific Northwest. Heavy concentrations of soft-shell clams are found in muddy or sandy beaches, usually at the mouths of rivers, but areas suitable for these species are rather limited.   Recently several individuals or companies have begun harvesting soft-shell clams using two types of hydraulic dredges to minimize labor costs. One type similar to that used in Chesapeake Bay is operated from a boat and consists of a digging head which is forced through the bottom and a conveyor to bring the clams to the surface. The second type is hand-operated at low tide, but uses water pressure to wash the clams out of the bottom.   The quality of the soft clams in Washington is comparable to those from Chesapeake Bay or New England. If harvesting and shipping costs are not prohibitive, it is likely that a new industry for softshell clams will become established in the Pacific Northwest.   Large populations of the blue mussel,  Mytilus edulis  Linnaeus, 1758, occur in Puget Sound, Wash., but this species also traditionally has not been fully utilized in the United States. Puget Sound mussels are comparable to the European mussels in quality and the paralytic shellfish poisoning caused by their feeding on the dinoflagellate Gonyaulax, which sometimes limits mussel harvesting along the ocean coast, is not a problem in the inshore waters of Puget Sound.   Recently, through efforts of the marketing specialists of the National Marine Fisheries Service, local restaurants have begun to serve mussels and the product seems to be gaining acceptance in the Pacific Northwest. There are substantial natural stocks of mussels which could be harvested if a market develops. Also, it would be possible to supplement natural production by applying mussel farming techniques used in Holland, Spain, and elsewhere as the market expands.    COASTAL ZONING    People in the United States are becoming increasingly aware of the need to protect the environment from industrial or residential development. This need is especially apparent along the shoreline where several classes of users compete for space. Shellfish farmers are finding difficulty in obtaining approval from local ""zoning boards"" to anchor rafts for oyster culture in areas where shoreline residents want to use the water surface for boating, fishing, water skiing, etc. Even the installation of pilings or stakes marking boundaries of shellfish beds or wharfs for unloading the product are being questioned.   At the same time there is a major effort to maintain or improve water quality in the bays and estuaries and to eliminate sources of industrial and domestic pollution. These public efforts will help to assure continuation and expansion of aquaculture which is a ""clean"" industry. Furthermore, aquaculture provides a good economic justification for maintaining high water quality in inshore areas.   Federal and state legislation has been passed or is being considered to establish authorities and procedures for zoning the shoreline for special purposes. If fish and shellfish farmers can present a convincing argument, it is likely that certain areas will be reserved for aquaculture with assurance that water quality will be maintained at acceptable levels.    CONCLUSION    In conclusion, oyster production on the Pacific coast is limited by demand, but the potential exists for greatly increased harvests through application of modern methods of aquaculture.   Clam production is limited by natural supply. Clam farming has not been developed but, now that seed of at least one species is available, it is likely that commercial clam culture will develop rapidly in the Pacific Northwest.   Water quality will not be a limiting factor if the present awareness of the importance of the environment is translated into action to control pollution. Coastal zoning is a threat to aquaculture in some areas but could protect those areas which are most important for production of fish and shellfish.   1   Deputy Regional Director. Northwest Region.

GX045-27-13945217	KOREA-US AQUACULTURE -> Korean aquaculture  ->Technology->Hanging  culture               Shellfish (Longline aquaculture  system)   The aquaculture for oysters, mussels, pearl oysters, and  sea squirt are based on the long line system. In the system, the longlines are  horizontally stretched on the surface of the farming ground with the aid of  floats fixed to the location. To the longline on the water surface, vertical  ropes holding cultured species are attached downward with a regular interval.  The locations of the system should be contamination free, algal foods rich,  and deeper than 5 meters in common.      1. Longline system for Pacific oyster          The longline based oyster aquaculture in Korea is    practiced on the southeast and middle of the southern coasts, including Tongyoung    blue belts where the water depth are 5∼20m. The longlines are 100m long    and stretched in a parallel way with the interval of 5∼10m in width. The    floats anchored firmly to the bottom keep the longlines on the surface of the    water. The vertical ropes are hung from the longline with intervals of 50∼70cm    to which seed collectors are attached with intervals of 30∼ 50cm. Normally,    the lines are of polyethylene and the floats are of styrofoam .                    Longline culture system  for oysters.         1-1. Seed production of oyster     The seeds for oyster culture in Korea are wild or hatchery-based.  The seed spats are captured on collectors which are suspended from lines within  1 meter in depth. The seed collector is a string of scallop shells threaded  on a wire of about 1 meter length. A seed collector has about 50 scallop seeds  threaded together on a polyethylene wire. To capture absolute oyster seeds on  the collectors, the collectors should be set on time when oyster larvae predominate  the seedling grounds. A care should be given not to have barnacles attached  on the seed collectors. Failures are frequently resulted from the attachment  of barnacles which are a competitor to the collectors. Therefore, oyster aquaculturists  are busy monitoring the oyster larvae during the spawning season from June to  September.    It is now possible to obtain seed oysters attached on the    collectors in the hatchery, so-called hatchery-based seeds, which eliminate    the laborious works on the sea and worry about the failure of seed collector.    Two of the prominent advantages of hatchery-based seed production are to have    seeds from healthy broodstocks in physiological and genetic senses and to have    seeds the farmers need in time. These are because the hatchery researchers can    manipulate reproduction-related environmental factors to have the healthy broodstocks    spawned in their hatcheries. Temperature manipulation is one of the routine    factors to control the reproduction of the oyster. In the hatchery, algal foods    such as  Isochrysis galbana, Pavlova luteheri, Chaetoceros calcitrans, Tetraselmis    suecica, Phaeodactylum tricornutum , etc. are served singly or in a combination    manner for the nutritional balance.      1-2. Hardening of the seed     The oyster seeds collected in June to July (early seeds)  grow fast to 10mm in shell length by the end of September when the spat numbers  are 25∼30 per collector. The oyster seeds can go to on-growing culture after  2 to 3 weeks after attachment or can be hardened by September before on-growing.  The oysters spats grow to market size by the coming winter or spring. The oyster  seeds collected in August to September (late seeds) are hardened until coming  spring when they move to on-growing system. The hardening is achieved by fixing  the seeds attached on the collectors in the middle of intertidal zone to have  the seeds exposed to air and surfs in a regular manner. The hardened seeds are  smaller but stronger compared with those submerged all the way. Once moved to  on growing system, the hardened oysters are growing faster and more resistant  against diseases over those unhardened ones.    1-3. On-growing     Hardened or unhardened oyster seeds move to on-growing  system. In the system, 10∼25 collectors are attached to vertical rope of 2∼6m  length. The culture continues until harvest.    2. Longline system for pearl oyster     The longline system for pearl oysters are set in the coastal  waters where water temperature and depth are suitable. The pearl oysters are  cultured on the southeast coasts of Korean peninsula where water depth are 5∼10m.  The basic culture system for pearl oysters are same as that for Pacific oysters.  None of hatchery-based seeds are available.                  Longline  culture system for pearl oysters in Korea.       3. Longline culture system for sea squirt      The operation of the longline system for sea squirt are  in the coastal waters of the southeast and southern parts of Korean peninsula  where water depth are over 10m. The culture system for the sea quirt are also  same as that for Pacific oysters. The sea squirt seeds are available from the  hatchery in Korea.                        Longline culture system for sea squirt
GX241-90-4141072	Tributary Team Is Busy Planning Activities To Spread Clean Water Message      Annapolis, MD (May 12, 1998)--Marylands Lower Western Shore Tributary Team is designing and implementing a series of projects over the next few months that will bring greater awareness to nutrient pollution issues and  lead to a reduction of those contaminants in the watershed.   The Lower Western Shore Tributary Team reviews water quality issues within Anne Arundel and Calvert counties that drain into the Chesapeake Bay. Nutrient pollution, primarily excess nitrogen and phosphorus, come from both point and non-point sources and the team focuses on both. The 10 tributary teams throughout the state are composed of individuals from farming, business, academic, government, environmental and citizens' groups. Their work is focused on reducing nutrient pollution, considered to be one of the largest threats to good water quality in the state.   Next Wednesday and Thursday, May 20 and 21, team members, along with 200 students from Southern High School, will plant Bay grasses in Rose Haven. Funded by the Chesapeake Bay Trust and organized by the Rose Haven Concerned Citizens Association, the project presents an opportunity to teach the importance of sub-aquatic vegetation and help students earn service learning credits for graduation. Bay grasses absorb nutrients, produce oxygen and acts as food and shelter for  fish and waterfowl.        On June 6, the team will set up an educational display during the South County Festival at Herrington Harbor-North in Deale. The display booth will contain information on the team, maps of the 25 square mile Herring Bay watershed and actions that  citizens can take to help keep the watershed and Bay healthy and clean.     Come June 14, the team, Anne Arundel County officials, including Dels. George Owings and Virginia Clagett, will join their counterparts across the state for a wade-in that symbolically assesses water quality in their area. The Lower Western Shore wade-in will take place at noon on Owings Cliff Beach in Fairhaven. The wade-in is based on retired state Sen. Bernie Fowlers annual wade into the Patuxent River which has brought continued attention to the plight and clean-up of that river and the Bay.     Also that day, wade-in participants will be asked to sign-up for the teams oyster gardening project. Project participants will be given seed oysters and instruction on how to grow the bi-valves from their private piers for ecological benefit.      On July 11, the team will take its work to another level with the launch of its clean watershed initiative for Herring Bay. The team asserts that the natural resources of Herring Bay and its watershed are comparable to the Chesapeake Bay. Many of the types of groups and landowners located along the Chesapeake can also be found along Herring Bay. The team hopes that the Herring Bay Clean Watershed Initiative will be used as a management model to examine strategies and outcomes of a citizen-driven plan. A host of festivities for the initiatives kick-off are being planned.     The team  invites all to take part in these exciting Herring Bay watershed-based activities. Watermen, farmers, citizens and representatives of the development/business community who have an interest in participating on the Lower Western Shore Tributary Team and/or the  Herring Bay Clean Watershed Initiative can contact team coordinator Roger Banting at (410) 260-8725.  New team members are appointed by the Governor.   Governor Parris N. Glendening appointed the teams in fall 1995 to assist with the implementation of the state's watershed-based plans to reduce nutrient pollution reaching the Chesapeake Bay and Maryland rivers. Maryland has pledged to reduce nutrients reaching the Bay by 40 percent between 1985 and 2000.      Posted on May 15, 1998

GX247-44-5971858	"More Than 200 Citizens Attend Maryland's Tributary Teams 4th Annual Meeting To Address Health Of Bay And Tributaries   Awards presented to Marylanders for achievement and dedication to protecting waterways Baltimore County resident receives annual Bernie Fowler Award      Linthicum, MD (January 22, 2000) - More than 200 citizens, volunteers, local and state elected officials joined members of Governor Parris N. Glendening's Bay Cabinet for a day-long summit to address watershed issues and plan future goals for ensuring a healthier Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries at the 4th Annual Meeting of Maryland's 10 Tributary Teams.  Sessions were held on a variety of issues addressing topics such as: the renewal of the Chesapeake Bay Agreement; Green Infrastructure and the affect of growth on water quality; increasing minority involvement in watershed issues; and diagnosing the health of Maryland's streams.  The event was held today at the Maritime Institute in Linthicum.     ""The work and achievements of the Maryland Tributary Team members, in crafting policy recommendations, conducting research and education, and helping to restore local watersheds, is a model for those who seek to make a difference in ensuring clean water and a healthy Chesapeake Bay for our children,"" said Governor Glendening in a letter to team members.  ""As we move forward to seek public comments on the draft Chesapeake Bay Agreement, I know that the teams will take a leadership role in encouraging citizens to participate.  In doing so, you are helping us build a strong framework for all of our Bay restoration efforts in the decades ahead.""    Between morning and afternoon sessions, an awards luncheon was held to recognize the many  efforts and achievements of team members.  Governor's citations and certificates were presented by members of the Governor's cabinet, including secretaries Sarah Taylor-Rogers, Ph.D. of the Department of Natural Resources, Henry A. Virts, D.V.M. of the Department of Agriculture, and Thomas A. Fretz, Ph.D. dean of the University of Maryland College Park's College of Agriculture and Natural Resources and Donald F. Boesch, Ph.D., president of the University of Maryland Center of Environmental Science.   One of the afternoon's most prestigious awards, the ""Bernie Fowler Award,"" was presented to Charlie Conklin of Glen Arm, Md.  The award, named in honor of  former state senator, Bernie Fowler, recognizes a Tributary Team member who has demonstrated outstanding and consistent dedication to protecting and preserving bay tributaries.  Mr. Conklin was recognized for his extraordinary dedication of time, energy and creativity and efforts on behalf of the Gunpowder River watershed, the Stream ReLeaf project and his work on the draft renewal of the Chesapeake Bay Agreement.  A complete listing of Tributary Team award winners is attached.     ""On behalf of the members of the Governor's Bay Cabinet, I extend my deepest gratitude and congratulations to today's award winners and to all members of the Maryland Tributary Teams,"" said Secretary Taylor-Rogers.  ""The team members are the essential link between local citizens and our efforts to restore the health of the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries.  They are bringing the draft New Bay Agreement and its policies to the local residents, who are providing tangible feedback concerning bay restoration efforts.  Without their help, we would not be able to forge ahead with our goals and priorities for a cleaner, healthier bay.""    In addition, former Governor Harry R. Hughes presented the Chesapeake Bay Trust's annual ""Ellen Fraites-Wagner"" award for exceptional environmental protection achievement to Pat and Ed Nielsen of Centreville, Md.  The Neilsens founded the Chester River Association and have actively  supported land preservation and watershed protection efforts on the Eastern Shore.    Keynote speaker Kennedy Lawson Smith, director of the National Main Street Center, National Trust for Historic Preservation, addressed the audience about the economic arguments for environmental choices.  She shared her expertise on development choices and their environmental consequences and urban revitalization.      In 1995, Governor Glendening appointed members to 10 tributary teams, comprised of interested citizens, local government representatives, business people, farmers, educators and environmental leaders, to coordinate local efforts to help restore the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries.  The Tributary Teams are working to make a difference in neighborhoods, cities and towns across the State, a difference that will result in cleaner, healthier tributaries and the Chesapeake Bay.     Maryland's Tributary Teams meet regularly in each of the Bay's 10 major tributaries to help implement pollution prevention measures needed to address local water quality problems. These teams are laying the groundwork to ensure clean water and healthy rivers for future generations. A major focus of their efforts is controlling nutrient pollution from suburban and urban properties, farm fields and horse pastures, wastewater treatment plants, construction and road building activities.

It is the most comprehensive     review to date of the history and benefits of dam removal in the United States.     It provides information on the ecological, safety, and economic benefits that     accompany dam removals. Twenty-five case studies demonstrate dam removal success     and the 26th case study (included as an appendix) discusses mistakes to avoid     when removing a dam. The report asserts that in many cases where a dam's negative     impacts on a river and riverside community outweigh the dam's benefits, dam     removal can be a reasonable approach to restore the river and the community.     Many dam owners have already chosen removal as the preferred alternative for     hundreds of deteriorating, unsafe, or abandoned dams.     The report is based on data collected from state dam safety offices, federal     agencies, river conservation and fishing organizations, dam owners, media reports,     and academic institutions.

GX232-14-2288091	"Volume 4 Public safety is the top priority ""Public safety is our highest priority,"" according to Evan Richert, Director of the Maine State Planning Office. ""Every possible precaution will be taken to protect people and property along the Kennebec River that will be most affected by the Dam's removal."" To address all potential public safety concerns, a Safety Team was formed to develop a comprehensive Public Safety Plan. The team consists of representatives from the U.S. Coast Guard, the Department of Marine Resources, Inland Fisheries and Wildlife, the Maine Emergency Management Association, the City of Augusta, the Farmingdale Harbor Master, the Maine State Planning Office, E/PRO, and H.E. Sargent. River safety concerns both up and downstream of the dam before and after the breach have been identified and safety steps will be implemented and strictly enforced to help insure the safety of the general public. The Public Safety Plan developed by the team is separated into 2 phases. The first phase is for the initial breach and the second is for the remainder of the dam removal. The Federal Energy Regulatory Agency has approved the Plan. Public safety-breach phase 1 At exactly 9:06 am on Thursday, July 1, 1999 a portion of the west side of the Edwards Dam will be breached to allow the water being held back by the dam to begin to be lowered to its natural level. The maximum elevation of the breach flow downstream of the Father Curran Bridge will be within the normal tidal zone. The flow from the breach will reach Hallowell within the first hour. It will build to a peak elevation of 2.8 feet above normal river flow in Hallowell within 4 hours after the breach. This will all happen during low tide to minimize increases in downstream water levels. However, when the initial breach occurs, a large quantity of potentially dangerous fast rushing water will be suddenly let loose downstream and continue to flow for up to 24 hours. Downstream Maximum Water Rise  June 1999 the northern most electric transmission lines crossing the River downstream of Seven Mile Island, and downstream of the dam to the Hallowell public boat launch facility. This area will be designated a safety zone by the United States Coast Guard on the day of the breach. Violations will carry severe penalties. Seven Mile Island  Transmission Lines  Kennebec  .5 3 5 7  miles, miles, miles, miles,  3.5ft 2.8ft 1.7ft 1.1ft  Augusta Hallowell Farmingdale Gardiner  Hallowell Boat Ramp  To alert and protect the public regarding the potential hazards associated with the initial breach of the dam the following safety precautions and/or procedures will be implemented and must be observed.  On July 1, 1999 from 6:00 am to 8:00 pm all boating will be prohibited upstream of the Dam to  Phase 1 Safety Zone  The United States Coast Guard will monitor and enforce the safety zone around the dam during the breach.  The Maine Marine Patrol will secure the Hallowell boat launch,  Riv er  Transmission Lines  Edwards Dam   patrol the river downstream of the Dam and prohibit all boat traffic north of Hallowell during the day of the breach.  A boat barrier will be installed upstream of the Dam.  Public notices will be published in the local newspapers.  The Augusta Fire Department & the Emergency Management Agency will secure and set up a command post at the Augusta boat launch.  The Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife will secure the Sidney boat launch, monitor and patrol the river upstream of the Dam.  Local law enforcement agencies will provide barricades at all major access points to the river. All planned safety precautions for the breach are scheduled to be in place no later than 6:00 am on July 1, 1999 and will remain in place until the water being discharged reaches a stable flow as determined by safety officials. Public safety-dam removal phase 2 Protection of the public during the removal of the remainder of the Dam will focus on implementing precautionary measures closer to the Dam and will include the following:  From the day of the breach  until the completion of the Edwards Dam demolition, scheduled for mid-November, all boating will be prohibited upstream of the Dam to the construction boom located just north of the Dam and downstream to the construction boom at the railroad bridge. This area will be designated a safety zone by the United States Coast Guard until the Dam is completely removed.  All work areas and access routes out to the Dam will be fenced and/or barricaded with signage to warn/restrict unauthorized access.   The upstream boat barrier will remain in place  A downstream boat barrier will be installed at the railroad bridge abutments.  A boom will be installed to collect floating debris that may escape during the demolition process. These safety precautions will remain in place until the Dam has been completely removed. Safety-an individual responsibility The goal of the Safety Team is to provide the information and awareness necessary to make removal of the Edwards Dam as safe as possible during the entire process. It must be absolutely clear that breaching and removing the Edwards Dam has the potential to be very dangerous or even life threatening. Therefore, it's critical that all safety procedures have to be taken very seriously and strictly followed.

The coral reefs and seagrass beds support a high diversity of fishes, endangered sea turtles, and other organisms. Damage to marine      habitats occurs from natural processes (hurricanes, disease outbreaks) and human activities such as sediment runoff from increased clearing and development of privately held lands, damage from boats running aground and cruise ships running into the island, and nutrient input from over 1.2 million visitors a year (VINP) and increasing numbers of charter and  cruising boats.       To provide information on natural rates of change and recovery following disturbances, permanent long-term monitoring sites were established at the three parks: in VINP on 3 reefs (Lameshur-1989, Newfound-1990, and Windspirit reef-1991); on the fringing reef at BUCK (1988); and 5 reef sites at Dry Tortugas National Park (1989).

GX001-44-13913188	United States Shellfish Delegation to Japan   November, 2000   In November of 2000, Dr. James McVey, NOAA Sea Grant, organized and supported    a Shellfish Delegation to meet with Japanese scientists, managers and industry    in close coordination with the United States Japan Cooperative Program in Natural    Resources (UJNR).  Dorothy Leonard of NOAA Fisheries served as group leader.     The schedule was planned to coincide with the UJNR meeting, which was held in    Ise and Ishigaki (Okinawa Prefecture). The delegation departed the US on November    2, returning November 12 and 13.                            Delegation Members from U.S.A.   1st  row, left to right :      Mr. Frederick Kern; Dr. Daniel P Cheney;   Ms. Dorothy L. Leonard, Delegation Chair; Mr.    Bill Dewey; Dr. Ralph A. Elston   2 nd  row,  left to right :    Dr. John Supan; Ms. Lori A. Howell; Mr. Ken B. Moore; Dr. Carolyn S. Friedman     Report of the Delegation:                                  On November 3 all US Shellfish Delegation members arrive in Kansai Airport    and were met by Dr. Makoto Yamasaki to assist in our travel to Kyòto    and our subsequent tour of Kyòto’s finest temples on Saturday, November    4.   We began our tour at the Ginkaku Temple established in 1482, the best place    to observe both the Higashiyama and Zen cultures.  Within are Kan'nonden, considered    a National Treasure and the Buddhist Hall which is the oldest existing Shoin    style building in existence.   We visited Kinkaku Temple, the Golden Pavilion,    and a classical teahouse, Sekkatei at the  Rokuon temple, construction of which    began in the 1220s. We also visited the Ryoanji Temple where the rock garden,    a rectangular Zen garden, laid out at the end of the 15 th  century,    is the outstanding feature. Only 15 rocks and white gravel are used but its    simple beauty captures the imagination and inspires philosophical meditation.     The major challenge to the Americans traveling in Japan was the crowds.  Protective    of our personal space we had difficulty managing the packed buses and streetcars.     On the other hand the trains are very comfortable as your seats are assigned.     The Japanese transportation system is efficient and clean and enables travel    throughout Japan at a very reasonable cost.   On Sunday, November 5, the group left Kyòto for Hiroshima under the    guidance of our Japanese hosts, Dr. Tomoyoshi Yoshinaga and Dr. Kazufumi Takayanagi.     The visitors from the United States had requested the tour of Hiroshima as the    most important shrine that we would visit during our tour.  We toured the Hiroshima    Peace Memorial Museum and Park extensively, from which we could view the A-Bomb    Dome .  We had the opportunity to visit the Hiroshima Museum of Art and the    beautifully restored Shukkei-en,  the name means “shrink-scenery garden”.  In    the center of Shukkei-en is Takuei Pond containing more than 10 islets and encircled    by mountains, valleys, bridges, tea cottages and arbors.                                   On the evening of November 5 we were treated to a traditional Hiroshima cuisine    hosted by Dr. Kunihiko Fukusho, Director General of the National Research Institute    of Fisheries and Environment of the Inland Sea.  The US Delegation presented    Dr. Fukusho with a gimbaled clock engraved for the occasion and all of the Japanese    scientists received US/Japan oyster pins specifically designed for the delegation.                                    The morning UJNR seminar included talks by several of the scientists at FEIS    beginning with Dr. Uchida who presented an overview of the red tide occurrences    and effects of  Heterocapsa circularisquama .   H circularisquama     occurred first in the Inland Sea in 1988 and by 1995 had spread so widely that    it caused extensive mortalities (approximately 355 MT) to clams.  It is toxic    to shellfish but not to finfish.  In the case of clams and oysters mortalities    occur within 24 hours.   H. circularisquama  forms temporary cysts that    respond to temperature and salinity (ideally >30c and >25 ppt)and other    planktonic species and utilizes compounds such as nitrogen and phosphorus and    glycerin.  Dr. Nagasaki presented research on the use of viruses for red tide    elimination.  The virus, HaV (several species) isolated from seaweed will disrupt    the organelles of the dinoflagellates within 48 hours.   Dr. Akashige    gave an overview of the shellfish industry and of oyster culture at Hiroshima.    In his overview he said that over 80 percent of oyster production is from 2    areas; Miyagi and Okayama.  In the winter, oyster rafts, which were introduced    as a culture method in the mid 1950s, are moved from upper Hiroshima Bay to    offshore.  In 1970 there were more than 10,000 rafts with production at 30,000    tons.  From 1990-2000 there has been a decrease to 16,000 tons, the decline    attributed to weather, overcrowding, red tide and toxic poisoning.  In the Inland    Sea, oysters spawn from late June to September.  However, recent emphasis has    been on the production of triploids (approximately 100 million in 2000) with    a related increase in meat weight.   The shellfish delegation gave two papers; one by Bill Dewey discussing water    quality and habitat issues of the US West Coast industry and John Supan presenting    the research issues of the Gulf Coasts oyster industry. Lunch was a Japanese    style lunch box beautifully presented by our hosts.                                                                              In the afternoon Dr. Takayanagi and Dr.    Usuki took us in the research vessel, “SETO” to the area where oysters are being    cultured.   (The “on-water” trip was followed by a visit to an oyster processing    plant. The evening was highlighted by a dinner party at “Ginza Lion” at Hiroshima    Train Station where we also shopped the myriad of seafood products available.   On November 7 we left for Ise City to join the UJNR seminar in progress. On    November 8, Drs. Fred Kern, Ralph Elston and Carolyn Friedman were among the    scientists presenting papers on pathogenic organisms and disease prevention   On November 9, we were able to get out in the field to observe shellfishing    activity. We traveled by bus to Hazamura to visit the Fisheries Co-operative    Association and by boat to observe the Density Current Generating System owned    by the Cooperative and described by Dr. Kazuyuki Ouchi of Ouchi Ocean Consultant,    Inc. The density current generator simultaneously takes in less dense water    from the surface and denser water from the bottom.  It mixes the water with    an impeller, and pumps it out horizontally into the middle layer.  This intermediate-density    mixed water creates a  density current , which diffuses horizontally over    a long distance.  Density current refers to the phenomenon of a liquid of a    given density flowing into a liquid stratified with different densities will    flow into a layer of the same density.  The impeller is driven by an electric    motor powered by a solar cell with a maximum output of 12kw.  The volume of    mixed water discharged from the generator reaches a maximum of about 170,000m 3 /day    (120m 3 /minute).  At night, when the solar cell cannot produce electricity,    a land-based power source takes over, ensuring a minimum volume of 120,000m 3 /day.     The impeller is an environmentally friendly system that makes optimum use of    the renewable energies of gravity and sunlight, and incurs minimal operating    costs.  Since June 1997, a demonstration density current generator has been    in operation in Gokasho Bay in Mie Prefecture, Japan.  The generator, placed    15m deep, produces a density current in Gokasho Bay, which flows steadily across    a wide area.  Temperature stratification has weakened, and water transparency    has improved.  The red tide that normally appears at one end of the bay in summer    season did not appear, and oxygen consumption at the sea bottom was greatly    reduced.  Anecdotally, local residents report more fishes in the bay.                                                                We then visited the National Research Institute of Aquaculture (NRIA) in Nansei      where we met with Dr. Makoto Yamasaki, Chief of the Research, Planning    and Coordination Section, Dr. Takashi Kamaishi of the Pathology Division and    Drs. Takayanagi, Yokoyama, Inoue, Nakajima and Director General Dr. Yasuaki    Nakamura. The discussion covered many areas of aquaculture including pathology    and environmental issues. Nansei Station faces Gokasho Bay, which we viewed    during our lunch at the facility.  The Environmental Management Division focuses    on hydrodynamics and the matter cycle mechanism in mariculture farms, the relationships    between organisms and physico-chemical factors of their environment to provide    the information necessary to manage the water quality and benthic habitat of    the farms, and the environmental evaluation system based on the eco-physiological    responses of organisms to environmental stimuli. The Fish Pathology Division    is conducting studies to elucidate the physiology and ecology of viruses, bacteria    and parasites to establish preventative measures.  They are also conducting    basic studies on the malignant physiology and immunology of aquatic organisms    and to develop health management techniques such as vaccination.  The scientists    at NRIA are investigating the metabolism of drugs with utility to treat disease    with the objective of preventing diseases of aquatic cultured organisms.                                  On November 10 we left Ise City for the Matoya Bay Research Laboratory, guided    by Dr. Tetsuo Seki, Director of the Genetics Section of NRIA and Dr. Yamasaki.    The Matoya Bay Oyster research Laboratory, directed by Hideo Tahara, was established    in 1930 to track the effect of changes in Matoya Bay on primary productivity    and the rearing of  Crassostrea gigas     and  Pinctada fucata martensii , the pearl    oyster.  Although production of the pearl oyster has declined, the  C. gigas     continues at relatively high production levels in spite of decreasing levels    of plankton.  These decreases are explained by the cultivation of green laver    and a short term, but devastating growth in the cultivation of pearl oysters.     It was through the Matoya Laboratory that Sato Oyster Culture Company developed    a purification system for their oysters.  The company, headed by President Fumio    Sato, produces oysters of exceptional quality in an ecosystem that can be very    productive and yet affected by red tides, stratification and pollution.  These    Matoya oysters are prized for live sales and raw half shell consumption.  It    is necessary that the oysters be depurated.  The firm has been depurating oysters    since 1954.  The Matoya firm depurates oysters for 12 to 24 hours, significantly    shorter than the 44 hour depuration time required in the United States.    Also    of interest in this facility was a continuous flow oyster shucked meat washer.     In the United States companies use predominantly single batch washers, which    are relatively inefficient compared to this continuous washer.  Details regarding    the make and cost of the machine were provided following the trip. Oysters were    cultured in similar fashion to Hiroshima Bay.  Clusters of oysters were produced    on hanging longlines from natural set seed on scallop shells with spacers between.     At maturity the clusters were harvested, broken into singles and returned to    the bay in lantern nets for a period of healing and hardening prior to sale. The    Matoya firm also has a line of the most beautifully colored scallops ever seen.     They ranged from brilliant yellow to stunning orange to vibrant pinks and purples.     These scallops are selected for their colors.  They are sold by the firm in    boxes containing several oysters of each color making a beautiful presentation.     A few of us were able to sample the raw scallops there on the culture raft-    and they tasted as good as they looked.                                   On November 10 we left Ise City for the Matoya Bay Research Laboratory , guided    by Dr. Tetsuo Seki, Director of the Genetics Section of NRIA and Dr. Yamasaki.    The Matoya Bay Oyster research Laboratory, directed by Hideo Tahara, was established    in 1930 to track the effect of changes in Matoya Bay on primary productivity    and the rearing of  Crassostrea gigas  and  Pinctada fucata martensii ,    the pearl oyster. Although production of the pearl oyster has declined, the     C. gigas  continues at relatively high production levels in spite of decreasing    levels of plankton.  These decreases are explained by the cultivation of green    laver and a short term, but devastating growth in the cultivation of pearl oysters.     It was through the Matoya Laboratory that Sato Oyster Culture Company developed    a purification system for their oysters. The company, headed by President, Fumio    Sato, produces oysters of exceptional quality in an ecosystem that can be very    productive and yet affected by red tides and stratification.                                        November 11 was our last day for technical and sightseeing tours as a group    and we began with a trip to Toba Pearl Island.  The first pearl culture in the    world was developed here by Kokichi Mikimoto in 1893 and is currently cultured    in rafts in this quiet inlet.  The Ama, women divers, dive into the sea for    the cultured pearls and, although other methods are now employed, we were able    to watch Amas dive at Mikimoto Pearl Island.  From the very beginning these    Ama worked along side Kokichi Mikimoto placing mother oysters deep on the ocean    floor and bringing them back up.  It was difficult to divert us from the Pearl    Museum where the process of a pearl from creation to production is introduced    including a demonstration of each of the steps.  The pearl is composed of thousands    of layers of calcium carbonate crystals and a hard protein called “conchiolin”.     The pearl color results from light effect, pigments contained in conchiolin    and organic matter.   Following our trip to Pearl island we visited Ise Jin-gü, principally    composed of the Kōtaijingū (Naikū) and the Toyoukedaijingū    (Gekū) where the supreme deity AmaterasuŌmikami and the great deity    Tokouke Ōmikami are worshipped. The Hiyoke Bridge is the entrance to Gekū    while the Uji Bridge is the entrance into Naikū.  Since ancient times the    Japanese people have lived in accordance with nature.  All over Japan there    are consecrated rocks and evergreen trees in which kami (powerful beings) reside    as well as sanctuaries (generally called jinja) in which kami are enshrined    and which usually consists of a building surrounded by a grove of trees.  According    Shintō, the indigenous religion of Japan, kami are worshipped in matsuri,    which include solemn ceremonial occasions as well as festivals.  There are more    than 100,000 Shintō sanctuaries in Japan which are at the center of spiritual    life.  We were honored to observe some of the ceremony and a wedding party within    the sanctuary.                                                                              Our Japanese hosts were generous and thoughtful, balancing our thirst for shellfish-related    information and our desire to learn more of the culture.  Although our time    in Japan was short our knowledge was greatly enhanced and we made some friendships    that will help to achieve the goals of the UJNR: promote conservation of marine    and terrestrial resources through cooperation in applied science and technology.     We learned of the Japan Science and Technology Agency (STA) and the opportunity    to send some of our young shellfish scientists to Japan to conduct research    at the facilities we visited. Through the bonds of friendship and three decades    of scientific collaboration, the United States and Japan have made significant    progress in understanding natural processes and promoting sound management of    our precious natural resources.     Some of the delegation members have been in communication with our Japanese    hosts to gain additional information and discuss possible collaborations.  In    response to questions posed by our US industry regarding the High Hydrostatic    Pressure processing equipment being developed in Japan. The system patented    in Japan uses a process that puts the product through 40 degrees centigrade    heat process for 15 minutes and then submits the batch to pressure of 11,379    psi for five minutes.  The cycle of 150 oysters takes 5 minutes.  The cost of    the equipment is 70,000,000 yen or ~$700,000.                                   The automated shucked oyster meat washer demonstrated at Matoya Oyster company    is model JAW-1835B. It contains 300 liters of water at a flow of 800-1500 liters    per hour.  The price in Japan is 1,000,000 yen or ~ $10,000.  Bill Dewey also    communicated with Dr. Kazufumi Takayanagi (Kazu) regarding Japan's petition    to WHO to change the Vibrio parahaemolyticus action level to 100 MPN (total    vibrio) to see if he was aware of any science the country had to support this    petition.   We expect to continue and expand those activities by increased collaboration    with our shellfish colleagues in Japan in the following areas of research: Pacific    oyster summer mortality and triploidy, augmentive bio (virus) control of harmful    algal blooms, carrying capacity for shellfish culture and  vibrio parahaemolyticus .

GX001-49-1097872	"Forest Preserve District of Cook County (Illinois)       Nature Bulletin No. 614-A   October 23, 1976 Forest Preserve District of Cook County George W. Dunne, President Roland F. Eisenbeis, Supt. of Conservation  ****:PEARLS  About ten years ago, a large valuable pearl was found in a mussel taken  from the Wabash River. In years past, news of such finds often started  outbreaks of ""pearl fever. "" Then, people flocked to rivers and creeks  where they waded, dived, raked and dredged for mussels. 'These were  broken open, searched for that dreamed of pearl and tossed aside. Some  were successful. For instance, in the years 1889 to 1897 a quarter of a  million dollars worth of pearls were sold from the Mackinaw River, a  small stream in central Illinois. In recent decades, however, these slow- growing mollusks have become scarce due to exploitation and  increasing pollution. Now, the discovery of a freshwater pearl is a rare  event.  Clams, oysters, mussels and many other mollusks with limy shells are  known to produce pearls. but very few kinds yield gem pearls of  jeweler's quality. The pearl is an abnormal growth of mother-of-pearl,  or nacre, imbedded in the soft bodies of these shellfish. It is built up,  layer upon layer, in the same way as nacre is added to the lining of the  growing shell and always has the same color and luster. For example,  over the country, hundreds of good-sized pearls are found each year in  the oysters we eat. Unfortunately these have no commercial value  regardless of whether they have been cooked or not because they are  dull opaque white or purple like the shell of the parent oyster. In recent  times almost all pearls of gem quality come from the oriental pearl  oyster which has a bright shimmering translucent nacre.  A pearl starts growing when some irritating foreign substance such as a  sand grain, bit of mud, parasite or other object becomes lodged in the  shell-producing gland called the mantle. Pearls formed in the soft flesh  where nacre can be added on all sides are most likely to be spherical  and the most highly prized. By far the great majority are flattened or  variously distorted and have little value. Size, color, luster and freedom  from flaws are other essential qualities. Unlike other gems, such as  diamonds, pearls have an average life of only about 50 years. In time  the small amount of water in a pearl's make-up is lost and its surface  cracks. Because they are mostly lime, necklaces which are worn often  are injured by the acid secretions of the human skin.  Centuries ago the Chinese learned that beads or tiny figures of Buddha  slipped between the soft mantle and the shell of a living clam became  coated with a blister of mother-of-pearl and could be sold as a curio or  religious object. With this as a hint a Japanese pearl hunter named  Mikimoto began to cut mother-of-pearl beads and insert them between  the mantle and shell of pearl oysters and return them to an ocean bay  near his home. Many of these grew in size and took on the sheen and  beauty of true pearls but, because they were in contact with the mantle  on only one side, they became half-pearls with little value as jewelry.  After years of experimenting, Mikimoto finally learned how to grow  spherical gem pearls and founded the great cultured pearl industry of  Japan. Briefly, this is the method. A mother-of-pearl bead is wrapped in  a piece of the living mantle of one pearl oyster and is skillfully  transplanted into the flesh of another. Women divers care for the  oysters by the tens of thousands in special floating cages. After three or  more years, a small percentage of them yield pearls no less beautiful  than the best ""wild"" pearls.

The Trust is a nonprofit                  organization created by the Maryland General Assembly in 1985                  to promote public awareness and participation in the restoration                  and protection of the Chesapeake Bay.                   Nearly 2,000 community organizations, volunteer groups and schools                  throughout Maryland have shared in grants for stream cleanups,                  tree and marsh grass plantings, erosion control projects, water                  quality monitoring, habitat restoration, aquaculture projects,                  recycling activities and the development of awareness programs                  and educational materials to instill in people of all ages a better                  understanding of the Bay.                    In                  addition to gifts from private citizens and the business community,                  the Trust is supported by voluntary donations via the tax checkoff                  on the Maryland income tax return and by sales of the commemorative                  Chesapeake Bay license plate. The tax checkoff was created in                  1989 to aid Bay cleanup activities and protect endangered species.

The agreement contains more than 100 individual commitments ranging from restoring the blue crab fishery, to preserving 20 percent of the watershed's resource lands, to removing the Bay from the EPA's list of impaired waters.   The 2000 Bay Agreement, the game plan for the world's largest, most ambitious environmental restoration, is one praised by the Chesapeake Bay Foundation for its scope and vision.  The Foundation pointed out one of the strengths of the agreement - that it was developed not based on what was affordable in June of 2000, but what the Bay needed to be restored to health.   In 2001, the Maryland Department of Natural Resources undertook a fiscal analysis of fully implementing the agreement in Maryland for Fiscal Years (FY) 2003-2010.  The analysis was done to calculate the cost of achieving the 100+ commitments found in the Agreement and identify the largest areas of funding need.  Projected cost and income estimates were collected from State agency staff responsible for the programs charged with carrying out the Bay agreement.   Restoring the Chesapeake Bay, a significant and ambitious undertaking, is expensive.  The cost of success: the money that has been spent over the past twenty years and the funding needed in the next ten or twenty years is measured in the billions.  At any time, but especially now in a period of fiscal challenges and budget deficits, these are daunting numbers.  But the cost of ignoring the Bay's problems, of shortchanging Maryland's greatest and most valuable natural resource, is even greater.  The Bay is the engine that helps drive the State's economy.  Additionally, tens of thousands of Maryland sports enthusiasts, hunters, anglers, and recreational boaters depend on a clean, healthy, productive Bay for their enjoyment.   In 2002, the Chesapeake Bay Commission (CBC) undertook a similar cost assessment on a broader scale, collecting cost and income data from Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Virginia.  The Maryland data included in the CBC report is mostly based on the information collected in 2001 with some changes to reflect more recent information and the Commission's cost assumptions that were designed to provide consistency in cost estimates among the three states.  The January 2003 CBC report ""The Cost of a Clean Bay - Assessing Funding Needs Throughout the Watershed"" can be found on its web site at  http://www.chesby.state.va.us/ .  This document provides a detailed and comprehensive description of how the funding analysis was prepared and the results.   The report following this Executive Summary is Maryland's supporting cost and income estimates and underlying cost assumptions that are part of the Bay-wide cost analysis published by the Chesapeake Bay Commission.  The data are organized by the five major categories and 22 subcategories in the Bay Agreement.  The information was compiled at the commitment level then aggregated into one of the 22 subcategories. The five major categories are:      Living Resource Protection and Restoration   Vital Habitat Protection and Restoration   Water Quality Protection and Restoration   Sound Land Use   Stewardship and Community Engagement     The 22 subcategories of the Bay agreement fall within these major categories.  For example, the first major category, Living Resource Protection and Restoration, is comprised of five subcategories including Oysters, Exotic Species, Fish Passage, Multi-Species Management and Crabs. Maryland's cost estimates and underlying cost assumptions are shown to the most specific level of detail available; some costs and assumptions are for individual programs, some for individual commitments and others are for groups of commitments.  All estimated costs and income projections are then aggregated at the subcategory level.   Below is a summary of the funding estimates found in the Commission's report.    Bay-wide Cost of A Clean Bay         Total Projected Cost   $18.7 billion       Total Projected Income   $  5.9 billion       Unfunded Gap   $12.8 billion         Maryland Cost of A Clean Bay         Total Projected Cost   $ 6.4 billion       Total Projected Income   $ 3.5 billion       Unfunded Gap   $ 2.9 billion        The cost assessment is a tool that can be used by state policy makers and others charged with restoring the Bay.  It provides a basis for evaluating cost and spending projections, identifying funding shortfalls and developing a strategic plan to meet the funding challenges that lie ahead.

The enabling legislation of Virgin Islands National Park (VINP), Buck Island Reef National Monument (BUCK), and Dry Tortugas National Park (DTNP) all recognize the significance of the marine resources. The coral reefs and seagrass beds support a high diversity of fishes,endangered sea turtles, and other organisms. Damage to marine habitats occurs from natural processes (hurricanes, disease outbreaks) and human activities such as sediment runoff from increased clearing and development of privately held lands, damage from boats running aground and cruise ships running into the island, and nutrient input from over 1.2 million visitors a year (VINP) and increasing numbers of charter and cruising boats.        Because VINP, BUCK and DTNP contain a large part of the protected coral reefs in the United States and participate in a coordinated research program, they were chosen in 1996 to be an NPS/NBS Inventory and Monitoring (I&M) prototype park cluster. The seven years of coral reef research at VINP, BUCK and DTNP will form the basis for developing and fine-tuning protocols for coral reef work worldwide.

GX242-61-6606108	Tributary Team Seeks Volunteers To Assess, Survey Herring Bay Watershed      Annapolis, MD (September 22, 1999) -- Southern Anne Arundel County's Herring Bay watershed will be under assault on October 16 as citizen surveyors fan out over the area seeking  potential pollution problems. The Herring Bay watershed survey is being organized by the Lower Western Shore Tributary Team, Maryland Save Our Streams and residents of that area  in an effort to raise public awareness of human impacts on water quality.   The Herring Bay watershed is approximately 25 square miles and runs from Deale in the north, to Rose Haven in the south. A watershed is the land area that drains into a particular body of water, whether it be a stream, creek, river, bay or ocean. Herring Bay's water quality  is a direct result of what happens on the land, along the shoreline, creeks, streams and marshlands.   Volunteers are needed to conduct the survey. Interested persons are requested to meet at Deale Elementary School (located at 759 Mason's Beach Road)  at 9:30 a.m. Saturday, October 16 for a training session. Surveyors will be given the information and equipment necessary to identify sources of concern to the health of the watershed and any factors that might degrade local waters.   After a light lunch, teams will be sent out to cover a specific area. They will travel by car, foot, air and boat to locate and/or identify bank erosion, trashy areas, various odors, sunken boats, and sewage pipe outfalls within the watershed. Farms and places where vegetation could or need to be planted will also be identified. That initial assessment of the watershed's 65 miles of stream banks, marshes and shorelines should be completed in less than three hours.     Once potential and real pollution sources are identified, Maryland Save Our Streams will guide community groups and local residents in activities to correct the problems. Stream and shoreline cleanups may be done by each area by homeowners. Other problems may require help from the county, the state or even the federal government.   The surveyor training will be conducted that morning regardless of the weather. Volunteers will be assigned to teams and given information to complete the survey at a later date, if it is not possible to do so on the 16th.  Surveyors should wear casual attire, long trousers and sturdy shoes.   The Lower Western Shore Tributary Team is one of 10 teams across Maryland working to restore and protect their neighborhood streams, rivers and the Chesapeake Bay. The teams have been working for three years on community education, policy recommendations, and innovative demonstration projects to clean up local rivers and the Bay.    Teams were created for each of Maryland's 10 major Bay watersheds, and are made up of citizens, farmers, environmentalists, state and local government representatives.  The Lower Western Shore Tributary Team  reviews water quality issues within Anne Arundel and a portion of Calvert counties. Their work is focused on reducing nutrient pollution, considered to be one of the largest threats to good water quality in the state.    Nutrient pollution, primarily excess nitrogen and phosphorus, come from both point and non-point sources, and the teams focus on both. The teams were appointed by Governor Parris N. Glendening in 1996.     For more information and to pre-register, contact Terri Lehr at Maryland Save Our Streams at     (800) 448-5826.    Posted September 22, 1999

Bernie Fowler's annual wade into the Patuxent River in Calvert County which has brought continued attention to the plight and clean-up of that river and the Chesapeake Bay.       The Lower Potomac Tributary Team is one of 10 teams across Maryland working to restore and protect their neighborhood streams, rivers and the Chesapeake Bay. The Lower Potomac Tributary Team  reviews water quality issues within Charles, St. Mary's and Prince George's counties that drain into the Chesapeake Bay. Their work is focused on reducing nutrient pollution, considered to be one of the largest threats to good water quality in the state. Nutrient pollution, primarily excess nitrogen and phosphorus, come from both point and non-point sources, and the teams focus on both.      The teams were appointed by Governor Parris N. Glendening in 1996 and are comprised of local citizens, farmers, business leaders and government officials.       PEPCO's Morgantown Power Plant is located along U.S. Route 301south of La Plata. Participants should take the last exit before the Governor Harry Nice Bridge into Virginia. Signs will be posted.
