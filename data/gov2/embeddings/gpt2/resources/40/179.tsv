Service Animals       Background    v Over 12,000 people with disabilities use the aid of service   animals. Although the  most familiar types of service animals are  guide dogs used by people who are blind,  service animals assist  persons who have other disabilities as well. Many disabling  conditions are invisible. Therefore, a  person who is accompanied  by a service animal may or may not “look” disabled. A service  animal is  NOT   required to have any special certification.    What is a Service  Animal?               v A service animal is  NOT  a  pet! According to the Americans with  Disabilities Act (ADA), a service animal  is any animal that has  been individually trained to provide assistance or perform  tasks for  the  benefit of a person with a physical or mental disability which  substantially limits one or more major  life functions.
