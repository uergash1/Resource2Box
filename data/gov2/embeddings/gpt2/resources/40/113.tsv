The flag of the United States should be one of the first things seen at our Customs ports of entry, both by American citizens returning from abroad and by travelers from other countries.   As the symbol of our country and our freedoms, the national colors of the United States provide a welcome greeting of warm promise.   Many people, however, enter our country at night when the flag is not flown, because of the nearly universal custom of displaying it only from sunrise to sunset.   Authority exists to amend that custom. A Congressional joint resolution of June 22, 1942 (56 Stat. 377), as amended (36 U.S.C. 173-178), permits the flag to be displayed at night ""upon special occasions when it is desired to produce a patriotic effect.""   I believe it is appropriate that returning citizens and visitors from other countries be welcomed by our flag whether they arrive at their ports of entry by night or by day.   NOW, THEREFORE, I, RICHARD NIXON, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim that the flag of the United States of America shall hereafter be displayed at all times during the day and night, except when the weather is inclement, at United States Customs ports of entry which are continually open.   The rules and customs pertaining to the display of the flag, as set forth in the joint resolution of June 22, 1942, as amended, are hereby modified accordingly."

The Washington Monument stands day and night as America's tribute to our first President. The fifty American flags that encircle the base of the Monument represent our fifty States and, at the same time, symbolize our enduring Federal Union.   As this Nation's 200th year approaches, I believe that it would do all Americans well to remember the years of our first President and to recall the enduring ideals of our Nation.   As an expression of our rededication to the ideals of America and in accordance with the joint resolution of Congress of June 22, 1942 (56 Stat. 377), as amended by the joint resolution of December 22, 1942, (56 Stat. 1074), which permits the flag to be displayed at night ""upon special occasions when it is desired to produce a patriotic effect,"" it is appropriate that our national colors henceforth be displayed day and night at the Washington Monument.   NOW, THEREFORE, I, RICHARD NIXON, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim that, effective July 4, 1971, the fifty flags of the United States of America displayed at the Washington Monument in the District of Columbia be flown at all times during the day and night, except when the weather is inclement.

WHEREAS the joint resolution of Congress of June 22, 1942, entitled ""Joint Resolution to Codify and Emphasize Existing Rules and Customs Pertaining to the Display and Use of the Flag of the United States of America,"" as amended by the joint resolution of December 22, 1942, 56 Stat. 1074, contains the following provisions:   Sec. 2.  (a) It is the universal custom to display the flag only from sunrise to sunset on buildings and on stationary flagstaffs in the open. However, the flag may be displayed at night upon special occasions when it is desired to produce a patriotic effect.  * * * * * * *   Sec. 8.  Any rule or custom pertaining to the display of the flag of the United States of America, set forth herein, may be altered, modified, or repealed, or additional rules with respect thereto may be prescribed, by the Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States, whenever he deems it to be appropriate or desirable; and any such alteration or additional rule shall be set forth in a proclamation.   and   WHEREAS Francis Scott Key, after having anxiously watched from afar the bombardment of Fort McHenry throughout the night of September 13, 1814, saw his country's flag still flying in the early morning of the following day; and   WHEREAS this stirring evidence of the failure of the prolonged attack inspired him to write the Star-Spangled Banner, our national anthem:   NOW, THEREFORE, I, HARRY S. TRUMAN, President of the United States of America and Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy, do hereby proclaim that, as a perpetual symbol of our patriotism, the flag of the United States shall hereafter be displayed at Fort McHenry National Monument and Historic Shrine at all times during the day and night, except when the weather is inclement.   The rules and customs pertaining to the display of the flag as set forth in the said joint resolution are modified accordingly.   IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.

The Washington Monument stands day and night as America's tribute to our first President. The fifty American flags that encircle the base of the Monument represent our fifty States and, at the same time, symbolize our enduring Federal Union.   As this Nation's 200th year approaches, I believe that it would do all Americans well to remember the years of our first President and to recall the enduring ideals of our Nation.   As an expression of our rededication to the ideals of America and in accordance with the joint resolution of Congress of June 22, 1942 (56 Stat. 377), as amended by the joint resolution of December 22, 1942, (56 Stat. 1074), which permits the flag to be displayed at night ""upon special occasions when it is desired to produce a patriotic effect,"" it is appropriate that our national colors henceforth be displayed day and night at the Washington Monument.   NOW, THEREFORE, I, RICHARD NIXON, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim that, effective July 4, 1971, the fifty flags of the United States of America displayed at the Washington Monument in the District of Columbia be flown at all times during the day and night, except when the weather is inclement.

The flag of the United States should be one of the first things seen at our Customs ports of entry, both by American citizens returning from abroad and by travelers from other countries.   As the symbol of our country and our freedoms, the national colors of the United States provide a welcome greeting of warm promise.   Many people, however, enter our country at night when the flag is not flown, because of the nearly universal custom of displaying it only from sunrise to sunset.   Authority exists to amend that custom. A Congressional joint resolution of June 22, 1942 (56 Stat. 377), as amended (36 U.S.C. 173-178), permits the flag to be displayed at night ""upon special occasions when it is desired to produce a patriotic effect.""   I believe it is appropriate that returning citizens and visitors from other countries be welcomed by our flag whether they arrive at their ports of entry by night or by day.   NOW, THEREFORE, I, RICHARD NIXON, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim that the flag of the United States of America shall hereafter be displayed at all times during the day and night, except when the weather is inclement, at United States Customs ports of entry which are continually open.   The rules and customs pertaining to the display of the flag, as set forth in the joint resolution of June 22, 1942, as amended, are hereby modified accordingly."

By virtue of the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and laws of the United States of America, and in order to establish policies and procedures' governing the assertion of Executive privilege by incumbent and former Presidents in connection with the release of Presidential records by the National Archives and Records Administration pursuant to the Presidential Records Act of 1978, it is hereby ordered as follows:  Section 1.   Definitions.  For purposes of this Order:  (a) ""Archivist"" refers to the Archivist of the United States or his designee.  (b) ""NARA"" refers to the National Archives and Records Administration.  (c) ""Presidential Records Act"" refers to the Presidential Records Act of 1978 (Pub. L. No. 95-591, 92 Stat. 2523-27, as amended by Pub. L. No. 98-497, 98 Stat. 2287), codified at 44 U.S.C. 2201-2207.  (d) ""NARA regulations"" refers to the NARA regulations implementing the Presidential Records Act. 53 Fed. Reg. 50404 (1988), codified at 36 C.F.R. Part 1270.  (e) ""Presidential records"" refers to those documentary materials maintained by NARA pursuant to the Presidential Records Act and the NARA regulations.  (f) ""Former President"" refers to the former President during whose term or terms of office particular Presidential records were created.  (g) A ""substantial question of Executive privilege"" exists if NARA's disclosure of Presidential records might impair the national security (including the conduct of foreign relations), law enforcement, or the deliberative processes of the Executive branch.  (h) A ""final court order"" is a court order from which no appeal may be taken.  Sec. 2.    Notice of Intent to Disclose Presidential Records.   (a) When the Archivist provides notice to the incumbent and former Presidents of his intent to disclose Presidential records pursuant to section 1270.46 of the NARA regulations, the Archivist, utilizing any guidelines provided by the incumbent and former Presidents, shall identify any specific materials, the disclosure of which he believes may raise a substantial question of Executive privilege. However, nothing in this Order is intended to affect the right of the incumbent or former Presidents to invoke Executive privilege with respect to materials not identified by the Archivist. Copies of the notice for the incumbent President shall be delivered to the President (through the Counsel to the President) and the Attorney General (through the Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal Counsel). The copy of the notice for the former President shall be delivered to the former President or his designated representative.  (b) Upon the passage of 30 days after receipt by the incumbent and former Presidents of a notice of intent to disclose Presidential records, the Archivist may disclose the records covered by the notice, unless during that time period the Archivist has received a claim of Executive privilege by the incumbent or former President or the Archivist has been instructed by the incumbent President or his designee to extend the time period. If a shorter time period is required under the circumstances set forth in section 1270.44 of the NARA regulations, the Archivist shall so indicate in the notice.  Sec. 3.    Claim of Executive Privilege by Incumbent President.   (a) Upon receipt of a notice of intent to disclose Presidential records, the Attorney General (directly or through the Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal Counsel) and the Counsel to the President shall review as they deem appropriate the records covered by the notice and consult with each other, the Archivist, and such other Federal agencies as they deem appropriate concerning whether invocation of Executive privilege is justified.  (b) The Attorney General and the Counsel to the President, in the exercise of their discretion and after appropriate review and consultation under subsection (a) of this section, may jointly determine that invocation of Executive privilege is not justified. The Archivist shall be promptly notified of any such determination.  (c) If after appropriate review and consultation under subsection (a) of this section, either the Attorney General or the Counsel to the President believes that the circumstances justify invocation of Executive privilege, the issue shall be presented to the President by the Counsel to the President and the Attorney General.  (d) If the President decides to invoke Executive privilege, the Counsel to the President shall notify the former President, the Archivist, and the Attorney General in writing of the claim of privilege and the specific Presidential records to which it relates. After receiving such notice, the Archivist shall not disclose the privileged records unless directed to do so by an incumbent President or by a final court order.  Sec. 4.    Claim of Executive Privilege by Former President.   (a) Upon receipt of a claim of Executive privilege by a former President, the Archivist shall consult with the Attorney General (through the Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal Counsel), the Counsel to the President, and such other Federal agencies as he deems appropriate concerning the Archivist's determination as to whether to honor the former President's claim of privilege or instead to disclose the Presidential records notwithstanding the claim of privilege. Any determination under section 3 of this Order that Executive privilege shall not be invoked by the incumbent President shall not prejudice the Archivist's determination with respect to the former President's claim of privilege.  (b) In making the determination referred to in subsection (a) of this section, the Archivist shall abide by any instructions given him by the incumbent President or his designee unless otherwise directed by a final court order. The Archivist shall notify the incumbent and former Presidents of his determination at least 30 days prior to disclosure of the Presidential records, unless a shorter time period is required in the circumstances set forth in section 1270.44 of the NARA regulations. Copies of the notice for the incumbent President shall be delivered to the President (through the Counsel the President) and the Attorney General (through the Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal Counsel). The copy of the notice for the former President shall be delivered to the former President or his designated representative.  Sec. 5. Judicial Review.  This Order is intended only to improve the internal management of the Executive branch and is not intended to create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law by a party against the United States, its agencies, its officers, or any person."

WHEREAS the joint resolution of Congress of June 22, 1942, entitled ""Joint Resolution to Codify and Emphasize Existing Rules and Customs Pertaining to the Display and Use of the Flag of the United States of America,"" as amended by the joint resolution of December 22, 1942, 56 Stat. 1074, contains the following provisions:   Sec. 2.  (a) It is the universal custom to display the flag only from sunrise to sunset on buildings and on stationary flagstaffs in the open. However, the flag may be displayed at night upon special occasions when it is desired to produce a patriotic effect.  * * * * * * *   Sec. 8.  Any rule or custom pertaining to the display of the flag of the United States of America, set forth herein, may be altered, modified, or repealed, or additional rules with respect thereto may be prescribed, by the Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States, whenever he deems it to be appropriate or desirable; and any such alteration or additional rule shall be set forth in a proclamation.   and   WHEREAS Francis Scott Key, after having anxiously watched from afar the bombardment of Fort McHenry throughout the night of September 13, 1814, saw his country's flag still flying in the early morning of the following day; and   WHEREAS this stirring evidence of the failure of the prolonged attack inspired him to write the Star-Spangled Banner, our national anthem:   NOW, THEREFORE, I, HARRY S. TRUMAN, President of the United States of America and Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy, do hereby proclaim that, as a perpetual symbol of our patriotism, the flag of the United States shall hereafter be displayed at Fort McHenry National Monument and Historic Shrine at all times during the day and night, except when the weather is inclement.   The rules and customs pertaining to the display of the flag as set forth in the said joint resolution are modified accordingly.   IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.   DONE at the City of Washington this 2nd day of July in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and forty-eight, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-second."

E­mail records governed by the Federal Records Act (""FRA"") that are subject to this MOU shall be transferred to NARA, following completion of the projects described below, in accordance with the existing records schedule, covering EOP/OA OASIS ALL­IN­1 and other VAX Cluster Applications, job number N1­429­95­2.   II.   The Projects   Copies of all Clinton presidential and federal and Gore vice presidential e­mail records that are associated with the ARMS and TRP databases and the multi­host anomaly will be transferred from the New Executive Office Building to a facility located in reasonable proximity to the Archives II complex at 11710 Beltsville Road, Calverton, MD (""the Facility"") by OA on or before January 20, 2001. OA shall provide the Facility and hire staff to maintain physical and environmental security at the Facility.   OA shall complete the two restoration projects and the related reformatting project described below and shall be responsible for ensuring that sufficient funding exists or is obtained to complete each project, except to the extent that NARA is funding Project C, as described below.  OA will transfer copies of all tapes, software, equipment and necessary personnel associated with these projects to the Facility.  OA shall administer all of the contracts governing each project until its completion.  OA shall provide NARA with reports as requested by NARA on each project.  NARA shall at all times have access to the presidential and vice presidential records maintained at the Facility.      Project A ­ the Tape Restoration Project (""TRP"")   The TRP involves the restoration of certain e­mail records from back­up tapes and the extraction of that data into a searchable database. Funding for the project totals $13.2 million, including $8.4 million in supplemental funding, and is available through September 2002.  The project is and will continue to be performed by contractors retained by OA. The TRP is being undertaken on equipment that is separate and apart from the computer systems dedicated by OA for use in supporting the incumbent President.   The software and the hardware development for the TRP effort is complete and these systems are fully operational.  4319 tapes in the possession of the EOP have been copied, which is all of the relevant tapes with two minor exceptions.  136 tapes could not be adequately copied on the equipment OA possesses.  OA is negotiating with outside vendors to copy these tapes.  In addition, law enforcement organizations have 53 tapes in their possession.  To date, the EOP has not been able to obtain an agreement with the law enforcement organizations for the return of these 53 original tapes or the provision of tape copies prior to January 20, 2001.  If and when copies are obtained of the 136 and 53 tapes, respectively, they will be processed in accordance with the Projects.  Prior to January 20, 2001, OA will provide NARA an inventory of these two groups of tapes.  If legible copies of these tapes are not received by the end of the Projects, OA will be deemed to have completed the Projects regardless.  If legible copies of these two groups of tapes or the original 53 tapes are received after the end of the Projects, then either OA, through its contractors, at OA's expense, will copy and process those tapes, or OA will make available to NARA the equipment, software, and documentation to copy and process the tapes, at NARA's expense, consistent with all applicable law.  OA will place the TRP records into ARMS, segregated into appropriate agency buckets.  The interim TRP database will be searchable and de­duplicated against itself.  After the data extraction is complete, these records will be reformatted and placed on tapes for NARA, as covered in Project C.       Project B ­ the ""Multi­Host"" Project   The multi­host project involves the restoration of certain e­mail data for the period April 1 through May 31, 2000 from back­up tapes.  This e­mail data, plus other e­mail data currently stored on the ARMS3 server for the period June 1 through September 30, 2000, will be streamed through a reconfigured Lotus Notes/ARMS interface.  This effort will remediate a problem that affected email from approximately April to September 30, 2000, during which time approximately 1% of e­mail entering ARMS was defective due to an anomaly in the Lotus Notes/ARMS interface, and will result in a complete data set containing only correct emails for that period of time.  Streaming the data through a reconfigured interface will separate presidential and federal records into the appropriate buckets utilized by ARMS for records management purposes.  The reconfigured Lotus Notes/ARMS interface was placed into operation on October 1, 2000, and has processed e­mail records after that date without any detected incident.   All software and hardware associated with the Lotus Notes/ARMS interface as well as all equipment necessary to perform the multi­host repair will be moved to the Facility by OA.      Project C ­ Tape Reformatting Project   The ARMS system currently archives e­mail records generated or received by ARMS­managed accounts during the Clinton­Gore Administration beginning July 1994 through the end of the Administration, subject to various anomalies.  These records are stored in agency buckets that serve to separate presidential or vice presidential records from federal records. ¹   OA will move the data in ARMS, along with the hardware and software associated with supporting and searching ARMS, to the Facility.  The equipment will include the ARMS software, as well as nodes of the existing VAX computer that provide the ARMS platform.    This project involves the reformatting of e­mails in the ARMS system, including those records that had been subject to the multi­host anomaly, and those records restored as a part of the TRP, in accordance with the Memorandum of Understanding Between the National Archives and Records Administration and the Executive Office of the President, Office of Administration ARMS­NARA Tape Reformatting Project for Clinton Administration, Post July 14, 1994, signed on October 6 & 8, 1999. (""1999 Tape Reformatting MOU""), attachment A.     OA will send to NARA tapes of reformatted e­mail drawn from the ARMS database and the TRP database on a rolling basis as reformatting is completed, as specified by the 1999 Tape Reformatting MOU.  NARA will enter these tapes into a database of Clinton­Gore Administration records. The records from the TRP database will be de­duplicated against all other TRP records, although they will not be de­duplicated against the ARMS records.  Therefore, prior to the creation of the record database or the streaming of the TRP database into ARMS, requests for Clinton Administration e­mail records from the ""Mail 2"" and ""Letter D"" timeframes, as well as requests for OVP e­mail records prior to May 2000, will require searches of both the TRP database and the ARMS database.   At the time the tape reformatting project is completed and validated by NARA using NARA's established electronic records preservation procedures, OA will remove all remaining personnel and equipment and shut down the Facility.    III.   Records Subject to the MOU   There are three distinct records categories of ARMS­related e­mail records subject to portions of this MOU, all created by the Clinton­Gore Administration EOP after July 14, 1994: (1) records of President Clinton and the EOP offices that create presidential records, which are governed by the PRA; (2) records of Vice President Gore and his staff, which are also governed by the PRA; and (3) records of EOP offices that create federal records, which are governed by the Federal Records Act (""FRA""), 44 U.S.C. chapters 21, 29, 31 and 33.      A.  Legal Custody of PRA Records   On January 20, 2001, legal custody of all presidential and vice presidential record e­mail messages shall transfer to the Archivist of the United States. OA will transfer copies of all tapes, plus software, equipment and necessary personnel associated with these Projects to the Facility on or before that date.  The originals of all other electronic media not associated with the above Projects shall be transferred to other NARA facilities.  Any access to PRA records by OA staff, OA contractors, or any other party shall be controlled exclusively by NARA and shall be governed by the PRA, NARA regulations, and Executive Order 12667.   These records shall remain Clinton presidential and Gore vice presidential records after noon, January 20, 2001, notwithstanding their physical location or the limited access to them as described above.   In order to restrict access to Clinton presidential and Gore vice presidential record e­mail effectively, NARA agrees that only pre­authorized OA and OA contractor personnel may enter the OA­leased premises at the Facility.  All personnel entering the Facility shall sign a log book upon entry and exit. The log book shall be sent to NARA weekly and maintained by NARA.  In addition, the ARMS and the TRP databases will be password protected so that only password holders can read the message text in these databases.   NARA shall be responsible for responding to requests for documents or information and conducting searches of the Clinton presidential and Gore vice presidential e­mail records in response to requests and subpoenas pursuant to the PRA that are made by investigative bodies or other requesting parties.  NARA shall be responsible for developing search terms and search strings to be used in conducting a search of these records.  NARA and EOP personnel have met to begin to learn how to formulate search strategies and regarding the status of searches pending at the time of transition and any searches reasonably expected to be made into those records, so as to assist NARA in staff planning.  Members of the Counsel's Office will furnish NARA with the most up­to­date documentation they possess of subpoenas served on the EOP during this Administration and for which e­mail searches must still be performed, and any correspondence or other documents relevant to those searches.   NARA personnel will formulate search terms for searches on the TRP database and enter the search terms directly into the computer accessing those records.  NARA personnel will formulate the search terms and search strings of the ARMS database and will be responsible for entering the search terms directly into the computer accessing those records.  OA will provide at NARA's option reasonable and necessary training on the ARMS database and associated VAX Computer system on a reimbursable basis.  Based on NARA's current knowledge of the VAX computer system upon which ARMS database is run, NARA is presently not able to conduct searches on the ARMS database.  However, NARA will pursue ways as expeditiously as possible to acquire the ability to conduct such searches, but NARA does not know how long this will take.  The search results will be copied to a CD (or more if necessary) and given directly to NARA personnel.  Access to search results are controlled by NARA and governed by the PRA, NARA regulations, and E.O. 12667.       B.  Legal Custody of Federal Records   In contrast to the presidential records discussed above, all federal records associated with the Projects shall remain under the legal custody and control of OA.  Access to such federal records, including e­mails and backup tapes associated with the Projects, shall be controlled by OA and shall be governed by the FRA, NARA regulations and governing records schedules.   OA shall be responsible for responding to and conducting searches of all federal record e­mails, including requests under the Freedom of Information Act, congressional requests, subpoenas and other authorized requests until the restoration and reformatting of those records has been completed under Section II, above, and such records are formally accessioned into NARA by means of a fully effectuated SF 258, in accordance with 36 C.F.R. section 1228, subpart L.      C.  Transfer of Original Electronic Media Associated With the Above Projects   As soon as possible, and no later than January 20, 2001, OA shall transfer to NARA a complete set of the original electronic media in its possession that back up information used in completing the above­listed Projects, including the 136 tapes that have not yet been copied, and with the exception of the 53 tapes retained by law enforcement agencies.  OA shall produce disaster recovery back­up tapes of the ARMS and TRP databases as they exist at that time. These back­up tapes shall be sent directly to NARA, along with sufficient documentation for OA to accomplish a full and complete restoration.  An inventory of all such transferred backup tapes and e­mail files shall be provided to NARA along with the electronic materials.  These backup tapes and copies are being transferred to NARA solely for security storage pending completion of the Projects.  When the presidential, vice presidential and federal record e­mail databases are completed and reformatted, NARA will consider these backup tapes and copies for disposal in accordance with the PRA and the FRA.                                  (signed)_ Lewis J.

The flag of the United States should be one of the first things seen at our Customs ports of entry, both by American citizens returning from abroad and by travelers from other countries.   As the symbol of our country and our freedoms, the national colors of the United States provide a welcome greeting of warm promise.   Many people, however, enter our country at night when the flag is not flown, because of the nearly universal custom of displaying it only from sunrise to sunset.   Authority exists to amend that custom. A Congressional joint resolution of June 22, 1942 (56 Stat. 377), as amended (36 U.S.C. 173-178), permits the flag to be displayed at night ""upon special occasions when it is desired to produce a patriotic effect.""   I believe it is appropriate that returning citizens and visitors from other countries be welcomed by our flag whether they arrive at their ports of entry by night or by day.   NOW, THEREFORE, I, RICHARD NIXON, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim that the flag of the United States of America shall hereafter be displayed at all times during the day and night, except when the weather is inclement, at United States Customs ports of entry which are continually open.   The rules and customs pertaining to the display of the flag, as set forth in the joint resolution of June 22, 1942, as amended, are hereby modified accordingly."

The Washington Monument stands day and night as America's tribute to our first President. The fifty American flags that encircle the base of the Monument represent our fifty States and, at the same time, symbolize our enduring Federal Union.   As this Nation's 200th year approaches, I believe that it would do all Americans well to remember the years of our first President and to recall the enduring ideals of our Nation.   As an expression of our rededication to the ideals of America and in accordance with the joint resolution of Congress of June 22, 1942 (56 Stat. 377), as amended by the joint resolution of December 22, 1942, (56 Stat. 1074), which permits the flag to be displayed at night ""upon special occasions when it is desired to produce a patriotic effect,"" it is appropriate that our national colors henceforth be displayed day and night at the Washington Monument.   NOW, THEREFORE, I, RICHARD NIXON, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim that, effective July 4, 1971, the fifty flags of the United States of America displayed at the Washington Monument in the District of Columbia be flown at all times during the day and night, except when the weather is inclement.

WHEREAS the joint resolution of Congress of June 22, 1942, entitled ""Joint Resolution to Codify and Emphasize Existing Rules and Customs Pertaining to the Display and Use of the Flag of the United States of America,"" as amended by the joint resolution of December 22, 1942, 56 Stat. 1074, contains the following provisions:   Sec. 2.  (a) It is the universal custom to display the flag only from sunrise to sunset on buildings and on stationary flagstaffs in the open. However, the flag may be displayed at night upon special occasions when it is desired to produce a patriotic effect.  * * * * * * *   Sec. 8.  Any rule or custom pertaining to the display of the flag of the United States of America, set forth herein, may be altered, modified, or repealed, or additional rules with respect thereto may be prescribed, by the Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States, whenever he deems it to be appropriate or desirable; and any such alteration or additional rule shall be set forth in a proclamation.   and   WHEREAS Francis Scott Key, after having anxiously watched from afar the bombardment of Fort McHenry throughout the night of September 13, 1814, saw his country's flag still flying in the early morning of the following day; and   WHEREAS this stirring evidence of the failure of the prolonged attack inspired him to write the Star-Spangled Banner, our national anthem:   NOW, THEREFORE, I, HARRY S. TRUMAN, President of the United States of America and Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy, do hereby proclaim that, as a perpetual symbol of our patriotism, the flag of the United States shall hereafter be displayed at Fort McHenry National Monument and Historic Shrine at all times during the day and night, except when the weather is inclement.   The rules and customs pertaining to the display of the flag as set forth in the said joint resolution are modified accordingly.   IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.   DONE at the City of Washington this 2nd day of July in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and forty-eight, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-second."

By virtue of the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and laws of the United States of America, and in order to establish policies and procedures' governing the assertion of Executive privilege by incumbent and former Presidents in connection with the release of Presidential records by the National Archives and Records Administration pursuant to the Presidential Records Act of 1978, it is hereby ordered as follows:  Section 1.   Definitions.  For purposes of this Order:  (a) ""Archivist"" refers to the Archivist of the United States or his designee.  (b) ""NARA"" refers to the National Archives and Records Administration.  (c) ""Presidential Records Act"" refers to the Presidential Records Act of 1978 (Pub. L. No. 95-591, 92 Stat. 2523-27, as amended by Pub. L. No. 98-497, 98 Stat. 2287), codified at 44 U.S.C. 2201-2207.  (d) ""NARA regulations"" refers to the NARA regulations implementing the Presidential Records Act. 53 Fed. Reg. 50404 (1988), codified at 36 C.F.R. Part 1270.  (e) ""Presidential records"" refers to those documentary materials maintained by NARA pursuant to the Presidential Records Act and the NARA regulations.  (f) ""Former President"" refers to the former President during whose term or terms of office particular Presidential records were created.  (g) A ""substantial question of Executive privilege"" exists if NARA's disclosure of Presidential records might impair the national security (including the conduct of foreign relations), law enforcement, or the deliberative processes of the Executive branch.  (h) A ""final court order"" is a court order from which no appeal may be taken.  Sec. 2.    Notice of Intent to Disclose Presidential Records.   (a) When the Archivist provides notice to the incumbent and former Presidents of his intent to disclose Presidential records pursuant to section 1270.46 of the NARA regulations, the Archivist, utilizing any guidelines provided by the incumbent and former Presidents, shall identify any specific materials, the disclosure of which he believes may raise a substantial question of Executive privilege. However, nothing in this Order is intended to affect the right of the incumbent or former Presidents to invoke Executive privilege with respect to materials not identified by the Archivist. Copies of the notice for the incumbent President shall be delivered to the President (through the Counsel to the President) and the Attorney General (through the Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal Counsel). The copy of the notice for the former President shall be delivered to the former President or his designated representative.  (b) Upon the passage of 30 days after receipt by the incumbent and former Presidents of a notice of intent to disclose Presidential records, the Archivist may disclose the records covered by the notice, unless during that time period the Archivist has received a claim of Executive privilege by the incumbent or former President or the Archivist has been instructed by the incumbent President or his designee to extend the time period. If a shorter time period is required under the circumstances set forth in section 1270.44 of the NARA regulations, the Archivist shall so indicate in the notice.  Sec. 3.    Claim of Executive Privilege by Incumbent President.   (a) Upon receipt of a notice of intent to disclose Presidential records, the Attorney General (directly or through the Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal Counsel) and the Counsel to the President shall review as they deem appropriate the records covered by the notice and consult with each other, the Archivist, and such other Federal agencies as they deem appropriate concerning whether invocation of Executive privilege is justified.  (b) The Attorney General and the Counsel to the President, in the exercise of their discretion and after appropriate review and consultation under subsection (a) of this section, may jointly determine that invocation of Executive privilege is not justified. The Archivist shall be promptly notified of any such determination.  (c) If after appropriate review and consultation under subsection (a) of this section, either the Attorney General or the Counsel to the President believes that the circumstances justify invocation of Executive privilege, the issue shall be presented to the President by the Counsel to the President and the Attorney General.  (d) If the President decides to invoke Executive privilege, the Counsel to the President shall notify the former President, the Archivist, and the Attorney General in writing of the claim of privilege and the specific Presidential records to which it relates. After receiving such notice, the Archivist shall not disclose the privileged records unless directed to do so by an incumbent President or by a final court order.  Sec. 4.    Claim of Executive Privilege by Former President.   (a) Upon receipt of a claim of Executive privilege by a former President, the Archivist shall consult with the Attorney General (through the Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal Counsel), the Counsel to the President, and such other Federal agencies as he deems appropriate concerning the Archivist's determination as to whether to honor the former President's claim of privilege or instead to disclose the Presidential records notwithstanding the claim of privilege. Any determination under section 3 of this Order that Executive privilege shall not be invoked by the incumbent President shall not prejudice the Archivist's determination with respect to the former President's claim of privilege.  (b) In making the determination referred to in subsection (a) of this section, the Archivist shall abide by any instructions given him by the incumbent President or his designee unless otherwise directed by a final court order. The Archivist shall notify the incumbent and former Presidents of his determination at least 30 days prior to disclosure of the Presidential records, unless a shorter time period is required in the circumstances set forth in section 1270.44 of the NARA regulations. Copies of the notice for the incumbent President shall be delivered to the President (through the Counsel the President) and the Attorney General (through the Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal Counsel). The copy of the notice for the former President shall be delivered to the former President or his designated representative.  Sec. 5. Judicial Review.  This Order is intended only to improve the internal management of the Executive branch and is not intended to create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law by a party against the United States, its agencies, its officers, or any person."

NARA does not lend original      documents for research      use.             Originating Federal agencies      or successors in function;      courts; and the President,      Vice President, former      Presidents or Vice Presidents      or donors, or their designated      representative may request      loans of their own original      holdings for the conduct      of official business.             Loans of original holdings      to originating agencies      are limited to instances      of demonstrated need when      copies will not suffice      and are subject to conditions      that exempt from loan any      holdings of high intrinsic      value or in need of preservation      action.     Does NARA lend      original documents for      exhibition use?     Original documents may      be loaned for exhibition      to qualified institutions      for the purpose of informing      and educating the public      about NARA, its holdings,      or the national experience,      while ensuring their continued      availability for the future.                  Borrowers must submit a      written request at least      120 days in advance of      loan date and include an       American      Association of Museums      Standard Facility Report       or equivalent. Borrowers      must comply with NARA's      stringent security, fire      protection, environmental,      and transport requirements.               Read the complete      guidelines .             Captured  German Records and the Berlin  Document Center           What is the      Berlin Document Center?     The records of the Berlin      Document Center consist      of personnel and related      records of the Nazi party      (NSDAP) and its affiliated      organizations and activities      from the founding of the      Party in 1920 until 1945.                  NARA holds more than 70,000      rolls of microfilm reproducing       captured      German and related records .      Reference copies of the      microfilm may be viewed      free of charge in the Microfilm      Research Room,  National      Archives at College Park ,      8601 Adelphi Road, College      Park, MD 20740-6001.       Self-service copies from      microfilm can also be made      in the research room.     How do I get      the records for someone      who was in the SS or a      member of the Nazi party?      This information can      be located in the  captured      German and related records .              Census  Records           How do I get      census records?     Federal population census      records, 1790-1930, are      available for research      at the  National      Archives Building in Washington,      DC , and in  Regional      Records Service Centers       throughout the country.      The National Archives at      College Park does not have      census records.     Please note that the  1930      census  is the most      recent one available for      research.     Some libraries and other      research institutions have      purchased copies of Federal      censuses. Check with your      local library or genealogical      society to see if the census      may be available in your      area.     Can I order copies    of census materials by mail?       NARA will only copy exactly      identified pages of the      Federal census. To use      this service, you must      provide the following:              census year       name of the individual        listed       exact page number       state       county       enumeration district        (1880-1920 only)           To ask for copies of the    exact census page, submit    NATF Form 82 (National Archives    Order for Copies of Census    Records). Use the online     Inquire    form  to request NATF    Form 82.       What if I don't      know the exact page of      the census?     You might be able to find      census indexes near you.      Check with your local librarian      or genealogical society.      Private firms have produced      indexes to census records      for specific years, generally      1790-1870. These are widely      available throughout the      country in libraries that      have genealogical collections.      In addition to these printed      indexes, there are microfilm      indexes to the 1900 and      1920 census and partial      indexes to the 1880 and      1910 census.     From these indexes, you      can determine the exact      page on which a family      was enumerated. With that      information, you can use      the NATF Form 82 to order      a copy of the page. Use      the online  Inquire      form  to request NATF      Form 82..      For more information,      please visit  How      to Use NARA's Census Microfilm      Catalogs .                 Charters of Freedom          What are the      Charters of Freedom?     The  Charters      of Freedom  are the      founding documents of the      United States. They are      the Declaration of Independence,      the Constitution, and the      Bill of Rights.       Where can I      get copies (reproductions)      of the Charters of Freedom?     Posters and reproductions      are available for purchase.      See the  Charters      of Freedom Catalog .      You may also  download      copies  from this web      site.             Congressional Records          How do I get      U.S. House of Representatives      or U.S. Senate committee      records?      Records of Congress in NARA are held by the  Center      for Legislative Archives  in the National Archives Building in Washington,      DC.       How do I get      U.S. House or U.S. Senate      hearing testimony?      Some hearing testimony is available via the Internet on the  Thomas      web site at the Library of Congress . In addition, published hearing testimony      is generally available through the  Federal      depository library system . There are approximately 1,350 Federal depository      libraries throughout the United States and its territories, at least one in      almost every Congressional District. All provide free public access to a wide      variety of Federal Government information in both print and electronic formats,      and have expert staff available to assist users. You can find more information      about this system on the  Government      Printing Office web site .       Do you have footage of Congressional hearings and speeches      from C-SPAN?     C-SPAN is a private organization not affiliated with the government. You      may contact  C-SPAN  directly.       How long do Congressional records stay closed?      Congressional records remain closed for varying lengths of time depending      upon several factors. More information is available in the  Records      of Congress  section of our web site.             Copyright          May I reproduce      images from your web site?     The vast majority of the      digital images in the  Archival      Research Catalog (ARC)       are in the public domain.      Therefore, no written permission      is required to use them.      We would appreciate your      crediting the National      Archives and Records Administration      as the original source.      For the few images that      remain copyrighted, please      read the instructions noted      in the ""Access Restrictions""      field of each  ARC       record.     Please note that a few      images on other areas of      our web site have been      obtained from other organizations      and that these are always      credited. Permission to      use these photographs should      be obtained directly from      those organizations.       May I reproduce      other NARA records?     In general, all government      records are in the public      domain and may be freely      used. We do have some donated      or other materials that      might be copyrighted. If      you have questions about      the records you are interested      in, speak to the archivist      or reference staff that      handles those records.       Can I get a      signed permission form      from NARA to use materials?     NARA as a policy does      not sign documents stating      that particular records      are not copyrighted because      government records are      in the public domain. For      other materials, it is      the user's responsibility      to determine copyright.             Court  Records           What court records      does NARA have?     NARA only has records      of Federal courts. We do      not have records from state      or county courts. Federal      court records are kept      in the  Regional      Records Services Facility       that covers records from      that state.      The one exception is the      District of Columbia. These      court records are in the      National Archives Building      in Washington, DC. Please       contact      us  if you have questions.         How      do I use the National Archives      to research bankruptcies?     Please see  information      on how to obtain bankruptcy      records .     Where can I research      Supreme Court decisions?      Many sources exist for      locating Supreme Court      decisions both in print      and electronic format.                  The Court itself provides      an excellent finding aid,       Where      to Obtain Supreme Court      Decisions , on its web      site.  Textual      Supreme Court  records      are also held in the National      Archives Building in Washington,      DC, while recorded oral      arguments are in the National      Archives at College Park.      Please  contact      us  if you have questions.     Most research into Supreme      Court decisions can be      done with printed sources      at  Federal      depository libraries.       In addition, please be      aware of the following      caution from the Supreme      Court concerning electronic      versus print versions of      decisions:            ""Only the bound volumes      of the United States Reports      contain the final, official      text of the opinions of      the Supreme Court of the      United States. In case      of discrepancies between      the bound volume and any      other version of a case--whether      print or electronic, official      or unofficial--the bound      volume controls.""                   Document Appraisal          Can you tell me about or appraise my historic document?      The National Archives does not appraise or look at privately owned documents      or artifacts. To find an appraiser in your area, you may wish to  contact the      ABAA  (Antiquarian      Booksellers Association of America).                Document Preservation          How do I preserve      a photo or other family      documents?            Personal documents are      no less valuable than government      records and care should      be taken for their proper      storage. You can find more      information in the  Preservation       section of this web site.             Donations          Does NARA purchase old, historic pictures or accept      them as donations?    NARA does not add to its holdings through purchase. We may accept offers of    donations when the documentary materials involved are closely related to Federal    records already in our custody. When documentary materials don't have a close    Federal connection, we direct potential donors to other appropriate archival    facilities.             Electronic  Records         What is the Electronic      Records Archives?     In the Federal Government,      electronic records are      as indispensable as their      paper predecessors for      documenting citizens' rights,      the actions for which officials      are accountable, and the      nation's history. Effective      democracy depends on access      to such records.             But we will lose the millions      of records being created      in electronic forms unless      we find ways to preserve      and keep them accessible      indefinitely. The Electronic      Records Archives (ERA)      is NARA’s vision for      a comprehensive, systematic,      and dynamic means of preserving      and providing continuing      access to authentic electronic      records over time.

The National Archives      does not have information      to help you locate living      individuals. The records      in the custody of NARA      are usually at least 20-30      years old. Information      on living individuals is      protected by the Privacy      Act. NARA records, therefore,      are not helpful in providing      current information about      individuals.     Other government resources      are available that may      be useful in locating individuals.      The Consumer Information      Center has created a list      of  resources      for locating persons of      unknown whereabouts .                  In addition to this resource, there are many  online      telephone directories  that may be useful for locating individuals. You      can also find them via most of the popular Internet search engines.             Forms          It seems the      forms change regularly.      How long do they last?          NARA has close to 600      forms, and some forms change      regularly.             Forms last until the office      that created them cancels      them.            If there is a particular      form that you have used      but can no longer locate,      you may  contact      us  for assistance in      determining the form's      status.

The Soundex is a coded      surname (last name) index      based on the way a surname      sounds rather than the      way it is spelled. Surnames      that sound the same, but      are spelled differently,      like SMITH and SMYTH, have      the same code and are filed      together. The Soundex coding      system was developed so      that you can find a surname      even though it may have      been recorded under various      spellings.  More      information on Soundex.

The general and permanent      laws of the United States      can be found in the  U.S.      Code .

NARA tries to make as      many records as possible      available via the Internet.      This is a daunting task,      even with records that      were created in electronic      format. More information      on this effort is available      from NARA's  Electronic      Records Archives (ERA)       Program.     The volume of records      in NARA's possession that      pre-date electronic formats      is so vast, that costs      and resource availabilities      will most likely preclude      the conversion of all of      them to electronic formats.      However, as resources permit,      NARA will continue to select      records to be digitized      and made available electronically.

WHEREAS there is now being constructed in the counties of Fairfax and Loudoun in the State of Virginia, pursuant to an act of Congress approved September 7, 1950 (Public Law 762; 64 Stat. 770), an international airport which will provide facilities for the District of Columbia and its vicinity; and   WHEREAS it is desirable that this airport be given an appropriate and significant name; and   WHEREAS the public service of John Foster Dulles, the renowned diplomat and statesman, was dedicated in large measure to the ideals of democracy and the cause of freedom and peace throughout the world; and   WHEREAS it is fitting that the international airport being built to serve our Nation's Capital should bear the name of this distinguished American whose memory is revered wherever men cherish democracy and freedom:   NOW, THEREFORE, by virtue of the authority vested in me as President of the United States, I hereby designate the airport now being constructed in the counties of Fairfax and Loudoun in the State of Virginia, pursuant to the above-mentioned act of Congress, as the Dulles International Airport; and such airport shall hereafter be known and referred to by that name.
