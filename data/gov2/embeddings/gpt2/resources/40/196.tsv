Overview      A. INTRODUCTION       State estimates of not only the number of uninsured children but their   characteristics have attracted growing interest with the passage of legislation   establishing the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP). The Current   Population Survey (CPS), the most widely cited source of data on the uninsured,   has been criticized because its state samples are inadequate to provide state   estimates of uninsured children with sufficient statistical precision to serve   policy needs. To produce detailed breakdowns of uninsured children goes well   beyond what most of the state samples can support. But while it may be   inappropriate to rely on ""direct sample"" estimation to produce the tabulations   that policymakers require, there exist innovative but well-grounded techniques   for developing state and substate estimates by the application of statistical   procedures that ""borrow strength"" from other data sources. This report employs   statistical procedures that allow us to (1) make use of the entire CPS sample   in developing estimates for each state and (2) incorporate data from a wide   variety of other sources. We apply these procedures to the March 1998 CPS to   develop state estimates of the number of uninsured children in January 1998 by   poverty level and age. The report also includes illustrative estimates of the   number of children simulated to be eligible for Medicaid and the number who   would be eligible for coverage under the SCHIP if the September 1999 rules had   been in effect in 1997.       Part I of this report is organized as follows. Section B discusses the   purpose of the tables in this report, and Section C provides a brief   description of the methodology. Section D presents estimates of uninsured rates   among children for the 50 states and the District of Columbia (DC), and Section   E presents illustrative estimates of the number of children who are eligible   for Medicaid and SCHIP, by state. These estimates are based on a simulation   model that incorporates state program detail. Finally, Section F discusses some   caveats regarding these estimates.       Part II of the report consists primarily of the state tables--10 per   state. Three of the tables are based entirely on the March 1998 CPS data   without any of the enhancements that we have introduced. They are included to   demonstrate, first, how limiting they are for most states and, second, to show   how closely (or not) our enhanced estimates match in broad terms certain state   characteristics that can be estimated directly from the CPS sample data. A   Technical Appendix follows the state tables and outlines the procedures that we   employed to develop the estimates.                B. PURPOSE OF THE TABLES IN THIS REPORT       While much attention has focused on the inadequacy of the state   estimates of uninsured children that the CPS provides, state and federal needs   go well beyond a simple count of the number of uninsured children (or adults)   in each state. How many of the uninsured children fall into different poverty   levels? What are their ages? The answers to these questions are important   because they have a direct bearing on how many children are eligible for   existing public health insurance programs or may be eligible for new programs.   To states that are trying to incrementally expand their coverage of children,   it is very important to know how many children may become eligible for coverage   with a given incremental change in the eligibility criteria. States need to   know what it will cost, potentially, to extend coverage beyond current levels.   Uncertainty about these numbers and therefore the cost implications of   expanding coverage usually translates into caution in the design of new   programs or modifications to existing programs. With better information, many   states may find that they can afford to be more generous in the coverage that   they extend to the uninsured.       The tables in this report are intended to provide baseline information   that states could find useful in planning future expansions of their SCHIP   initiatives and in evaluating their progress in reducing the number of children   who are without health insurance. (1)    Moreover, the database that was used to create these tables can be used to   generate customized tables that better suit the needs of individual states or   federal policymakers.                C. METHODOLOGY       The estimates presented in this report were derived from the March 1998   CPS public use file after making a number of enhancements discussed below and   in the Technical Appendix. The CPS is a monthly sample survey of 50,000   households in the United States. It serves as the source of the official   monthly unemployment estimates for the nation and the 50 states and the   District of Columbia. Interviews are conducted with all civilian non   institutionalized persons age 15 and older in the sample households. Each   March, the Census Bureau includes a supplemental questionnaire in the CPS   interview. The data collected in this questionnaire are the source of the   official estimates of the incidence of poverty in the United States. In   addition, the March supplement collects information on the health insurance   coverage of all household members (including children). These data have become   the source of the most widely-cited estimates of the number of uninsured   children in the United States each year.       While the CPS sample was designed to support state-level estimates of   unemployment rates and other labor force statistics, the sample sizes for most   states are inadequate for satisfactorily precise monthly estimates that use   only the survey data for that month. (2)    Thus, even if we are producing just a single estimate for each state--such as   the number of uninsured children--that estimate will generally be imprecise due   to the high sampling error associated with small samples. This means that we   will be very uncertain about the true number of uninsured children and able to   say for a typical state only that the number falls within a wide range, a range   that is too wide to provide useful guidance for developing policy or   administering a program.       This problem is even more severe when we must produce many estimates   for each state, such as a table showing the distribution of uninsured children   across poverty and age categories. Then, the already small sample for a state   must be spread across the many cells of the table. It is not unusual for the   available sample to have no observations in some cells even though the state   population obviously has uninsured children with the characteristics defined by   those cells.       When large samples are not available, a standard approach to improving   the precision of sample estimates is to borrow strength. (3)  This entails the development of statistical   models that allow us to derive, say, a 1998 estimate of uninsured children in   Virginia using not only the 1998 data for Virginia from the main sample survey   database but also data from other states, earlier years, and auxiliary sources,   such as administrative records. Knowing something about the numbers of   uninsured children in Virginia in 1996 and 1997 and the numbers of uninsured   children in other states with economic and demographic conditions similar to   Virginia's, we would generally be able to reduce substantially our uncertainty   about how many uninsured children lived in Virginia in 1998.       To derive most of the estimates presented in this report, we have used   a method for borrowing strength that is described in detail by Schirm and   Zaslavsky (1997). With this method, we have reweighted the March 1998 CPS   database to produce 51 sets of weights--one set for each state and the District   of Columbia. We use the Virginia weights to derive estimates for Virginia. Each   of the roughly 50,000 households in the CPS database--regardless of state of   residence--gets a Virginia weight, greatly increasing the size of the sample   from which to obtain estimates for Virginia. How much Virginia weight a   household gets and, therefore, its relative contribution to estimates for   Virginia depends on the household's characteristics. If a household from, say,   Montana has characteristics that would make it unusual were it in Virginia, as   opposed to other states, it receives a relatively small--probably   negligible--Virginia weight. If, instead, a household of that type would be   more common in Virginia than in other states, it receives a relatively large   Virginia weight.       The Virginia weight assigned to a household with a particular set of   characteristics depends on the aggregate characteristics of Virginia.   Specifically, Virginia weights are controlled so that totals derived for   Virginia using Virginia weights equal specified values. For example, the   weights might be controlled so as to reproduce specified totals of children,   children below 100 percent of poverty, and uninsured children. By controlling   the weights, we ensure that the entire database--when weighted according to the   Virginia weights--looks like Virginia in terms of totals that are relevant to   ascertaining the patterns of insurance coverage among children. (4)       In reweighting the March 1998 CPS database, we used controls reflecting   the age and racial/ethnic structure of each state's child population, the   distribution of children across poverty categories, and the numbers of   uninsured children (by poverty category). The full list of totals to which we   controlled weights appears in the Technical Appendix.       Reweighting a database as we have described can substantially improve   the precision of estimates because the samples used to derive the estimates are   much larger than when we use only the observations from a single state. Using   observations from all the states allows us to borrow strength. Although this   alone improves precision, we have further improved precision by using   administrative estimates or empirical Bayes shrinkage estimates--rather than   direct sample estimates --for many of the control totals used in the   reweighting. (5)  The administrative   totals, which are population estimates derived from mainly vital records (and   decennial census) data, have essentially no sampling error, and the shrinkage   totals, which are derived by borrowing strength, are more precise than direct   sample estimates. The specific sources of control totals are described in   greater detail in the  Technical Appendix . (6)          D. ESTIMATES OF THE   UNINSURED       Table I.1 reports the March 1998 CPS sample sizes for all children and   uninsured children by state and compares the model-based estimates of the   uninsured rate with the direct sample estimates. The sample sizes underscore   why it is necessary to employ procedures of the kind used here to construct   state-level tabulations of uninsured children. Most state samples include fewer   than 100 uninsured children, and 15 states have fewer than 50. Spreading such   small numbers of observations over a table with 24 cells (the number of cells   in each of the state tables in Part II) cannot yield much information of   value.

Differences between the model-based and direct sample estimates vary   from 0.1 to 5.2 percentage points (plus or minus). The two estimates are within   one percentage point for 25 states but differ by three percentage points or   more for 8 states. Sample size is clearly relevant but not the sole factor   affecting the size of the difference. For example, all nine states with CPS   sample sizes of more than 1,000 children have differences of 1 percentage point   or less, but the two largest differences occur in states with above average   sample sizes (Arizona and Arkansas). Perhaps more importantly, the model-based   estimates show the impact of shrinkage toward the mean. Generally the most   extreme rates--which are probably too extreme--are pulled toward the center. We   see this in the states of Arizona, Arkansas, Louisiana, and Texas, where the   model-based estimates are lower than the (high) direct sample estimates, and in   Hawaii, South Dakota, Washington, and Wisconsin, where the model-based   estimates are greater than the (low) direct sample estimates. This result is   not universal, however. There are states with low direct sample uninsured rates   (for example, Vermont and Minnesota) that get assigned even lower rates by the   model-based procedure. As low as the direct sample estimates were in these   states, the regression model predicted even lower rates. Thus the model did not   indiscriminantly eliminate high and low rates.       Table I.2 reports uninsured rates by poverty level for the model-based   estimates. It is quite clear from an examination of these rates that the   model-based procedure does not generate homogenous uninsured rates across the   states. Rather, there are distinctly different patterns in the rates for groups   of states.

              SOURCE: Mathematica Policy Research, from     the March 1998 CPS and other sources.                 For example, there is a general tendency for children who are between   100 percent and 150 percent of poverty to have the highest uninsured rates.   Children below 100 percent of poverty often have access to Medicaid while   children above 150 percent of poverty are more likely to have   employer-sponsored or other private insurance. But despite these tendencies we   do see a number of states in which the uninsured rates are highest among   children under 50 percent of poverty and then decline with each succeeding   higher income level. Arizona, Florida, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, Oklahoma,   Oregon, Utah, and Wyoming are among the states that fit this pattern. It is   likely that these states have low participation in Medicaid since most children   under 50 percent of poverty will be covered by Medicaid. In general, the states   that fit this pattern have large Hispanic populations or western locations. The   high uninsured rates of Hispanic children are well-documented. For the western   states, the high uninsured rates at low income levels may reflect low   participation in safety net programs generally. Whatever the reason, there is a   clear pattern that the model-based estimates are able to identify.       Four states--Hawaii, Minnesota, Vermont, and Wisconsin--have   single-digit uninsured rates in the two lowest poverty classes. The first three   of these are noted for their broad Medicaid coverage expansions, and we would   guess that Medicaid participation is very high among the eligible populations.   That the model-based estimates can differentiate between these states and the   rest provides additional face validity.          E. ILLUSTRATIVE ESTIMATES OF UNINSURED CHILDREN   ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICAID AND SCHIP       Development of the model-based estimation procedures employed here was   motivated by an interest in applying the methodology of microsimulation to   individual states. Microsimulation is particularly useful for estimating the   incremental impact of small changes in program eligibility on caseloads and   costs, but it requires a very large sample. (7)  To illustrate the application of   microsimulation to the reweighted March 1998 database, we have prepared a   simulation of eligibility under both Medicaid (1997 rules) and SCHIP (September   1999 rules) and applied this simulation model to the reweighted data. The   simulation program captures most of the major elements of state differentiation   in income eligibility limits by age, the use of gross versus net income, and,   to some degree, the application of asset tests. (8)  We base eligibility on annual family   income rather than trying to construct monthly income streams that would allow   a more literal replication of the Medicaid eligibility determination. This is a   widely-used practice--in large part because the CPS and other major surveys   collect only annual income data. Furthermore, given that the CPS provides only   annual rather than monthly estimates of insurance coverage, basing eligibility   on simulated monthly rather than reported annual income would not solve the   problem of relating eligibility to insurance coverage.        The first four columns of Table I.3 present state estimates of the   number of uninsured children, the number of all children who were simulated to   be eligible for Medicaid (without regard to insurance coverage), and both the   number and percentage of these Medicaid-eligible children who were reported as   uninsured. The final three columns present estimates of children who were   simulated to be eligible for either Medicaid or SCHIP (again without regard to   insurance coverage) and the number and percentage of these   Medicaid/SCHIP-eligible children who were uninsured. Medicaid eligibility is   based on program rules that were in effect in 1997 while SCHIP eligibility is   based on state program provisions that were in effect in September 1999. Thus   SCHIP eligibility is prospective or hypothetical rather than actual eligibility   in 1997. It should be noted as well that even in the absence of SCHIP, Medicaid   eligibility would have grown between 1997 and 1999. Earlier reforms extended   eligibility to low income children who were born after September 30, 1983. As   these children age, a larger and larger share of all children are made eligible   by these provisions.

         SOURCE: Mathematica Policy Research, from     the March 1998 CPS and other sources.                 Across all of the states, our estimates of uninsured children who were   eligible for Medicaid total 4.2 million out of the 11.5 million uninsured   children under 19. Our simulation of SCHIP eligibility suggests that SCHIP   would have extended eligibility for public insurance coverage to about 2.4   million additional children.       The estimated percentage of simulated Medicaid-eligible children who   were uninsured in each state helps us to understand the patterns of uninsurance   among low income children that we saw in Table I.2. Nationally, 22.0 percent of   our simulated Medicaid-eligible children were uninsured. Among the states, this   rate varies from a low of 7 percent (Minnesota and Wisconsin) to a high of 33   percent (Arizona). Generally, states with higher uninsured rates among children   under 100 percent of poverty than among children between 100 and 150 percent of   poverty have high rates of Medicaid-eligible uninsured in Table I.3. For   example, Arizona, Florida, and Idaho have higher uninsured rates in the two   lowest poverty classes than in the 100 to 150 percent class, and all three have   Medicaid-eligible uninsured rates in excess of 30 percent. At the other end of   the distribution, we singled out Hawaii, Minnesota, Vermont, and Wisconsin for   their relatively low uninsured rates among children below 100 percent of   poverty, and all four of these have Medicaid-eligible uninsured rates below 10   percent.       Some important implications of the impact of SCHIP eligibility at the   state level can be seen in Table I.4, which shows by state the number of   uninsured children who were  not  simulated to be Medicaid-eligible and   both the number and percentage of these who would be made eligible for coverage   under SCHIP. Nationally, SCHIP would extend eligibility to about one-third of   the uninsured children who were not otherwise eligible for Medicaid in 1997.   This varies substantially by state--in part because some states were already   covering a large part of the population that other states would now cover under   SCHIP. Hawaii and Minnesota, which provide broad coverage under Medicaid, would   extend coverage to fewer than 5 percent of the uninsured who were not eligible   for Medicaid, whereas Alabama, with comparatively low Medicaid coverage, would   extend coverage through SCHIP to nearly 60 percent of its remaining uninsured   children. At the same time, Texas with comparatively low Medicaid coverage   would extend coverage through SCHIP to only 12 percent of its remaining   uninsured children while DC would extend coverage to 57 percent.

(9)  In the   final column we see that three states would leave more than 10 percent of their   low income children uninsured and ineligible for Medicaid or SCHIP: Arkansas   (16 percent), Mississippi (11 percent), and Texas (13 percent). (10)  Most states, however, would leave   fewer than 2 percent of their low income children uninsured and ineligible for   Medicaid or SCHIP.

F. CAVEATS ABOUT THESE   ESTIMATES       We highlight three caveats that apply to the tables presented in Part   II and one additional caveat that applies to further use of the reweighted CPS   database. The first three are the CPS's undercount of the Medicaid population,   the overstatement of uninsurance among infants, and the limitations of the   Medicaid simulation. The fourth involves limitations on the kinds of data that   can be tabulated with the reweighted database.      1. Medicaid Undercount       It is widely known that the Medicaid enrollment in the CPS understates   estimates compiled from the states' program administrative statistics. It is   much less widely known that this Medicaid undercount has been growing. (11)  It is very likely that at least some   of the children reported as uninsured were actually covered by Medicaid. (12)    We have not attempted to adjust our estimates in any way for this Medicaid   undercount, so a portion (and perhaps a large portion) of those children that   we report as eligible for Medicaid but uninsured may have actually been covered   by Medicaid. (13)      2. Uninsured Rates for Infants         Despite their greater access to Medicaid, infants are reported to have   higher uninsured rates than children 1 to 5. This is peculiar to the CPS,   however, and it is very likely due to a combination of two factors: (1) the   uninsured being identified as those who report no insurance (as opposed to   reporting that they were uninsured) and (2) insurance coverage being measured   for the previous year (Czajka and Lewis 1999). Children born between the end of   the reference year and the March survey date cannot in truth be described as   having had coverage of any kind the previous year, and parents who answer the   questions literally will end up with their newborn infants classified as   uninsured. It is not possible to identify infants born after the end of the   reference year, and so it is not possible to screen out those who may have been   misclassified. Users of the data need to be aware that the rate of uninsurance   among infants is overstated.       3. Medicaid Eligibility       The rules governing Medicaid eligibility, which vary by state, are   extraordinarily complex. A complete simulation of all the ways that a child can   become eligible for Medicaid is impossible--both because of the limitations of   survey data and because the full details of eligibility, state by state, are   not documented in any accessible form. For this reason, any Medicaid   eligibility simulation is going to involve simplifications. It is quite rare,   for example, that anyone simulates eligibility under the medically needy   provisions, other than indirectly, and we have not done so here. Nor have we   incorporated state-specific differences in the calculation and application of   disregards. The information required to do so for all of the states is not   readily available, and that limits not only our own simulation but those that   could be constructed by others--even with substantially more resources.      4. Tabulating the Reweighted Database       The reweighting of the CPS database for state estimation was   accomplished by applying a number of controls that, depending on which of the   51 sets of weights is chosen, make the database ""look like"" a specific state.   The controls were chosen because of their relevance to estimating the number of   uninsured children by age and poverty level. While it is possible to tabulate   any field on the CPS file with the state weights that we have constructed, the   state-specificity of the resulting tabulation deteriorates with the declining   relevance of children's age, race and Hispanic origin, poverty level, and   insurance coverage (insured or not) to the fields being tabulated. In addition,   fields that depend on rules that differ across states, such as AFDC   participation or Medicaid participation, may be inconsistent with the rules in   most other states and, for this reason, should not be tabulated or used to   infer eligibility in a simulation algorithm. (14)                II. State Estimates       The sections that follow present ten tabulations for each of the 50   states and the District of Columbia. The tables are organized by state. Each   table consists of a cross-tabulation of a defined population of children by   poverty level and age. The tables utilize six poverty levels:           Less than 50 percent of the federal poverty level (FPL)      50 percent to less than 100 percent      100 percent to less than 150 percent      150 percent to less than 200 percent      200 percent to less than 350 percent      350 percent or greater           The four age categories are:           Less than 1 year of age (infant)      1 to 5      6 to 12      13 to 18           These age categories match those that the Health Care Financing   Administration is using in reports of SCHIP enrollment.       Each table describes a different population or sub population within   the state. The first seven tables were produced from the reweighted CPS   database. That is, they are model-based estimates. They are dated January 1998   rather than March 1998 because the population estimates that were used as   external controls are effectively January 1998 numbers.           Table II.A: Model-based Estimates of the Number of Children by Age     and Poverty Level, January 1998      Table II.B: Model-based Estimates of the Number of Children in     January 1998 Who Were Uninsured in the Previous Year      Table II.C: Model-based Estimates of the Percent of Children in     January 1998 Who Were Uninsured in the Previous Year      Table II.D: Model-based Estimates of Simulated Medicaid-Eligible     Children, January 1998      Table II.E: Model-based Estimates of Simulated Medicaid-Eligible     Children in January 1998 Who Were Uninsured in the Previous Year      Table II.F: Model-based Estimates of Simulated SCHIP- or     Medicaid-eligible Children, January 1998      Table II.G: Model-based Estimates of Simulated SCHIP- or     Medicaid-eligible Children in January 1998 Who Were Uninsured in the Previous     Year           The final three tables are direct sample estimates from the March 1998   survey. They use no other data. They provide counterparts to the first three of   the tables listed above and were included so that we could demonstrate on a   state-by-state basis how much our borrowing strength methodology has improved   our ability to produce usable state-level information. These final three tables   are:           Table II.H: Direct Sample Estimates of the Number of Children by Age     and Poverty Level, March 1998      Table II.I: Direct Sample Estimates of the Number of Children in     March 1998 Who Were Uninsured in the Previous Year      Table II.J: Direct Sample Estimates of the Percent of Children in     March 1998 Who Were Uninsured in the Previous Year           These tables are dated March 1998 because the March CPS sample is   weighted to population estimates for the month of March. (15)       We walk through these tables for Alabama to illustrate their   interpretation. Table II.A.1 indicates that there were about 1.2 million   children in Alabama in January 1998 and provides a breakdown by poverty level   and age. (16)  These estimates indicate,   for example, that there were 122,000 children in families with incomes below 50   percent of poverty and that about 33,000 were 13 to 18 years old. Table II.B.1   shows the number of uninsured children, which totaled 195,000. Children in   families between 100 and 150 percent of poverty accounted for the largest   number of uninsured (47,100) in any poverty class and nearly three times as   many as children in families above 350 percent of poverty. Table II.C.1 gives   the percentage of children who were uninsured in the previous year. The   estimates in this table were prepared by dividing each cell entry in Table   II.B.1 by the corresponding cell entry in Table II.A.1. Table II.C.1 indicates,   for example, that 19 percent of all Alabama children 13 to 18 years old were   uninsured while 38 percent of the 13 to 18 year-olds in families under 50   percent of poverty were uninsured.       Table II.D.1 presents estimates of the number of Alabama children who   were simulated to be eligible for Medicaid, without regard to their existing   insurance coverage. Very small numbers with family incomes above 200 percent of   poverty appear to be eligible, indicating the impact of income disregards that   extend eligibility beyond the nominal limits. Table II.E.1 shows how many of   these simulated Medicaid-eligible children were uninsured the previous year.   Note that none of the children who were simulated to be eligible with family   incomes above 200 percent of poverty were uninsured. Table II.F.1 provides   estimates of the number of children who were simulated to be eligible for   either Medicaid or SCHIP. (17)  Table   II.F.1 shows that about 533,000 Alabama children were simulated to be eligible   for either program when existing insurance coverage was ignored while Table   II.G.1 shows that only 141,000 of these eligible children were actually   uninsured the previous year.       Tables II.H.1, II.I.1, and II.J.1 are direct sample estimates from the   CPS, and they correspond in content to Tables II.A.1, II.B.1, and II.C.1. Table   II.H.1 shows all children, and it is about 90,000 lower than the total   represented in Table II.A.1. The difference is due to our use of population   controls that are external to the CPS and that include detail for children   under 15. (18)  While the totals are   nearly the same, however, there are striking differences between Tables II.A.1   and II.H.1 in the estimates for combinations of poverty level and age. For   example, Table II.A.1 shows almost 7,000 infants below 50 percent of poverty   while table II.H.1 shows double that number (and half as many as the number 1   to 5). The differences between Tables II.B.1 and II.I.1, which show the number   of uninsured children, are even more dramatic. Table II.I.1 contains several   cells for which there were no sample observations whereas Table II.B.1 has no   empty cells. The totals are different because our model-based estimate of the   uninsured rate in Alabama was higher than the CPS direct sample estimate (see   Table I.1). The relative numbers of children in adjacent age categories in   Table II.I.1 fluctuate dramatically across poverty levels. For example, there   are more than twice as many 13 to 18 year-olds as 6 to 12 year-olds between 100   and 150 percent of poverty but 10 times as many 6 to 12 year-olds as 13 to   18-year olds between 200 and 350 percent of poverty. In Table II.B.1 the   relative numbers of children in the two age groups vary little by poverty level   until the top category. Finally, the uninsured rates reported in Table II.J.1   show sharp fluctuations across the table and even between adjoining cells   whereas those reported in Table II.C.1 are much smoother.           Footnotes:           1.  An earlier application of the methodology employed   in this report was used to assist the State of New Jersey in its SCHIP design   and planning efforts (see Czajka, Rosenbach, and Schirm 1999).      2.  Recognizing the limitations of the CPS, Congress   has appropriated funds for enhancing the CPS to support more precise state   estimates of the numbers of uninsured children. But, such enhancements have not   yet been designed, let alone implemented, and it is unlikely that the expanded   sample will support detailed breakdowns of uninsured children.      3.  Estimators that borrow strength have been used   successfully in administering important public programs. For example, the   Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) uses data from administrative sources to help   construct the monthly estimates of state unemployment rates. Another estimator   has been used for several years to derive state estimates for allocating   federal funds under the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women,   Infants, and Children (WIC) (Schirm and Long 1995). Similar estimators have   also been used to obtain state and county estimates of poor school-aged   children for allocating federal Title I funds for compensatory education in   elementary and secondary schools (National Research Council 1998). Thus the   methodology that we employ in producing the tables presented in this report   follows a long line of successful applications of statistical enhancements to   the CPS for the purpose of preparing estimates at the state level.      4.  In contrast, with the original CPS sample weights,   the database looks like the whole United States.      5.  Empirical Bayes shrinkage methods average direct   sample estimates with predictions from regression models that derive their   predictions based on state characteristics measured by decennial census and   administrative records data (e.g., the poverty rate according to the census or   the ratio of children enrolled in Medicaid, according to Medicaid   administrative data, to the total population of children, which is derived from   a combination of census and administrative data).      6.  Prior to reweighting the CPS database to borrow   strength, we controlled the weights of households  within  each state to   a set of population totals characterizing the age and race/ethnic structure of   the state's child population (the same set of totals that is later used in the   reweighting). Such control totals are not used by the Census Bureau in   weighting the CPS because of the emphasis placed on using the survey for   producing employment estimates. Indeed, the only state-level control on weights   used by the Census Bureau is the total population aged 16 and over, which is   regarded as the population of working age. Because we are developing estimates   pertaining to the child population, our within-state adjustment of weights to   child population totals should improve the precision of the estimates. Then,   borrowing strength by reweighting should lead to further improvements in   precision.      7.  If the underlying database is too small, the   estimates of incremental changes to programs tend to be either zero or   excessively large.      8.  For Medicaid, the most important limitation of our   simulation is the exclusion of eligibility under state medically needy   provisions. The CPS lacks the medical expenditure data required to simulate   these provisions. For SCHIP the most important limitation is our inability to   take into account the waiting periods that a number of states have introduced   to discourage parents from dropping employer-sponsored coverage for their   children and enrolling them in SCHIP. The CPS provides no information on   duration of uninsurance and, furthermore, the details on state waiting periods   that we would require in order to simulate them are not readily available.   These waiting periods can reduce potential eligibility by a significant amount.        9.  Poverty in this table is measured relative to the   Census Bureau's poverty thresholds while program eligibility is based on the   poverty guidelines released by the Department of Health and Human Services   (DHHS). While generally similar, the two series differ in a number of respects,   and this may account for the fact that small percentages of children below 200   percent of poverty are simulated to be ineligible for Medicaid or SCHIP in   states with SCHIP eligibility limits of 200 percent. The Census Bureau poverty   threshold may define 200 percent of poverty as a slightly higher dollar figure   than the corresponding DHHS guideline used to determine eligibility, such that   a small number of children fall between the two figures. In addition, the   poverty guidelines recognize the markedly higher living costs in Hawaii and   Alaska than the rest of the nation and are set at higher levels while the   Census Bureau thresholds are undifferentiated across the states.      10.  Access to coverage among low income children in   Arkansas, currently, is actually better than this suggests. In September 1997,   Arkansas implemented the ARKids First program under a section 1115 Medicaid   waiver. Because of its late introduction, this program which provides coverage   for children up to 200 percent of poverty is not included in our simulation of   Medicaid eligibility in 1997 for the state of Arkansas. Nor is it included in   the combined Medicaid and SCHIP eligibility simulation, which mixes Medicaid   eligibility rules in 1997 with SCHIP eligibility rules as of September 1999. A   simulation based on a later point in time would very likely include this   extended coverage under SCHIP; state officials have indicated that there are   plans to transform ARKids First into a state SCHIP (Irvin and Czajka 2000).        11.  Comparison of CPS estimates with Medicaid   administrative statistics indicates that the CPS undercount of Medicaid   children under 15  grew  by about 3 million children between the March   1994 and March 1998 surveys. In March 1994 the undercount was estimated to be   about 17 percent or 3.2 million children. See Czajka and Lewis (1999) for a   discussion.      12.  Underreporting of coverage probably accounts for   most of the Medicaid undercount. Persons who failed to report their Medicaid   coverage could have reported another form of coverage during the year--either   as an incorrect description of their Medicaid coverage or as other coverage   that they actually had during the year. Part of the undercount could also be   due to CPS underrepresentation of low income households. This has quite   different implications, however. If low income households are underrepresented,   then not only Medicaid enrollees but uninsured people will be undercounted as   well. We are not aware of any evidence of an under-representation of low income   households in the CPS, but the possibility is one that must be recognized.   Under-representation of low income households might arise for many of the same   reasons that the decennial census undercounts the population.      13.  Both our ASPE project officers and the majority   of a technical advisory committee recommended against any adjustment for the   Medicaid undercount. The concern is not about the reality of a sizable   undercount but the uncertainty as to what it implies about the estimate of the   uninsured.      14.  Researchers who apply microsimulation to   estimate changes in eligibility under hypothetical program reforms are familiar   with the limitations of reported participation under such scenarios. Schirm and   Zaslavsky (1998) propose a solution to this problem.      15.  As we explain in the Technical Appendix, one of   the ways in which our methodology reduces the sampling error in state estimates   of uninsured children is by incorporating more state-specific detail for   children than the Census Bureau uses in weighting the March CPS. The added   detail includes race and Hispanic origin and multiple age categories. In order   to include this additional detail, however, we had to use population estimates   that the Census Bureau prepares for July 1 of each year. We averaged the July 1   estimates for 1997 and 1998, yielding estimates that we then characterize as   January 1, 1998.      16.  The numeral 1 is appended to each of the 10   tables for Alabama, the numeral 2 to each of the 10 tables for Alaska, and so   on.      17.  We combine the two programs because the SCHIP   eligibility criteria that we were asked to use refer to September 1999 while   the Medicaid eligibility criteria apply to 1997. Medicaid eligibility is   continuing to grow because of the phase-in of poverty-related eligiblity   provisions, so subtracting the 1997 Medicaid eligibles from the 1999 SCHIP   eligibles would attribute too much of the growth in eligibility to SCHIP.      18.  As we noted in an earlier footnote, the Census   Bureau applies no state-specific controls to the population under 16 when it   constructs weights for the CPS.

The provision requires that a State, which has entered into an                agreement with the Commissioner for Federal administration of the                State's supplementary payments, to remit payments and fees no                later than the business day preceding the SSI payment date.

The administrative fees would be credited to a special fund of the                U.S. Treasury to defray expenses in carrying out title VIII and                federally administered State recognition payments.

There are four                categories of statutory employees-certain full-time life insurance                sales people, agent drivers or commission drivers, homeworkers and                full-time traveling or city salespeople. While these individuals                will continue to be treated as statutory employees for Social                Security purposes and self-employed for income tax purposes, they                now will be treated as self-employed for SSI purposes.                 The provision is effective upon enactment.                Individual Development Accounts (Section 610)                               Excludes for determining means-tested program eligibility and                benefit amount, funds (and accrued interest) in an individual                development account provided for under the ""Assets for                Independence Act"" (P.L. 105-285). (Previously only matching funds                were excluded. The funds deposited by the individual and interest                on those deposits could have been counted for SSI purposes.)

Establishes a 45-day period for the processing of initial                claims, a 30-day period for the processing of appeals at the                reconsideration level, a 90-day period for the processing of                appeals at the hearing level, and a 90-day period for the                processing of appeals to the Departmental Appeals Board of the                Department of Health and Human Services.                 Permits the party requesting the hearing to waive the 90-day                time limit at the hearing level.                 These provisions apply with respect to initial determinations                made on or after October 1, 2002.                Permitting Premium Reductions Additional Benefits Under              Medicare+Choice Plans (Title VI, Subtitle A, Section 606)                               Allows, beginning for plan year 2003, managed care providers                participating in the Medicare Plus Choice program to offer                beneficiaries, instead of options for additional services as                required under current law, a reduction in the Part B Medicare                premium. The reduction could take the form of a reduction in the                premium withheld from monthly Social Security benefits, a                retroactive adjustment in the amount withheld or a rebate.                 Outreach on Availability of Medicare Cost-Sharing Assistance to              Eligible Low-Income Medicare Beneficiaries (Title IX, Subtitle B,              Section 911)                               Adds section 1144 to the Social Security Act, which requires                that the Commissioner of Social Security:                                   Identify Medicare beneficiaries-- Qualified Medicare                  Beneficiaries (QMBs), Specified Low-Income Medicare (SLMBs), and                  Qualified Individuals (QI's) -- who may be eligible for payment                  of the cost of Medicare cost-sharing under the Medicaid program                  (although not specified, presumably on the basis of the amount                  of the beneficiary's title II benefit);                   Notify individuals who may be eligible of the availability                  of cost sharing assistance under the Medicaid program that the                  assistance is conditioned on meeting the eligibility                  requirements, including an assets test, of individual States'                  cost-sharing programs under Medicaid;                   Furnish each State agency administering a cost-sharing                  program under Medicaid the name and address of beneficiaries who                  live in that State and who are identified as potentially                  eligible for cost-sharing; and                   Update information for the States each year, including                  information on beneficiaries who may have become eligible for a                  cost-sharing program during the year because of a reduction in                  their title II benefits.                  The provision is effective one year after the date of                enactment.                 Requires that the Comptroller General study and report to the                Congress on the impact of section 1144 on the enrollment in                cost-sharing programs of individuals and make recommendations for                legislative changes the Comptroller deems appropriate. The report                is due 18 months after the Commissioner of Social Security first                conducts outreach under the provision.                Community Renewal Tax Relief Act of 2000 (H.R. 5662)               Title III-Subtitle A-Administrative Provisions               Adjustments for Consumer Price Index Error (Section 308)                               Directs the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to determine                whether a technical error in the computation of the Consumer Price                Index for 1999 has or will result in a shortfall in payments to                beneficiaries of Federal benefits programs, including Social                Security and SSI payments and payments under title VIII of the                Social Security Act (Special Veterans Benefits) as compared to                payments that would have been made had the error not occurred.                 Requires the head of any agency administering Federal benefits                programs to make an initial determination as to whether, and the                extent to which, the error resulted in a shortfall to                beneficiaries; and submit a report, no later than 30 days after                enactment, to the Director of OMB and to each House of the                Congress describing the shortfall.                 Requires OMB, within 60 days after enactment, to direct that                payment or payments be made to compensate for any identified                shortfall.                 Provides that payments made as a result of this change in the                law shall be disregarded in determining income under title VIII of                the Social Security Act or any applicable means-tested program.                 Also requires the Director of OMB to submit to Congress by                April 1, 2001, a report on the activities undertaken by OMB in                accordance with this section.                                                                                                     Privacy        Policy  |  Accessibility Policy  |         Linking Policy  |  Site        Map"
GX236-21-3439549	"Preface The Supplement is a major data resource on our nation's social insurance and welfare programs. The majority of the data concern the Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance programs, known collectively as Social Security, and the Supplemental Security Income program. The Supplement has been published annually since 1940. Decisions affecting the future of Social Security are facilitated by the availability of relevant data over a long period. The data provide a base for research, policy analysis, and proposals for changing the programs. In addition to meeting the Social Security Administration's (SSA's) information needs, the Supplement strengthens the agency's ability to respond to requests for program data from congressional committees, government agencies at all levels, and the research community. One of our most important goals is to provide clear and meaningful program data. For this reason, we have repackaged the all-in-one Table 5.A1 into smaller, more manageable statistical tables so that it is easier to locate data on specific beneficiary populations. The Supplement is prepared by SSA staff from various components throughout the agency. I would also like to express my thanks to the many people in other federal agencies for their contributions. The inside cover includes a list of the agencies and persons contributing to this edition. General questions or comments about this report are welcome and should be directed to Rona M. Blumenthal at 410-965-0163 or rona.m.blumenthal@ssa.gov. For specific questions about the data, please call the contact listed on each table. This report is available on our Web site at www.ssa.gov/policy. For additional copies of the report, please telephone 202-358-6274 or e-mail ores.publications@ssa.gov.

Of the 2001 awards, 502,800 went to blind or disabled recipients aged 18-64, 157,000 to those blind or disabled under age 18, and 110,800 to recipients aged 65 or older.  4  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2002   Health Care Medicare Hospital Insurance (Part A) Total benefits paid in calendar year 2001 Supplementary Medical Insurance (Part B) Total benefits paid in calendar year 2001 Number of enrollees in July 2001, (one or both of Parts A and B) Aged Disabled Administrative costs, 2001 Hospital Insurance As a percentage of total benefits paid Supplementary Medical Insurance As a percentage of total benefits paid Medicaid Medical service expenditures in fiscal year 1998 Number of unduplicated recipients, fiscal year 1998 Average 1998 vendor payment per unduplicated recipient Persons aged 65 or older Permanently and totally disabled persons Dependent children under age 21 Average 1998 vendor payment for medical services Nursing facility services Inpatient general hospital care Prescribed drugs Physicians services $142.3 billion 40.7 million $10,242 $9,095 $1,203 $19,379 $5,031 $699 $327 $141.2 billion $99.7 billion 40.0 million 34.4 million 5.5 million $2.2 billion 1.6 percent $1.7 billion 1.7 percent  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2002  5   Unemployment Insurance 2001 Total payments Average-- Weekly benefit amount (regular programs) Duration of benefits Weekly insured unemployment Covered employment $31.6 billion $238 13.8 weeks 3.0 million 127.9 billion  Workers' Compensation 2000 Benefit payments Total Compensation payments Medical and hospitalization Benefits paid by-- Private insurance carriers State and federal funds Employers' self-insurance Covered workers per month Costs as a percentage of covered payroll  $45.9 billion 25.9 billion 20.0 billion 25.7 billion 10.4 billion 9.8 billion 126.6 million 1.25 percent  Temporary Disability Insurance Programs in effect in-- California, Hawaii, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Puerto Rico, and the railroad industry.

Eligibility and benefit amounts are determined by the worker's contributions to Social Security. Benefits are paid as an earned right to workers, their families and their survivors. There is no means test to qualify for benefits. At the end of December 2001, 45.9 million people were receiving benefits at a rate exceeding $36 billion each month ($432 billion annually). According to the latest Social Security Trustees Report, these cash benefits comprised 4 percent of the nation's gross domestic product. During the same year, approximately 153 million employees and self-employed workers, along with employers, contributed more than $516 billion to the OASDI trust funds--through which contributions are credited and benefits are paid. Social Security benefits are essential to the economic well-being of millions of individuals. Social Security pays benefits to more than 90 percent of those 65 or older. It is the major source of income (providing 50 percent or more of total income) for 64 percent of the beneficiaries. It contributes 90 percent or more of income for almost one-third of the beneficiaries, and is the only source of income for 20 percent of them (see Charts 14 at the end of this section). 1. Monthly benefits for workers and their families. 2. Vocational rehabilitation services for disabled beneficiaries. 3. Administrative costs (currently less than 1 percent of expenditures). 4. The lump-sum death payment to eligible survivors. Revenue received from FICA payments is transferred to the U.S. Treasury. FICA revenue in excess of outlays is used to purchase special interest-bearing Treasury bonds. These securities remain assets of the trust funds until needed to cover Social Security costs. 0  Structure and Organization The OASDI program is administered by the Social Security Administration (SSA), which became an independent agency in 1995. The Commissioner of Social Security serves a 6-year term following appointment by the President and confirmation by the Senate. A bipartisan Social Security Advisory Board serves to review existing laws and policies and commissions studies and issues recommendations intended to anticipate changing circumstances. The President appoints three of the seven board members and Congress appoints the other four members. The Social Security Administration is headquartered in Baltimore, Maryland. Major headquarter components include the National Computer Center that contains SSA's mainframe computers that drive our systems, much of the executive staff for policy, programs and systems as well as field support components. SSA's field structure is divided into 10 geographic regions containing over 1,300 field installations in communities throughout the country. Office sizes range from large urban offices with 50 or more employees to remote resident stations staffed by one or two individuals. Each region is headed by a Regional Commissioner, and staffed with specialists to handle regional administrative tasks and to assist field offices with operational issues. In addition, there are teleservice centers servicing all regions. While physically located within the various regions, each teleservice center manages the public's Social Security business from throughout the nation using state of the art communications systems. Seven program service centers provide service and support for the field offices in some aspects of Social Security's workloads. Tables 2.F12.F11 provide SSA administrative data on the agency's national workforce (Tables 2.F12.F3), claims workloads (Tables 2.F42.F6), delivery of services (Table 2.F7), and its hearings and appeals operations (Tables 2.F82.F11).  Contributions and Trust Funds A person contributes to Social Security either through payroll taxes or self-employment taxes under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) or the Self-Employed Contributions Act (SECA). Employers match the employee contribution, while self-employed workers pay an amount equal to the combined employer-employee contributions. (Self-employed workers receive a special tax deduction to ease the impact of paying the higher rate.) There is a maximum yearly amount of earnings subject to OASDI taxes, $84,900 in 2002. There is no upper limit on taxable earnings for Medicare Hospital Insurance. Employees whose contributions exceed the maximum taxable amount because they worked for more than one employer can receive refunds of excess FICA payments when they file their tax returns. Taxes are allocated to the Old-Age (Retirement) and Survivors Insurance (OASI), the Disability Insurance (DI), and the Hospital Insurance (HI) Trust Funds. In addition to the taxes on covered earnings, OASI and DI trust fund revenues include interest on trust fund securities, income from taxation of OASI and DI benefits, certain technical transfers, and gifts or bequests. By law, the OASI and DI trust funds may only be disbursed for:  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2002  9   Social Security  Significant Program Changes Program changes occur through legislation or (in areas where authority is delegated to the Commissioner) through regulation. Elimination of Annual Earnings Test for Persons Reaching Full Retirement Age Public Law 106-182, The Senior Citizen's Freedom to Work Act of 2000, enacted April 7, 2000 eliminated the earnings test beginning with the month a beneficiary attains full retirement age (FRA). Elimination of this earnings test is effective for taxable years ending after December 31, 1999. The earnings limit that applies in the year of attainment of FRA is based on the limits previously established for persons at FRA through age 69--$25,000 in 2001, and $30,000 in 2002. Benefits are withheld at the rate of $1 for every $3 of earnings above these exempt amounts. In determining earnings for purposes of the annual earnings test under this legislation, only earnings before the month of attainment of FRA will be considered. The legislation also permits retired workers to earn delayed retirement credits for any months between the attainment of full retirement age and age 70 for which the worker requests that benefits not be paid. Public Law 106-182 did not change the annual exempt amount for beneficiaries who are under FRA throughout the year, which continued to be pegged to increases in the average wage. This amount increased from $10,680 in 2001 to $11,280 in 2002. Withholding for beneficiaries subject to this earnings test is at $1 for each $2 of earnings over the exempt amounts. Work Incentives Improvement Act The Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act, Public Law 106-170, was enacted on December 17, 1999. This legislation provides major enhancements to SSA's programs that assist disabled beneficiaries who attempt to return to work. It provides beneficiaries more choices in vocational rehabilitation services, and offers expanded health care for beneficiaries who are no longer eligible for cash benefits due to work. Effective October 1, 2000, the Act offers extended Medicare coverage to beneficiaries who return to work, and offers buy-in for Medicaid coverage. The Ticket to Work provisions of this legislation are being phased in over a 3-year period that began January 1, 2001. The Ticket to Work will emphasize and encourage rehabilitation efforts and will reimburse private employment service providers for their services to beneficiaries attempting to return to work. These providers are called Employment Networks. Most disability beneficiaries will receive a Ticket that they may use to obtain vocational rehabilitation, job training, or other support services.  Individuals may take their ticket to any of the Employment Networks that offer services in their communities. By the end of 2002, SSA expects to have distributed tickets to beneficiaries in 33 states and the District of Columbia. In 2003, tickets will be distributed in the remaining 17 states, American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. Also beginning January 1, 2001, former beneficiaries may have their benefits resumed if their work activity ends within 5 years of the month their benefits stopped and they are still disabled Regulatory Increases in Substantial Gainful Activity and in Trial Work Period Amounts Effective July 1, 1999, the Social Security Administration raised from $500 to $700 the amount of monthly earnings for a nonblind disabled individual to be considered engaging in substantial gainful activity (SGA). Effective January 1, 2001, the top SGA level was raised to $740 per month, with the provision that ongoing SGA levels will be automatically adjusted annually based on increases in the national average wage index. Effective January 1, 2002, the level is $780 per month. The SGA threshold is part of the definition of disability that requires an individual to be unable to engage in substantial gainful activity to be eligible for benefits. Earnings of more than the top SGA level will ordinarily demonstrate that an individual is engaged in SGA. Earnings of less than $780 per month will ordinarily demonstrate that an individual is not engaged in SGA. A different definition of SGA applies to blind persons receiving Social Security disability benefits. Increases in the SGA amount for blind individuals have long been pegged to increases in the national average wage index and thus were not affected by the 1999 or subsequent rule changes. The level for blind individuals increased from $1,240 in 2001 to $1,300 in 2002. New rules also affect the trial work period (TWP). The TWP allows disability beneficiaries to test their ability to work for at least 9 months. During the TWP, beneficiaries may earn any amount and still receive full benefits. The monthly level at which earnings count toward the 9-month TWP was raised from $200 to $530 effective January 1, 2001, with future increases pegged to the national average wage index. Effective January 1, 2002, the level is $560. After completion of 9 trial work months, the SGA level is used to determine whether earnings are substantial or not. If earnings fall below the SGA level, full benefits generally continue. If earnings are higher than the SGA level, cash benefits are usually suspended while medical benefits continue. Table 2.A30 provides related historical data on disability program earnings guidelines, including reference to recent changes in thresholds for determining SGA.  10  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2002   Social Security  Coverage and Financing In 2001, about 153 million persons worked in employment or self-employment covered under the OASDI program. In recent years, coverage has become nearly universal for work performed in the United States, including American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Approximately 96 percent of the American workforce are covered by OASDI. Workers excluded from coverage fall into five major categories: 1. Civilian federal employees hired before January 1, 1984, 2. Railroad workers (who are covered under the railroad retirement system, which is coordinated with Social Security), 3. Certain employees of state and local governments who are covered under their employers' retirement systems, 4. Domestic workers and farm workers whose earnings do not meet certain minimum requirements (workers in industry and commerce are covered regardless of the amount of earnings), and 5. Persons with very low net earnings from selfemployment, generally under $400 annually. 0  A self-employed person pays the combined employeeemployer rate of 12.4 percent for OASDI and 2.9 for HI under the Self-Employment Contributions Act (SECA). Two deduction provisions reduce the SECA and income tax liability of self-employed persons. The intent of these provisions is to treat the self-employed in much the same manner as employees and employers are treated for purposes of FICA and income taxes. The first provision allows a deduction from net earnings from self-employment equal to the amount of net earnings before the deduction, times one-half the SECA tax rate. The effect of this deduction is intended to be analogous to the treatment of the FICA tax paid by the employer, which is disregarded as remuneration to the employee for FICA and income tax purposes. The second provision allows an income tax deduction, equal to one-half of the amount of the SECA tax paid, which is designed to reflect the income tax deductibility of the employer's share of the FICA tax. Table 2.A5 describes income tax credits for 19841989 intended to cushion the impact of increases in FICA and SECA taxes enacted in 1983. The SECA tax credits were replaced, effective 1990, by the deduction provisions described above. Table 2.A6 outlines the history of provisions regarding appropriations from general revenues and interfund borrowing.  Table 2.A1 outlines the history of coverage provisions and table 2.A2 provides a history of provisions regarding noncontributory wage credits, mostly for military service. For most employees, taxes are withheld from wages beginning with the first dollar earned. The exceptions are domestic employees, election workers, and agricultural workers. In 2002, a domestic employee must earn $1,300 from any single employer in a calendar year before FICA is withheld. Most election workers must earn $1,200 in 2002 before FICA is withheld. Most agricultural workers wages are covered if the employer pays more than $2,500 in total wages in a year or if the individual worker earns over $150 in a year from a single employer. Employees, their employers, and the self-employed each pay taxes on earnings in covered employment and self-employment up to an annual maximum taxable amount for OASDI. There is no upper limit on taxable earnings for Medicare Hospital Insurance (HI). The OASDI maximum taxable amount--$84,900 in 2002--is updated automatically each year in relation to increases in the national average annual wage. The current FICA tax rate applicable to both employees and employers is 6.2 percent for OASDI (5.30 percent for OASI and 0.9 percent for DI), and 1.45 percent for HI. See Table 2.A3 for annual amounts of maximum taxable earnings and contribution rates. Table 2.A4 shows historical annual maximum amounts of contributions by employees and self-employed persons. 0  Insured Status To become eligible for his or her benefit and benefits for family members or survivors, a worker must earn a minimum number of credits based on work in covered employment or self-employment. These credits are described as quarters of coverage. In 2002, a quarter of coverage (QC) is credited for each $870 in annual covered earnings, up to a maximum of four QCs for the year. Earnings of $3,480 or more in 2002 will give the worker four QCs regardless of when the money is actually earned or paid during the year. The amount of earnings required for a QC is adjusted automatically each year in proportion to increases in the average wage level. Fully Insured Eligibility for most types of benefits requires that the worker be fully insured. To be fully insured a worker must have a number of QCs at least equal to the number of calendar years elapsing between age 21 (or 1950 if later) and the year in which he or she reaches age 62, becomes disabled, or dies--whichever occurs first. Under this requirement, workers who reach age 62 in 1991 or later need the maximum number of 40 QCs to be fully insured. For workers who become disabled or die before age 62, the number of QCs needed for fully insured status depends on their age at the time the worker is disabled or dies. A minimum of 6 QCs is required regardless of age.  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2002  11   Social Security Currently Insured If a worker dies before achieving fully insured status, benefits can still be paid to qualified survivors if the worker was ""currently insured"" at the time of death. (In the case of a young worker, survivors benefits are potentially payable to a worker's children and to a widow(er) with children in care.) To be currently insured, the worker must have earned 6 QCs in the 12 quarters before death (that is, 6 of the last 13 quarters, including the quarter in which death occurred). Disability Insured To qualify for disability benefits, a nonblind worker must have recent work activity as well as being fully insured. Under the test involving recent work experience, a nonblind worker older than age 31 must have earned at least 20 QCs among the 40 calendar quarters ending with the quarter in which the disability began. Workers disabled at ages 24 through 30 must have earned QCs in one-half of the calendar quarters elapsing between age 21 and the calendar quarter in which the disability began. Workers under age 24 need 6 QCs in the 12-quarter period ending with the quarter of disability onset. Workers who qualify for benefits based on blindness need only be fully insured. Table 2.A7 summarizes the basic provisions concerning insured status. Social Security taxes to both countries on the same earnings. Each agreement includes rules that assign a worker's coverage to only one country. The second goal of the agreement is to help fill gaps in benefit protection for workers who have divided their careers between the United States and another country. Such workers may fail to qualify for Social Security benefits from one or both countries because they have not worked long enough to meet minimum eligibility requirements. Under an agreement, these workers and their family members may qualify for a partial U.S. benefit based on ""totalized"" (that is, combined) credits from both countries. Similarly, workers may qualify for partial benefits from the foreign country based on totalized credits. Table 5.M1 shows the number of beneficiaries receiving totalization payments and their average benefits.  Benefit Computation and Automatic Adjustment Provisions The primary insurance amount (PIA) is the monthly benefit amount payable to the worker upon retirement at full retirement age or upon entitlement to disability benefits. The PIA is also the base figure from which monthly benefit amounts payable to the worker's family members or survivors are determined. The PIA is derived from the worker's annual taxable earnings, averaged over a period that encompasses most of the worker's adult years. Until the late 1970s, the average monthly wage (AMW) was the earnings measure generally used. For workers first eligible for benefits after 1978, average indexed monthly earnings (AIME) have replaced the AMW as the usually applicable earnings measure. The PIA computation based on AIME currently involves the following three steps: 1. Indexing of earnings. The worker's annual taxable earnings after 1950 are updated, or indexed, to reflect the general earnings level in the indexing year--the second calendar year before the year in which the worker is first eligible; that is, first reaches age 62, becomes disabled, or dies. Earnings in years after the indexing year are not indexed but instead are counted at their actual value. A worker's earnings for a given year are indexed by multiplying them by the following ratio (indexing factor): The average wage in the national economy for the indexing year, divided by the corresponding average wage figure for the year to be indexed.  International Agreements The President is authorized to enter into international Social Security agreements (also called ""totalization"" agreements) to coordinate the U.S. Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI) program with comparable programs of other countries. The United States currently has Social Security agreements in effect with 20 countries. Social Security Agreements and Effective Dates Australia ................. Austria ....................

Table 2.A9 shows indexed earnings for workers first eligible in 19952002 who had maximum taxable earnings in each year after 1950. For a detailed description of an AIME computation, see Appendix D, ""Computing a Retired-Worker Benefit."" 2. Determining AIME. The period used to calculate AIME equals the number of full calendar years elapsing between age 21 (or 1950, if later) and the year of first eligibility, usually excluding the lowest 5 years. Workers disabled before age 47 have from zero to 4 excluded years from the computation. At an absolute minimum, 2 years are used to compute AIME. The actual years used in the computation (the ""computation years"") are the years of highest indexed earnings after 1950, including any years before age 22 or after age 61 as well as the year of disability or death. AIME is calculated as the sum of indexed earnings in the computation period, divided by the number of months in that period. Table 2.A10 provides a historical outline of provisions related to AIME and AMW, and describes variations in the number of dropout years. Tables 2.A15 and 2.A16 describe AMW benefit computations based on the worker's nonindexed earnings after 1936 and 1950, respectively. (Very few persons currently being awarded benefits have PlAs computed under these old-start or new-start computation methods. These methods, particularly the new-start method shown in Table 2.A16, are more frequently applicable in earnings recomputations for workers who reached age 62 before 1979.) 3. Computing the PIA. The formula used to compute the PIA from AIME is weighted to provide a higher PIA-toAIME ratio for workers with comparatively low earnings. The formula applies declining percentage conversion rates to three AIME brackets. For workers who reach age 62, become disabled, or die in 2002, the formula provides a PIA equal to the sum of: 90 percent of the first $592 of AIME, plus 32 percent of the next $2,975 of AIME, plus 15 percent of AIME over $3,567. Beginning with the first year of eligibility, the PIA is increased by cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs). 0 0  Table 2.A11 shows the PIA formula and first applicable COLA for workers first eligible in 1979 or later.  The dollar amounts defining the AIME brackets are referred to as ""bend points."" These bend points (as described in Table 2.A11) are updated automatically each year in proportion to increases in the national average wage level. This automatic adjustment ensures that benefit levels for successive generations of eligible workers will keep up with rising earnings levels, thereby assuring consistent rates of earnings replacement from one generation of beneficiaries to the next. The benefit formula applicable to a worker depends on the year of eligibility (or death) rather than on the year benefits are first received. Thus the PIA of a worker retiring at age 65 in 2002 is calculated using the benefit formula that applies to all workers first eligible in 1999 (the ""year of attainment"" of age 62). The PIA derived from that formula is then increased by the COLAs effective for December, 1999, 2000, and 2001 to obtain the PIA effective at age 65. Subsequent recomputations of the worker's benefit, including additional earnings not originally considered, delayed retirement credits or additional COLA increases, all refer to the basic computation that originally applied, based on the year of attainment. Beginning in 1981, benefits have been rounded to the next lower ten cents at each step in the computation. The final benefit payment is rounded to the next lower dollar amount (if not already an even dollar). Prior to 1981, benefits were paid in ten-cent increments after rounding up to the next dime in each computation step. A cost-of-living increase in benefits generally is established each year if the consumer price index for urban wage earners and clerical workers (CPI-W), prepared by the Department of Labor, indicates a percentage increase (after rounding) of at least 0.1 percent between two specified quarters. The arithmetical mean of the CPI-W for July, August, and September in the year of determination is compared with the arithmetical mean of the CPI-W for the later of (a) July, August, and September in the year in which the last effective cost-of-living increase was established or (b) the 3 months of the calendar quarter in which the effective month of the last general benefit increase occurred. The percentage increase in the CPI-W, rounded to the nearest 0.1 percent, represents the size of the increase in benefits, effective for December of the year in which the determination is made. Under certain conditions, depending on the size of the combined OASDI trust funds relative to estimated disbursements, the applicability and size of a cost-of-living adjustment may be determined under an alternative method, called the ""stabilizer provision."" In no case, however, are benefits reduced below the level of benefits in the year of determination. Historically, this provision has never been triggered.  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2002  13   Social Security Table 2.A18 presents a history of provisions relating to the automatic adjustment of benefits, including a description of the stabilizer provision. In addition, the Table includes a summary history and description of provisions relating to the annual automatic adjustment of (1) the maximum amount of taxable and creditable earnings, (2) the dollar amount needed to establish a quarter of coverage, (3) the bend points defining the AIME brackets in the PIA formula and the PIA brackets in the maximum family benefit formula, and (4) the exempt amounts under the earnings (retirement) test. All of these adjustments are linked to increases in the level of the national average annual wage, rather than to increases in the CPI. Table 2.A19 illustrates the cumulative effect of statutory and automatic increases in benefits for workers who have been in benefit status over varying time periods. Alternative PIA Computation Provisions Special minimum PIA. Workers with low earnings but steady attachment to the workforce over most of their adult years may qualify for monthly benefits based on the special minimum PIA computation. This computation does not depend on the worker's average earnings, but on the number of coverage years--years in which the worker had earnings equal to or above a specified amount. The level of the special minimum PIA is the same for workers having the same number of coverage years, regardless of age or year of first eligibility. Increases in the special minimum PIA are linked to cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs). See Table 2.A12 for additional information on the special minimum PIA. Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP). The WEP affects persons who receive a pension based on noncovered work after 1956 and Social Security benefits. First eligibility for the noncovered pension and Social Security benefits must be after December 31, 1985 for WEP to apply. WEP reduces the Social Security PIA upon which SSA benefits are based and affects all benefits paid on that record, except survivors. The WEP reduction ceases when entitlement to the pension payment ends, the wage earner dies, or the wage earner earns a total of 30 years of substantial Social Security earnings. The WEP reduction amount is never more than one-half of the noncovered pension. A WEP PIA is generally based on 40 percent of the first bend point instead of 90 percent as with the regular PIA: Example: A retired worker with a noncovered pension of $2,000 a month and less than 20 years of covered employment attains age 62 in 2002. 0  Normal PIA, based on AIME of $800. $592 x .90 = $532.80 $208 x .32 = $66.56 PIA = $599.30 WEP PIA, based on AIME of $800. $592 x .40 = $236.80 $208 x .32 = $66.56 PIA = $303.30 If a worker has more than 20 years of substantial covered earnings, the WEP PIA begins to increase. With the 21st year of substantial covered earnings, the first bend point percentage is increased by 5 percentage points. This rate of increase applies for each additional year of substantial covered earnings, through the 30th year of substantial earnings at which point WEP no longer applies. After 23 years of substantial coverage, for example, the first bend point percentage would be 55 percent. Thirty years of substantial earnings would yield a first bend point percentage of 90 percent (the normal percentage of the first bend point). Examples of pensions subject to WEP are U.S. Civil Service Retirement System annuities, retirement benefits based on foreign earnings, and state and local pensions based on noncovered earnings. Table 2.A11.1 provides more detail about the WEP computation and contains the amounts of substantial earnings for years after 1990. Substantial earnings for earlier years are listed in Table 2.A12. Family maximum provisions. Monthly benefits payable to the worker and family members or to the worker's survivors are subject to a maximum family benefit amount. The family maximum level for retired-worker families or survivor families usually ranges from 150 percent to 188 percent of the worker's PIA. The maximum benefit for disabled-worker families is the smaller of 85 percent of AIME (or 100 percent of PIA, if larger) or 150 percent of the PIA. Like the formula for determining the PIA, the maximum family benefit formula applicable to a worker depends on the year of first eligibility (that is, the year of attainment of age 62, onset of disability, or death). Once the worker's maximum family benefit amount for the year of first eligibility is determined, it is updated in line with the COLAs. For information on family maximum provisions, as described here, see Table 2.A13 (comparison of family maximums to the PIAs on which they are based), and Table 2.A14 (disability family maximums). Table 2.A17 shows the maximum family benefit amounts applicable in cases of first eligibility before 1979.  14  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2002   Social Security  Benefit Types and Levels Retired and Disabled Workers The full retirement age (FRA) is the earliest age at which an unreduced retirement benefit is payable (sometimes referred to as the ""normal retirement age""). The age for full retirement benefits is scheduled to rise gradually from age 65 to age 67, with the first incremental increase affecting workers who reached age 62 in the year 2000. Workers over age 62 who retire before FRA can receive reduced benefits. The monthly rate of reduction from the full retirement benefit (that is, the PIA) is 5/9 of 1 percent a month for the first 36 months immediately preceding FRA. The reduction rate is 5/12 of 1 percent a month for any additional months. The maximum overall reduction for early retirement will have risen from 20 percent to 30 percent by 2022, when age 67 becomes the full retirement age. If a disabled worker receives a reduced retirement benefit for months before disability entitlement, the disability benefit is reduced by the number of months for which he or she received the reduced benefit. For workers who postpone their retirement beyond the full retirement age, benefits are increased for each month of nonpayment beyond that age and age 70. This increase is called a ""delayed retirement credit,"" and is potentially available for any or all months following attainment of the full retirement age (maximum of 60 months for persons who attained age 65 prior to 2003). The annual rate of increase for delayed retirement credits is 7 percent for workers who reach age 62 in 2001 and 2002, and will eventually rise to 8 percent for workers reaching age 62 in 2005 or later. Spouses and Children of Workers Spouses receive 50 percent of the worker's PIA (regardless of the worker's actual benefit amount), if the spouse has attained the full retirement age at entitlement to spousal benefits. The spouse of a retired or disabled worker can elect monthly benefits as early as age 62. These benefits are reduced at the rate of 25/36 of 1 percent a month for the first 36 months immediately preceding FRA and 5/12 of 1 percent for each additional month. The maximum overall reduction for early retirement will have risen from 25 percent to 35 percent by 2022, when age 67 becomes the full retirement age (FRA) for spouses attaining age 62 in that year. Children of retired or disabled workers are also eligible to receive monthly benefits. The term ""child"" refers to a child under the age of 18, a child aged 1819 attending elementary or secondary school full time, or to an adult child, aged 18 or older, who was disabled prior to age 22. In addition, young spouses (that is, those under the age of 62) who care for a worker's entitled child may also be eligible. For purposes of defining young spouses' benefits, the term  ""child"" refers to a child under age 16, or to an adult child of the worker who was disabled prior to age 22. Children of retired or disabled workers can receive up to 50 percent of the worker's PIA, as can young spouses. (The benefit of a young spouse is not reduced for age.) Monthly benefits payable to the spouse and children of a retired or disabled worker are limited to a family maximum amount, as discussed earlier. Benefits are payable to unmarried divorced spouses of retirement age who were married at least 10 years to the worker. A divorced spouse benefit is excluded from family maximum provisions. Divorced spouses age 62 or older and divorced for 2 or more years (after marriage of 10 or more years) may be independently entitled on the record of the ex-spouse if the ex-spouse could be entitled if he or she applied. Survivors Benefits Widows and widowers of fully insured workers are eligible for unreduced benefits at full retirement age (FRA), currently age 65. As with retired workers and spouses, widow(er)s' FRA will gradually increase to age 67. Widows and widowers can elect reduced monthly benefits at age 60 or, if disabled, as early as age 50. Surviving divorced spouses can also receive benefits if married to the worker for at least 10 years and not remarried before age 60 (age 50 if disabled). For survivors whose full benefit retirement age is 65, the monthly rate of reduction for the first 60 months immediately preceding FRA is 19/40 of 1 percent of the worker's PIA, with a maximum reduction of 28.5 percent at age 60. For survivors whose full benefit retirement age is over 65, the amount of reduction for each month prior to FRA is adjusted accordingly to ensure that the maximum reduction at age 60 remains 28.5 percent of the worker's PIA. Benefits for widows and widowers are increased if the deceased worker delayed retirement beyond the FRA. In these cases, the survivor benefits include any delayed retirement credits the deceased worker had earned. Conversely, if the worker had elected early retirement, widow(er)s' benefits are limited for widow(er)s first entitled to survivors benefits at age 62 or later. For these beneficiaries, the benefit is the higher of 82.5 percent of the worker's PIA or the amount the worker would be receiving if still alive. Disabled widow(er)s ages 5060 receive the age 60 widow's rate (71.5 percent of PIA) regardless of their age at the time of entitlement. Children of deceased workers and mothers and fathers under FRA are eligible to receive monthly benefits up to 75 percent of the worker's PIA if the worker died either fully or currently insured. Mothers and fathers must be caring for the worker's entitled child who is either under age 16 or disabled. A dependent parent aged 62 or older is eligible for monthly benefits equal to 82.5 percent of the worker's PIA. Each of two dependent parents can qualify for benefits  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2002  15   Social Security equal to 75 percent of the deceased worker's PIA. Monthly benefits payable to survivors are reduced to conform to the family maximum benefit payable on the deceased worker's account. Benefits for a surviving divorced spouse, however, are disregarded when computing the maximum family benefit. See Table 2.A20 for more information on the increases in the full (or normal) retirement age for workers. Table 2.A21 describes age-related reductions for dependent beneficiaries, as does Table 2.A22 (widow(er)s). Additionally, Tables 2.A23 and 2.A24 show the history of legislation relating to special monthly benefits payable to certain persons born before January 2, 1900. Table 2.A25 summarizes the history of certain OASDI benefits other than monthly benefit payments. Table 2.A26 presents illustrative monthly benefit amounts for selected beneficiary families, based on hypothetical earnings histories representing five different earnings levels. Table 2.A27 shows minimum and maximum monthly benefits payable to retired workers retiring at age 62 in various years beginning with 1957 (the first full year benefits became available at age 62). Table 2.A28 shows minimum and maximum monthly benefits payable to retired workers retiring at age 65 in various years beginning with 1940. Provisions for Railroad Retirement Board Beneficiaries The OASDI tables do not include a number of persons receiving Railroad Retirement benefits who would be eligible for Social Security benefits had they applied. The reason they have not applied is that receipt of a Social Security benefit would reduce their Railroad Retirement benefit by a like amount. The number of persons is not available, but is estimated to be less than 100,000. The Railroad Retirement Act of 1974, effective January 1, 1975, provided that the regular annuity for employees with 10 or more years of railroad service who retired after December 31, 1974, will consist of two components. Public Law 107-90 (the 2001 amendments to the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974) effective January 1, 2002 revised the railroad service work requirement. The railroad service work requirement is 10 or more years of railroad service or, effective January 1, 2002, have at least 5 years of railroad service after December 31, 1995. The two components are unchanged:  Tier 1. A basic Social Security level component equivalent to what would be paid under the Social Security Act on the basis of the employee's combined railroad and nonrailroad service, reduced by the amount of any monthly benefit under OASDI actually paid on the basis of nonrailroad work; and  Tier 2. A ""private pension"" component payable over and above the Social Security equivalent, calculated on the basis of the number of years of railroad service.  Effect of Current Earnings on Benefits Beneficiaries under the full retirement age (FRA) with earnings in excess of certain exempt amounts may have all or part of their benefits withheld as a result of the annual earnings test (AET) provisions of the Social Security Act. For those at or above FRA, however, there have been recent changes to AET provisions. Amendments in 1996 eased the impact of AET provisions, while changes in 2000 removed the AET altogether for beneficiaries aged 65 or older. Public Law 104- 121, enacted March 29, 1996, substantially raised the exempt amounts under the annual earnings test for persons who have reached full retirement age. These amounts are $12,500 in 1996; $13,500 in 1997; $14,500 in 1998; $15,500 in 1999; $17,000 in 2000; $25,000 in 2001; and $30,000 in 2002. Benefits are withheld at the rate of $1 in benefits for every $3 of earnings above the FRA exempt amount. Public Law 106-182, enacted April 7, 2000, eliminated the earnings test beginning with the month a beneficiary reaches FRA. The annual earnings test that applies in the year one attains FRA is based on the more generous annual limits established under P.L. 104-121 (including the $1 for $3 withholding rate). After 2002, the annual exempt amount will be indexed to the growth in average wages. In determining annual earnings for purposes of the annual earnings test, only earnings before the month of attainment of FRA will be counted. Public Laws 104-121 and 106-182 did not change the annual exempt amount for beneficiaries who are under FRA throughout the year. This annual amount continues to be pegged to increases in average wages. The amount was $10,680 in 2001, and is $11,280 in 2002. When the annual earnings limit affects working beneficiaries under FRA, benefits are withheld at the rate of $1 for every $2 of earnings above the exempt amount. Individuals have the option to receive reduced benefits under a monthly earnings test if it is to their advantage to do so. This option is usually exercised in the first year of retirement, because in that year the monthly test permits payment for some months even if the annual earnings limit is greatly exceeded. Under the monthly test, beneficiaries receive a full monthly benefit for months in which they do not earn over an amount equal to 1/12 of the annual earnings limit. The monthly earnings test is applied to the self-employed based on hours they work instead of monthly earnings. Generally, beneficiaries are eligible for the monthly earnings test in only one year.  16  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2002   Social Security Table 2.A29 provides historical detail on the retirement test. Beneficiaries entitled on the basis of their own disability--disabled workers, disabled adult children, and disabled widow(er)s--are not subject to the earnings test. Substantial earnings by disabled beneficiaries, however, may indicate that they are able to do work which constitutes substantial gainful activity (SGA) and are therefore no longer disabled. Although other factors are considered, numerical earnings thresholds are used in a determination of SGA. Table 2.A30 provides historical thresholds for determining substantial gainful activity (SGA). Table 2.A31 shows the history of provisions related to taxation of Social Security benefits. Table 2.A32 offers examples to illustrate when benefits are taxable and the amount subject to taxation. CONTACT: Curt Pauzenga (410) 965-7210 or Joseph Bondar (410) 965-0162.  Taxation of Benefits Up to 85 percent of Social Security benefits may be subject to federal income tax depending on the beneficiary's income, marital status, and filing status. The definition of income for this provision is as follows: Adjusted gross income (before Social Security or Railroad Retirement benefits are considered), plus tax-exempt interest income, with further modification of adjusted gross income in some cases involving certain tax provisions of limited applicability among the beneficiary population; plus onehalf of Social Security and Tier 1 Railroad Retirement benefits. For married beneficiaries filing jointly with adjusted gross income under $32,000 a year, no Social Security benefits are subject to taxation. If adjusted gross income exceeds $32,000 but is under $44,000, the amount of benefits included in gross income is the lesser of one-half of income over $32,000. If a couple's adjusted gross income exceeds $44,000, the amount of benefits included in gross income is 85 percent of income over $44,000 plus the lesser of $6,000 or one-half of benefits. However, no more than 85 percent of benefits are subject to income tax. The income thresholds for single beneficiaries are $25,000 and $32,000. If members of a married couple are filing separately, they do not have a minimum threshold if they lived together any time during the tax year. The amount of benefits included in gross income is the lesser of 85 percent of Social Security or Tier 1 Railroad Retirement benefits, or 85 percent of all income as defined above. Like all matters dealing with tax liability, taxation of Social Security benefits fall under the jurisdiction of the Internal Revenue Service.  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2002  17   Supplemental Security Income The Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program, provides income support to persons aged 65 or older, blind or disabled adults, and blind or disabled children. Eligibility requirements and federal payment standards are nationally uniform. The 2002 federal SSI benefit rate for an individual living in his or her own household and with no other countable income is $545 monthly; for a couple (with both husband and wife eligible), the SSI benefit rate is $817 monthly. Payments under SSI began in January 1974 . It replaced the former federal-state adult assistance programs in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Under SSI each eligible person is provided a monthly cash payment based on a statutory federal benefit rate. Since 1975, these rates have been increased by the same percentage, as the cost-of-living increases in OASDI benefits. If an individual or couple is living in another person's household and is receiving both food and shelter from the person in whose household they are living, the federal benefit rate is reduced by one-third. This is done instead of determining the actual dollar value of the in-kind support and maintenance. For institutionalized persons, the eligibility requirements and payment standards depend on the type of institution. With some exceptions, inmates of public institutions are ineligible for SSI. For persons institutionalized for a complete calendar month, a maximum federal SSI payment of $30 per month applies where (1) the institution receives a substantial part of the cost of the person's care from the Medicaid program, or (2) recipients under age 18 whose private health insurance is making payments to the institution,. Other eligible persons in institutions may receive up to the full federal benefit rate. The federal payment is based on the individual's countable income. The first $20 monthly in OASDI benefits or other earned or unearned income is not counted. Also excluded is $65 monthly of earnings plus one-half of any earnings above $65. For example, a person living in his or her own household, whose sole income is a $200 monthly OASDI benefit, would receive $365 in federal SSI payments: $545 - ($200 - $20) = ($545 - $180) = $365. A person whose income consists of $500 in gross monthly earnings would receive $337.50 in federal SSI payments: $545 - (($500 - $85) / 2) = $207.50 countable earnings FBR $545 -$207.50 = $337.50 federal SSI Individuals generally are not eligible for SSI if they have resources in excess of $2,000 (or $3,000 for a couple). Certain resources are excluded, most commonly a home, an automobile, and household goods and personal effects of reasonable value. States have the option to supplement the federal SSI payment for all or selected categories of persons, regardless of previous state program eligibility. CONTACT: Lenna D.

Aged: Any person aged 65 or older. Blind: Any person with 20/200 or less vision in the better eye with the use of correcting lenses, or with tunnel vision of 20 degrees or less. An individual transferred from a state Aid to the Blind (AB) program is eligible if he/she received such state aid in December 1973 and continues to meet the October 1972 state definition of blindness. Disabled: Any person unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment expected to result in death or that has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of at least 12 months. For a child under age 18, eligibility is based on disability of severity comparable with that of an adult. An individual transferred from a state Aid to the Permanently and Totally Disabled (APTD) program to SSI is also eligible if he/she received such state aid in December 1973 and continues to meet the October 1972 state definition of disability. 1973 Public Law 93-233, enacted December 31 1980 Public Law 96-265, enacted June 9 Only persons who had received APTD before July 1973 and were on the rolls in December 1973 may receive SSI on the basis of the state definition of disability; those who became eligible for state aid from July to December 1973 must meet the federal definition of disability. A disabled recipient who loses federal SSI eligibility because of earnings at the substantial gainful activity level may continue to receive a special benefit under section 1619 and retain eligibility for Medicaid under title XIX of the Social Security Act. This special benefit status may continue as long as the recipient has the disabling impairment and meets all nondisability SSI eligibility criteria. States have the option of supplementing this special benefit. This provision of the law was in effect from January 1, 1981, through December 31, 1983. Beginning in January 1984, under a 1-year demonstration project, this provision was continued for persons already eligible for either regular SSI payments or special monthly benefits. 1984 Public Law 98-460, enacted October 9 1986 Public Law 99-643, enacted November 10 The special benefit and Medicaid provisions of the 1980 legislation were extended through June 30, 1987 (retroactive to January 1, 1984). The special benefit and Medicaid provisions of the 1980 amendments are made permanent. The provisions were amended effective July 1, 1987, with significant modifications to simplify administration and to allow free movement between regular SSI disability payments and either the special cash benefit or Medicaid eligibility under section 1619. The distinction between a disabled person eligible for regular SSI payments and one eligible for 1619(a) is that the latter has several months with gross earnings above the SGA level. Previously, section 1619(a) status required completion of a trial work period and the determination that the work was SGA. For individuals under age 18, the ""comparable severity"" standard is eliminated and replaced with a requirement that a child be considered disabled if he/she has a medically determinable impairment that results in ""marked and severe functional limitations,"" and meets the  1996 Public Law 104-193, enacted August 22  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2002  19   SSI: History of Provisions existing statutory duration requirement. The law also eliminates references to ""maladaptive behaviors"" in the Listing of Impairments for children, and discontinues the use of individualized functional assessments for children. SSI eligibility is prohibited for an individual in any month during which such an individual is a fugitive felon, fleeing prosecution, or violating state or federal conditions of probation or parole. In addition, SSI eligibility is prohibited for 10 years for those convicted of fraudulently claiming residence to obtain benefits simultaneously in two or more states.a  Other Eligibility Provisions Citizenship and Residence 1972 Public Law 92-603, enacted October 30 The individual must reside within izen or an alien lawfully admitted United States under color of law. dar month lose their eligibility for one of the 50 states or the District of Columbia and be a citfor permanent residence or permanently residing in the Persons living outside the United States for an entire calensuch a month.  1976 Public Law 94-241, enacted March 24 1980 Public Law 96-265, enacted June 9  Eligibility for SSI is extended to residents of the Northern Mariana Islands, effective January 9, 1978. The income and resources of the immigration sponsors of aliens applying for SSI are considered in determining eligibility for and the amount of payment. After allowances for the needs of the sponsor and his/her family, the remainder is deemed available for the support of the alien applicant for a 3-year period after admission to the United States for permanent residence. This provision does not apply to those who become blind or disabled after admission, to refugees, or to persons granted political asylum. (See ""Deeming of Income and Resources"" on page 30 for subsequent changes to sponsor-to-alien deeming provisions.) SSI eligibility is continued for a disabled or blind child who was receiving SSI benefits while living in the United States and is now living with a parent who is a member of the U.S. armed forces assigned to permanent duty ashore outside the United States, but not where the parent is stationed in Puerto Rico or the territories and possessions of the United States. Above provision made applicable where the parent is a member of the U.S. armed forces and stationed in Puerto Rico or the territories and possessions of the United States. Prohibits SSI eligibility for anyone who is not a U.S. citizen or national unless they are in a ""qualified alien"" category and meet one of certain exceptions such as lawful permanent residents who earn or can be credited with 40 qualifying quarters of earnings, certain refugee type categories eligible for up to 5 years of time-limited eligibility, or active duty U.S. military or veterans and their spouses and children. Extends eligibility for aliens receiving SSI as of August 22, 1996 (the enactment date of the law) for 1 year after the enactment date for those aliens found ineligible under the new standards.  1989 Public Law 101-239, enacted December 19  1993 Public Law 103-66, enacted August 10 1996 Public Law 104-193, enacted August 22  a  This last provision was repealed in 1999 by Public Law 106-169 and replaced with a provision providing for nonpayment of benefits for up to 24 months for making false or misleading statements regarding material facts.  20  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2002   SSI: History of Provisions Public Law 104-208, enacted September 30 1997 Public Law 105-18, enacted June 12 Public Law 105-33, enacted August 5 Amends Public Law 104-193 to add to the list of ""qualified aliens"" certain noncitizens (and their children) who have been battered or subjected to extreme cruelty by a spouse or parent or a member of the spouse's or parent's family living in the same household. Extends eligibility for aliens receiving SSI as of August 22, 1996, until September 30, 1997, for those found ineligible under the new alien standards of Public Law 104-193. Further amends Public Law 104-193 to add Cuban and Haitian entrants, and the child of a parent who has been battered or subjected to extreme cruelty, to the list of qualified aliens. Provides that Cuban and Haitian entrants and Amerasian immigrants qualify for time limited eligibility, and increases the time limit from 5 to 7 years for all time-limited categories. Additional exceptions are added for qualified aliens: (1) lawfully residing in the United States and receiving SSI benefits on August 22, 1996; and (2) lawfully residing in the United States on August 22, 1996 and meeting the definition of blind or disabled in the Social Security Act. Certain noncitizen American Indians are excepted from the alien nonpayment provisions of Public Law 104-193. Extends eligibility for ""nonqualified aliens"" receiving SSI as of August 22, 1996, until September 30, 1998. 1998 Public Law 105-306, enacted October 28 2000 Public Law 106-386, enacted October 28 Permanently extends eligibility of all remaining ""nonqualified aliens"" who were receiving SSI benefits when Public Law 104-193 was enacted on August 22, 1996. Noncitizens, regardless of their immigration status, may be eligible for SSI to the same extent as refugees, if they are determined to be victims of ""severe forms of trafficking in persons.""  Other Benefits 1980 Public Law 96-272, enacted June 17 SSI applicants and recipients are not required as a condition of eligibility to elect to receive Veterans Administration pensions under the Veterans and Survivors' Pension Improvement Act of 1978 if the state of residence lacks a medically needy program under title XIX.  Drug Addiction and Alcoholism (DA&A) 1972 Public Law 92-603, enacted October 30 Any disabled individual who has been medically determined to be an alcoholic or drug addict must accept appropriate treatment, if available, in an approved facility and demonstrate compliance with conditions and requirements for treatment. SSI payments are required to be made through a representative payee--another person or public or private agency designated by SSA to manage the recipient's benefit on his/her behalf. 1994 Public Law 103-296, enacted August 15 Any individual who is receiving SSI based on a disability where drug addiction or alcoholism is a contributing factor material to the finding of disability must comply with the DA&A treatment requirements. The individual must accept appropriate treatment when it is available and comply with the conditions and terms of treatment. Instances of noncompliance with the requirements result in progressively longer payment suspensions. Before payments can resume, the individual must demonstrate compliance for specific periods; 2 months, 3 months, and 6 months, respectively, for the first, second, third and subsequent instances of noncompliance. An individual who is not in compliance with the DA&A treatment require-  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2002  21   SSI: History of Provisions ments for 12 consecutive months shall not be eligible for payments; however, this does not prevent such individuals from reapplying and again becoming eligible for payments. SSI disability payments based on DA&A are also limited to a total of 36 benefit months (beginning March 1995) regardless of whether appropriate treatment is available. Months for which benefits are not due and received do not count towards the 36-month limit. Payments based on DA&A must be made to a representative payee. Preference is required to be given to community based nonprofit social service agencies and federal, state, or local government agencies in representative payee selection. These agencies when serving as payees for individuals receiving payments based on DA&A may retain the lesser of 10 percent of the monthly benefit or $57 (indexed to the consumer price index (CPI)) as compensation for their services. Establishment of one or more referral and monitoring agencies for each state is required. 1996 Public Law 104-121, enacted March 29 An individual is not considered disabled if DA&A is a contributing factor material to a finding of disability. Applies DA&A representative payee requirements enacted under Public Law 103-296 to disabled SSI recipients who have a DA&A condition and are incapable of managing their benefits. In addition, these recipients shall be referred to the appropriate state agency administering the state plan for substance abuse treatment.  Institutionalization 1972 Public Law 92-603, enacted October 30 An individual who is an inmate of a public institution is ineligible for SSI payments unless the institution is a facility approved for Medicaid payments and is receiving such payments on behalf of the person. Under regulations, the Medicaid payment must represent more than 50 percent of the cost of services provided by the facility to the individual. An inmate of a publicly operated community residence serving no more than 16 persons may, if otherwise eligible, receive SSI. Payments may be made to persons who are residents of public emergency shelters for the homeless for a period of up to 3 months in any 12-month period. Effective July 1, 1987, disabled or blind recipients who were receiving special SSI payments or had special SSI recipient status under section 1619 in the month preceding the first full month of institutionalization, may receive payments based on the full federal benefit rate for the initial 2 full months of institutionalization, if they reside in certain public medical, psychiatric or Medicaid facilities, or in private Medicaid facilities. Effective January 1, 1988, payments may be made to persons who are residents of public emergency shelters for the homeless, for up to 6 months in a 9-month period. Effective July 1, 1988, continued payment of SSI benefits for up to 3 months is permitted, at the rate that was applicable in the month prior to the first full month of institutionalization, for individuals whose expected institutional stay on admission is not likely to exceed 3 months, as certified by a physician, and for whom the receipt of benefits is necessary to maintain living arrangements to which they may return.  1976 Public Law 94-566, enacted October 20 1983 Public Law 98-21, enacted April 20 1986 Public Law 99-643, enacted November 10  1987 Public Law 100-203, enacted December 22  22  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2002   SSI: History of Provisions 1996 Public Law 104-193, enacted August 22  Effective December 1996, institutionalized children under age 18 whose private health insurance is making payments to the institution may receive no more than $30 per month in federal SSI.  Vocational Rehabilitation and Treatment 1972 Public Law 92-603, enacted October 30 1976 Public Law 94-566, enacted October 20 Blind or disabled individuals receiving federal SSI benefits who are under age 65, must be referred to the state agency providing services under the Vocational Rehabilitation Act and must accept the services offered. States are reimbursed for the cost of services. Blind or disabled children under age 16 must be referred to the state agency administering crippled children's services or to another agency designated by the state. States are reimbursed for the cost of services. Of funds provided for these services, at least 90 percent must be used for children under age 6 or for those who have never attended public schools. 1980 Public Law 96-265, enacted June 9 Disabled SSI recipients who medically recover while enrolled in approved vocational rehabilitation programs of state VR agencies, may continue to receive benefits during their participation in such programs if the Commissioner of Social Security determines that continuation in the program will increase the probability that they leave the rolls permanently. Funding no longer provided under title XVI for medical, social, developmental and rehabilitative services to disabled or blind children. Reimbursement for the cost of rehabilitation services will be made if the services result in the recipient's return to work. 1984 Public Law 98-460, enacted October 9 Authorizes the reimbursement of states for the cost of VR services provided to individuals who (1) continue to receive benefits after medical recovery because they are participating in a state VR program or (2) refuse, without good cause, to continue in or cooperate with the VR program in which they had been participating. Provision for continuation of payments to SSI recipients who have medically recovered while enrolled in an approved vocational rehabilitation program extended to blind SSI recipients. Reimbursement authorized for the cost of vocational rehabilitation services provided in months in which the individual was not receiving federal SSI payments, if:  1981 Public Law 97-35, enacted August 13  1987 Public Law 100-203, enacted December 22 1990 Public Law 101-508, enacted November 5   SSI recipient status for Medicaid eligibility purposes was retained under work incentive provisions, or   Benefits were in suspense b status (for a reason other than cessation of disability or blindness), or   Federally administered state supplementation was received.  b  Recipients who have lost eligibility for SSI benefits for fewer than 13 consecutive months are in suspended payment status.  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2002  23   SSI: History of Provisions Extends the provision providing for benefit continuation to SSI recipients who medically recover while participating in a state VR program to include SSI recipients participating in a non-state VR program. 1999 Public Law 106-170, enacted December 17 Establishes a Ticket to Work and Self-Sufficiency program which will provide SSI (and OASDI) disability beneficiaries with a ticket that can be used to obtain vocational rehabilitation services, employment services, or other support services, from an employment network of their choice.  Continuing Disability Reviews and Eligibility Redeterminations 1994 Public Law 103-296, enacted August 15 During each of fiscal years 1996, 1997, and 1998, requires SSA to conduct continuing disability reviews (CDRs) on a minimum of 100,000 SSI recipients. In addition, during the same period, requires SSA to redetermine the SSI eligibility of at least one-third of all childhood SSI recipients who reach age 18 after April 1995 during the 1-year period following attainment of age 18. Redeterminations for persons turning age 18 could count toward the 100,000 CDR requirement. Repeals the requirement that SSA redetermine the eligibility of at least one-third of all childhood SSI recipients who reach age 18 after April 1995 during the 1-year period following attainment of age 18. Requires a CDR:  1996 Public Law 104-193, enacted August 22   At least once every 3 years for SSI recipients under age 18 who are eligible by reason of an impairment which is likely to improve, and   Not later than 12 months after birth for recipients whose low birth weight is a contributing factor material to the determination of their disability. Requires eligibility redetermination for all childhood SSI recipients eligible for the month before the month in which they attain age 18. Requires redetermination of eligibility for children considered disabled based on an individual functional assessment and/or consideration of maladaptive behavior. Requires the representative payee of a childhood disability recipient whose continuing eligibility is being reviewed to present evidence that the recipient is receiving treatment which is considered medically necessary and available for the condition which was the basis for providing SSI benefits. 1997 Public Law 105-33, enacted August 5 Modifies provision of Public Law 104-193 to extend from 12 to 18 months the period for redetermining the disability of children under age 18 under the new childhood disability standard. Modifies provision of Public Law 104-193 to permit SSA to schedule a CDR for a disabled child for whom low birth weight is a contributing factor material to the determination of disability, at a date after the child's first birthday if the Commissioner determines the impairment is not expected to improve within 12 months of the child's birth. Modifies provision of Public Law 104-193 to provide SSA the authority to make redeterminations of disabled childhood recipients who attain age 18, more than 1 year after the date such recipient attains age 18. 1999 Public Law 106-170, enacted December 17 Prohibits the initiation of a CDR during the period that a recipient is ""using a ticket"" under the Ticket to Work program.  24  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2002   SSI: History of Provisions  Deeming of Income and Resources 1972 Public Law 92-603, enacted October 30 Deeming occurs when the income and resources of certain family members living in the same household with the SSI recipient are considered in determining the amount of the SSI payment. These family members are the ineligible spouse of an adult recipient and the ineligible parents of a child recipient under age 21. After deduction of personal allocations for the spouse (or parents) and for ineligible children in the home, and after application of income exclusions, any remaining income of the spouse (or parents) is added to the income of the eligible person. 1980 Public Law 96-265, enacted June 9 1989 Public Law 101-239, enacted December 19 Children aged 18 or older are not subject to parental deeming. Sponsor 's income and resources deemed to an alien for 3 years. Disabled children receiving home care services under state Medicaid programs, who are ineligible for SSI because of deeming of parental income, and who received SSI benefits limited to $30 while in a medical treatment facility, may receive the $30 monthly allowance that would be payable if the recipient were institutionalized. Sponsor-to-alien deeming period extended from 3 years to 5 years, effective January 1, 1994, through September 30, 1996. Considers an ineligible spouse or parent who is absent from the household due to active military service to be a member of the household for deeming purposes. 1996 Public Law 104-193, enacted August 22 Deeming of income and resources from an immigration sponsor to a noncitizen continues until citizenship, with exceptions for those who earn, or can be credited with, 40 qualifying quarters of earnings. Effective for those whose sponsor signs a new legally enforceable affidavit of support. Amends Public Law 104-193 to add two exceptions to the sponsor-to-alien deeming:  1993 Public Law 103-152, enacted November 24  Public Law 104-208, enacted September 30   Provides that if the noncitizen is indigent and would be unable to obtain food and shelter without SSI benefits even after receiving support from the sponsor, then only the amount of income and resources actually provided by the sponsor will be counted for a 12-month period after a determination of indigence; and   Provides that in certain cases, deeming would not apply for a 12-month period (with some options for extension) if the noncitizen (or his/her children) has been battered, or subjected to extreme cruelty by family members. 1997 Public Law 105-33, enacted August 5 Amends Public Law 104-208 to add an additional exception to sponsor-to-alien deeming when the parent of a noncitizen has been battered or subjected to extreme cruelty by family members.  Federal Benefit Payments Federal Benefit Rates Basic benefit standards are used in computing the amount of federal SSI payments. Benefit levels differ for individuals and couples living in households and for persons in Medicaid institutions. Individuals or couples living in their own households receive the full federal benefit. If an individual or couple is living in another person's household and receiving support and  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2002  25   SSI: History of Provisions maintenance there, the federal benefit is reduced by one-third. The federal benefit rates for persons in households are increased annually to reflect increases in the cost of living. Legislation affecting the level of federal benefit rates since the inception of the SSI program are summarized in table 2.B1.  Windfall Offset 1980 Public Law 96-265, enacted June 9 1984 Public Law 98-617, enacted November 8 Offset (by reduction of retroactive Social Security benefits) to prevent persons whose initial OASDI payment is retroactive from receiving more in total benefits for the same period than if they were paid the benefits when regularly due. Offset provision expanded to allow for reduction of retroactive SSI benefits and to apply in cases of OASDI benefit reinstatement.  Proration of Benefit 1982 Public Law 97-248, enacted September 3 1996 Public Law 104-193, enacted August 22 Benefit for first month of eligibility to be prorated by the number of days in the month for which an application has been filed and there is eligibility. Changes the effective date of an SSI application to the first day of the month following the date on which the application was filed or on which the individual first becomes eligible, whichever is later. This, in effect, eliminates prorated payments in initial claims.  Retrospective Monthly Accounting 1981 Public Law 97-35, enacted August 13 1984 Public Law 98-369, enacted July 18 1987 Public Law 100-203, enacted December 22 Changes the method of computing the SSI benefit to one under which the benefit amount is computed on a monthly basis and is based on income and other characteristics in the previous (or second previous) month. Changes the method of computing the SSI benefit to persons receiving title II payments. The effect of the increased title II income at the time of the cost-of-living increase is not delayed as it otherwise would be. Provides an exception to retrospective monthly accounting so that amounts received under Aid to Families With Dependent Children (AFDC), foster care, refugee cash assistance, Cuban-Haitian entrant assistance, or general and child welfare assistance provided by the Bureau of Indian Affairs are counted only in the month received. Changes the method of computing the SSI benefit to persons receiving the value of the onethird reduction. The effect of the increased value at the time of the cost-of-living increase is not delayed as it otherwise would be. Effective January 1995.  1993 Public Law 103-66, enacted August 10  Uncashed Checks 1981 Public Law 97-35, enacted August 13 States that have federally administered supplements to be credited their share of SSI checks that remain unnegotiated for 180 days.  26  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2002   SSI: History of Provisions 1987 Public Law 100-86, enacted August 10  SSI checks now unnegotiable after 1 year. States are credited their share of SSI checks after 1 year rather than 180 days.  Rounding of Payment Amounts 1982 Public Law 97-248, enacted September 3 Cost-of-living adjustments in the federal SSI benefit and income eligibility levels are to be rounded to the next lower whole dollar, after the adjustment is calculated. Subsequent costof-living adjustments will be calculated on the previous year 's benefit standard before rounding.  Penalties Resulting in Nonpayment of Benefits for False or Misleading Statements 1999 Public Law 106-169, enacted December 14 Provides for the nonpayment of OASDI and for the first, second, and third or subsequen statement or representation of material fact the individual knew, or should have known, fact.

Earned income tax credit treated as earned income (temporarily excluded from 1975 through 1980). Remunerations received in sheltered workshops and work activity centers are considered earned income and qualify for earned income exclusions. Impairment-related work expenses paid by the individual (including cost for attendant care, medical equipment, drugs, and services necessary to control an impairment) are deducted from earnings when determining if an individual is engaging in substantial gainful activity. Impairment-related work expenses are excluded in calculating income for benefit purposes if initial eligibility for benefits exists on the basis of countable income without applying this exclusion. 1981 Public Law 97-35, enacted August 13 1982 Public Law 97-377, enacted December 21 1983 Public Law 97-424, enacted January 6 Modifies provision under which irregularly or infrequently received income is excluded to conform to change from quarterly to monthly accounting; amounts excludable: $20 or less of unearned income and $10 of earned income in a month.

Presumptive payment provision was extended to persons applying on the basis of blindness.  Extends the period for receipt of payments to 6 months.  Emergency Advance Payments 1972 Public Law 92-603, enacted October 30 1987 Public Law 100-203, enacted December 22 1996 Public Law 104-193, enacted August 22 Any applicant who can be presumed to meet the criteria of eligibility, but has not yet been determined eligible, and who is faced with a financial emergency may receive an immediate cash advance of up to $100. Increases the maximum emergency advance payment amount to the maximum amount of the regular federal SSI monthly benefit rate, plus, if any, the federally administered state supplementary payment. Applicants who have a financial emergency may receive an emergency advance payment in the month of application, which, effective with this law, is always prior to the first month of eligibility. These advance payments are recouped by proportional reductions in the recipient's first 6 months of SSI benefits.  Interim Assistance Reimbursement 1974 Public Law 93-368, enacted August 7 1976 Public Law 94-365, enacted July 14 1987 Public Law 100-203, enacted December 22 SSA may enter into agreements with the states to repay them directly for assistance payments made to an SSI applicant while his/her claim is being adjudicated.

Extends interim assistance reimbursement to situations in which payments are made by states or political subdivisions to persons whose SSI payments were suspended or terminated and who subsequently are found to be eligible for such benefits. Also clarifies that the payment from which the interim assistance reimbursement is paid must be the first payment of benefits relating to the interim period.  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2002  33   SSI: History of Provisions  Medicaid Eligibility 1972 Public Law 92-603, enacted October 30 States can provide Medicaid coverage to all recipients of SSI payments. Alternatively, they can limit coverage by applying more restrictive criteria from the state Medicaid plan in effect on January 1, 1972. States can accept SSA determination of eligibility, or make their own determination. 1976 Public Law 94-566, enacted October 20 1980 Public Law 96-265, enacted June 9 Preserves the Medicaid eligibility of recipients who become ineligible for cash SSI payments due to the cost-of-living increases in Social Security benefits. Blind or disabled recipients under age 65 no longer eligible for either regular or special SSI payments because of their earnings may retain SSI recipient status for Medicaid eligibility purposes under the following conditions: (1) they continue to have the disabling impairment, (2) they meet all nondisability eligibility criteria except for earned income, (3) they would be seriously inhibited from continuing employment without Medicaid services, and (4) their earnings are insufficient to provide a reasonable equivalent of SSI payments and Medicaid. In states that do not provide Medicaid coverage categorically to all SSI recipients, qualification for Medicaid benefits depends on the state's specific eligibility and program requirements. The Medicaid provision of the 1980 legislation was in effect from January 1, 1981, through December 31, 1983. Under a 1-year demonstration project, beginning January 1, 1984, this provision was continued for persons already eligible for regular or special SSI payments or for retention of Medicaid eligibility. 1984 Public Law 98-460, enacted October 9 1986 Public Law 99-272, enacted April 7 Public Law 99-643, enacted November 10 Medicaid provision of 1980 legislation extended through June 30, 1987 (retroactive to January 1, 1984). Restores Medicaid eligibility for some disabled widow(er)s who became ineligible for SSI when their title II benefits increased in 1984 because of a change in the Social Security disabled widow(er)s benefits reduction factor. The SSI recipient status for Medicaid eligibility provision of the 1980 amendments is made permanent. Effective July 1, 1987, certain expenses are excluded from earnings when determining sufficiency of earnings to establish SSI recipient status eligibility for Medicaid purposes:       Impairment-related work expenses of disabled persons, Work expenses of blind persons, Income required for achieving an approved self-support plan, and The value of publicly funded attendant care services.  Effective July 1, 1987, preserves the Medicaid eligibility of recipients who become ineligible for SSI payments because of entitlement to, or an increase in, Social Security disabled adult child benefits on or after the effective date. Effective July 1, 1987, requires all states to provide Medicaid coverage for recipients in special SSI status (either receiving special SSI payments or in the special recipient status described for 1980) if they received Medicaid coverage the month before special SSI status.  34  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2002   SSI: History of Provisions 1987 Public Law 100-203, enacted December 22  Effective July 1, 1988, restores or preserves the Medicaid eligibility of persons aged 60 or older who are eligible for Social Security benefits as widows or widowers (but not eligible for Medicare) and who become ineligible for SSI payments or state supplementation because of the receipt of old-age or survivors insurance benefits under Social Security. Age limit for retention of SSI recipient status for Medicaid eligibility purposes (1980 and subsequent work incentive provisions, above) is eliminated. Preserves the Medicaid eligibility of SSI recipients who become ineligible for payments when they become entitled to Social Security disabled widow(er)s benefits following the revised definition used for their disability.  1990 Public Law 101-508, enacted November 5  1997 Public Law 105-33, enacted August 5  Requires states to continue Medicaid payments as of August 22, 1996 and except that their eligibility terminated disability standard established under  coverage for disabled children who were receiving SSI would have continued to be eligible for such payments because they did not meet the revised SSI childhood Public Law 104-193.  State Supplementation 1972 Public Law 92-603, enacted October 30 States are given the option of providing supplementary payments both to recipients transferred from the state program and to those newly eligible for SSI. States may either administer the payments themselves or have the Social Security Administration make payments on their behalf. When state supplementary payments are federally administered, the Social Security Administration makes eligibility and payment determinations for the state and assumes administrative costs. ""Hold harmless"" protection, which limits a state's fiscal liability to its share of OAA, AB, and APTD expenditures for calendar year 1972, is provided to states electing federal administration of their supplementary plans. This provision applies only to supplementary payments that do not, on the average, exceed a state's ""adjusted payment level."" (The adjusted payment level is the average of the payments that individuals with no other income received in January 1972; it may include the bonus value of food stamps. Adjustments are provided for payments that had been below state standards.) 1973 Public Law 93-66, enacted July 9 Provision is made for mandatory state supplementation as assurance against reduction of income for persons who received state assistance in December 1973 and were transferred to SSI. These supplementary payments must equal the difference between (1) the amount of the state assistance payment that the individual received in December 1973 plus other income and (2) his/her federal SSI payment plus other income. After June 30, 1977, when the federal SSI payment level is increased by a cost-of-living increase, such an increase will be excluded in calculating the ""hold harmless"" amount. Requires states to maintain state supplementation payments at the level of December 1976 (""maintenance of payments"") or to continue to pay in supplements the same total annual amounts (""maintenance of expenditures"") when the federal SSI payment level is increased and thereby pass through any increases in federal benefits without reducing state supplements.  1976 Public Law 94-585, enacted October 21  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2002  35   SSI: History of Provisions 1982 Public Law 97-248, enacted September 3 1983 Public Law 98-21, enacted April 20  Begins a 3-year phase out of ""hold harmless"" protection. Effective with fiscal year 1985, Wisconsin and Hawaii (the only remaining ""hold harmless"" states) assumed the full cost of their supplementary payments. Federal pass-through law is adjusted (1) by substituting the state supplementary payment levels in effect in March 1983 for those in effect in December 1976 as the levels that states must maintain in complying with the pass-through requirements, and (2) with regard to the $20 (individual) and $30 (couple) increase in the federal SSI standard in July 1983, by requiring states to pass through only as much as would have been required if the SSI cost-of-living adjustment had been made in July 1983. Provides for federal administration of state supplements to residents of medical institutions. Provides for required pass through of $5 increase in federal rate for persons whose care in institutions is paid in substantial part by Medicaid. Requires states to pay fees for federal administration of their state supplementation payments. The fees are $1.67 for each monthly supplementary payment in fiscal year 1994, $3.33 in fiscal year 1995, and $5.00 in fiscal year 1996. Fees for subsequent fiscal years will be $5.00 or another amount determined by the Commissioner to be appropriate. The Commissioner may charge the states additional fees for services they request that are beyond the level customarily provided in administering state supplementary payments. Revises the schedule of per-payment fees for federal administration of state supplementation for fiscal years 1998 ($6.20) through 2002 ($8.50) and provides a formula for determining the fee beyond fiscal year 2002. A state which has an agreement with SSA to administer its supplementation payments, must remit both payments and fees prior to the SSI payment date. Changes the effective date of above provision from 2009 to 2001.  1987 Public Law 100-203, enacted December 22  1993 Public Law 103-66, enacted August 10  1997 Public Law 105-33, enacted August 5 1999 Public Law 106-170, enacted December 17 2000 Public Law 106-554, enacted December 21  Overpayment Recovery 1984 Public Law 98-369, enacted July 18 Limits the rate of recovering overpayments from monthly payments to the lesser of: (1) the monthly payment, or (2) 10 percent of a recipient's monthly income. Permits a higher or lower adjustment at the request of the recipient subject to the agreement of the Commissioner. The limit does not apply if fraud, willful misrepresentation, or concealment of material information was involved on the part of the recipient or spouse in connection with the overpayment. Waives recovery of certain overpayments due to amount of excess resources of $50 or less. Provides temporary authority for the recovery of overpayments from tax refunds. 1988 Public Law 100-485, enacted October 13 Grants permanent authority to recover overpayments from tax refunds.  36  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2002   SSI: History of Provisions 1998 Public Law 105-306, enacted October 28 1999 Public Law 106-169, enacted December 14  Authorizes SSA to collect SSI overpayments by offsetting Social Security benefits, with a maximum monthly offset of no more than 10 percent of the Social Security benefit. Makes representative payees liable for an SSI overpayment caused by a payment made to a recipient who has died, and requires SSA to establish an overpayment control record under the representative payee's Social Security number. Requires SSA to recover SSI overpayments from SSI lump-sum amounts by withholding at least 50 percent of the lump-sum payment or the amount of the overpayment, whichever is less.

They should be used only as overviews and general guides to the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The views expressed herein do not necessarily reflect the policies or legal positions of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services or the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). These summaries do not render any legal, accounting, or other professional advice, nor are they intended to explain fully all of the provisions or exclusions of the relevant laws, regulations, and rulings of the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Original sources of authority should be researched and utilized. care-only coverage in federal, state, or local government employment are eligible beginning at age 65. Similarly, individuals who have been entitled to Social Security or Railroad Retirement disability benefits for at least 24 months, and government employees with Medicare-only coverage who have been disabled for more than 29 months, are entitled to HI benefits. HI coverage is also provided to insured workers with ESRD (and to insured workers' spouses and children with ESRD), as well as to some otherwise ineligible aged and disabled beneficiaries who voluntarily pay a monthly premium for their coverage. In 2001, the HI program provided protection against the costs of hospital and specific other medical care to almost 40 million people (34 million aged and 6 million disabled enrollees). HI benefit payments totaled $141.2 billion in 2001. The following health care services are covered under Medicare's HI program:  Inpatient hospital care coverage includes costs of a semi-private room, meals, regular nursing services, operating and recovery rooms, intensive care, inpatient prescription drugs, laboratory tests, X-rays, psychiatric hospitals, inpatient rehabilitation, and longterm care (LTC) hospitalization when medically necessary, as well as all other medically necessary services and supplies provided in the hospital. An initial deductible payment is required of beneficiaries who are admitted to a hospital, plus copayments for all hospital days following day 60 within a benefit period (described later).  Skilled nursing facility (SNF) care is covered by HI only if it follows within 30 days (generally) of a hospitalization of 3 days or more and is certified as medically necessary. Covered services are similar to those for inpatient hospital but also include rehabilitation services and appliances. The number of SNF days provided under Medicare is limited to 100 days per benefit period (described later), with a copayment required for days 21100. HI does not cover nursing facility care if the patient does not require skilled nursing or skilled rehabilitation services.  Home health agency (HHA) care is covered by both HI and SMI. The BBA transferred from HI to SMI those home health services furnished on or after January 1, 1998 that are unassociated with a hospital or skilled nursing facility stay. HI will continue to cover the first 100 visits following a 3-day hospital stay or a skilled nursing facility stay; SMI covers any visits thereafter. Home health care under HI and SMI has no copayment and no deductible. HHA care, including care provided by a home health aide, may be furnished part-time by a HHA in the residence of a home-bound beneficiary if intermittent or part-time skilled nursing and/or certain other therapy or rehabilitation  Overview Title XVIII of the Social Security Act, designated ""Health Insurance for the Aged and Disabled,"" is commonly known as Medicare. As part of the Social Security Amendments of 1965, the Medicare legislation established a health insurance program for aged persons to complement the retirement, survivors, and disability insurance benefits under Title II of the Social Security Act. When first implemented in 1966, Medicare covered most persons age 65 or older. In 1973, the following groups also became eligible for Medicare benefits: persons entitled to Social Security or Railroad Retirement disability cash benefits for at least 24 months, most persons with endstage renal disease (ESRD), and certain otherwise noncovered aged persons who elect to pay a premium for Medicare coverage. The Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Benefits Improvement and Protection Act of 2000 (Public Law 106-554) allowed persons with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (Lou Gehrig's Disease) to waive the 24-month waiting period. Medicare has traditionally consisted of two parts: Hospital Insurance (HI), also known as Part A, and Supplementary Medical Insurance (SMI), also known as Part B. A new, third part of Medicare, sometimes known as Part C, is the Medicare+Choice program, which was established by the Balanced Budget Act (BBA) of 1997 (Public Law 105-33) and which expanded beneficiaries' options for participation in private-sector health care plans. When Medicare began on July 1, 1966, approximately 19 million people enrolled. In 2002, over 40 million people are enrolled in one or both of Parts A and B of the Medicare program, and 5 million of them have chosen to participate in a Medicare+Choice plan.  Coverage HI is generally provided automatically, and free of premiums, to persons age 65 or older who are eligible for Social Security or Railroad Retirement benefits, whether they have claimed these monthly cash benefits or not. Also, workers and their spouses with a sufficient period of Medi-  38  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2002   Medicare care is necessary. Certain medical supplies and durable medical equipment (DME) may also be provided, though beneficiaries must pay a 20-percent coinsurance for DME, as required under SMI of Medicare. There must be a plan of treatment and periodical review by a physician. Full-time nursing care, food, blood, and drugs are not provided as HHA services.  Hospice care is a service provided to terminally ill persons with life expectancies of 6 months or less who elect to forgo the standard Medicare benefits for treatment of their illness and to receive only hospice care for it. Such care includes pain relief, supportive medical and social services, physical therapy, nursing services, and symptom management. However, if a hospice patient requires treatment for a condition that is not related to the terminal illness, Medicare will pay for all covered services necessary for that condition. The Medicare beneficiary pays no deductible for the hospice program, but does pay small coinsurance amounts for drugs and inpatient respite care. An important HI component is the benefit period, which starts when the beneficiary first enters a hospital and ends when there has been a break of at least 60 consecutive days since inpatient hospital or skilled nursing care was provided. There is no limit to the number of benefit periods covered by HI during a beneficiary's lifetime; however, inpatient hospital care is normally limited to 90 days during a benefit period, and copayment requirements (detailed later) apply for days 6190. If a beneficiary exhausts the 90 days of inpatient hospital care available in a benefit period, he or she can elect to use days of Medicare coverage from a non-renewable ""lifetime reserve"" of up to 60 (total) additional days of inpatient hospital care. Copayments are also required for such additional days. All citizens (and certain legal aliens) age 65 or older, and all disabled persons entitled to coverage under HI, are eligible to enroll in the SMI program on a voluntary basis by payment of a monthly premium. Almost all persons entitled to HI choose to enroll in SMI. In 2001, the SMI program provided protection against the costs of physician and other medical services to almost 38 million people (33 million aged and 5 million disabled). SMI benefits totaled $99.7 billion in 2001. The SMI program covers the following services and supplies:  Physicians' and surgeons' services, including some covered services furnished by chiropractors, podiatrists, dentists, and optometrists. Also covered are the services provided by these Medicare-approved practitioners who are not physicians: certified registered nurse anesthetists, clinical psychologists, clinical social workers (other than in a hospital or skilled nursing facility), physician assistants, and nurse practitioners and clinical nurse specialists in collaboration with a physician.  Services in an emergency room or outpatient clinic, including same-day surgery, and ambulance services.  Home health care not covered under HI.  Laboratory tests, X-rays, and other diagnostic radiology services, as well as certain preventive care screening tests.  Ambulatory surgical center services in a Medicareapproved facility.  Most physical and occupational therapy and speech pathology services.  Comprehensive outpatient rehabilitation facility services, and mental health care in a partial hospitalization psychiatric program, if a physician certifies that inpatient treatment would be required without it.  Radiation therapy, renal (kidney) dialysis and transplants, heart, lung, heart-lung, liver, pancreas, and bone marrow transplants, and, as of April 2001, intestinal transplants.  Approved durable medical equipment for home use, such as oxygen equipment and wheelchairs, prosthetic devices, and surgical dressings, splints, and casts.  Drugs and biologicals that cannot be self-administered, such as hepatitis B vaccines and immunosuppressive drugs (certain self-administered anticancer drugs are covered). To be covered, all services must be either medically necessary or one of several prescribed preventive benefits. SMI services are generally subject to a deductible and coinsurance (see next section). Certain medical services and related care are subject to special payment rules, including deductibles (for blood), maximum approved amounts (for Medicare-approved physical, speech, or occupational therapy services performed after 2002 in settings other than hospitals), and higher cost-sharing requirements (such as those for outpatient treatments for mental illness). It should be noted that some health care services are not covered by Medicare. Non-covered services include long-term nursing care, custodial care, and certain other health care needs, such as dentures and dental care, eyeglasses, hearing aids, and most prescription drugs. These services are not a part of the Medicare program unless they are a part of a private health plan under the Medicare+Choice program. Medicare+Choice (Part C) is an expanded set of options for the delivery of health care under Medicare. While all Medicare beneficiaries can receive their benefits through the original fee-for-service (FFS) program, most beneficiaries enrolled in both HI and SMI can choose to participate in a Medicare+Choice plan instead. Organiza-  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2002  39   Medicare tions that seek to contract as Medicare+Choice plans must meet specific organizational, financial, and other requirements. Following are the primary Medicare+Choice plans:  Coordinated care plans, which include health maintenance organizations (HMOs), provider-sponsored organizations (PSOs), preferred provider organizations (PPOs), and other certified coordinated care plans and entities that meet the standards set forth in the law.  Private, unrestricted FFS plans, which allow beneficiaries to select certain private providers. For those providers who agree to accept the plan's payment terms and conditions, this option does not place the providers at risk, nor does it vary payment rates based on utilization.  Medical savings account (MSA) plans, which provide benefits after a single high deductible is met. Medicare makes an annual deposit to the MSA, and the beneficiary is expected to use the money in the MSA to pay for medical expenses below the annual deductible. Except for MSA plans, all Medicare+Choice plans are required to provide at least the current Medicare benefit package, excluding hospice services. Plans may offer additional covered services and are required to do so (or return excess payments) if plan costs are lower than the Medicare payments received by the plan. There are some restrictions as to who may elect an MSA plan, even when enrollment is no longer limited to a certain number of participants. employment income without limit. (Prior to 1994, the tax applied only up to a specified maximum amount of earnings.) The HI tax rate is specified in the Social Security Act and cannot be changed without legislation. The HI trust fund also receives income from the following sources: (1) a portion of the income taxes levied on Social Security benefits paid to high-income beneficiaries; (2) premiums from certain persons who are not otherwise eligible and choose to enroll voluntarily; (3) reimbursements from the general fund of the U.S. Treasury for the cost of providing HI coverage to certain aged persons who retired when the HI program began and thus were unable to earn sufficient quarters of coverage (and those federal retirees similarly unable to earn sufficient quarters of Medicare-qualified federal employment); (4) interest earnings on its invested assets; and (5) other small miscellaneous income sources. The taxes paid each year are used mainly to pay benefits for current beneficiaries. The SMI program is financed through premium payments ($58.70 per beneficiary per month in 2003) and contributions from the general fund of the U.S. Treasury. Beneficiary premiums are generally set at a level that covers 25 percent of the average expenditures for aged beneficiaries. Therefore, the contributions from the general fund of the U.S. Treasury are the largest source of SMI income. The SMI trust fund also receives income from interest earnings on its invested assets, as well as a small amount of miscellaneous income. Beneficiary premiums and general fund payments are redetermined annually, to match estimated program costs for the following year. Capitation payments to Medicare+Choice plans are financed from the HI and SMI trust funds in proportion to the relative weights of HI and SMI benefits to the total benefits paid by the Medicare program. Beneficiary Payment Liabilities Fee-for-service beneficiaries are responsible for charges not covered by the Medicare program and for various cost-sharing aspects of both HI and SMI. These liabilities may be paid (1) by the Medicare beneficiary; (2) by a third party, such as an employer-sponsored retiree health plan or private ""Medigap"" insurance; or (3) by Medicaid, if the person is eligible. The term ""Medigap"" is used to mean private health insurance that pays, within limits, most of the health care service charges not covered by Parts A or B of Medicare. These policies, which must meet federally imposed standards, are offered by Blue Cross and Blue Shield (BC/BS) and various commercial health insurance companies. For beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare+Choice plans, the beneficiary's payment share is based on the cost-sharing structure of the specific plan selected by the beneficiary, since each plan has its own requirements. Most plans have lower deductibles and coinsurance than are required of fee-for-service beneficiaries. Such beneficiaries pay the  Program Financing, Beneficiary Liabilities, and Provider Payments All financial operations for Medicare are handled through two trust funds, one for the HI program and one for the SMI program. These trust funds, which are special accounts in the U.S. Treasury, are credited with all receipts and charged with all expenditures for benefits and administrative costs. The trust funds cannot be used for any other purpose. Assets not needed for the payment of costs are invested in special Treasury securities. The following sections describe Medicare's financing provisions, beneficiary cost-sharing requirements, and the basis for determining Medicare reimbursements to health care providers. Program Financing The HI program is financed primarily through a mandatory payroll tax. Almost all employees and self-employed workers in the United States work in employment covered by the HI program and pay taxes to support the cost of benefits for aged and disabled beneficiaries. The HI tax rate is 1.45 percent of earnings, to be paid by each employee and a matching amount by the employer for each employee, and 2.90 percent for self-employed persons. Beginning in 1994, this tax is paid on all covered wages and self-  40  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2002   Medicare monthly Part B premium and may, depending on the plan, pay an additional plan premium. For hospital care covered under HI, a fee-for-service beneficiary's payment share includes a one-time deductible amount at the beginning of each benefit period ($840 in 2003). This deductible covers the beneficiary's part of the first 60 days of each spell of inpatient hospital care. If continued inpatient care is needed beyond the 60 days, additional coinsurance payments ($210 per day in 2003) are required through the 90th day of a benefit period. Each HI beneficiary also has a ""lifetime reserve"" of 60 additional hospital days that may be used when the covered days within a benefit period have been exhausted. Lifetime reserve days may be used only once, and coinsurance payments ($420 per day in 2003) are required. For skilled nursing care covered under HI, Medicare fully covers the first 20 days of SNF care in a benefit period. But for days 21100, a copayment ($105 per day in 2003) is required from the beneficiary. After 100 days of SNF care per benefit period, Medicare pays nothing for SNF care. Home health care has no deductible or coinsurance payment by the beneficiary. In any HI service, the beneficiary is responsible for fees to cover the first 3 pints or units of non-replaced blood per calendar year. The beneficiary has the option of paying the fee or of having the blood replaced. There are no premiums for most people covered by the HI program. Eligibility is generally earned through the work experience of the beneficiary or of his or her spouse. However, most aged people who are otherwise ineligible for premium-free HI coverage can enroll voluntarily by paying a monthly premium, if they also enroll in SMI. For people with fewer than 30 quarters of coverage as defined by SSA, the 2003 HI monthly premium rate is $316; for those with 30 to 39 quarters of coverage, the rate is reduced to $174. Voluntary coverage upon payment of the HI premium, with or without enrolling in SMI, is also available to disabled individuals for whom cash benefits have ceased due to earnings in excess of those allowed for receiving cash benefits. For SMI, the beneficiary's payment share includes the following: one annual deductible (currently $100); the monthly premiums; the coinsurance payments for SMI services (usually 20 percent of the medically allowed charges); a deductible for blood; certain charges above the Medicare-allowed charge (for claims not on assignment); and payment for any services that are not covered by Medicare. For outpatient mental health treatment services, the beneficiary is liable for 50 percent of the approved charges. Provider Payments For HI, before 1983, payments to on a reasonable cost basis. Medicar inpatient hospital services are now bursement mechanism known as the providers were made e payments for most made under a reimprospective payment system (PPS). Under PPS, a specific predetermined amount is paid for each inpatient hospital stay, based on each stay's diagnosis-related group (DRG) classification. In some cases the payment the hospital receives is less than the hospital's actual cost for providing the HI-covered inpatient hospital services for the stay; in other cases it is more. The hospital absorbs the loss or makes a profit. Certain payment adjustments exist for extraordinarily costly inpatient hospital stays. Payments for skilled nursing care and home health care are made under separate prospective payment systems. Payments for inpatient rehabilitation and psychiatric care are currently reimbursed on a reasonable cost basis, but prospective payment systems are expected to be implemented in the near future, as required by the BBA. For SMI, before 1992, physicians were paid on the basis of reasonable charge. This amount was initially defined as the lowest of (1) the physician's actual charge; (2) the physician's customary charge; or (3) the prevailing charge for similar services in that locality. Beginning January 1992, allowed charges were defined as the lesser of (1) the submitted charges, or (2) the amount determined by a fee schedule based on a relative value scale (RVS). Payments for DME and clinical laboratory services are also based on a fee schedule. Most hospital outpatient services are reimbursed on a prospective payment system, and home health care is reimbursed under the same prospective payment system as HI. If a doctor or supplier agrees to accept the Medicareapproved rate as payment in full (""takes assignment""), then payments provided must be considered as payments in full for that service. The provider may not request any added payments (beyond the initial annual deductible and coinsurance) from the beneficiary or insurer. If the provider does not take assignment, the beneficiary will be charged for the excess (which may be paid by Medigap insurance). Limits now exist on the excess that doctors or suppliers can charge. Physicians are ""participating physicians"" if they agree before the beginning of the year to accept assignment for all Medicare services they furnish during the year. Since Medicare beneficiaries may select their doctors, they have the option to choose those who participate. Medicare payments to Medicare+Choice plans are based on a blend of local and national capitated rates, generally determined by the capitation payment methodology described in section 1853 of the Social Security Act. Actual payments to plans vary based on demographic characteristics of the enrolled population. New ""risk adjusters"" based on demographics and health status are currently being phased in to better match Medicare capitation payments to the expected costs of individual beneficiaries.  Claims Processing Medicare's HI and SMI fee-for-service claims are processed by nongovernment organizations or agencies that  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2002  41   Medicare contract to serve as the fiscal agent between providers and the federal government. These claims processors are known as intermediaries and carriers. They apply the Medicare coverage rules to determine the appropriateness of claims. Medicare intermediaries process HI claims for institutional services, including inpatient hospital claims, SNFs, HHAs, and hospice services. They also process outpatient hospital claims for SMI. Examples of intermediaries are BC/ BS (which utilize their plans in various states) and other commercial insurance companies. Intermediaries' responsibilities include the following:  Determining costs and reimbursement amounts.  Maintaining records.  Establishing controls.  Safeguarding against fraud and abuse or excess use.  Conducting reviews and audits.  Making the payments to providers for services.  Assisting both providers and beneficiaries as needed. Medicare carriers handle SMI claims for services by physicians and medical suppliers. Examples of carriers are the BS plans in a state, and various commercial insurance companies. Carriers' responsibilities include the following:  Determining charges allowed by Medicare.  Maintaining quality-of-performance records.  Assisting in fraud and abuse investigations.  Assisting both suppliers and beneficiaries as needed.  Making payments to physicians and suppliers for services that are covered under SMI. Peer review organizations (PROs) are groups of practicing health care professionals who are paid by the federal government to generally oversee the care provided to Medicare beneficiaries in each state and to improve the quality of services. PROs educate other health care professionals and assist in the effective, efficient, and economical delivery of health care services to the Medicare population. The ongoing effort to combat monetary fraud and abuse in the Medicare program was intensified after enactment of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-191), which created the Medicare Integrity Program. Prior to this 1996 legislation, CMS was limited by law to contracting with its current carriers and fiscal intermediaries to perform payment safeguard activities. The Medicare Integrity Program provided CMS with stable, increasing funding for payment safeguard activities, as well as new authorities to contract with entities to perform specific payment safeguard functions.  Administration Department of Health and Human Services has the overall responsibility for administration of the Medicare program. Within DHHS, responsibility for administering Medicare rests with CMS. SSA assists, however, by initially determining an individual's Medicare entitlement, by withholding Part B premiums from the Social Security benefit checks of beneficiaries, and by maintaining Medicare data on the master beneficiary record, which is SSA's primary record of beneficiaries. The Internal Revenue Service in the Department of the Treasury collects the HI payroll taxes from workers and their employers. A Board of Trustees, composed of two appointed members of the public and four members who serve by virtue of their positions in the federal government, oversees the financial operations of the HI and SMI trust funds. The Secretary of the Treasury is the managing trustee. The Board of Trustees reports to Congress on the financial and actuarial status of the Medicare trust funds on or about the first day of April each year. State agencies (usually State Health Departments under agreements with CMS) identify, survey, and inspect provider and supplier facilities and institutions wishing to participate in the Medicare program. In consultation with CMS, these agencies then certify the facilities that are qualified.  Data Summary The Medicare program covers 95 percent of our nation's aged population, as well as many people who are on Social Security because of disability. In 2001, HI covered about 40 million enrollees with benefit payments of $141.2 billion, and SMI covered about 38 million enrollees with benefit payments of $99.7 billion. Administrative costs were about 2 percent of HI and about 2 percent of SMI disbursements for 2001. Total disbursements for Medicare in 2001 were $241 billion. Note: Medicare enrollment data are based on estimates prepared for the 2002 annual report of the Medicare Board of Trustees to Congress (available on the Internet at www.cms.hhs.gov/publications/trusteesreport/). Medicare benefits, administrative costs, and total disbursements for 2001 are actual amounts for the calendar year, as reported by the Department of the Treasury.

Act * Insured Status Entitlement to Hospital Insurance Benefits 1965 Individual aged 65 or older entitled to monthly benefits under the Social Security or Railroad Retirement program, or aged 65 before 1968, or 3 quarters of coverage (QC) after 1965 and before attainment of age 65. 3 QC for each year after 1966 and before attainment of age 65. Disabled individual, under age 65, entitled to disability benefits for 24 consecutive months under the Social Security or Railroad Retirement program (excludes spouses and children of disabled individuals). Individual under age 65 who has end stage renal disease (ESRD) and who is either fully or currently insured, or is entitled to monthly benefits under the Social Security or Railroad Retirement program or is the spouse or dependent child of such an insured individual or beneficiary. Entitlement begins on the first day of the third month following the initiation of a course of renal dialysis and ends with the 12th month following the month in which either the dialysis terminates or the individual has a renal transplant. Individual aged 65 or older enrolled in the SMI program who is not otherwise entitled to HI benefits, upon voluntary participation with payment of Hospital Insurance premium. 1980 Individual who would be entitled to monthly benefits under the Social Security or Railroad Retirement program if application were made. Disabled individual under age 65 entitled to disability benefits for at least 24 months, not necessarily consecutive, under the Social Security or Railroad Retirement program. Medicare coverage extended for up to 36 months for disabled individuals whose disability continues, but whose monthly benefit ceased because they engaged in substantial gainful activity. Second waiting period eliminated if a former disabled-worker beneficiary becomes entitled again within 5 years (7 years for disabled widows and widowers and disabled children aged 18 or older). 1982 1983 1986 1987 1989 Federal employees covered under HI based on QC for earnings as federal employees and/ or based on deemed QC for earnings as federal employees before 1983.

Individual under age 65 entitled to HI benefits, upon voluntary participation with payment of SMI premium. Medicare Benefits HI and SMI 1965 1981 Requires that Medicare be secondary payer to benefits provided by liability insurance policies or under no-fault insurance. Requires that Medicare be secondary payer to employer-based group health plans for beneficiaries entitled to Medicare solely due to end stage renal disease (ESRD) for up to 12 months. For workers and their spouses aged 65-69, Medicare is the secondary payer when benefits are provided under an employer-based group health plan (applicable to employers with 20 or more employees who sponsor or contribute to the group plan). Health maintenance organizations (HMOs) will be authorized as providers of benefits. The Secretary of HHS must certify the prospective payment mechanism for HMOs before implementation. 1984 Medicare secondary payer provisions are extended to spouses aged 65-69 of workers under age 65 whose employer-based group health plan covers such spouses. For HMOs, includes medical and other health services furnished by clinical psychologists. 1985 1986 Provides payment for liver transplant services. Extends the working age secondary payer provision to cover workers and their spouses beyond age 69. For HMOs that offered organ transplants as a basic health service on Apr. 15, 1985, such services may be offered from Oct. 1, 1985, through Apr. 1, 1988. For disabled individuals who are covered by employer-based health plans (with at least 100 employees), Medicare is the secondary payer, effective for 1987-1991. 1987 Requires HMOs/competitive medical plans that cease to contract with Medicare to provide or arrange supplemental coverage of benefits related to preexisting conditions for the lesser of 6 months or the duration of an exclusion period. Specifies in law that in order to be eligible for home health care, a Medicare beneficiary must have a restricted ability to leave the home, requiring the assistance of another or the aid of a supportive device (such as crutches, a cane, a wheelchair, or a walker). Clarifies that the secondary payer provision for disabled individuals covered under employerbased health plans for employers with at least 500 employees applies to employers who are government entities. 1990 Requires that Medicare be the secondary payer to employer-based group health plans for beneficiaries entitled to Medicare solely due to ESRD for up to 18 months (extended from 12 months), effective Feb. 1, 1991, to Jan. 1, 1996. The secondary payer provision for disabled beneficiaries covered under large employer plans (see 1986.); effective through Sept. 30, 1995. 1993 The secondary payer provision for disabled beneficiaries covered under large employer plans is effective through Sept. 30, 1998.  1972  1982  44  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2002   Medicare: History of Provisions The secondary payer provision for beneficiaries with ESRD applies to all beneficiaries with end stage renal disease, not only those entitled to Medicare solely on the basis of it. The extension to include the first 18 months of an individual's entitlement on the basis of ESRD is effective through Sept. 30, 1998. 1997 Established an expanded set of options for the delivery of health care under Medicare, referred to as Medicare+Choice. All Medicare beneficiaries can receive their Medicare benefits through the original fee-for-service program. In addition, most beneficiaries can choose instead to receive their Medicare benefits through one of the following Medicare+Choice plans: (1) coordinated care plans (such as HMOs, provider-sponsored organizations, and preferred provider organizations); (2) Medical Savings Account (MSA)/ High Deductible plans (through a demonstration available for up to 390,000 beneficiaries); or (3) private fee-for-service plans. Except for MSA plans, all Medicare+Choice plans are required to provide the current Medicare benefit package (excluding hospice services) and any additional health services required under the adjusted community rate (ACR) process. MSA plans provide Medicare benefits after a single high deductible is met, and enrollees receive an annual deposit in their Medical Savings Account. Transition rules for current Medicare HMO program also provided. The provision making Medicare the secondary payer for disabled beneficiaries covered under large employer plans, previously scheduled to expire Sept. 30, 1998, made permanent. The provision making Medicare secondary payer for the first 12 months of entitlement due to ESRD, which had been extended on a temporary basis (through Sept. 30, 1998) to include the first 18 months of entitlement, has been extended, permanently, to include the first 30 months of entitlement on the basis of ESRD.

Deductible and coinsurance provisions (see Table 2.C1). Lifetime reserve of 60 additional days of inpatient hospital services. Outpatient hospital diagnostic services transferred to SMI. Services of interns and residents in podiatry training. Unlimited home health visits in a year. Requirement for prior hospitalization eliminated. Home health services provided for up to 4 days a week and up to 21 consecutive days. Alcohol detoxification facility services. 1981 Part A coinsurance is based on the deductible for the calendar year in which services are received rather than the deductible in effect at the time the beneficiary's spell of illness began, starting in 1982. Alcohol detoxification facility services eliminated. 1982 Beneficiaries expected to live 6 months or less may elect to receive hospice care benefits instead of other Medicare benefits. May elect maximum of two 90-day and one 30-day hospice care periods, effective Nov. 1, 1983, to Oct. 1, 1986. For durable medical equipment provided by home health agencies, the payment amount is reduced from 100 percent of costs to 80 percent of reasonable charges.  1967 1972 1980  1984  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2002  45   Medicare: History of Provisions 1986 Set the Part A deductible for 1987 at $520 with resulting increases in cost sharing. Increased the Part A deductible annually by the applicable percentage increase in the hospital prospective payment rates. Hospice care benefit (enacted in 1982) made permanent. 1987 Specifies in law that in order to be eligible for home health care, a Medicare beneficiary must have a restricted ability to leave the home, requiring the assistance of another or the aid of a supportive device (such as crutches, a cane, a wheelchair, or a walker). Enrollee pays annual hospital deductible (set at $560 for 1989) and Medicare pays balance of covered charges, regardless of the number of days of hospitalization (except for psychiatric hospital care, which is still limited by 190-day lifetime maximum). The number of days in a skilled nursing facility changed to 150 per year. Deletes the requirement for a prior hospital stay of 3 or more consecutive days. Expands home health care to provide care for less than 7 days per week and up to 38 consecutive days. Hospice care extended beyond 210 days when beneficiary is certified as terminally ill. All 1988 provisions became effective Jan. 1, 1989. 1989 The spell of illness and benefit period coverage of laws determination of inpatient hospital benefits in 1990 and benefit period, Medicare pays 100 percent of covered c hospital care. Coinsurance applies for the next 30 days prior to 1988 return to the later. After the deductible is paid in osts for the first 60 days of inpatient in a benefit period.  1988  The requirement for a prior hospital stay of 3 or more consecutive days is reinstated for skilled nursing facility services. Coverage returns to 100 days post-hospital care per spell of illness with a daily coinsurance rate in effect for days 21 through 100. Home health services return to a limit of 21 consecutive days of care. Provision providing for home health care for fewer than 7 days per week continued due to a court decision. Hospice care is returned to a lifetime limit of 210 days. 1990 1997 Hospice care is extended beyond 210 days when beneficiary is certified as terminally ill. Home health services not associated with a hospital or skilled nursing facility stay for individuals enrolled in both HI and SMI are transferred from the HI program to the SMI program, effective January 1998. The HI program will continue to cover the first 100 visits following a hospital stay of at least 3 consecutive days or a skilled-nursing facility stay. The cost to the SMI trust fund of the transferred services will phase in over a 6-year period (that is, the HI trust fund will transfer funds to the SMI trust fund during that period). Limits on the number of hours and days that home health care can be provided have been clarified. ""Part time"" now defined as skilled nursing and home health aide services (combined) furnished any number of days per week, for less than 8 hours per day and 28 or fewer hours per week. ""Intermittent"" now defined as skilled nursing care provided for fewer than 7 days each week, or less than 8 hours each day (combined) for 21 days or less. Hospice benefit periods are restructured to include two 90-day periods, followed by an unlimited number of 60-day periods. Medicare coverage provided for a number of prevention initiatives, most of which covered under SMI program. HI program affected mainly by two of the initiatives: (1) annual prostate cancer screening for male beneficiaries aged 50 or older, effective Jan. 1, 2000; and (2) colorectal screening procedures, including fecal-occult blood tests and flexible sigmoidoscopies, for beneficiaries age 50 or older, colonoscopy for beneficiaries at high risk for colorectal cancer, and other procedures, including screening barium enemas under certain circumstances.  46  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2002   Medicare: History of Provisions 2000 The homebound benefit is clarified to specify that benficiaries who require home health services may attend adult day-care for therapeutic, psychosocial, or medical treatment and still remain eligible for the home health benefit. Homebound beneficiaries may also attend religious services without being disqualified from receiving home health benefits. Effective July 1, 2001, the 24-month waiting period (otherwise required for an individual to establish Medicare eligibility on the basis of a disability) is waived for persons with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The entitlement to Medicare begins with the first month of the Social Security Administration's determination of eligibility for Disability Insurance benefits. There were no changes in 2001 affecting beneficiaries. Supplementary Medical Insurance 1965 Physician and surgeon services. In-hospital services of anesthesiologists, pathologists, radiologists, and psychiatrists. Limited dental services. Home health services, 100 visits in calendar year.

Coverage of outpatient immunosuppresive drugs (see 1986) is broadened/clarifed to include prescription drugs used in immunosuppressive therapy. Specifies in law that in order to be eligible for home health care, a Medicare beneficiary must have a restricted ability to leave the home, requiring the assistance of another or the aid of a supportive device (such as crutches, a cane, a wheelchair, or a walker). 1988 Beginning Jan. 1, 1990, the beneficiary pays a $75 deductible and 20-percent coinsurance, but once out-of-pocket expenses for the deductible and coinsurance exceed $1,370, Medicare pays 100 percent of allowable charges for remainder of year. Beginning in 1991, Medicare pays 50 percent of the cost of outpatient prescription drugs above $600. When fully implemented in 1993, Medicare will pay 80 percent of prescription drug costs above a deductible that assumes that 16.8 percent of Part B enrollees will exceed the deductible. Certain prescription drugs administered in an outpatient or home setting, including immunosuppressive drugs (previously covered for 1 year after a covered transplant), home intravenous drugs, and certain others, will be covered in 1990 under a new prescription drug provision. 1989 Provisions enacted in 1988 and to begin in 1990 and 1991 are repealed and benefits are restored to levels in effect prior to Jan. 1, 1989. Limits on mental health benefits eliminated in 1990. Coverage extended to services of clinical psychologists and social workers. The annual payment limits of $500 per beneficiary for outpatient physical therapy services and outpatient occupational therapy services, each, are raised to $750, for 1990 and later.

The annual payment limits of $750 per beneficiary for outpatient physical therapy services and outpatient occupational therapy services, each, are raised to $900 for 1994 and later. (See 1989.) 1997 Home health services not associated with a hospital or skilled nursing facility stay for individuals enrolled in both HI and SMI are transferred from the HI program to the SMI program, effective January 1998. The HI program will continue to cover the first 100 visits following a hospital stay of at least 3 consecutive days or a skilled nursing facility stay. The cost to the SMI Trust Fund of the transferred services will phase in over a 6-year period, while the cost of the home health services will phase into the SMI premium over 7 years.

For those exhausting their 36 months of coverage in 2001, at least 8 more months will be covered. (The Secretary of HHS will specify the increase, if any, beyond 8 months.) For those exhausting their 36 months of coverage in 2002, 2003, or 2004, the number of additional months may be more or less than 8. (The Secretary will specify the increase for each of these years.) (See 1993.) The annual payment limits of $1,500 per beneficiary for outpatient physical services and outpatient occupational therapy services, each, for services furnished by independent practitioners (that is, not by a hospital outpatient department), are suspended for 2000 and 2001.

Increases in the SMI premium may not exceed the dollar amount of the Social Security cost-of-living adjustment. For calculating the amount of SMI premium surcharge for individuals from age 65 up to age 70 not previously enrolled in SMI, the number of years an individual did not enroll because of coverage by employer group health insurance will not be taken into account. 1985 Extends through calendar year 1988 the requirement that SMI premiums be set to cover 25 percent of aged program costs and that increases in the SMI premium may not exceed the dollar amount of the Social Security cost-of-living adjustment.  1984  50  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2002   Medicare: History of Provisions Premium-paying individuals who do not purchase Part A coverage within a specific time after becoming eligible because of age are subject to a 10-percent penalty for each 12 months they are late in enrolling. There is a cutoff on the length of time these individuals will have to pay an enrollment penalty. The 10-percent premium penalty would be limited to twice the number of years enrollment was delayed. Therefore, if enrollment were delayed 1 year, the penalty would be assessed for 2 years. Individuals in this category and already enrolled will have the length of time the higher premium was paid credited to them. 1987 Extends through calendar year 1989 the provisions requiring that the SMI premium be set to cover 25 percent of aged program costs, prohibiting any increase in the premium if there is no Social Security cost-of-living adjustment, and continuing to hold beneficiaries harmless from Social Security check reductions as a result of a premium increase. Increases in the SMI premium may not exceed the dollar amount of the Social Security costof-living adjustments for 1989 and beyond. Extends through calendar year 1990 the requirement that SMI premiums be set to cover 25 percent of aged program costs.

They should be used only as overviews and general guides to the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The views expressed herein do not necessarily reflect the policies or legal positions of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services or the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). These summaries do not render any legal, accounting, or other professional advice, nor are they intended to explain fully all of the provisions or exclusions of the relevant laws, regulations, and rulings of the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Original sources of authority should be researched and utilized. icaid coverage for certain individuals who receive federally assisted income-maintenance payments, as well as for related groups not receiving cash payments. In addition to their Medicaid programs, most states have additional ""state-only"" programs to provide medical assistance for specified poor persons who do not qualify for Medicaid. Federal funds are not provided for state-only programs. The following enumerates the mandatory Medicaid ""categorically needy"" eligibility groups for which federal matching funds are provided:  Individuals are generally eligible for Medicaid if they meet the requirements for the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program that were in effect in their state on July 16, 1996, or--at state option--more liberal criteria.  Children under age 6 whose family income is at or below 133 percent of the federal poverty level (FPL).  Pregnant women whose family income is below 133 percent of the FPL (services to these women are limited to those related to pregnancy, complications of pregnancy, delivery, and postpartum care).  Supplemental Security Income (SSI) recipients in most states (some states use more restrictive Medicaid eligibility requirements that pre-date SSI).  Recipients of adoption or foster care assistance under Title IV of the Social Security Act.  Special protected groups (typically individuals who lose their cash assistance due to earnings from work or from increased Social Security benefits, but who may keep Medicaid for a period of time).  All children born after September 30, 1983 who are under age 19, in families with incomes at or below the FPL.  Certain Medicare beneficiaries (described later). States also have the option of providing Medicaid coverage for other ""categorically related"" groups. These optional groups share characteristics of the mandatory groups (that is, they fall within defined categories), but the eligibility criteria are somewhat more liberally defined. The broadest optional groups for which states will receive federal matching funds for coverage under the Medicaid program include the following:  Infants up to age 1 and pregnant women not covered under the mandatory rules whose family income is no more than 185 percent of the FPL (the percentage amount is set by each state).  Children under age 21 who meet the AFDC income and resources requirements that were in effect in their state on July 16, 1996.  Overview Title XIX of the Social Security Act is a federal/state entitlement program that pays for medical assistance for certain individuals and families with low incomes and resources. This program, known as Medicaid, became law in 1965 as a cooperative venture jointly funded by the federal and state governments (including the District of Columbia and the Territories) to assist states in furnishing medical assistance to eligible needy persons. Medicaid is the largest source of funding for medical and health-related services for America's poorest people. Within broad national guidelines established by federal statutes, regulations, and policies, each state (1) establishes its own eligibility standards; (2) determines the type, amount, duration, and scope of services; (3) sets the rate of payment for services; and (4) administers its own program. Medicaid policies for eligibility, services, and payment are complex and vary considerably, even among states of similar size or geographic proximity. Thus, a person who is eligible for Medicaid in one state may not be eligible in another state, and the services provided by one state may differ considerably in amount, duration, or scope from services provided in a similar or neighboring state. In addition, state legislatures may change Medicaid eligibility and/or services during the year.  Basis of Eligibility and Maintenance Assistance Status Medicaid does not provide medical assistance for all poor persons. Under the broadest provisions of the federal statute, Medicaid does not provide health care services even for very poor persons unless they are in one of the groups designated below. Low income is only one test for Medicaid eligibility for those within these groups; their resources also are tested against threshold levels (as determined by each state within federal guidelines). States generally have broad discretion in determining which groups their Medicaid programs will cover and the financial criteria for Medicaid eligibility. To be eligible for federal funds, however, states are required to provide Med-  52  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2002   Medicaid  Institutionalized individuals eligible under a ""special income level"" (the amount is set by each state--up to 300 percent of the SSI federal benefit rate).  Individuals who would be eligible if institutionalized, but who are receiving care under home and community-based services waivers.  Certain aged, blind, or disabled adults who have incomes above those requiring mandatory coverage, but below the FPL.  Recipients of state supplementary income payments.  Certain working-and-disabled persons with family income less than 250 percent of the FPL who would qualify for SSI if they did not work.  TB-infected persons who would be financially eligible for Medicaid at the SSI income level if they were within a Medicaid-covered category (however, coverage is limited to TB-related ambulatory services and TB drugs).  Certain uninsured or low-income women who are screened for breast or cervical cancer through a program administered by the Centers for Disease Control. The Breast and Cervical Cancer Prevention and Treatment Act of 2000 (Public Law 106-354) provides these women with medical assistance and follow-up diagnostic services through Medicaid.  ""Optional targeted low-income children"" included within the state Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) established by the Balanced Budget Act (BBA) of 1997 (Public Law 105-33).  ""Medically needy"" persons (described below). The medically needy (MN) option allows states to extend Medicaid eligibility to additional persons. These persons would be eligible for Medicaid under one of the mandatory or optional groups, except that their income and/or resources are above the eligibility level set by their state. Persons may qualify immediately or may ""spend down"" by incurring medical expenses that reduce their income to or below their state's MN income level. Medicaid eligibility and benefit provisions for the medically needy do not have to be as extensive as for the categorically needy, and may be quite restrictive. Federal matching funds are available for MN programs. However, if a state elects to have a MN program, there are federal requirements that certain groups and certain services must be included; that is, children under age 19 and pregnant women who are medically needy must be covered, and prenatal and delivery care for pregnant women, as well as ambulatory care for children, must be provided. A state may elect to provide MN eligibility to certain additional groups and may elect to provide certain additional services within its MN program. As of August 2002, thirty-six states have elected to have a MN program and are providing at least some MN services to at least some MN beneficiaries. All remaining states utilize the ""special income level"" option to extend Medicaid to the ""near poor"" in medical institutional settings.The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (Public Law 104193)-- known as the ""welfare reform"" bill--made restrictive changes regarding eligibility for SSI coverage that impacted the Medicaid program. For example, legal resident aliens and other qualified aliens who entered the United States on or after August 22, 1996 are ineligible for Medicaid for 5 years. Medicaid coverage for most aliens entering before that date and coverage for those eligible after the 5-year ban are state options; emergency services, however, are mandatory for both of these alien coverage groups. For aliens who lose SSI benefits because of the new restrictions regarding SSI coverage, Medicaid can continue only if these persons can be covered for Medicaid under some other eligibility status (again with the exception of emergency services, which are mandatory). Public Law 104-193 also affected a number of disabled children, who lost SSI as a result of the restrictive changes; however, their eligibility for Medicaid was reinstituted by Public Law 105-33, the BBA. In addition, welfare reform repealed the open-ended federal entitlement program known as Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) and replaced it with Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), which provides states with grants to be spent on time-limited cash assistance. TANF generally limits a family's lifetime cash welfare benefits to a maximum of 5 years and permits states to impose a wide range of other requirements as well--in particular, those related to employment. However, the impact on Medicaid eligibility is not expected to be significant. Under welfare reform, persons who would have been eligible for AFDC under the AFDC requirements in effect on July 16, 1996 generally will still be eligible for Medicaid. Although most persons covered by TANF will receive Medicaid, it is not required by law. Title XXI of the Social Security Act, known as the state Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), is a new program initiated by the BBA. In addition to allowing states to craft or expand an existing state insurance program, SCHIP provides more federal funds for states to expand Medicaid eligibility to include a greater number of children who are currently uninsured. With certain exceptions, these are low-income children who would not qualify for Medicaid based on the plan that was in effect on April 15, 1997. Funds from SCHIP also may be used to provide medical assistance to children during a presumptive eligibility period for Medicaid. This is one of several options from which states may select to provide health care coverage for more children, as prescribed within the BBA's Title XXI program. Medicaid coverage may begin as early as the third month prior to application--if the person would have been eligible for Medicaid had he or she applied during that time. Medicaid coverage generally stops at the end of the month  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2002  53   Medicaid in which a person no longer meets the criteria of any Medicaid eligibility group. The BBA allows states to provide 12 months of continuous Medicaid coverage (without reevaluation) for eligible children under the age of 19. The Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999 (Public Law 106-170) provides or continues Medicaid coverage to certain disabled beneficiaries who work despite their disability. Those with higher incomes may pay a sliding scale premium based on income. The BBA included a state option known as Programs of All-inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE). PACE provides an alternative to institutional care for persons aged 55 or older who require a nursing facility level of care. The PACE team offers and manages all health, medical, and social services and mobilizes other services as needed to provide preventative, rehabilitative, curative, and supportive care. This care, provided in day health centers, homes, hospitals, and nursing homes, helps the person maintain independence, dignity, and quality of life. PACE functions within the Medicare program as well. Regardless of source of payment, PACE providers receive payment only through the PACE agreement and must make available all items and services covered under both Titles XVIII and XIX, without amount, duration, or scope limitations and without application of any deductibles, copayments, or other cost sharing. The individuals enrolled in PACE receive benefits solely through the PACE program.  Scope of Medicaid Services Title XIX of the Social Security Act allows considerable flexibility within the states' Medicaid plans. However, some federal requirements are mandatory if federal matching funds are to be received. A state's Medicaid program must offer medical assistance for certain basic services to most categorically needy populations. These services generally include the following: Inpatient hospital services. Outpatient hospital services. Prenatal care. Vaccines for children. Physician services. Nursing facility services for persons aged 21 or older. Family planning services and supplies. Rural health clinic services. Home health care for persons eligible for skilled nursing services.  Laboratory and x-ray services.  Pediatric and family nurse practitioner services.  Nurse-midwife services.  Federally qualified health-center (FQHC) services, and ambulatory services of an FQHC that would be available in other settings.  Early and periodic screening, diagnostic, and treatment (EPSDT) services for children under age 21. States may also receive federal matching funds to provide certain optional services. Following are the most common of the 34 currently approved optional Medicaid services:  Diagnostic services.  Clinic services.  Intermediate care facilities for the mentally retarded (ICFs/MR).  Prescribed drugs and prosthetic devices.  Optometrist services and eyeglasses.  Nursing facility services for children under age 21.  Transportation services.  Rehabilitation and physical therapy services.  Home and community-based care to certain persons with chronic impairments.           Amount and Duration of Medicaid Services Within broad federal guidelines and certain limitations, states determine the amount and duration of services offered under their Medicaid programs. States may limit, for example, the number of days of hospital care or the number of physician visits covered. Two restrictions apply: (1) limits must result in a sufficient level of services to reasonably achieve the purpose of the benefits; and (2) limits on benefits may not discriminate among beneficiaries based on medical diagnosis or condition. In general, states are required to provide comparable amounts, duration, and scope of services to all categorically needy and categorically related eligible persons. There are two important exceptions: (1) Medically necessary health care services that are identified under the EPSDT program for eligible children, and that are within the scope of mandatory or optional services under federal law, must be covered even if those services are not included as part of the covered services in that state's Plan; and (2) states may request ""waivers"" to pay for otherwise uncovered home and community-based services (HCBS) for Medicaid-eligible persons who might otherwise be institutionalized. As long as the services are cost effective, states have few limitations on the services that may be covered under these waivers (except that, other than as a part of respite care, states may not provide room and board for the beneficiaries). With certain exceptions, a state's Medicaid program must allow beneficiaries to have some informed choices among participating providers of health care and to receive quality care that is appropriate and timely.  Payment for Medicaid Services Medicaid operates as a vendor payment program. States may pay health care providers directly on a fee-forservice basis, or states may pay for Medicaid services  54  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2002   Medicaid through various prepayment arrangements, such as health maintenance organizations (HMOs). Within federally imposed upper limits and specific restrictions, each state for the most part has broad discretion in determining the payment methodology and payment rate for services. Generally, payment rates must be sufficient to enlist enough providers so that covered services are available at least to the extent that comparable care and services are available to the general population within that geographic area. Providers participating in Medicaid must accept Medicaid payment rates as payment in full. States must make additional payments to qualified hospitals that provide inpatient services to a disproportionate number of Medicaid beneficiaries and/or to other low-income or uninsured persons under what is known as the ""disproportionate share hospital"" (DSH) adjustment. During 19881991, excessive and inappropriate use of the DSH adjustment resulted in rapidly increasing federal expenditures for Medicaid. Under legislation passed in 1991, 1993, and again within the BBA of 1997, the federal share of payments to DSH hospitals was somewhat limited. However, the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Benefits Improvement and Protection Act (BIPA) of 2000 (Public Law 106-554) increased DSH allotments for 2001 and 2002 and made other changes to DSH provisions that resulted in increased costs to the Medicaid program. States may impose nominal deductibles, coinsurance, or copayments on some Medicaid beneficiaries for certain services. The following Medicaid beneficiaries, however, must be excluded from cost sharing: pregnant women, children under age 18, and hospital or nursing home patients who are expected to contribute most of their income to institutional care. In addition, all Medicaid beneficiaries must be exempt from copayments for emergency services and family planning services. The federal government pays a share of the medical assistance expenditures under each state's Medicaid program. That share, known as the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP), is determined annually by a formula that compares the state's average per capita income level with the national income average. States with a higher per capita income level are reimbursed a smaller share of their costs. By law, the FMAP cannot be lower than 50 percent or higher than 83 percent. In 2002, the FMAPs varied from 50 percent in eleven states to 76.09 percent in Mississippi, and averaged 57 percent overall. The BBA also permanently raised the FMAP for the District of Columbia from 50 percent to 70 percent and raised the FMAP for Alaska from 50 percent to 59.8 percent through 2000. The BIPA of 2000 further adjusted Alaska's FMAP to a higher level for 20012005. The federal government pays states a higher share for children covered through the SCHIP program. This ""enhanced"" FMAP averages about 70 percent for all states, compared to the general Medicaid average of 57 percent. The federal government also reimburses states for 100 percent of the cost of services provided through facilities of the Indian Health Service, provides financial help to the twelve states that furnish the highest number of emergency services to undocumented aliens, and shares in each state's expenditures for the administration of the Medicaid program. Most administrative costs are matched at 50 percent, although higher percentages are paid for certain activities and functions, such as development of mechanized claims processing systems. Except for the SCHIP program, the Qualifying Individuals (QI) program (described later), and DSH payments, federal payments to states for medical assistance have no set limit (cap). Rather, the federal government matches (at FMAP rates) state expenditures for the mandatory services, as well as for the optional services that the individual state decides to cover for eligible beneficiaries, and matches (at the appropriate administrative rate) all necessary and proper administrative costs. The Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999 (as incorporated into Public Law 106-113, the appropriations bill for the District of Columbia for fiscal year 2000) increased the amount that certain states and the territories can spend on DSH and SCHIP payments, respectively. The BIPA set upper payment limits for inpatient and outpatient services provided by certain types of facilities.  Summary and Trends Medicaid was initially formulated as a medical care extension of federally funded programs providing cash income assistance for the poor, with an emphasis on dependent children and their mothers, the disabled, and the elderly. Over the years, however, Medicaid eligibility has been incrementally expanded beyond its original ties with eligibility for cash programs. Legislation in the late 1980s assured Medicaid coverage to an expanded number of low-income pregnant women, poor children, and to some Medicare beneficiaries who are not eligible for any cash assistance program. Legislative changes also focused on increased access, better quality of care, specific benefits, enhanced outreach programs, and fewer limits on services. In most years since its inception, Medicaid has had very rapid growth in expenditures. This rapid growth has been due primarily to the following factors:  The increase in size of the Medicaid-covered populations as a result of federal mandates, population growth, and the earlier economic recession. In recent years Medicaid enrollment has declined somewhat.  The expanded coverage and utilization of services.  The DSH payment program, coupled with its inappropriate use to increase federal payments to states.  The increase in the number of very old and disabled persons requiring extensive acute and/or long-term health care and various related services.  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2002  55   Medicaid  The results of technological advances to keep a greater number of very low-birth-weight babies and other critically ill or severely injured persons alive and in need of continued extensive and very costly care.  The increase in drug costs and the availability of new expensive drugs.  The increase in payment rates to providers of health care services, when compared to general inflation. As with all health insurance programs, most Medicaid beneficiaries incur relatively small average expenditures per person each year, and a relatively small proportion incurs very large costs. Moreover, the average cost varies substantially by type of beneficiary. National data for 1999 (excluding Hawaii), for example, indicate that Medicaid payments for services for 20.5 million children, who constitute 51 percent of all Medicaid beneficiaries, average about $1,170 per child (a relatively small average expenditure per person). Similarly, for 8.4 million adults, who comprise 20 percent of beneficiaries, payments average about $1,935 per person. However, certain other specific groups have much larger per-person expenditures. Medicaid payments for services for 4.1 million aged, constituting 10 percent of all Medicaid beneficiaries, average about $10,335 per person; for 7.3 million disabled, who comprise 18 percent of beneficiaries, payments average about $9,000 per person. When expenditures for these high- and lower-cost beneficiaries are combined, the 1999 payments to health care vendors for 40 million Medicaid beneficiaries average $3,825 per person. Long-term care is an important provision of Medicaid that will be increasingly utilized as our nation's population ages. The Medicaid program paid for over 40 percent of the total cost of care for persons using nursing facility or home health services in 2000. National data for 1999 (excluding Hawaii) show that Medicaid payments for nursing facility services (excluding ICFs/MR) totaled $33.1 billion for more than 1.6 million beneficiaries of these services--an average expenditure of $20,690 per nursing home beneficiary. The national data also show that Medicaid payments for home health services totaled $2.9 billion for more than 800,000 beneficiaries--an average expenditure of $3,625 per home health care beneficiary. With the percentage of our population who are elderly or disabled increasing faster than that of the younger groups, the need for long-term care is expected to increase. Another significant development in Medicaid is the growth in managed care as an alternative service delivery concept different from the traditional fee-for-service system. Under managed care systems, HMOs, prepaid health plans (PHPs), or comparable entities agree to provide a specific set of services to Medicaid enrollees, usually in return for a predetermined periodic payment per enrollee. Managed care programs seek to enhance access to quality care in a cost-effective manner. Waivers may provide the states with greater flexibility in the design and implementation of their Medicaid managed care programs. Waiver authority under sections 1915(b) and 1115 of the Social Security Act is an important part of the Medicaid program. Section 1915(b) waivers allow states to develop innovative health care delivery or reimbursement systems. Section 1115 waivers allow statewide health care reform experimental demonstrations to cover uninsured populations and to test new delivery systems without increasing costs. Finally, the BBA provided states a new option to use managed care. The number of Medicaid beneficiaries enrolled in some form of managed care program is growing rapidly, from 14 percent of enrollees in 1993 to 57 percent in 2001. More than 40 million persons received health care services through the Medicaid program in fiscal year (FY) 1999 (the last year for which beneficiary data are available). In FY 2001, total outlays for the Medicaid program (federal and state) were $227.8 billion, including direct payment to providers of $162.6 billion, payments for various premiums (for HMOs, Medicare, etc.) of $37.6 billion, payments to disproportionate share hospitals of $15.9 billion, and administrative costs of $11.7 billion. Outlays under the SCHIP program in FY 2001 were $3.8 billion. With no changes to either program, expenditures under Medicaid and SCHIP are projected to reach $394 billion and $7.2 billion, respectively, by FY 2007.  The Medicaid-Medicare Relationship Medicare beneficiaries who have low incomes and limited resources may also receive help from the Medicaid program. For such persons who are eligible for full Medicaid coverage, the Medicare health care coverage is supplemented by services that are available under their state's Medicaid program, according to eligibility category. These additional services may include, for example, nursing facility care beyond the 100-day limit covered by Medicare, prescription drugs, eyeglasses, and hearing aids. For persons enrolled in both programs, any services that are covered by Medicare are paid for by the Medicare program before any payments are made by the Medicaid program, since Medicaid is always the ""payer of last resort."" Certain other Medicare beneficiaries may receive help with Medicare premium and cost-sharing payments through their state Medicaid program. Qualified Medicare Beneficiaries (QMBs) and Specified Low-Income Medicare Beneficiaries (SLMBs) are the best-known categories and the largest in numbers. QMBs are those Medicare beneficiaries who have resources at or below twice the standard allowed under the SSI program, and incomes at or below 100 percent of the FPL. For QMBs, Medicaid pays the Hospital Insurance (HI) and Supplementary Medical Insurance (SMI) premiums and the Medicare coinsurance and deductibles, subject to limits that states may impose on payment rates. SLMBs are Medicare beneficiaries with resources like the QMBs, but with incomes that are higher, though still less than 120 percent of the FPL. For SLMBs,  56  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2002   Medicaid the Medicaid program pays only the SMI premiums. A third category of Medicare beneficiaries who may receive help consists of disabled-and-working individuals. According to the Medicare law, disabled-and-working individuals who previously qualified for Medicare because of disability, but who lost entitlement because of their return to work (despite the disability), are allowed to purchase Medicare HI and SMI coverage. If these persons have incomes below 200 percent of the FPL but do not meet any other Medicaid assistance category, they may qualify to have Medicaid pay their HI premiums as Qualified Disabled and Working Individuals (QDWIs). For Medicare beneficiaries with incomes that are above 120 percent and less than 175 percent of the FPL, the BBA establishes a capped allocation to states, for each of the 5 years beginning January 1998, for payment of all or some of the Medicare SMI premiums. These beneficiaries are known as Qualifying Individuals (QIs). Unlike QMBs and SLMBs, who may be eligible for other Medicaid benefits in addition to their QMB/SLMB benefits, the QIs cannot be otherwise eligible for medical assistance under a state plan. The payment of this QI benefit is 100 percent federally funded, up to the state's allocation. When all these categories are taken into account, Medicaid is estimated to provide some level of supplemental health coverage for about 6.5 million Medicare beneficiaries. Note: Medicaid data are based on the projections of the Mid-Session Review of the President's Fiscal Year 2003 Budget and are consistent with data received from the states on the Forms HCFA-2082, HCFA-37, and HCFA-64.

Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2002  57   Unemployment Insurance  Unemployment Insurance Through federal and state cooperation, unemployment insurance programs are designed to provide benefits to regularly employed members of the labor force who become involuntarily unemployed and who are able and willing to accept suitable employment. Workers in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands are covered under unemployment insurance programs. To induce states to enact unemployment insurance laws, the Social Security Act of 1935 provided a tax offset incentive. A uniform national tax was imposed on payrolls of industrial and commercial employers who employed eight or more workers in 20 or more weeks in a calendar year. Employers who paid taxes to a state with an approved unemployment insurance law could credit (offset) up to 90 percent of the state tax against the federal tax. This insured that employers in states without an unemployment insurance law would not have an advantage competing with similar businesses in states with such a law because they would still be subject to the federal payroll tax, and their employees would not be eligible for benefits. In addition, the Social Security Act authorized grants to states to meet the costs of administering the state systems. By July 1937, all 48 states, the then territories of Alaska and Hawaii, and the District of Columbia had passed unemployment insurance laws. Later, Puerto Rico adopted its own program, which was incorporated in 1961 into the federal-state system. A similar program for workers in the Virgin Islands was added in 1978. If employers are to receive an offset against federal taxes and if states are to receive federal grants for administration, federal law requires state unemployment insurance programs to meet certain requirements. These requirements are intended to assure that a state participating in the program has an unemployment insurance system that is fairly administered and financially secure. One requirement is that all contributions collected under state laws be deposited in the unemployment trust fund of the U.S. Treasury Department. The fund is invested as a whole, but each state has a separate account to which its deposits and its share of interest on investments are credited. At any time, a state may withdraw money from its account in the trust fund, but only to pay benefits. Thus, unlike the situation in the majority of states having workers' compensation and temporary disability insurance laws, unemployment insurance benefits are paid exclusively through a public fund. Private plans cannot be substituted for the state plan. Aside from federal standards, each state has major responsibility for the content and development of its unemployment insurance law. The state itself decides the amount and duration of benefits (except for certain federal requirements concerning Federal-State Extended Benefits), the contribution rates (with limitations), and, in general, the eligibility requirements and disqualification provisions. The states also directly administer the programs collecting contributions, maintaining wage records (where applicable), taking claims, determining eligibility, and paying benefits to unemployed workers.  Coverage Originally, coverage had been limited to employment covered by the Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA), which relates primarily to industrial and commercial workers in private industry. However, several federal laws added substantially to the number and types of workers protected under the state programs, such as the Employment Security Amendments of 1970 and the Unemployment Compensation Amendments of 1976. Private employers in industry and commerce are subject to the law if they have one or more individuals employed on 1 day in each of 20 weeks during the current or preceding year, or if they paid wages of $1,500 or more during any calendar quarter in the current or preceding year. Agricultural workers are covered on farms with a quarterly payroll of at least $20,000 or employing 10 or more employees in 20 weeks of the year. Domestic employees in private households are subject to FUTA if their employer pays wages of $1,000 or more in a calendar quarter. Excluded from coverage are workers employed by their families and the self-employed. Before 1976, employment in state and local governments and nonprofit organizations were exempt from FUTA. However, as a result of federal legislation enacted in 1976, most employment in these groups must now be covered by state law as a condition for securing federal approval of the state law. Under this form of coverage, local government and nonprofit employers have the option of making contributions as under FUTA or of reimbursing the state for benefit expenditures actually made. Elected officials, legislators, members of the judiciary, and the state National Guard are still excluded, as are employees of nonprofit organizations that employ fewer than four workers in 20 weeks in the current or preceding calendar year. Many states have extended coverage beyond that provided by federal legislation. Through special federal legislation, federal civilian employees and ex-servicemembers of the armed forces were brought under the unemployment insurance system. Benefits for those persons are financed through federal funds but are administered by the states and paid in accordance with the provisions of the state laws. A separate unemployment insurance law enacted by Congress covers railroad workers.  58  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2002   Unemployment Insurance Amendments to FUTA made in 2000 added Indian tribes to the set of entities for whom coverage is required, although they are not liable for FUTA taxes. As a result, workers performing services for tribes are now potentially eligible to receive Unemployment Insurance benefits. Coverage is required when service is performed for any Indian tribe, band, nation, or other organized group community which is recognized as eligible for federal assistance because of their status as Indians. The same permissible exclusion from coverage that are applicable to other governmental entities also apply to services performed for Indian tribes. If an Indian tribe fails to make payments to states as required, the tribe loses its FUTA exemption and may lose coverage. all benefit levels. The other laws use a weighted schedule that gives a greater proportion of the high-quarter wages to lower paid workers than to those earning more. Each state establishes a ceiling on the weekly benefit amount and no worker may receive an amount larger than the ceiling. The maximum may be either a fixed dollar amount or a flexible amount. Under the latter arrangement, which has been adopted in 35 jurisdictions, the maximum is adjusted automatically in accordance with the weekly wages of covered employees. Twelve states provide additional allowances for certain dependents. They all include children under ages 16, 18, or 19 (and, generally, older if incapacitated); 8 states include a nonworking spouse; and 2 states consider other dependent relatives. The amount allowed per dependent varies considerably by state but generally is $24 or less per week and, in the majority of states, the amount is the same for each dependent. All but 12 states require a waiting period of 1 week of total unemployment before benefits can begin. Four states pay benefits retroactively for the waiting period if unemployment lasts a certain period or if the employee returns to work within a specified period. Except for two jurisdictions, states provide a statutory maximum duration of 26 weeks of benefits in a benefit year. However, jurisdictions vary the duration of benefits through various formulas.  Eligibility for Benefits Unemployment benefits are available as a matter of right (without a means test) to unemployed workers who have demonstrated their attachment to the labor force by a specified amount of recent work or earnings in covered employment. All workers whose employers contribute to or make payments in lieu of contributions to state unemployment funds, federal civilian employees, and ex-servicemembers are eligible if they are involuntarily unemployed, able to work, available for work, and actively seeking work. Workers must also meet the eligibility and qualifying requirements of the state law and be free from disqualifications. Workers who meet these eligibility conditions may still be denied benefits if they are found to be responsible for their own unemployment. Work Requirements A worker's monetary benefit rights are based on his or her employment in covered work over a prior reference period called the ""base period,"" and these benefit rights remain fixed for a ""benefit year."" In most states, the base period is the first 4 quarters of the last 5 completed calendar quarters preceding the claim for unemployment benefits. Benefits Under all state laws, the weekly benefit amount--that is, the amount payable for a week of total unemployment-- varies with the worker's past wages within certain minimum and maximum limits. In most states, the formula is designed to compensate for a fraction of the usual weekly wage, normally about 50 percent, subject to specified dollar maximums. Three-fourths of the laws use a formula that computes weekly benefits as a fraction of wages in one or more quarters of the base period. Most commonly, the fraction is taken of wages in the quarter during which wages were highest because this quarter most nearly reflects full-time work. In most of these states, the same fraction is used at  Extended Benefits In the 1970s, a permanent federal-state program of Extended Benefits (EB) was established for workers who exhaust their entitlement to regular state benefits during periods of high unemployment. The program is financed equally from federal and state funds. Employment conditions in an individual state trigger Extended Benefits. This happens when the unemployment rate among insured workers in a state averages 5 percent or more over a 13week period, and is at least 20 percent higher than the rate for the same period in the 2 preceding years. If the insured unemployment rate reaches 6 percent, a state may by state law disregard the 20-percent requirement in initiating Extended Benefits. Once triggered, Extended Benefit provisions remain in effect for at least 13 weeks. When a state's benefit period ends, Extended Benefits to individual workers also end, even if they have received less than their potential entitlement and are still unemployed. Further, once a state's benefit period ends, another statewide period cannot begin for at least 13 weeks. State law determines most eligibility conditions for Extended Benefits and the weekly benefit payable. However, under federal law a claimant must have had 20 weeks in full-time employment (or the equivalent in insured wages) and must meet special work requirements. A worker who has exhausted his or her regular benefits is eligible for a 50-percent increase in duration of benefits for a  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2002  59   Unemployment Insurance maximum of 13 weeks of Extended Benefits. There is, however, an overall maximum of 39 weeks of regular and Extended Benefits. Extended Benefits are payable at the same rate as the weekly amount under the regular state program. Prior to the 1992 legislation, the EB program was based on the insured unemployment rate (IUR)-the number of unemployed workers receiving benefits in a state as a percentage of the number of persons in unemployment-- insurance covered employment in that state. By definition, the IUR does not include workers who have exhausted their benefits but are still unemployed. The 1992 legislation (P.L. 102-318) provided states the option of adopting an additional formula for triggering the permanent Extended Benefits program. Effective March 1993, states had the option of amending their laws to use alternative total unemployment rate triggers in addition to the current insured unemployment rate triggers. Under this option, Extended Benefits would be paid when (1) the state's seasonally adjusted total unemployment rate for the most recent 3 months is at least 6.5 percent, and (2) that rate is at least 110 percent of the state average total unemployment rate in the corresponding 3-month period in either of the 2 preceding years. States triggering on to the Extended Benefits program under other triggers would provide the regular 26 weeks of unemployment benefits in addition to 13 weeks of Extended Benefits, (which is the same number of weeks of benefits provided previously). In addition, states that have chosen the total unemployment rate option will also amend their state laws to add an additional 7 weeks of Extended Benefits (for a total of 20 weeks) where the total unemployment rate is at least 8 percent and is 110 percent of the state's total unemployment rate for the same 3 months in either of the 2 preceding years. As of April 13, 2002, extended Benefits were payable for 13 weeks in Alaska, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington. CONTACT: Rita L. DiSimone (202) 358-6221.  60  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2002   Workers' Compensation  Workers' Compensation Workers' compensation was the first form of social insurance to develop widely in the United States. It is designed to provide cash benefits and medical care when employees suffer work-related injuries or illnesses, and survivor's benefits to the dependents of workers whose deaths result from a work-related incident. In exchange for receiving benefits, workers who receive workers' compensation are generally not allowed to bring a tort suit against their employers for damages of any kind. The federal government was the first to establish a workers' compensation program, covering its civilian employees with an act that was passed in 1908 to provide benefits for workers engaged in hazardous work. The remaining federal workforce was covered in 1916. Nine states enacted workers' compensation laws in 1911. By 1920, all but seven states and the District of Columbia had workers' compensation laws. Today each of the 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands has its own program. The federal government covers its employees through its own program. It also administers the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act, enacted in 1927, which covers longshore and harbor workers throughout the United States. Coal miners suffering from pneumoconiosis, or black lung disease, are covered by the Black Lung Benefits Act of 1972, with the initial benefits enacted as part of the Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969. Under this program, monthly cash benefits are payable to miners disabled by black lung disease and to their dependents or survivors. Medical benefits are also payable on the basis of a diagnosis of pneumoconiosis. The Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act of 2000 instituted a new program that covers employees, contractors, and sub-contractors of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) for exposure to beryllium and the contraction of chronic beryllium disease. In addition, employees of private companies providing beryllium to DOE are covered. Employees' survivors also receive cash benefits. This same act also covers employees disabled or killed by cancers that developed after beginning employment at a DOE or an atomic weapons facility, as long as the cancer was at least ""as likely as not"" related to this employment, subject to a number of guidelines relating to radiation exposure, type of cancer, and other relevant factors. It also provides benefits for silica-related diseases and to uranium miners and their survivors who have received lump-sum payments under the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, and establishes an Office of Worker Advocacy in the Department of Energy to deal with other claims of workrelated occupational disease.  Coverage In 2000, state and federal workers' compensation laws covered about 123.7 million employees. Covered payroll in 2000--that is, total wages paid to covered workers--was $4.3 trillion. Common exemptions from coverage are domestic service, agricultural employment, small employers, and casual labor. However, 39 programs have some coverage for agricultural workers, and 25 programs have some coverage for domestic workers. Many programs exempt employees of nonprofit, charitable, or religious institutions. The coverage of state and local public employees differs widely from one state program to another. Two other major groups outside the coverage of workers' compensation laws are railroad employees engaged in interstate commerce and seamen in the U.S. Merchant Marine. Those workers have health insurance and shortterm and long-term cash benefit plans that cover disabilities whether or not the conditions are work-related. In addition, under federal laws they retain the right to bring tort suits against their employers for negligence in the case of work-related injuries or illness. The programs are compulsory for most private employment, except in Texas, where it is elective. If Texas employers reject it, they lose the customary common-law defenses against suits by employees in private industry.  Benefits The benefits provided under workers' compensation include periodic cash payments and medical services to the worker during the period of disablement for the disabling condition. They also include death and funeral benefits to the workers' survivors. Lump-sum settlements are permitted under most programs. Approximately three-fourths of all workers' compensation cases involve only medical benefits. Cash wage replacement benefits are categorized according to the duration and severity of the worker 's disability. Temporary and Permanent Total Disability A large majority of compensation cases involving cash payments involve temporary total disability. That is, employees are unable to work at all while they are recovering from the injury but they are expected to recover. When workers' lost time exceeds the waiting period (3 to 7 days, depending on the state) they receive a percentage of their weekly wages--typically two-thirds--up to a maximum weekly amount. The maximum generally being set at some percentage of the states average weekly wage, ranging from 66-2/3 percent to 200 percent, but typically 100 percent.

Its primary protect the rights and quality of life for the senior citizens of Maryland. Established in 1975 of Aging, the department receives its statutory authority under Article 70B, Annotated Code and the federal Older Americans Act of 1965, as amended. With the enactment of Chapter 1998 the department attained cabinet level status. mission is to as the Office of Maryland 573, Acts of  MDoA is charged with responsibilit ies delegated to the State under the Older Americans Act, not otherwise designated by law to some other unit o f St at e government. This includes planning, coordinating, administering, and assessing public pro grams and services carried out at State and local levels in the areas of income maintenance, nutrit io n, lo ng-term care, public guardianship, housing, advo cacy, employment, education, recreation, and rehabilitation of the physically and mentally handicapped.  Proposed Deficiency A $504,000 fiscal 2001 deficiency appropriation is requested to cover expenses of Medicaid waiver clients not covered by the Medicaid Waiver Program. The fiscal 2001 appropriation provides local case management services for the Medicaid waiver, but there are gaps in coverage of costs for Medicaid waiver clients otherwise eligible for Medicaid coverage. (See Issue 2 concerning Medicaid waiver case management problems.)  Governor's Proposed Budget Exhibit 1 indicates the MDoA allowance increases by $3,826,550 or 10.4 %. MDoA has a very small staff and, therefore, provides very few direct services to the elderly. Two additional contractual positions are provided in the 2002 allowance. Most services to the aging population are provided by local aging agencies (LAAs). The State provides grants for case management and direct services provided by local aging agencies. The MDoA allowance for LAAs increases $3,451,271, of which $2,780,696 of the increase is in general funds and $670,575 is in federal funds. The allowance includes case management funds to be distributed to LAAs to implement the Medicaid waiver. The Medicaid program in the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DHMH) will pay most costs for 13 services covered by the waiver including: assisted living; home health; personal care; and respite care.  3   DA.07 - Department of Aging  Exhibit 1  Governor's Proposed Budget  Department of Aging ($ in Thousands) How Much It Grows: 2001 Working Appropriation 2002 Governor's Allowance Amount Change Percent Change Where It Goes: Personnel Expenses Fiscal 2002 general salary increase . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

The legislation supports a staffing ratio at the higher of: (1) one full-time ombudsman per 1,000 long-term beds; (2) 20 hours of ombudsman time per week per LAA; or (3) 10 ho urs of ombudsman time per week per nursing home. The fiscal no t e indicat ed that there are currently 261 nursing homes in 24 jurisdictions and projected expenditures of $1,917,800 in fiscal 2001 and $2,692,100 in fiscal 2002, based on 10 hours per nursing ho me. The fiscal 2002 allowance provides $1,905,486 to handle 5,518 complaints. The program is augmented with volunteer ombudsmen.  Senior Center Activities Operating Fund Legislation The new $500,000 grant for the Senior Center Activities operating fund implements House Bill 759 (Chapter 635, Acts of 2000). At least 50% of the funds for senior citizen activities are to be distributed to counties in eco no mically distressed areas. The fund may not be used to supplant existing funds of senior centers. Senior centers continue to receive most of their funds from the local government.  Assisted Living Group Home Subsidy The increase ($561,931) in assisted living subsidy will provide for an additional 80 clients in group homes. Exhibit 3 indicates that 465 individuals will receive group home subsidies -- an average of $6,888 per client. This group of clients is not eligible for the Medicaid waiver coverage.  Performance Analysis: Managing for Results The number one goal of MDoA is to increase opportunities for the elderly to live in independent living arrangements and for those with disabilities requiring assistance to receive long-term care services. Exhibit 3 indicates the number of clients served in the direct service programs. Exhibit 4 indicates that MDoA's success in providing services to clients is measured by reducing the number of eligible persons on the waiting list and increasing the number of providers. This includes expansion of alternative models for local senior nutrition programs to two additional jurisdictio ns in fiscal 2002. There are already nutrition programs in all 24 jurisdictions. The second goal is to insure that residents of long-term care are treated with dignity. This is achieved by increasing contacts with the long- term care industry and expanding training of long-term care providers. Success will be measured by a reduction in the complaints handled by the Ombudsman Program, which receives additional funds for case management in fiscal 2001 and 2002.  7   DA.07 - Department of Aging  Exhibit 4  Program Measurement Data  Department of Aging Fiscal Years Ann.

Expansion of the Home- and Community-Based Services Waiver During the 1999 session, the General Assembly sought to expand the number of options for low-income seniors who want to prevent or delay their admission into nursing homes. This resulted in the enactment of Senate Bill 593 in 1999 (Chapter 593, Acts of 1999), which directed DHMH to apply for a Medicaid waiver that would cover home- and community-based services.  Problems with the Old Waiver Maryland has had a Medicaid waiver since 1993. Under that waiver, eligible low-income adults could receive long-term care in a community-based setting rather than in a nursing facility. The waiver provided services to 135 eligible seniors. The 1993 waiver required the senior to meet the Medicaid financial requirements, be at least 62 years of age, be eligible for MDoA housing subsidies, and be medically qualified for skilled nursing care. As a result of the restrictive requirements, most qualified seniors were in nursing homes and too ill for assisted living or home care.  The New Waiver The Health Care Financing Administrat io n (HCFA) approved DHMH's new waiver application. Applicants would be qualified if they needed a nursing home placement immediately. HFCA rejected Maryland's attempt to establish an ""at risk"" standard in the waiver application submitted in 1999. Medical eligibility for the waiver has not changed. The client must still qualify for a Medicaid nursing home level of care. Under the new MDoA regulations, low-income adults may be eligible to receive home care or live in a licensed assisted living facility and are: at least 50 years old; have a monthly income of no more than $1,590 (300% of SSI level); have assets that are no more than $2,000 to $2,500 depending on the eligibility category; and qualify for nursing facility level of care. Under the waiver, Medicaid would pay the following reimbursement rates: assisted living for level II ($1,530 monthly) and level III ($1,930 monthly) care; assistive devices, e. g. , a wheel chair (Medicaid pays actual approved costs not to exceed $100 per item); behavior consultation services ($35 per hour); 9  ! ! ! ! ! ! !   DA.07 - Department of Aging  environmental accessibility, e.g., wheel chair ramps (Medicaid pays actual approved costs with a lifetime limit of $3,000); environmental assessments ($350); family or consumer training ($55 per hour); home delivered meals ($5 per delivered meal); home health at Medicaid's current reimbursement methodology; respite care ($64 to $138 per day or $9 to $11.50 per hour); personal care ($9 to $15 per hour for aide services); and Senior Center Plus ($40).  The vast majority of seniors needing assisted living services need assisted living level I services and would not be eligible for the Medicaid waiver. These would be seniors who can perform four of the five basic life skills but are unable to live at home alone or in senior independent living housing. Typically, this group needs no more than two to four hours a week of direct patient care in a group home or assisted living licensed facility. This group would be eligible for assisted living under most private long-term care insurance contracts. This care typically costs $70 to $100 a day or $2,100 to $3,000 a month in the private market. These individuals are not eligible for the Medicaid waiver because HCFA requires waiver clients to qualify for the nursing home level of care. In fiscal 2002, 465 income-eligible clients not eligible for the Medicaid Waiver Program will receive a group home subsidy that averages $6,688 per year, while 1,084 eligible clients needing long-term care but not eligible for the Medicaid waiver will remain on the waiting list. These subsidies are provided by the Senior Housing Program, which is supported by general funds. MDoA should brief the committees on the status of eligible clients who need assisted living level I or group home services who are not covered by any program after the implementation of the Medicaid waiver because of limitation of funds for direct services. Since the medical eligibility for the waiver has not changed and the client must still qualify for the nursing home level of care, MDoA needs to explain how more clients will qualify under the new Medicaid waiver.  ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !  Medicaid Coverage Still Limited  2. Medicaid Waiver Case Management Problems MDoA has requested a $504,000 fiscal 2000 deficiency appropriation to cover Medicaid management services to assisted living clients and clients who continue to live in their homes. agencies provide t he case management services. The case manager assists in the client interviews the client, arranges a medical assessment by the local health department agency, 10  waiver case Local aging application, and secures   DA.07 - Department of Aging  the applicant's financial eligibility for the program from the Department of Human Resources. The case manager authorizes services and assists in placing the client by locating the appropriate provider. The case manager must maintain client records, assure quality of care, and assess continuing client eligibility every 12 months. MDoA indicates that the operating deficiency was created because the federal reimbursement from DHMH for the original smaller waiver program (assisted living services only) was much lower than MDoA budgeted in fiscal 2000. MDoA assumed the federal reimbursement from Medicaid would be 50% of Medicaid costs; instead MDoA reports they were reimbursed for 10% of costs because ""DHMH deducts medical expenses paid by Medicaid for the client from the federal reimbursement due MDoA."" The medical expenses include doctors' visits (out-patient), surgery (in-patient), prescription costs, etc. In some months MDoA reports that the medical expenses were so large that MDo A ended up paying DHMH rather than receiving reimbursement. The net effect of this was a shortfall at the end of fiscal 2000 which rolled over into fiscal 2001 and resulted in the projected deficiency for fiscal 2001. It is not clear if the problem will occur in fiscal 2002 with the new waiver. This problem raises several questions. Why are medical expenses deducted fro m t he Medicaid provider reimbursement for assisted living under the Medicaid waiver? Medical expenses for doctors are a separate Medicaid-covered expense with doctors reimbursed for services provided to income-eligible clients under Medicaid in-patient and out-patient medical service reimbursement rate schedules. Some of the problem may have been that not all waiver clients met t he eligibility requirements in regular Medicaid coverage. Therefore, MDoA had to absorb some of their medical costs. Medicaid reports that the problem occurred under the more limited Medicaid waiver involving 135 clients and is less likely to occur under the more generous waiver. Under the more limited waiver -- best described as nursing home triage -- to be eligible for assisted living or home care Medicaid coverage, a senior had to be medically and income eligible for nursing care. Most were too ill for assisted living and home care. Still the begging question -- why was MDoA and/or LAAs paying medical bills for patients who may have been Medicaid eligible for medical bill coverage? Eligibility for Medicaid coverage for medical coverage is less rigorous than that for assisted living and home care under either the old or new Medicaid waiver. The questions arising from this deficiency request are almost endless. DLS recommends that MDoA and the DHMH Medical Care Programs Administration brief the budget committees on the reimbursement mechanism for long-term care under the Medicaid waiver and explain how medical bills are submitted and paid for long-term care and home care for seniors under the Medicaid waiver. MDoA and DHMH should explain how and why the problem occurred in the first place and what mechanisms are in place to prevent a reoccurrence of the problem.  3. Medicaid Waiver Contractual Positions The allowance includes two new contractual positions, one Administrator III ($52,051) and a Human Services Specialist ($35,328) for administration of the Medicaid Waiver Program. The new positions are in fact existing positions that MDoA added for the Medicaid Waiver Program. The positions provide a variety of services for the Medicaid Waiver Program including technical assistance to LAAs, training new 11   DA.07 - Department of Aging  and existing providers on the Medicaid Waiver Program, and assisting providers with the electronic billing for Medicaid payments. MDoA indicates that the positions were created in August 2000 as the quickest way to create the needed positions for the Medicaid Waiver Program and reflected this in their fiscal 2002 budget submission. MDoA plans to convert the contractual positions to regular positions or PINs that already exist. MDoA has indicated that when the PINs are filled, the contractual positions will no longer be needed. The budgeted t urno ver for the agency is 2.43% so the PINs are already funded. It is recommended that the contractual positions be deleted as they will no longer be needed in fiscal 2002.  12   DA.07 - Department of Aging  Recommended Actions Amount Reduction 1.

Trends  In December 2000, 45,414,800 persons received Social Security benefits, an increase of 819,200 (1.8 percent) since December 1999, compared with an increase of 0.8 percent in the preceding year. This significant increase is related to the elimination of the earnings test in 2000 for persons who have reached the full retirement age. The number of retired workers increased by more than 700,000 in 2000 (2.6 percent), compared with an increase of 1.0 percent in 1999. The 28,499,000 retired workers represented 63 percent of all beneficiaries in December 2000. Another 10 percent were nondisabled widows and widowers (4,700,000). Seventy-one percent of the 28.5 million retiredworker beneficiaries received reduced benefits because of retirement prior to age 65. Relatively more women (75 percent) than men (68 percent) received reduced benefits. The number of persons aged 65 or older receiving Social Security benefits rose from 31.4 million in 1995 to 32.7 million in 2000 (4.0 percent). Beneficiaries aged 85 or older increased at a greater rate during the 5-year period (12.8 percent) from 3,576,000 in 1995 to 4,034,000 in 2000. In 2000, 39,500 centenarians were receiving Social Security. More than 19 million women aged 65 or older were receiving benefits in December 2000. Seven million (36.4 percent) were entitled solely to a retired-worker benefit, and another 5.5 million (28.9 percent) were dually entitled to a retired-worker benefit and a wife's or widow's benefit. About 6.6 million (34.7 percent) were receiving wife's or widow's benefits only. Almost 3 million children under age 18 were receiving benefits, including 1,346,100 children of deceased workers, 1,374,400 children of disabled workers, and 255,900 children of retired workers. In December 2000, 5,972,400 beneficiaries were receiving payments on the basis of disability-- 5,042,300 disabled workers, 728,700 disabled adult children, and 201,400 disabled widows and widowers. In addition, 165,100 spouses and 1,409,200 minor and student children of disabled workers were receiving benefits.   The leading causes of disability for disabled workers were mental disorders other than mental retardation (27 percent), and musculoskeletal conditions (23 percent). About 11 percent had circulatory conditions and an additional 10 percent had diseases of the nervous system and sense organs. Average monthly benefits for December 2000, including the 3.5 percent COLA increase, were $845 for retired workers, $786 for disabled workers, and $810 for nondisabled widows and widowers. Among retired workers, benefits averaged $951 for men and $730 for women. For disabled workers, average benefits were $883 for men and $661 for women. Average monthly family benefits for December 2000 were $1,502 for a widowed mother or father and children; $1,323 for a disabled worker, wife, and children; and $1,640 for a retired worker, wife, and children. Total OASDI benefit payments for calendar year 2000 were $407.6 billion. Payments from the OASI trust fund were $352.7 billion--an increase of 5.5 percent from the $334.4 billion paid in 1999. Benefit payments from the DI trust fund, from which benefits are paid to disabled workers, their spouses, and children, increased by 7.0 percent from $51.4 billion in 1999 to $55.0 billion in 2000. OASDI benefit awards in calendar year 2000 totaled 4,290,100, including 1,960,600 to retired workers, 456,900 to their spouses and children and 843,300 to survivors of insured workers. Benefits were awarded to 621,600 disabled workers and 407,600 of their spouses and children. Awards to disabled workers were 620,500 in 1999 and 608,100 in 1998.                      2  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2001   Supplemental Security Income Federal benefit rate change, effective January 2001 Cost-of-living adjustment Monthly amount for-- Individual living in his or her own household Couple with both members eligible Program Data Total: Benefits paid in 2000 Number of recipients, December 2000 Average benefit, December 2000 Federally administered payments: Benefits paid in 2000 Number of recipients, December 2000 Average benefit, December 2000 Federal SSI payments: Benefits paid in 2000 Number of recipients, December 2000 Average benefit, December 2000 Federally administered state supplementation: Benefits paid in 2000 Number of recipients, December 2000 Average benefit, December 2000 State-administered supplementation: Benefits paid in 2000 Number of recipients, December 2000 Average benefit, December 2000 $31.6 billion 6.7 million $385.52 $30.7 billion 6.6 million $378.82 $27.3 billion 6.3 million $351.48 $3.4 billion 2.5 million $112.16 1  3.5 percent $531 796  $0.9 billion 2 .7 million $110.95  1 Includes 2.2 million persons receiving federal SSI and state supplementation and 0.3 million persons receiving state supplementation only. 2 Includes 83,500 persons receiving state supplementation only.  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2001  3   Supplemental Security Income Program Trends  In December 2000, 6,601,700 persons received federally administered SSI payments--45,100 more than the previous year. Of the total, 2,010,900 (30 percent) were aged 65 or older; 3,744,000 (57 percent) were blind or disabled aged 18-64; and 846,800 (13 percent) were blind or disabled under age 18. The number of blind or disabled aged 18-64 rose by 53,000 (1.4 percent) between December 1999 and December 2000, while the number under age 18 remained virtually unchanged. In comparison, between December 1998 and December 1999, blind or disabled aged 18-64 increased by 1.2 percent, while blind or disabled under age 18 dropped by 4.5 percent. During 2000, 747,200 persons were awarded federally administered payments, a decrease of 1.4 percent from the previous year. Of the 2000 awards, 483,200 went to blind or disabled recipients aged 18-64, 144,600 to those blind or disabled under age 18, and 119,400 to recipients aged 65 or older.  Total SSI payments were $31.6 billion in 2000, up 2.0 percent from 1999. The 1999 increase over 1998 was 2.5 percent. Federal SSI payments in 2000 were $27.3 billion (an increase of 1.8 percent over the previous year). Federally administered state supplementation totaled $3.4 billion and state-administered supplementation $892.7 million, increasing by 2.4 percent and 4.6 percent, respectively from the previous year's totals. In 2000, the leading causes of disability among the blind or disabled between the ages of 18 and 64, and those under age 18 were mental disorders and mental retardation. Among disabled recipients between the ages of 18 and 64, 25.7 percent had mental retardation as the primary diagnosis, and 34.4 percent were diagnosed with another mental disorder. These conditions were also the most frequent diagnoses for blind or disabled under age 18.        4  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2001   Health Care Medicare Hospital Insurance (Part A): Total benefits paid in calendar year 2000 Supplementary Medical Insurance (Part B): Total benefits paid in calendar year 2000 Number of enrollees in July 2000, (one or both of Parts A and B) Aged Disabled Administrative costs, 2000: Hospital Insurance As a percent of total benefits paid Supplementary Medical Insurance As a percent of total benefits paid Medicaid Medical service expenditures in fiscal year 1998 Number of unduplicated recipients, fiscal year 1998 Average 1998 vendor payment per unduplicated recipient: Persons aged 65 or older Permanently and totally disabled persons Dependent children under age 21 Average 1998 vendor payment for medical services: Nursing facility services Inpatient general hospital care Prescribed drugs Physician's services $142.3 billion 40.7 million $10,242 9,095 1,203 $19,379 5,031 699 327 $128.5 billion $88.9 billion 39.6 million 34.3 million 5.3 million $2.6 billion 2.1 percent $1.8 billion 2.0 percent  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2001  5   Unemployment Insurance 2000 Total payments Average-- Weekly benefit amount (regular programs) Duration of benefits Weekly insured unemployment Covered employment $20.3 billion $221 13.7 weeks 2.1 million 127.9 million  Workers' Compensation 1999 Benefit payments: Total Compensation payments Medical and hospitalization Benefits paid by-- Private insurance carriers State and federal funds Employers' self-insurance Covered workers per month Costs as a percent of covered payroll  $43.4 billion 25.3 billion 18.0 billion 23.8 billion 10.2 billion 9.3 billion 123.9 million 1.29 percent  Temporary Disability Insurance Programs in effect in-- California, Hawaii, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Puerto Rico, and the railroad industry.

Eligibility and benefit amounts are determined by the worker's contributions to Social Security. Benefits are paid as an earned right to workers, their families and their survivors. There is no means test to qualify for benefits. During 2000, more than 45 million people received cash benefits at a rate exceeding $34 billion each month ($408 billion annually). According to the latest Social Security Trustees Report, these cash benefits comprised just over 4 percent of the nation's gross domestic product. During the same year, approximately 153 million employees and self-employed workers, along with employers, contributed more than $492 billion to the OASDI trust funds-- through which contributions are credited and benefits are paid. Social Security benefits are essential to the economic well-being of millions of individuals. Social Security pays benefits to more than 90 percent of those 65 or older. It is the major source of income (providing 50 percent or more of total income) for 64 percent of the beneficiaries. It contributes 90 percent or more of income for almost one-third of the beneficiaries, and is the only source of income for 20 percent of them (see charts 14 at the end of this section). By law, the OASI and DI trust funds may only be disbursed for: (1) Monthly benefits for workers and their families. (2) Vocational rehabilitation services for disabled beneficiaries. (3) Administrative costs (currently less than 1 percent of expenditures). (4) The lump-sum death payment to eligible survivors. 0  Revenue received from FICA payments is transferred to the U.S. Treasury. FICA revenue in excess of outlays is used to purchase special interest-bearing Treasury bonds. These securities remain assets of the trust funds until needed to cover Social Security costs.  Provisions for Railroad Retirement Board Beneficiaries The OASDI tables do not include a number of persons receiving Railroad Retirement benefits who would be eligible for Social Security benefits had they applied. The reason they have not applied is that receipt of a Social Security benefit would reduce their Railroad Retirement benefit by a like amount. The number of persons is not available, but is estimated to be less than 100,000. The Railroad Retirement Act of 1974, effective January 1, 1975, provided that the regular annuity for employees with 10 or more years of railroad service who retired after December 31, 1974, will consist of two components:  Tier 1--A basic Social Security level component equivalent to what would be paid under the Social Security Act on the basis of the employee's combined railroad and nonrailroad service, reduced by the amount of any monthly benefit under OASDI actually paid on the basis of nonrailroad work; and  Tier 2--A ""private pension"" component payable over and above the Social Security equivalent, calculated on the basis of the number of years of railroad service.  Contributions and Trust Funds A person contributes to Social Security either through payroll taxes or self-employment taxes under the Federal Insurance Contribution Act (FICA) or the Self-Employed Contribution Act (SECA). Employers match the employee contribution, while self-employed workers pay an amount equal to the combined employer-employee contributions. (Self-employed workers receive a special tax deduction to ease the impact of paying the higher rate). There is a maximum yearly amount of earnings subject to OASDI taxes, $80,400 in 2001. There is no upper limit on taxable earnings for Medicare Hospital Insurance (HI). Employees whose contributions exceed the maximum taxable amount because they worked for more than one employer can receive refunds of excess FICA payments when they file their tax returns. Taxes are allocated to the Old-Age (Retirement) and Survivors Insurance (OASI), the Disability Insurance (DI), and the Hospital Insurance (HI) Trust Funds. In addition to the taxes on covered earnings, OASI and DI trust fund revenues include interest on trust fund securities, income from taxation of OASI and DI benefits, certain technical transfers, and gifts or bequests.  Structure and Organization The OASDI program is administered by the Social Security Administration (SSA) which became an independent agency in 1995. The Commissioner of Social Security serves a 6-year term following appointment by the President and confirmation by the Senate. A bipartisan Social Security Advisory Board serves to review existing laws and policies and commissions studies and issues recommendations intended to anticipate changing circumstances. The President appoints three of the seven board members and Congress appoints the other four members.  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2001  9   Social Security The Social Security Administration is headquartered in Baltimore, Maryland. Major headquarter components include the National Computer Center that contains SSA's mainframe computers that drive our systems, much of the executive staff for policy, programs and systems as well as field support components. SSA's field structure is divided into 10 geographic regions containing over 1,300 field installations in communities throughout the country. Office sizes range from large urban offices with 50 or more employees to remote resident stations staffed by one or two individuals. Each region is headed by a Regional Commissioner, and staffed with specialists to handle regional administrative tasks and to assist field offices with operational issues. In addition, there are teleservice centers servicing all regions. While physically located within the various regions, each teleservice center manages the public's Social Security business from throughout the nation using state of the art communications systems. Seven program service centers provide service and support for the field offices in some aspects of Social Security's workloads. Tables 2.F1  2.F11 provide administrative data: Table 2.F2 summarizes data describing SSA's national workforce, and table 2.F3 provides a historical record of work years committed to SSA's overall operations. Table 2.F4 provides workload data for the Old-Age and Survivors Insurance programs, and table 2.F5 similarly provides workload data for the Disability Insurance program. Table 2.F7 provides data on the operation of SSA's teleservice centers. ber 1999 2.4 percent cost-of-living increase would have been 2.5 percent in the absence of the 1999 CPI error. SSA also determined that the December 2000 3.5 percent costof-living increase was not affected by the CPI error. SSA issued one-time payments in July 2001 to compensate beneficiaries for any shortfall in their benefits experienced between January 2000 and July 2001. Beginning in August 2001, ongoing benefits were adjusted based on the recalculated CPI. Elimination of Annual Earnings Test for Persons Reaching Full Retirement Age Public Law 106-182, The Senior Citizen's Freedom to Work Act of 2000, enacted April 7, 2000 eliminated the earnings test beginning with the month a beneficiary attains full retirement age (FRA), currently age 65. Elimination of this earnings test is effective for taxable years ending after December 31, 1999. The earnings limit that applies in the year of attainment of FRA is based on the limits previously established for persons at FRA through age 69--$17,000 in 2000; $25,000 in 2001; and $30,000 in 2002. Benefits are withheld at the rate of $1 for every $3 of earnings above these exempt amounts. In determining earnings for purposes of the annual earnings test under this legislation, only earnings before the month of attainment of FRA will be considered. The legislation also permits retired workers to earn delayed retirement credits for any months between the attainment of full retirement age and age 70 for which the worker requests that benefits not be paid. Public Law 106-182 did not change the annual exempt amount for beneficiaries who are under FRA throughout the year, which continues to be pegged to increases in the average wage. This amount increased from $10,080 in 2000 to $10,680 in 2001. Withholding for beneficiaries subject to this earnings test is at $1 for each $2 of earnings over the exempt amounts. Work Incentives Improvement Act The Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act, Public Law 106-170, was enacted on December 17, 1999. This legislation provides major enhancements to SSA's programs that assist disabled beneficiaries who attempt to return to work. It provides beneficiaries more choices in vocational rehabilitation services, and offers expanded health care for beneficiaries who are no longer eligible for cash benefits due to work. Effective October 1, 2000, the Act offers extended Medicare coverage to beneficiaries who return to work, and offers buy-in for Medicaid coverage. The Ticket to Work provisions of this legislation will be phased in over a 3-year period beginning January 1, 2001. The provisions include demonstration projects that will eventually apply a disability earnings test more directed toward individuals' earnings history and circumstances of  Significant Program Changes Program changes occur through legislation or (in areas where authority is delegated to the Commissioner) through regulation. Recent program changes follow: Change in the Consumer Price Index Cost-of-Living Adjustment The consumer price index (CPI), prepared by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) in the Department of Labor, provides the basis for an annual cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) in Social Security and Supplemental Security Income benefits. On September 28, 2000, the BLS announced their discovery of a software error used in the CPI calculation, affecting the calculation for months after 1998. Section 308 of Public Law 106-554, enacted December 21, 2000, requires the Office of Management and Budget and federal agencies that administer benefit programs to determine whether the CPI computation error for 1999 resulted in a shortfall in payments to beneficiaries and to compensate beneficiaries for any such shortfall. The Social Security Administration (SSA) determined that the Decem-  10  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2001   Social Security their reemployment. The Ticket to Work will emphasize and encourage rehabilitation efforts and will reimburse private vocational rehabilitation agencies for their services to beneficiaries attempting to return to work. Also beginning January 1, 2001, former beneficiaries may have their benefits resumed if their work activity ends within 5 years of the month their benefits stopped and they are still disabled. Regulatory Increases in Substantial Gainful Activity and in Trial Work Period Amounts Effective July 1, 1999, the Social Security Administration raised from $500 to $700 the amount of monthly earnings for a nonblind disabled individual to be considered engaging in substantial gainful activity (SGA). Effective January 1, 2001, the top SGA level was raised to $740 per month, with the provision that ongoing SGA levels will be automatically adjusted annually based on increases in the national average wage index. The SGA threshold is part of the definition of disability that requires an individual to be unable to engage in substantial gainful activity to be eligible for benefits. Earnings of more than the top SGA level will ordinarily demonstrate that an individual is engaged in SGA. Earnings of less than $300 per month will ordinarily demonstrate that an individual is not engaged in SGA. Earnings between $300 and the top SGA level will require that consideration be given to circumstances related to the work activity. A different definition of SGA applies to blind persons receiving Social Security disability benefits. Increases in the SGA amount for blind individuals are pegged to increases in the national average wage index and thus were not affected by the 1999 or subsequent rule changes. The level for blind individuals increased from $1,170 in 2000 to $1,240 in 2001. New rules also affect the trial work period (TWP). The TWP allows disability beneficiaries to test their ability to work for at least 9 months. During the TWP, beneficiaries may earn any amount and still receive full benefits. The monthly level at which earnings count toward the 9-month TWP was raised from $200 to $530 effective January 1, 2001, with future increases pegged to the national average wage index. After completion of nine trial work months, the SGA level is used to determine whether earnings are substantial or not. If earnings fall below the SGA level, full benefits generally continue. If earnings are higher than the SGA level, cash benefits are usually suspended while medical benefits continue. Table 2.A30 provides related historical data on disability program earnings guidelines, including reference to recent changes in thresholds for determining substantial gainful activity (SGA).  Coverage and Financing In 2000, about 153 million persons worked in employment or self-employment covered under the OASDI program. In recent years, coverage has become nearly universal for work performed in the United States, including American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Approximately 96 percent of the American workforce are covered by OASDI. Workers excluded from coverage fall into five major categories: (1) Civilian federal employees hired before January 1, 1984, (2) Railroad workers (who are covered under the railroad retirement system, which is coordinated with Social Security), (3) Certain employees of state and local governments who are covered under their employers' retirement systems, (4) Domestic workers and farm workers ings do not meet certain minimum (workers in industry and commerce regardless of the amount of earnings) whose earnrequirements are covered , and  (5) Persons with very low net earnings from selfemployment, generally under $400 annually. 0  Table 2.A1 outlines the history of coverage provisions and table 2.A2 provides a history of provisions regarding noncontributory wage credits, mostly for military service. 0  For most employees, taxes are withheld from wages beginning with the first dollar earned. The exceptions are domestic employees, election workers, and agricultural workers. In 2001, a domestic employee must earn $1,300 from any single employer in a calendar year before FICA is withheld. Most election workers must earn $1,100 in 2001 before FICA is withheld. Most agricultural workers wages are covered if the employer pays more than $2,500 in total wages in a year or if the individual worker earns over $150 in a year from a single employer. Employees, their employers, and the self-employed each pay taxes on earnings in covered employment and self-employment up to an annual maximum taxable amount for OASDI. There is no upper limit on taxable earnings for Medicare Hospital Insurance (HI). The OASDI maximum taxable amount--$80,400 in 2001--is updated automatically each year in relation to increases in the national average annual wage. The current FICA tax rate applicable to both employees and employers is 6.2 percent for OASDI (5.30 percent for OASI and 0.9 percent for DI), and 1.45 percent for HI.  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2001  11   Social Security ment, workers who reach age 62 in 1991 or later need the maximum number of 40 QCs to be fully insured. For workers who become disabled or die before age 62, the number of QCs needed for fully insured status depends on their age at the time the worker is disabled or dies. A minimum of 6 QCs is required regardless of age. Currently Insured If a worker dies before achieving fully insured status, benefits can still be paid to qualified survivors if the worker was ""currently insured"" at the time of death. (In the case of a young worker, survivor benefits are potentially payable to a worker's children and to a widow(er) with children in care.) To be currently insured, the worker must have earned 6 QCs in the 12 quarters before death (that is, 6 of the last 13 quarters, including the quarter in which death occurred). Disability Insured To qualify for disability benefits, a nonblind worker must have recent work activity as well as being fully insured. Under the test involving recent work experience, a nonblind worker older than age 31 must have earned at least 20 QCs among the 40 calendar quarters ending with the quarter in which the disability began. Workers disabled at ages 24 through 30 must have earned QCs in one-half of the calendar quarters elapsing between age 21 and the calendar quarter in which the disability began. Workers under age 24 need 6 QCs in the 12-quarter period ending with the quarter of disability onset. Workers who qualify for benefits based on blindness need only be fully insured. Table 2.A7 summarizes the basic provisions concerning insured status.  See Table 2.A3 for annual amounts of maximum taxable earnings and contribution rates. Table 2.A4 shows historical annual maximum amounts of contributions by employees and self-employed persons. A self-employed person pays the combined employeeemployer rate of 12.4 percent for OASDI and 2.9 for HI under the Self-Employment Contributions Act (SECA). Two deduction provisions reduce the SECA and income tax liability of self-employed persons. The intent of these provisions is to treat the self-employed in much the same manner as employees and employers are treated for purposes of FICA and income taxes. The first provision allows a deduction from net earnings from self-employment equal to the amount of net earnings before the deduction, times one-half the SECA tax rate. The effect of this deduction is intended to be analogous to the treatment of the FICA tax paid by the employer, which is disregarded as remuneration to the employee for FICA and income tax purposes. The second provision allows an income tax deduction, equal to one-half of the amount of the SECA tax paid, which is designed to reflect the income tax deductibility of the employer's share of the FICA tax. Table 2.A5 describes income tax credits for 198489 intended to cushion the impact of increases in FICA and SECA taxes enacted in 1983. The SECA tax credits were replaced, effective 1990, by the deduction provisions described above. Table 2.A6 outlines the history of provisions regarding appropriations from general revenues and interfund borrowing.  Insured Status To become eligible for his or her benefit and benefits for family members or survivors, a worker must earn a minimum number of credits based on work in covered employment or self-employment. These credits are described as quarters of coverage. In 2001, a quarter of coverage (QC) is credited for each $830 in annual covered earnings, up to a maximum of four QCs for the year. Earnings of $3,320 or more in 2001 will give the worker four QCs regardless of when the money is actually earned or paid during the year. The amount of earnings required for a QC is adjusted automatically each year in proportion to increases in the average wage level. Fully Insured Eligibility for most types of benefits requires that the worker be fully insured. To be fully insured a worker must have a number of QCs at least equal to the number of calendar years elapsing between age 21 (or 1950 if later) and the year in which he or she reaches age 62, becomes disabled, or dies--whichever occurs first. Under this require-  International Agreements The President is authorized to enter into international Social Security agreements (also called ""totalization"" agreements) to coordinate the U.S. Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI) program with comparable programs of other countries. The United States currently has Social Security agreements in effect with 18 countries. Agreements with several other countries are in progress.

First, they eliminate dual Social Security coverage, the situation that occurs when a person from one country works in another country and is required to pay Social Security taxes to both countries on the same earnings. Each agreement includes rules that assign a worker's coverage to only one country. The second goal of the agreement is to help fill gaps in benefit protection for workers who have divided their careers between the United States and another country. Such workers may fail to qualify for Social Security benefits from one or both countries because they have not worked long enough to meet minimum eligibility requirements. Under an agreement, these workers and their family members may qualify for a partial U.S. benefit based on ""totalized"" (that is, combined) credits from both countries. Similarly, workers may qualify for partial benefits from the foreign country based on totalized credits. Table 5.M1 provides data on the number of beneficiaries receiving totalization payments, and average benefits. Table 2.A8 shows the indexing factors applicable to the earnings of workers who were first eligible in 1988 2001. Table 2.A9 shows indexed earnings for workers first eligible in 19942001 who had maximum taxable earnings in each year after 1950. For a more detailed technical description of an AIME computation, including a computation worksheet, see the Technical Note ""Computing a Retired-Worker Benefit."" (2) Determining AIME: The period used to calculate AIME equals the number of full calendar years elapsing between age 21 (or 1950, if later) and the year of first eligibility, usually excluding the lowest 5 years. Workers disabled before age 47 have between zero and four excluded years from the computation. At an absolute minimum, two years are used to compute AIME. The actual years used in the computation--the ""computation years""--are the years of highest indexed earnings after 1950, including any years before age 22 or after age 61 as well as the year of disability or death. AIME is calculated as the sum of indexed earnings in the computation period, divided by the number of months in that period. Table 2.A10 provides a historical outline of provisions related to AIME and AMW, and describes variations in the number of dropout years. Tables 2.A15 and 2.A16 describe AMW benefit computations based on the worker's nonindexed earnings after 1936 and 1950, respectively. (Very few persons currently being awarded benefits have PlAs computed under these old-start or new-start computation methods. These methods, particularly the new-start method shown in table 2.A16, are more frequently applicable in earnings re-computations for workers who reached age 62 before 1979.) (3) Computing the PIA: The formula used to compute the PIA from AIME is weighted to provide a higher PIA-to-AIME ratio for workers with comparatively low earnings. The formula applies declining percentage conversion rates to three AIME brackets. For workers who reach age 62, become disabled, or die in 2001, the formula provides a PIA equal to the sum of: 90 percent of the first $561 of AIME, plus 32 percent of the next $2,820 of AIME, plus 15 percent of AIME over $3,381. 0  Benefit Computation and Automatic Adjustment Provisions The primary insurance amount (PIA) is the monthly benefit amount payable to the worker upon retirement at full retirement age or upon entitlement to disability benefits. The PIA is also the base figure from which monthly benefit amounts payable to the worker's family members or survivors are determined. The PIA is derived from the worker's annual taxable earnings, averaged over a period that encompasses most of the worker's adult years. Until the late 1970s, the average monthly wage (AMW) was the earnings measure generally used. For worker's first eligible for benefits after 1978, average indexed monthly earnings (AIME) have replaced the AMW as the usually applicable earnings measure. The PIA computation based on AIME currently involves the following three steps: (1) Indexing of earnings: The worker's annual taxable earnings after 1950 are updated, or indexed, to reflect the general earnings level in the indexing year--the second calendar year before the year in which the worker is first eligible; that is, first reaches age 62, becomes disabled, or dies. Earnings in years after the indexing year are not indexed but instead are counted at their actual value. A worker's earnings for a given year are indexed by multiplying them by the following ratio (indexing factor): The average wage in the national economy for the indexing year, divided by the corresponding average wage figure for the year to be indexed.  Beginning with the first year of eligibility, the PIA is increased by cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs). Table 2.A11 shows the PIA formula and first applicable COLA for workers first eligible in 1979 or later.  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2001  13   Social Security The dollar amounts defining the AIME brackets are referred to as ""bend points."" These bend points (as described in table 2.A11) are updated automatically each year in proportion to increases in the national average wage level. This automatic adjustment ensures that benefit levels for successive generations of eligible workers will keep up with rising earnings levels, thereby assuring consistent rates of earnings replacement from one generation of beneficiaries to the next. The benefit formula applicable to a worker depends on the year of eligibility (or death) rather than on the year benefits are first received. Thus the PIA of a worker retiring at age 65 in 2001 is calculated using the benefit formula that applies to all workers first eligible in 1998 (the ""year of attainment"" of age 62). The PIA derived from that formula is then increased by the COLAs effective for December, 1998, 1999, and 2000 to obtain the PIA effective at age 65. Subsequent recomputations of the worker's benefit, including additional earnings not originally considered, delayed retirement credits or additional COLA increases, all refer to the basic computation that originally applied, based on the year of attainment. Beginning in 1981, benefits have been rounded to the next lower ten cents at each step in the computation. The final benefit payment is rounded to the next lower dollar amount (if not already an even dollar). Prior to 1981, benefits were paid in ten-cent increments after rounding up to the next dime in each computation step. A cost-of-living increase in benefits generally is established each year if the consumer price index for urban wage earners and clerical workers (CPI-W), prepared by the Department of Labor, indicates a percentage increase (after rounding) of at least 0.1 percent between two specified quarters. The arithmetical mean of the CPI-W for July, August, and September in the year of determination is compared with the arithmetical mean of the CPI-W for the later of (a) July, August, and September in the year in which the last effective cost-of-living increase was established or (b) the 3 months of the calendar quarter in which the effective month of the last general benefit increase occurred. The percentage increase in the CPI-W, rounded to the nearest 0.1 percent, represents the size of the increase in benefits, effective for December of the year in which the determination is made. Under certain conditions, depending on the size of the combined OASDI trust funds relative to estimated disbursements, the applicability and size of a cost-of-living adjustment may be determined under an alternative method, called the ""stabilizer provision."" In no case, however, are benefits reduced below the level of benefits in the year of determination. Historically, this provision has never been triggered.  Table 2.A18 presents a history of provisions relating to the automatic adjustment of benefits, including a description of the stabilizer provision. In addition, table 2.A18 includes a summary history and description of provisions relating to the annual automatic adjustment of (1) the maximum amount of taxable and creditable earnings, (2) the dollar amount needed to establish a quarter of coverage, (3) the bend points defining the AIME brackets in the PIA formula and the PIA brackets in the maximum family benefit formula, and (4) the exempt amounts under the earnings (retirement) test. All of these adjustments are linked to increases in the level of the national average annual wage, rather than to increases in the CPI. Table 2.A19 illustrates the cumulative effect of statutory and automatic increases in benefits for workers who have been in benefit status over varying time periods. Alternative PIA Computation Provisions  Special minimum PIA.--Workers with low earnings but steady attachment to the workforce over most of their adult years may qualify for monthly benefits based on the special minimum PIA computation. This computation does not depend on the worker's average earnings, but on the number of coverage years--years in which the worker had earnings equal to or above a specified amount. The level of the special minimum PIA is the same for workers having the same number of coverage years, regardless of age or year of first eligibility. Increases in the special minimum PIA are linked to cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs). See table 2.A12 for additional information on the special minimum PIA.  Windfall Elimination Provision PIA.--WEP affects persons who receive a pension based on noncovered work after 1956 and Social Security benefits. First eligibility for the noncovered pension and Social Security benefits must be after December 31, 1985 for WEP to apply. WEP reduces the Social Security PIA upon which SSA benefits are based and affects all benefits paid on that record, except survivors. The WEP reduction ceases when entitlement to the pension payment ends, the wage earner dies, or the wage earner earns a total of 30 years of substantial Social Security earnings. The WEP reduction amount is never more than one-half of the noncovered pension. A WEP PIA is generally based on 40 percent of the first bend point instead of 90 percent as with the regular PIA:  14  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2001   Social Security Example: A retired worker with a noncovered pension of $2,000 a month and less than 20 years of covered employment attains age 62 in 2001. Normal PIA, based on AIME of $800: $561 x .90 = $504.90 $239 x .32 = $76.48 PIA = $581.30 WEP PIA, based on AIME of $800: $561 x .40 = $224.40 $239 x .32 = $76.48 PIA = $300.80 If a worker has more than 20 years of substantial covered earnings, the WEP PIA begins to increase. With the 21st year of substantial covered earnings, the first bend point percentage is increased by 5 percentage points. This rate of increase applies for each additional year of substantial covered earnings, through the 30th year of substantial earnings at which point WEP no longer applies. After 23 years of substantial coverage, for example, the first bend point percentage would be 55 percent. Thirty years of substantial earnings would yield a first bend point percentage of 90 percent (the normal percentage of the first bend point). Examples of pensions subject to WEP are U.S. Civil Service Retirement System annuities, retirement benefits based on foreign earnings, and state and local pensions based on noncovered earnings. Table 2.A11.1 provides more detail about the WEP computation and contains the amounts of substantial earnings for years after 1990. Substantial earnings for earlier years are listed in table 2.A12.  For information on family maximum provisions, as described here, see table 2.A13 (comparison of family maximums to the PIAs on which they are based), and table 2.A14 (disability family maximums). Table 2.A17 shows the maximum family benefit amounts applicable in cases of first eligibility before 1979.  Benefit Types and Levels Retired and Disabled Workers The full retirement age (FRA) is the earliest age at which an unreduced retirement benefit is payable (sometimes referred to as the ""normal retirement age""). The age for full retirement benefits is scheduled to rise gradually from age 65 to age 67, with the first incremental increase affecting workers who reach age 62 in the year 2000. Workers over age 62 who retire before FRA can receive reduced benefits. The monthly rate of reduction from the full retirement benefit (that is, the PIA) is 5/9 of 1 percent a month for the first 36 months immediately preceding FRA. The reduction rate is 5/12 of 1 percent a month for any additional months. The maximum overall reduction for early retirement will have risen from 20 percent to 30 percent by 2022, when age 67 becomes the full retirement age. If a disabled worker receives a reduced retirement benefit for months before disability entitlement, the disability benefit is reduced by the number of months for which he or she received the reduced benefit. For workers who postpone their retirement beyond the full retirement age, benefits are increased for each month of nonpayment beyond that age. This increase is called a ""delayed retirement credit,"" and is potentially available for any or all months following attainment of the full retirement age (currently a maximum of 60 months for persons age 65). The annual rate of increase for delayed retirement credits is 6-1/2 percent for workers who reach age 62 in 1999 or 2000, 7 percent in 2001 and 2002, and will eventually rise to 8 percent for workers reaching age 62 in 2005 or later. Spouses and Children of Workers Spouses receive 50 percent of the worker's PIA (regardless of the worker's actual benefit amount), if the spouse has attained the full retirement age at entitlement to spousal benefits. The spouse of a retired or disabled worker can elect monthly benefits as early as age 62. These benefits are reduced at the rate of 25/36 of 1 percent a month for the first 36 months immediately preceding FRA and 5/12 of 1 percent for each additional month. Children of retired or disabled workers are also eligible to receive monthly benefits. The term ""child"" refers to a child under the age of 18, a child aged 1819 attending elementary or secondary school full time, or to an adult child,  Family maximum provisions.--Monthly benefits payable to the worker and family members or to the worker's survivors are subject to a maximum family benefit amount. The family maximum level for retired-worker families or survivor families usually ranges from 150 percent to 188 percent of the worker's PIA. The maximum benefit for disabled-worker families is the smaller of 85 percent of AIME (or 100 percent of PIA, if larger) or 150 percent of the PIA. Like the formula for determining the PIA, the maximum family benefit formula applicable to a worker depends on the year of first eligibility (that is, the year of attainment of age 62, onset of disability, or death). Once the worker's maximum family benefit amount for the year of first eligibility is determined, it is updated in line with the COLAs.

In addition, young spouses (that is, those under the age of 62) who care for a worker's entitled child may also be eligible. For purposes of defining young spouses' benefits, the term ""child"" refers to a child under age 16, or to an adult child of the worker who was disabled prior to age 22. Children of retired or disabled workers can receive up to 50 percent of the worker's PIA, as can young spouses. (The benefit of a young spouse is not reduced for age.) Monthly benefits payable to the spouse and children of a retired or disabled worker are limited to a family maximum amount, as discussed earlier. Benefits are payable to unmarried divorced spouses of retirement age who were married at least 10 years to the worker. A divorced spouse benefit is excluded from family maximum provisions. Divorced spouses age 62 or older and divorced for 2 or more years (after marriage of 10 or more years) may be independently entitled on the record of the ex-spouse if the ex-spouse could be entitled if he or she applied. Survivors Benefits Widows and widowers of fully insured workers are eligible for unreduced benefits at full retirement age (FRA), currently age 65. As with retired workers and spouses, widows' and widowers' FRA will gradually increase to age 67. Widows and widowers can elect reduced monthly benefits at age 60 or, if disabled, as early as age 50. Surviving divorced spouses can also receive benefits if married to the worker for at least 10 years and not remarried before age 60 (age 50 if disabled). For survivors whose full benefit retirement age is 65, the monthly rate of reduction for the first 60 months immediately preceding FRA is 19/40 of 1 percent of the worker's PIA, with a maximum reduction of 28.5 percent at age 60. For survivors whose full benefit retirement age is over 65, the amount of reduction for each month prior to FRA is adjusted accordingly to ensure that the maximum reduction at age 60 remains 28.5 percent of the worker's PIA. Benefits for widows and widowers are increased if the deceased worker delayed retirement beyond the FRA. In these cases, the survivor benefits include any delayed retirement credits the deceased worker had earned. Conversely, if the worker had elected early retirement, widows' and widowers' benefits are limited for widows and widowers first entitled to survivor benefits at age 62 or later. For these beneficiaries, the benefit is the higher of 82.5 percent of the worker's PIA or the amount the worker would be receiving if still alive. Disabled widows and widowers ages 5060 receive the age 60 widow's rate (71.5 percent of PIA) regardless of their age at the time of entitlement. Children of deceased workers and mothers and fathers under FRA are eligible to receive monthly benefits up to 75 percent of the worker's PIA if the worker died either fully or currently insured. Mothers and fathers must be caring for the worker's entitled child who is either under age 16 or disabled. A dependent parent aged 62 or older is eligible for monthly benefits equal to 82.5 percent of the worker's PIA. Each of two dependent parents can qualify for benefits equal to 75 percent of the deceased worker's PIA. Monthly benefits payable to survivors are reduced to conform to the family maximum benefit payable on the deceased worker's account. Benefits for a surviving divorced spouse, however, are disregarded when computing the maximum family benefit. See table 2.A20 for more information on the increases in the full (or ""normal"") retirement age for workers. Table 2.A21 describes age-related reductions for dependent beneficiaries, as does table 2.A22 (widows and widowers). Additionally, tables 2.A23 and 2.A24 show the history of legislation relating to special monthly benefits payable to certain persons born before January 2, 1900. Table 2.A25 summarizes the history of certain OASDI benefits other than monthly benefit payments. Table 2.A26 presents illustrative monthly benefit amounts for selected beneficiary families, based on hypothetical earnings histories representing five different earnings levels. Table 2.A27 shows minimum and maximum monthly benefits payable to retired workers retiring at age 62 in various years beginning with 1957 (the first full year benefits became available at age 62). Table 2.A28 shows minimum and maximum monthly benefits payable to retired workers retiring at age 65 in various years beginning with 1940.  Effect of Current Earnings on Benefits Beneficiaries under age 65 with earnings in excess of certain exempt amounts may have all or part of their benefits withheld as a result of the annual earnings test (AET) provisions of the Social Security Act. For those aged 65 or older, however, there have been recent changes to AET provisions. Amendments in 1996 eased the impact of AET provisions, while changes in 2000 removed the AET altogether for beneficiaries aged 65 and older. Public Law 104121, enacted March 29, 1996 substantially raised the exempt amounts under the annual earnings test for persons who have reached full retirement age. These amounts are $12,500 in 1996; $13,500 in 1997; $14,500 in 1998; $15,500 in 1999; $17,000 in 2000; $25,000 in 2001; and $30,000 in 2002. After 2002, the annual exempt amount will be indexed to the growth in average wages. Benefits are withheld at the rate of $1 in benefits for every $3 of earnings above the age 65 exempt amount. Public Law 106-182, enacted April 7, 2000 eliminated the earnings test beginning with the month a beneficiary reaches full retirement age (FRA). The annual earnings test that applies in the year one attains FRA is based on the  16  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2001   Social Security more generous annual limits established under P.L. 104121 (including the $1 for $3 withholding rate). In determining annual earnings for purposes of the annual earnings test, only earnings before the month of attainment of age 65 will be counted. Public Laws 104-121 and 106-182 did not change the annual exempt amount for beneficiaries who are under age 65 throughout the year. This annual amount continues to be pegged to increases in average wages. The amounts are $10,080 in 2000, and $10,680 in 2001. When the annual earnings limit affects working beneficiaries under age 65, benefits are withheld at the rate of $1 for every $2 of earnings above the exempt amount. Individuals have the option to receive reduced benefits under a monthly earnings test if it is to their advantage to do so. This option is usually exercised in the first year of retirement, as in that year the monthly test permits payment for some months even if the annual earnings limit is greatly exceeded. Under the monthly test, beneficiaries receive a full monthly benefit for months in which they do not earn over an amount equal to 1/12 of the annual earnings limit. The monthly earnings test is applied to the self-employed based on hours they work instead of monthly earnings. Generally, beneficiaries are eligible for the monthly earnings test in only one year. Table 2.A29 provides historical detail on the retirement test. Beneficiaries entitled on the basis of their own disability--disabled workers, disabled adult children, and disabled widows and widowers--are not subject to the earnings test. Substantial earnings by disabled beneficiaries, however, may indicate that they are able to do work which constitutes substantial gainful activity (SGA) and are therefore no longer disabled. Although other factors are considered, numerical earnings thresholds are used in a determination of SGA. Table 2.A30 provides historical thresholds for determining substantial gainful activity (SGA). For married beneficiaries filing jointly with adjusted gross income under $32,000 a year, no Social Security benefits are subject to taxation. If adjusted gross income exceeds $32,000 but is under $44,000, the amount of benefits included in gross income is the lesser of one-half of income over $32,000. If a couple's adjusted gross income exceeds $44,000, the amount of benefits included in gross income is 85 percent of income over $44,000 plus the lesser of $6,000 or one-half of benefits. However, no more than 85 percent of benefits are subject to income tax. The income thresholds for single beneficiaries are $25,000 and $32,000. If members of a married couple are filing separately, they do not have a minimum threshold if they lived together any time during the tax year. The amount of benefits included in gross income is the lesser of 85 percent of Social Security or Tier 1 Railroad Retirement benefits, or 85 percent of all income as defined above. Like all matters dealing with tax liability, taxation of Social Security benefits fall under the jurisdiction of the Internal Revenue Service. Table 2.A31 shows the history of provisions related to taxation of Social Security benefits. Table 2.A32 offers examples to illustrate when benefits are taxable, and the amount subject to taxation.  Taxation of Benefits Up to 85 percent of Social Security benefits may be subject to federal income tax depending on the beneficiary's income, marital status, and filing status. The definition of income for this provision is as follows: Adjusted gross income (before Social Security or Railroad Retirement benefits are considered), plus tax-exempt interest income, with further modification of adjusted gross income in some cases involving certain tax provisions of limited applicability among the beneficiary population; plus onehalf of Social Security and Tier 1 Railroad Retirement benefits.

Disabled workers  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2001  21   Supplemental Security Income  Supplemental Security Income The Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program provides income support to persons aged 65 or older, blind or disabled adults, and blind or disabled children. Eligibility requirements and federal payment standards are nationally uniform. The 2001 federal SSI benefit rate for an individual living in his or her own household and with no countable income is $531 monthly; for a couple (with both husband and wife eligible), the SSI benefit rate is $796 monthly. Payments under SSI began in January 1974. It replaced the former federal-state adult assistance programs in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Residents of the Northern Mariana Islands became eligible for SSI in January 1998. Under the SSI program, each eligible person is provided a monthly cash payment based on a statutory federal benefit rate. Since 1975, these rates have been increased by the same percentage as the cost-of-living increases in OASDI benefits. If an individual or couple is living in another person's household and is receiving both food and shelter from the person in whose household they are living, the federal benefit rate is reduced by one-third. This is done instead of determining the actual dollar value of the in-kind support and maintenance. For institutionalized persons, the eligibility requirements and payment standards depend on the type of institution. With some exceptions, inmates of public institutions are ineligible for SSI. For persons institutionalized for a complete calendar month, a maximum federal SSI payment of $30 per month applies where (1) the institution receives a substantial part of the cost of the person's care from the Medicaid program, or (2) recipients' under age 18 have private health insurance making payments to the institution. Other eligible persons in institutions may receive up to the full federal benefit rate. The federal payment is based on the individual's countable income. The first $20 monthly in OASDI benefits or other earned or unearned income is not counted. Also excluded is $65 monthly of earnings plus one-half of any earnings above $65. For example, a person living in his or her own household, whose sole income is a $200 monthly OASDI benefit, would receive $351 in federal SSI payments: $531 - ($200 - $20) = ($531 -$180) = $351. 0  A person whose income consists of $500 in gross monthly earnings would receive $323.50 in federal SSI payments: $531 - (($500 - $85) / 2 = $207.50 countable earnings. Federal benefit rate $531 - $207.50 = $323.50 federal SSI. 0  Individuals generally are not eligible for SSI if they have resources in excess of $2,000 (or $3,000 for a couple). Certain resources are excluded, most commonly a home, an automobile used for essential transportation, and household goods and personal insurance of reasonable value, burial plots and spaces, and life insurance. States have the option to supplement the federal SSI payment for all or selected categories of persons, regardless of previous state program eligibility. Initially, states were required to supplement to assure that recipients did not suffer a loss in total income from the former state programs. Most of these ""converted"" cases have now left the rolls.  22  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2001   Supplemental Security Income  Chart 1.

Aged: Any person aged 65 or older. Blind: Any person with 20/200 lenses, or with tunnel vision of to the Blind (AB) program is eli continues to meet the October or less vision in the better eye with the use of correcting 20 degrees or less. An individual transferred from a state Aid gible if he/she received such state aid in December 1973 and 1972 state definition of blindness.  Disabled: Any person unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment expected to result in death or that has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of at least 12 months. For a child under age 18, eligibility is based on disability of severity comparable with that of an adult. An individual transferred from a state Aid to the Permanently and Totally Disabled (APTD) program to SSI is also eligible if he/she received such state aid in December 1973 and continues to meet the October 1972 state definition of disability. 1973 Public Law 93-233, enacted December 31 Only persons who had received APTD before July 1973 and were on the rolls in December 1973 may receive SSI on the basis of the state definition of disability; those who became eligible for state aid from July to December 1973 must meet the federal definition of disability. A disabled recipient who loses federal SSI eligibility because of earnings at the substantial gainful activity level may continue to receive a special benefit under section 1619 and retain eligibility for Medicaid under title XIX of the Social Security Act. This special benefit status may continue as long as the recipient has the disabling impairment and meets all nondisability SSI eligibility criteria. States have the option of supplementing this special benefit. This provision of the law was in effect from January 1, 1981, through December 31, 1983. Beginning in January 1984, under a 1-year demonstration project, this provision was continued for persons already eligible for either regular SSI payments or special monthly benefits. 1984 Public Law 98-460, enacted October 9 1986 Public Law 99-643, enacted November 10 The special benefit and Medicaid provisions of the 1980 legislation were extended through June 30, 1987 (retroactive to January 1, 1984). The special benefit and Medicaid provisions of the 1980 amendments are made permanent. The provisions were amended effective July 1, 1987, with significant modifications to simplify administration and to allow free movement between regular SSI disability payments and either the special cash benefit or Medicaid eligibility under section 1619. The distinction between a disabled person eligible for regular SSI payments and one eligible for 1619(a) is that the latter has several months with gross earnings above the SGA level. Previously, section 1619(a) status required completion of a trial work period and the determination that the work was SGA. For individuals under age 18, the ""comparable severity"" standard is eliminated and replaced with a requirement that a child be considered disabled if he/she has a medically determin-  1980 Public Law 96-265, enacted June 9  1996 Public Law 104-193, enacted August 22  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2001  25   SSI: History of Provisions  able impairment that results in ""marked and severe functional limitations,"" and meets the existing statutory duration requirement. The law also eliminates references to ""maladaptive behaviors"" in the Listing of Impairments for children, and discontinues the use of individualized functional assessments for children. SSI eligibility is prohibited for an individual in any month during which such an individual is a fugitive felon, fleeing prosecution, or violating state or federal conditions of probation or parole. In addition, SSI eligibility is prohibited for 10 years for those convicted of fraudulently claiming residence to obtain benefits simultaneously in two or more states.1 Other Eligibility Provisions Citizenship and Residence 1972 Public Law 92-603, enacted October 30 The individual must reside within izen or an alien lawfully admitted United States under color of law. dar month lose their eligibility for one of the 50 states or the District of Columbia and be a citfor permanent residence or permanently residing in the Persons living outside the United States for an entire calensuch a month.  1976 Public Law 94-241, enacted March 24 1980 Public Law 96-265, enacted June 9  Eligibility for SSI is extended to residents of the Northern Mariana Islands, effective January 9, 1978. The income and resources of the immigration sponsors of aliens applying for SSI are considered in determining eligibility for and the amount of payment. After allowances for the needs of the sponsor and his/her family, the remainder is deemed available for the support of the alien applicant for a 3-year period after admission to the United States for permanent residence. This provision does not apply to those who become blind or disabled after admission, to refugees, or to persons granted political asylum. (See ""Deeming of Income and Resources"" on page 30. for subsequent changes to sponsor-to-alien deeming provisions.) SSI eligibility is continued for a disabled or blind child who was receiving SSI benefits while living in the United States and is now living with a parent who is a member of the U.S. Armed Forces assigned to permanent duty ashore outside the United States, but not where the parent is stationed in Puerto Rico or the territories and possessions of the United States. Above provision made applicable where the parent is a member of the U.S. Armed Forces and stationed in Puerto Rico or the territories and possessions of the United States. Prohibits SSI eligibility for anyone who is not a U.S. citizen or national unless they are in a ""qualified alien"" category and meet one of certain exceptions such as lawful permanent residents who earn or can be credited with 40 qualifying quarters of earnings, certain refugee type categories eligible for up to 5 years of time limited eligibility, or active duty U.S. military or veterans and their spouses and children. Extends eligibility for aliens receiving SSI as of August 22, 1996 (the enactment date of the law) for 1 year after the enactment date for those aliens found ineligible under the new standards.  1989 Public Law 101-239, enacted December 19  1993 Public Law 103-66, enacted August 10 1996 Public Law 104-193, enacted August 22  1  This last provision was repealed in 1999 by Public Law 106-169 and replaced with a provision providing for nonpayment of benefits for up to 24 months for making false or misleading statements regarding material facts.  26  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2001   SSI: History of Provisions  Public Law 104-208, enacted September 30 1997 Public Law 105-18, enacted June 12  Amends Public Law 104-193 to add to the list of ""qualified aliens"" certain noncitizens (and their children) who have been battered or subjected to extreme cruelty by a spouse or parent or a member of the spouse's or parent's family living in the same household. Extends eligibility for aliens receiving SSI as of August 22, 1996, until September 30, 1997, for those found ineligible under the new alien standards of Public Law 104-193. Further amends Public Law 104-193 to add Cuban and Haitian entrants, and the child of a parent who has been battered or subjected to extreme cruelty, to the list of qualified aliens. Provides that Cuban and Haitian entrants and Amerasian immigrants qualify for time limited eligibility, and increases the time limit from 5 to 7 years for all categories. Additional exceptions are added for qualified aliens: (1) lawfully residing in the United States and receiving SSI benefits on August 22, 1996; and (2) lawfully residing in the United States on August 22, 1996 and meeting the definition of blind or disabled in the Social Security Act. Certain noncitizen American Indians are excepted from the alien nonpayment provisions of Public Law 104-193. Extends eligibility for ""nonqualified aliens"" receiving SSI as of August 22, 1996, until September 30, 1998.  Public Law 105-33, enacted August 5  1998 Public Law 105-306, enacted October 28 2000 Public Law 106-386, enacted October 28 1980 Public Law 96-272, enacted June 17  Permanently extends eligibility of all remaining ""nonqualified aliens"" who were receiving SSI benefits when Public Law 104-193 was enacted on August 22, 1996. Noncitizens, regardless of their immigration status, may be eligible for SSI as refugees, if they are determined to be victims of ""severe forms of trafficking in persons."" Other Benefits SSI applicants and recipients are not required as a condition of eligibility to elect to receive Veterans Administration pensions under the Veterans and Survivors' Pension Improvement Act of 1978 if the state of residence lacks a medically needy program under title XIX. Drug Addiction and Alcoholism (DA&A)  1972 Public Law 92-603, enacted October 30  Any disabled individual who has been medically determined to be an alcoholic or drug addict must accept appropriate treatment, if available, in an approved facility and demonstrate compliance with conditions and requirements for treatment. SSI payments are required to be made through a representative payee--another person or public or private agency designated by SSA to manage the recipient's benefit on his/her behalf.  1994 Public Law 103-296, enacted August 15  Any individual who is receiving SSI based on a disability where drug addiction or alcoholism is a contributing factor material to the finding of disability must comply with the DA&A treatment requirements. The individual must accept appropriate treatment when it is available and comply with the conditions and terms of treatment. Instances of noncompliance with the requirements result in progressively longer payment suspensions. Before payments can resume, the individual must demonstrate compliance for specific periods; 2 months, 3 months, and 6 months, respectively, for the first, second, third and subsequent instances of noncompliance. An individual who is not in compliance with the DA&A treatment requirements for 12 consecutive months shall not be eligible for payments; however, this does not prevent such individuals from reapplying and again becoming eligible for payments.  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2001  27   SSI: History of Provisions  SSI disability payments based on DA&A are also limited to a total of 36 benefit months (beginning March 1995) regardless of whether appropriate treatment is available. Months for which benefits are not due and received do not count towards the 36-month limit. Payments based on DA&A must be made to a representative payee. Preference is required to be given to community based nonprofit social service agencies and federal, state, or local government agencies in representative payee selection. These agencies when serving as payees for individuals receiving payments based on DA&A may retain the lesser of 10 percent of the monthly benefit or $56 (indexed to the consumer price index (CPI)) as compensation for their services. Establishment of one or more referral and monitoring agencies for each state is required. 1996 Public Law 104-121, enacted March 29 An individual is not considered disabled if DA&A is a contributing factor material to a finding of disability. Applies DA&A representative payee requirements enacted under Public Law 103-296 to disabled SSI recipients who have a DA&A condition and are incapable of managing their benefits. In addition, these recipients shall be referred to the appropriate state agency administering the state plan for substance abuse treatment. Institutionalization 1972 Public Law 92-603, enacted October 30 An individual who is an inmate of a public institution is ineligible for SSI payments unless the institution is a facility approved for Medicaid payments and is receiving such payments on behalf of the person. Under regulations, the Medicaid payment must represent more than 50 percent of the cost of services provided by the facility to the individual. An inmate of a publicly operated community residence serving no more than 16 persons may, if otherwise eligible, receive SSI. Payments may be made to persons who are residents of public emergency shelters for the homeless for a period of up to 3 months in any 12-month period. Effective July 1, 1987, disabled or blind recipients who were receiving special SSI payments or had special SSI recipient status under section 1619 in the month preceding the first full month of institutionalization, may receive payments based on the full federal benefit rate for the initial 2 full months of institutionalization, if they reside in certain public medical, psychiatric or Medicaid facilities, or in private Medicaid facilities. Effective January 1, 1988, payments may be made to persons who are residents of public emergency shelters for the homeless, for up to 6 months in a 9-month period. Effective July 1, 1988, continued payment of SSI benefits for up to 3 months is permitted, at the rate that was applicable in the month prior to the first full month of institutionalization, for individuals whose expected institutional stay on admission is not likely to exceed 3 months, as certified by a physician, and for whom the receipt of benefits is necessary to maintain living arrangements to which they may return. 1996 Public Law 104-193, enacted August 22 Effective December 1996, institutionalized children under age 18 whose private health insurance is making payments to the institution may receive no more than $30 per month in federal SSI.  1976 Public Law 94-566, enacted October 20 1983 Public Law 98-21, enacted April 20 1986 Public Law 99-643, enacted November 10  1987 Public Law 100-203, enacted December 22  28  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2001   SSI: History of Provisions  Vocational Rehabilitation and Treatment 1972 Public Law 92-603, enacted October 30 1976 Public Law 94-566, enacted October 20 Blind or disabled individuals receiving federal SSI benefits who are under age 65, must be referred to the state agency providing services under the Vocational Rehabilitation Act and must accept the services offered.

Blind or disabled children under age 16 must be referred to the state agency administering crippled children's services or to another agency designated by the state. States are reimbursed for the cost of services. Of funds provided for these services, at least 90 percent must be used for children under age 6 or for those who have never attended public schools. 1980 Public Law 96-265, enacted June 9 Disabled SSI recipients who medically recover while enrolled in approved vocational rehabilitation programs of state VR agencies, may continue to receive benefits during their participation in such programs if the Commissioner of Social Security determines that continuation in the program will increase the probability that they leave the rolls permanently. Funding no longer provided under title XVI for medical, social, developmental and rehabilitative services to disabled or blind children. Reimbursement for the cost of rehabilitation services will be made if the services result in the recipient's return to work. 1984 Public Law 98-460, enacted October 9 Authorizes the reimbursement of states for the cost of VR services provided to individuals who (1) continue to receive benefits after medical recovery because they are participating in a state VR program or (2) refuse, without good cause, to continue in or cooperate with the VR program in which they had been participating. Provision for continuation of payments to SSI recipients who have medically recovered while enrolled in an approved vocational rehabilitation program extended to blind SSI recipients. Reimbursement authorized for the cost of vocational rehabilitation services provided in months in which the individual was not receiving federal SSI payments, if:  1981 Public Law 97-35, enacted August 13  1987 Public Law 100-203, enacted December 22 1990 Public Law 101-508, enacted November 5   SSI recipient status for Medicaid eligibility purposes was retained under work incentive provisions, or   Benefits were in suspense2 status (for a reason other than cessation of disability or blindness), or   Federally administered state supplementation was received. Extends the provision providing for benefit continuation to SSI recipients who medically recover while participating in a state VR program to include SSI recipients participating in a non-state VR program.  2  Recipients who have lost eligibility for SSI benefits for fewer than 13 consecutive months are in suspended payment status.  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2001  29   SSI: History of Provisions  1999 Public Law 106-170, enacted December 17  Establishes a program which will provide SSI (and OASDI) disability beneficiaries with a ticket that can be used to obtain vocational rehabilitation services, employment services, or other support services, from an employment network of their choice. Continuing Disability Reviews and Eligibility Redeterminations  1994 Public Law 103-296, enacted August 15  During each of fiscal years 1996, 1997, and 1998, requires SSA to conduct continuing disability reviews (CDRs) on a minimum of 100,000 SSI recipients. In addition, during the same period, requires SSA to redetermine the SSI eligibility of at least one-third of all childhood SSI recipients who reach age 18 after April 1995 during the 1-year period following attainment of age 18. Redeterminations for persons turning age 18 could count toward the 100,000 CDR requirement. Repeals the requirement that SSA redetermine the eligibility of at least one-third of all childhood SSI recipients who reach age 18 after April 1995 during the 1-year period following attainment of age 18. Requires a CDR:  1996 Public Law 104-193, enacted August 22   At least once every 3 years for SSI recipients under age 18 who are eligible by reason of an impairment which is likely to improve, and   Not later than 12 months after birth for recipients whose low birth weight is a contributing factor material to the determination of their disability. Requires eligibility redetermination for all childhood SSI recipients eligible for the month before the month in which they attain age 18. Requires redetermination of eligibility for children considered disabled based on an individual functional assessment and/or consideration of maladaptive behavior. Requires the representative payee of a childhood disability recipient whose continuing eligibility is being reviewed to present evidence that the recipient is receiving treatment which is considered medically necessary and available for the condition which was the basis for providing SSI benefits. 1997 Public Law 105-33, enacted August 5 Modifies provision of Public Law 104-193 to extend from 12 to 18 months the period for redetermining the disability of children under age 18 under the new childhood disability standard. Modifies provision of Public Law 104-193 to permit SSA to schedule a CDR for a disabled child for whom low birth weight is a contributing factor material to the determination of disability, at a date after the child's first birthday if the Commissioner determines the impairment is not expected to improve within 12 months of the child's birth. Modifies provision of Public Law 104-193 to provide SSA the authority to make redeterminations of disabled childhood recipients who attain age 18, more than 1 year after the date such recipient attains age 18. 1999 Public Law 106-170, enacted December 17 Prohibits the initiation of a CDR during the period that a recipient is using a ""ticket"" to work.  Deeming of Income and Resources 1972 Public Law 92-603, enacted October 30 Deeming occurs when the income and resources of certain family members living in the same household with the SSI recipient are considered in determining the amount of the SSI  30  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2001   SSI: History of Provisions  payment. These family members are the ineligible spouse of an adult recipient and the ineligible parents of a child recipient under age 21. After deduction of personal allocations for the spouse (or parents) and for ineligible children in the home, and after application of income exclusions, any remaining income of the spouse (or parents) is added to the income of the eligible person. 1980 Public Law 96-265, enacted June 9 1989 Public Law 101-239, enacted December 19 Children aged 18 or older are not subject to parental deeming. Sponsor 's income and resources deemed to an alien for 3 years. Disabled children receiving home care services under state Medicaid programs, who are ineligible for SSI because of deeming of parental income, and who received SSI benefits limited to $30 while in a medical treatment facility may receive the $30 monthly allowance that would be payable if the recipient were institutionalized. Sponsor-to-alien deeming period extended from 3 years to 5 years, effective January 1, 1994, through September 30, 1996. Considers an ineligible spouse or parent who is absent from the household due to active military service to be a member of the household for deeming purposes. 1996 Public Law 104-193, enacted August 22 Deeming of income and resources from an immigration sponsor to a noncitizen continues until citizenship, with exceptions for those who earn, or can be credited with, 40 qualifying quarters of earnings. Effective for those whose sponsor signs a new legally enforceable affidavit of support. Amends Public Law 104-193 to add two exceptions to the sponsor-to-alien deeming:  1993 Public Law 103-152, enacted November 24  Public Law 104-208, enacted September 30   Provides that if the noncitizen is indigent and would be unable to obtain food and shelter without SSI benefits even after receiving support from the sponsor, then only the amount of income and resources actually provided by the sponsor will be counted for a 12-month period after a determination of indigence; and   Provides that in certain cases, deeming would not apply for a 12-month period (with some options for extension) if the noncitizen (or his/her children) has been battered, or subjected to extreme cruelty by family members. 1997 Public Law 105-33, enacted August 5 Amends Public Law 104-208 to add an additional exception to sponsor-to-alien deeming when the parent of a noncitizen has been battered or subjected to extreme cruelty by family members. Federal Benefit Payments Federal Benefit Rates Basic benefit standards are used in computing the amount of federal SSI payments. Benefit levels differ for individuals and couples living in households and for persons in Medicaid institutions. Individuals or couples living in their own households receive the full federal benefit. If an individual or couple is living in another person's household and receiving support and maintenance there, the federal benefit is reduced by one-third. The federal benefit rates for persons in households are increased annually to reflect increases in the cost of living. Legislation affecting the level of federal benefit rates since the inception of the SSI program are summarized in table 2.B1.  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2001  31   SSI: History of Provisions  Windfall Offset 1980 Public Law 96-265, enacted June 9 1984 Public Law 98-617, enacted November 8 1982 Public Law 97-248, enacted September 3 1996 Public Law 104-193, enacted August 22 Offset (by reduction of retroactive Social Security benefits) to prevent persons whose initial OASDI payment is retroactive from receiving more in total benefits for the same period than if they were paid the benefits when regularly due. Offset provision expanded to allow for reduction of retroactive SSI benefits and to apply in cases of OASDI benefit reinstatement. Proration of Benefit Benefit for first month of eligibility to be prorated by the number of days in the month for which an application has been filed and there is eligibility. Changes the effective date of an SSI application to the first day of the month following the date on which the application was filed or on which the individual first becomes eligible, whichever is later. This, in effect, eliminates prorated payments in initial claims. Retrospective Monthly Accounting 1981 Public Law 97-35, enacted August 13 1984 Public Law 98-369, enacted July 18 1987 Public Law 100-203, enacted December 22 Changes the method of computing the SSI benefit to one under which the benefit amount is computed on a monthly basis and is based on income and other characteristics in the previous (or second previous) month. Changes the method of computing the SSI benefit to persons receiving title II payments. The effect of the increased title II income at the time of the cost-of-living increase is not delayed as it otherwise would be. Provides an exception to retrospective monthly accounting so that amounts received under Aid to Families With Dependent Children (AFDC), foster care, refugee cash assistance, Cuban-Haitian entrant assistance, or general and child welfare assistance provided by the Bureau of Indian Affairs are counted only in the month received. Changes the method of computing the SSI benefit to persons receiving the value of the one-third reduction. The effect of the increased value at the time of the cost-of-living increase is not delayed as it otherwise would be. Effective January 1995. Uncashed Checks 1981 Public Law 97-35, enacted August 13 1987 Public Law 100-86, enacted August 10 1982 Public Law 97-248, enacted September 3 States that have federally administered supplements to be credited their share of SSI checks that remain unnegotiated for 180 days. SSI checks now unnegotiable after 1 year. States are credited their share of SSI checks after 1 year rather than 180 days. Rounding of Payment Amounts Cost-of-living adjustments in the federal SSI benefit and income eligibility levels are to be rounded to the next lower whole dollar, after the adjustment is calculated. Subsequent costof-living adjustments will be calculated on the previous year 's benefit standard before rounding.  1993 Public Law 103-66, enacted August 10  32  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2001   SSI: History of Provisions  Penalties Resulting in Nonpayment of Benefits 1999 Public Law 106-169, enacted December 14 Provides a penalty under the SSI program for the disposal of resources at less than fair market value.

Interim Assistance Reimbursement  1974 Public Law 93-368, enacted August 7 1976 Public Law 94-365, enacted July 14 1987 Public Law 100-203, enacted December 22  SSA may enter into agreements with the states to repay them directly for assistance payments made to an SSI applicant while his/her claim is being adjudicated. The repayment is made from the first check due to the individual. This legislation expires June 30, 1976. The authority to repay the state for interim assistance is made permanent.  Extends interim assistance reimbursement to situations in which payments are made by states or political subdivisions to persons whose SSI payments were suspended or terminated and who subsequently are found to be eligible for such benefits. Also clarifies that the payment from which the interim assistance reimbursement is paid must be the first payment of benefits relating to the interim period. Medicaid Eligibility  1972 Public Law 92-603, enacted October 30  States can provide Medicaid coverage to all recipients of SSI payments. Alternatively, they can limit coverage by applying more restrictive criteria from the state Medicaid plan in effect on January 1, 1972. States can accept SSA determination of eligibility, or make their own determination.  1976 Public Law 94-566, enacted October 20 1980 Public Law 96-265, enacted June 9  Preserves the Medicaid eligibility of recipients who become ineligible for cash SSI payments due to the cost-of-living increases in Social Security benefits. Blind or disabled recipients under age 65 no longer eligible for either regular or special SSI payments because of their earnings may retain SSI recipient status for Medicaid eligibility purposes under the following conditions: (1) they continue to have the disabling impairment, (2) they meet all nondisability eligibility criteria except for earned income, (3) they would be seriously inhibited from continuing employment without Medicaid services, and (4) their earnings are insufficient to provide a reasonable equivalent of SSI payments and Medicaid. In states that do not provide Medicaid coverage categorically to all SSI recipients, qualification for Medicaid benefits depends on the state's specific eligibility and program requirements. The Medicaid provision of the 1980 legislation was in effect from January 1, 1981, through December 31, 1983. Under a 1-year demonstration project, beginning January 1, 1984, this provision was continued for persons already eligible for regular or special SSI payments or for retention of Medicaid eligibility.  1984 Public Law 98-460, enacted October 9  Medicaid provision of 1980 legislation extended through June 30, 1987 (retroactive to January 1, 1984).  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2001  39   SSI: History of Provisions  1986 Public Law 99-272, enacted April 7  Restores Medicaid eligibility for some disabled widow(er)s who became ineligible for SSI when their title II benefits increased in 1984 because of a change in the Social Security disabled widow(er)s benefits reduction factor. The SSI recipient status for Medicaid eligibility provision of the 1980 amendments is made permanent. Effective July 1, 1987, certain expenses are excluded from earnings when determining sufficiency of earnings to establish SSI recipient status eligibility for Medicaid purposes:  Public Law 99-643, enacted November 10       Impairment-related work expenses of disabled persons, Work expenses of blind persons, Income required for achieving an approved self-support plan, and The value of publicly funded attendant care services.  Effective July 1, 1987, preserves the Medicaid eligibility of recipients who become ineligible for SSI payments because of entitlement to, or an increase in, Social Security disabled adult child benefits on or after the effective date. Effective July 1, 1987, requires all states to provide Medicaid coverage for recipients in special SSI status (either receiving special SSI payments or in the special recipient status described for 1980) if they received Medicaid coverage the month before special SSI status. 1987 Public Law 100-203, enacted December 22 Effective July 1, 1988, restores or preserves the Medicaid eligibility of persons aged 60 or older who are eligible for Social Security benefits as widows or widowers (but not eligible for Medicare) and who become ineligible for SSI payments or state supplementation because of the receipt of Old-Age or Survivors Insurance benefits under Social Security. Age limit for retention of SSI recipient status for Medicaid eligibility purposes is (1980 and subsequent work incentive provisions, above) eliminated. Preserves the Medicaid eligibility of SSI recipients who become ineligible for payments when they become entitled to Social Security disabled widow(er)s benefits following the revised definition used for their disability. 1997 Public Law 105-33, enacted August 5 Requires states to continue Medicaid payments as of August 22, 1996 and except that their eligibility terminated disability standard established under coverage for disabled children who were receiving SSI would have continued to be eligible for such payments because they did not meet the revised SSI childhood Public Law 104-193.  1990 Public Law 101-508, enacted November 5  State Supplementation 1972 Public Law 92-603, enacted October 30 States are given the option of providing supplementary payments both to recipients transferred from the state program and to those newly eligible for SSI. States may either administer the payments themselves or have the Social Security Administration make payments on their behalf. When state supplementary payments are federally administered, the Social Security Administration makes eligibility and payment determinations for the state and assumes administrative costs. ""Hold harmless"" protection, which limits a state's fiscal liability to its share of OAA, AB, and APTD expenditures for calendar year 1972, is provided to states electing federal administration of their supplementary plans. This provision applies only to supplementary payments that do not, on the average, exceed a state's ""adjusted payment level."" (The adjusted pay-  40  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2001   SSI: History of Provisions  ment level is the average of the payments that individuals with no other income received in January 1972; it may include the bonus value of food stamps. Adjustments are provided for payments that had been below state standards.) 1973 Public Law 93-66, enacted July 9 Provision is made for mandatory state supplementation as assurance against reduction of income for persons who received state assistance in December 1973 and were transferred to SSI. These supplementary payments must equal the difference between (1) the amount of the state assistance payment that the individual received in December 1973 plus other income and (2) his/her federal SSI payment plus other income. After June 30, 1977, when the federal SSI payment level is increased by a cost-of-living increase, such an increase will be excluded in calculating the ""hold harmless"" amount. Requires states to maintain state supplementation payments at the level of December 1976 (""maintenance of payments"") or to continue to pay in supplements the same total annual amounts (""maintenance of expenditures"") when the federal SSI payment level is increased and thereby pass through any increases in federal benefits without reducing state supplements. 1982 Public Law 97-248, enacted September 3 1983 Public Law 98-21, enacted April 20 Begins a 3-year phase out of ""hold harmless"" protection. Effective with fiscal year 1985, Wisconsin and Hawaii (the only remaining ""hold harmless"" states) assumed the full cost of their supplementary payments. Federal pass-through law is adjusted (1) by substituting the state supplementary payment levels in effect in March 1983 for those in effect in December 1976 as the levels that states must maintain in complying with the pass-through requirements, and (2) with regard to the $20 (individual) and $30 (couple) increase in the federal SSI standard in July 1983, by requiring states to pass through only as much as would have been required if the SSI cost-of-living adjustment had been made in July 1983. Provides for federal administration of state supplements to residents of medical institutions. Provides for required pass through of $5 increase in federal rate for persons whose care in institutions is paid in substantial part by Medicaid. Requires states to pay fees for federal administration of their state supplementation payments. The fees are $1.67 for each monthly supplementary payment in fiscal year 1994, $3.33 in fiscal year 1995, and $5.00 in fiscal year 1996. Fees for subsequent fiscal years will be $5.00 or another amount determined by the Commissioner to be appropriate. The Commissioner may charge the states additional fees for services they request that are beyond the level customarily provided in administering state supplementary payments. Revises the schedule of per-payment fees for federal administration of state supplementation for fiscal years 1998 ($6.20) through 2002 ($8.50) and provides a formula for determining the fee beyond fiscal year 2002. The scheduled fees for fiscal years 1999, 2000, and 2001 are $7.60; $7.80; and $8.10, respectively. A state which has an agreement with SSA to administer its supplementation payments, must remit both payments and fees prior to the SSI payment date.  1976 Public Law 94-585, enacted October 21  1987 Public Law 100-203, enacted December 22  1993 Public Law 103-66, enacted August 10  1997 Public Law 105-33, enacted August 5  1999 Public Law 106-170, enacted December 17  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2001  41   SSI: History of Provisions  2000 Public Law 106-554, enacted December 21  Changes the effective date of above provision from 2009 to 2001.  Overpayment Recovery 1984 Public Law 98-369, enacted July 18 Limits the rate of recovering overpayments from monthly payments to the lesser of (1) the monthly payment, or (2) 10 percent of a recipient's monthly income. Permits a higher or lower adjustment at the request of the recipient subject to the agreement of the Commissioner. The limit does not apply if fraud, willful misrepresentation, or concealment of material information was involved on the part of the recipient or spouse in connection with the overpayment. Waives recovery of certain overpayments due to amount of excess resources of $50 or less. Provides for the recovery of overpayments from tax refunds. 1988 Public Law 100-485, enacted October 13 1998 Public Law 105-306, enacted October 28 1999 Public Law 106-169, enacted December 14 Extends the authority to recover overpayments from tax refunds.  Authorizes SSA to collect SSI overpayments by offsetting Social Security benefits, with a maximum monthly offset of no more than 10 percent of the Social Security benefit. Makes representative payees liable for an SSI overpayment caused by a payment made to a recipient who has died, and requires SSA to establish an overpayment control record under the representative payee's Social Security number. Requires SSA to recover SSI overpayments from SSI lump-sum amounts by withholding at least 50 percent of the lump-sum payment or the amount of the overpayment, whichever is less. Extends all of the debt collection authorities currently available for the collection of overpayments under the OASDI program to the SSI program.  42  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2001   Medicare  Medicare The following summary of the Medicare program is intended for informational purposes only. It is not an official statement of policy that can be relied upon in lieu of the appropriate law, regulations, and rulings. This narrative is not intended to render legal or other professional advice; therefore, it should not be relied upon for making specific legal decisions. Instead, the law, regulations, and rulings should be consulted for purposes of making such decisions. road Retirement disability benefits for at least 24 months, and government employees with Medicare-only coverage who have been disabled for more than 29 months, are entitled to HI benefits. HI coverage is also provided to insured workers with ESRD (and to insured workers' spouses and children with ESRD), as well as to some otherwise ineligible aged and disabled beneficiaries who voluntarily pay a monthly premium for their coverage. In 2000, the HI program provided protection against the costs of hospital and specific other medical care to about 39 million people (34 million aged and 5 million disabled enrollees). HI benefit payments totaled $128 billion in 2000. The following health care services are covered under the HI program: 0  Overview Title XVIII of the Social Security Act, designated ""Health Insurance for the Aged and Disabled,"" is commonly known as Medicare. As part of the Social Security Amendments of 1965, the Medicare legislation established a health insurance program for aged persons to complement the retirement, survivors, and disability insurance benefits under title II of the Social Security Act. When first implemented in 1966, Medicare covered most persons aged 65 or older. In 1973, the following groups also became eligible for benefits: persons entitled to Social Security or Railroad Retirement disability cash benefits for at least 24 months, most persons with end stage renal disease (ESRD), and certain otherwise noncovered aged persons who elect to pay a premium for Medicare coverage. The Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Benefits Improvement and Protection Act of 2000 (Public Law 106554) allows persons with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Lou Gehrig's disease) to waive the 24-month waiting period. Medicare has traditionally consisted of two parts: Hospital Insurance (HI), also known as Part A, and Supplementary Medical Insurance (SMI), also known as Part B. A new, third part of Medicare, sometimes known as Part C, is the Medicare+Choice program, which was established by the Balanced Budget Act (BBA) of 1997 (Public Law 105-33) and which expanded beneficiaries' options for participation in private-sector health care plans. When Medicare began on July 1, 1966, approximately 19 million people enrolled. In 2001, about 40 million people are enrolled in one or both of Parts A and B of the Medicare program, and 5.7 million of them have chosen to participate in a Medicare+Choice plan.  Coverage HI is generally provided automatically, and free of premiums, to persons aged 65 or older who are eligible for Social Security or Railroad Retirement benefits, whether they have claimed these monthly cash benefits or not. Also, workers and their spouses with a sufficient period of Medicare-only coverage in federal, state, or local government employment are eligible beginning at age 65. Similarly, individuals who have been entitled to Social Security or Rail-   Inpatient hospital care coverage includes costs of a semi-private room, meals, regular nursing services, operating and recovery rooms, intensive care, inpatient prescription drugs, laboratory tests, X-rays, psychiatric hospitals, inpatient rehabilitation, and longterm care (LTC) hospitalization when medically necessary, as well as all other medically necessary services and supplies provided in the hospital. An initial deductible payment is required of beneficiaries who are admitted to a hospital, plus copayments for all hospital days following day 60 within a benefit period (described later).  Skilled nursing facility (SNF) care is covered by HI only if it follows within 30 days (generally) of a hospitalization of 3 days or more and is certified as medically necessary. Covered services are similar to those for inpatient hospital care but also include rehabilitation services and appliances. The number of SNF days provided under Medicare is limited to 100 days per benefit period (described later), with a copayment required for days 21100. HI does not cover nursing facility care if the patient does not require skilled nursing or skilled rehabilitation services.  Home health agency (HHA) care is covered by both HI and SMI. The BBA transferred from HI to SMI those home health services furnished on or after January 1, 1998 that are unassociated with a hospital or skilled nursing facility stay. HI will continue to cover the first 100 visits following a 3-day hospital stay or a skilled nursing facility stay; SMI covers any visits thereafter. Home health care under HI and SMI has no copayment and no deductible. HHA care, including care provided by a home health aide, may be furnished part-time by a HHA in the residence of a home-bound beneficiary if intermittent or part-time skilled nursing and/or certain other therapy or rehabilitation care is necessary. Certain medical supplies and durable  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2001  43   Medicare medical equipment (DME) may also be provided, though beneficiaries must pay a 20-percent coinsurance for DME, as required under SMI. There must be a plan of treatment and periodical review by a physician. Full-time nursing care, food, blood, and drugs are not provided as HHA services. 0 0   Hospice care is a service provided to terminally ill persons with life expectancies of 6 months or less who elect to forego the standard Medicare benefits for treatment of their illness and to receive only hospice care for it. Such care includes pain relief, supportive medical and social services, physical therapy, nursing services, and symptom management. However, if a hospice patient requires treatment for a condition that is not related to the terminal illness, Medicare will pay for all covered services necessary for that condition. The beneficiary pays no deductible for the hospice program, but does pay small coinsurance amounts for drugs and inpatient respite care. An important HI component is the benefit period, which starts when the beneficiary first enters a hospital and ends when there has been a break of at least 60 consecutive days since inpatient hospital or skilled nursing care was provided. There is no limit to the number of benefit periods covered by HI during a beneficiary's lifetime; however, inpatient hospital care is normally limited to 90 days during a benefit period, and copayment requirements (detailed later) apply for days 6190. If a beneficiary exhausts the 90 days of inpatient hospital care available in a benefit period, he or she can elect to use days of Medicare coverage from a nonrenewable ""lifetime reserve"" of up to 60 (total) additional days of inpatient hospital care. Copayments are also required for such additional days. All citizens (and certain legal aliens) aged 65 or older, and all disabled persons entitled to coverage under HI, are eligible to enroll in the SMI program on a voluntary basis by payment of a monthly premium. Almost all persons entitled to HI choose to enroll in SMI. In 2000, the SMI program provided protection against the costs of physician and other medical services to about 37 million people (32 million aged and 5 million disabled). SMI benefits totaled $88.9 billion in 2000. The SMI program covers the following services and supplies: 0  ration with a physician.  Services in an emergency room or outpatient clinic, including same-day surgery, and ambulance services.  Home health care not covered under HI.  Laboratory tests, X-rays, and other diagnostic radiology services, as well as certain preventive care screening tests.  Ambulatory surgical center services in a Medicareapproved facility.  Most physical and occupational therapy and speech pathology services.  Comprehensive outpatient rehabilitation facility services, and mental health care in a partial hospitalization psychiatric program, if a physician certifies that inpatient treatment would be required without it.  Radiation therapy, renal (kidney) dialysis and transplants, heart, lung, heart-lung, liver, pancreas, and bone marrow transplants, and, as of April 2001, intestinal transplants.  Approved durable medical equipment for home use, such as oxygen equipment and wheelchairs, prosthetic devices, and surgical dressings, splints, and casts.  Drugs and biologicals that cannot be self-administered, such as hepatitis B vaccines and immunosuppressive drugs (certain self-administered anticancer drugs are covered). To be covered, all services must be either medically necessary or one of several prescribed preventive benefits. SMI services are generally subject to a deductible and coinsurance (see next section). Certain medical services and related care are subject to special payment rules, including deductibles (for blood), maximum approved amounts (for Medicare-approved physical, speech, or occupational therapy services performed after 2002 in settings other than hospitals), and higher cost-sharing requirements (such as those for outpatient treatments for mental illness). It should be noted that some health care services are not covered by Medicare. Noncovered services include long-term nursing care, custodial care, and certain other health care needs, such as dentures and dental care, eyeglasses, hearing aids, and most prescription drugs. These services are not a part of the Medicare program unless they are a part of a private health plan under the Medicare+Choice program. Medicare+Choice (Part C) is an expanded set of options for the delivery of health care under Medicare. While all Medicare beneficiaries can receive their benefits through the original fee-for-service (FFS) program, most beneficiaries enrolled in both HI and SMI can choose to participate in a Medicare+Choice plan instead. Organiza-   Physicians' and surgeons' services, including some covered services furnished by chiropractors, podiatrists, dentists, and optometrists. Also covered are the services provided by these Medicare-approved practitioners who are not physicians: certified registered nurse anesthetists, clinical psychologists, clinical social workers (other than in a hospital or skilled nursing facility), physician assistants, and nurse practitioners and clinical nurse specialists in collabo-  44  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2001   Medicare tions that seek to contract as Medicare+Choice plans must meet specific organizational, financial, and other requirements. Following are the primary Medicare+Choice plans: 0   Coordinated care plans, which include health maintenance organizations (HMOs), provider-sponsored organizations (PSOs), preferred provider organizations (PPOs), and other certified coordinated care plans and entities that meet the standards set forth in the law.  Private, unrestricted FFS plans, which allow beneficiaries to select certain private providers. For those providers who agree to accept the plan's payment terms and conditions, this option does not place the providers at risk, nor does it vary payment rates based on utilization.  Medical savings account (MSA) plans, which provide benefits after a single high deductible is met. Medicare makes an annual deposit to the MSA, and the beneficiary is expected to use the money in the MSA to pay for medical expenses below the annual deductible. MSAs are currently a test program for a limited number of eligible Medicare beneficiaries. Except for MSA plans, all Medicare+Choice plans are required to provide at least the current Medicare benefit package, excluding hospice services. Plans may offer additional covered services and are required to do so (or return excess payments) if plan costs are lower than the Medicare payments received by the plan. There are some restrictions as to who may elect an MSA plan, even when enrollment is no longer limited to a certain number of participants.  Program Financing, Beneficiary Liabilities, and Provider Payments All financial operations for Medicare are handled through two trust funds, one for the HI program and one for the SMI program. These trust funds, which are special accounts in the U.S. Treasury, are credited with all receipts and charged with all expenditures for benefits and administrative costs. The trust funds cannot be used for any other purpose. Assets not needed for the payment of costs are invested in special Treasury securities. The following sections describe Medicare's financing provisions, beneficiary cost-sharing requirements, and the basis for determining Medicare reimbursements to health care providers. Program Financing The HI program is financed primarily through a mandatory payroll tax. Almost all employees and self-employed workers in the United States work in employment covered by the HI program and pay taxes to support the cost of benefits for aged and disabled beneficiaries. The HI tax rate is 1.45 percent of earnings, to be paid by each employee and a matching amount by the employer for each employee,  and 2.90 percent for self-employed persons. Beginning in 1994, this tax is paid on all covered wages and selfemployment income without limit. (Prior to 1994, the tax applied only up to a specified maximum amount of earnings.) The HI tax rate is specified in the Social Security Act and cannot be changed without legislation. The HI trust fund also receives income from the following sources: (1) a portion of the income taxes levied on Social Security benefits paid to high-income beneficiaries; (2) premiums from certain persons who are not otherwise eligible and choose to enroll voluntarily; (3) reimbursements from the general fund of the U.S. Treasury for the cost of providing HI coverage to certain aged persons who retired when the HI program began and thus were unable to earn sufficient quarters of coverage (and those federal retirees similarly unable to earn sufficient quarters of Medicare-qualified federal employment); (4) interest earnings on its invested assets; and (5) other small miscellaneous income sources. The taxes paid each year are used mainly to pay benefits for current beneficiaries. The SMI program is financed through premium payments ($50 per beneficiary per month in 2001) and contributions from the general fund of the U.S. Treasury. Beneficiary premiums are generally set at a level that covers 25 percent of the average expenditures for aged beneficiaries. Therefore, the contributions from the general fund of the U.S. Treasury are the largest source of SMI income. The SMI trust fund also receives income from interest earnings on its invested assets, as well as a small amount of miscellaneous income. Beneficiary premiums and general fund payments are redetermined annually, to match estimated program costs for the following year. Capitation payments to Medicare+Choice plans are financed from the HI and SMI trust funds in proportion to the relative weights of HI and SMI benefits to the total benefits paid by the Medicare program. Beneficiary Payment Liabilities Fee-for-service beneficiaries are responsible for charges not covered by the Medicare program and for various cost-sharing aspects of both HI and SMI. These liabilities may be paid (1) by the Medicare beneficiary; (2) by a third party, such as an employer-sponsored retiree health plan or private ""Medigap"" insurance; or (3) by Medicaid, if the person is eligible. The term Medigap is used to mean private health insurance that pays, within limits, most of the health care service charges not covered by Parts A or B of Medicare. These policies, which must meet federally imposed standards, are offered by Blue Cross and Blue Shield (BC/BS) and various commercial health insurance companies. For beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare+Choice plans, the beneficiary's payment share is based on the cost-sharing structure of the specific plan selected by the beneficiary, since each plan has its own requirements. Most plans  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2001  45   Medicare have lower deductibles and coinsurance than are required of fee-for-service beneficiaries. Such beneficiaries pay the monthly Part B premium and may, depending on the plan, pay an additional plan premium. For hospital care covered under HI, a fee-for-service beneficiary's payment share includes a one-time deductible amount at the beginning of each benefit period ($792 in 2001). This deductible covers the beneficiary's part of the first 60 days of each spell of inpatient hospital care. If continued inpatient care is needed beyond the 60 days, additional coinsurance payments ($198 per day in 2001) are required through the 90th day of a benefit period. Each HI beneficiary also has a ""lifetime reserve"" of 60 additional hospital days that may be used when the covered days within a benefit period have been exhausted. Lifetime reserve days may be used only once, and coinsurance payments ($396 per day in 2001) are required. For skilled nursing care covered under HI, Medicare fully covers the first 20 days of SNF care in a benefit period. But for days 21100, a copayment ($99 per day in 2001) is required from the beneficiary. After 100 days of SNF care per benefit period, Medicare pays nothing for SNF care. Home health care has no deductible or coinsurance payment by the beneficiary. In any HI service, the beneficiary is responsible for fees to cover the first 3 pints or units of nonreplaced blood per calendar year. The beneficiary has the option of paying the fee or of having the blood replaced. There are no premiums for most people covered by the HI program. Eligibility is generally earned through the work experience of the beneficiary or of his or her spouse. However, most aged people who are otherwise ineligible for premium-free HI coverage can enroll voluntarily by paying a monthly premium, if they also enroll in SMI. For people with fewer than 30 quarters of coverage as defined by the Social Security Administration (SSA), the 2001 HI monthly premium rate is $300; for those with 30 to 39 quarters of coverage, the rate is reduced to $165. Voluntary coverage upon payment of the HI premium, with or without enrolling in SMI, is also available to disabled individuals for whom cash benefits have ceased due to earnings in excess of those allowed for receiving cash benefits. For SMI, the beneficiary's payment share includes the following: one annual deductible (currently $100); the monthly premiums; the coinsurance payments for SMI services (usually 20 percent of the medically allowed charges); a deductible for blood; certain charges above the Medicare-allowed charge (for claims not on assignment); and payment for any services that are not covered by Medicare. For outpatient mental health treatment services, the beneficiary is liable for 50 percent of the approved charges. Provider Payments For HI, before 1983, payments to providers were made on a reasonable cost basis. Medicare payments for most inpatient hospital services are now made under a reimbursement mechanism known as the prospective payment system (PPS). Under PPS, a specific predetermined amount is paid for each inpatient hospital stay, based on each stay's diagnosis-related group (DRG) classification. In some cases the payment the hospital receives is less than the hospital's actual cost for providing the HI-covered inpatient hospital services for the stay; in other cases it is more. The hospital absorbs the loss or makes a profit. Certain payment adjustments exist for extraordinarily costly inpatient hospital stays. Payments for skilled nursing care and home health care are made under separate prospective payment systems. Payments for inpatient rehabilitation and psychiatric care are currently reimbursed on a reasonable cost basis, but prospective payment systems are expected to be implemented in the near future, as required by the BBA. For SMI, before 1992, physicians were paid on the basis of reasonable charge. This amount was initially defined as the lowest of (1) the physician's actual charge; (2) the physician's customary charge; or (3) the prevailing charge for similar services in that locality. Beginning January 1992, allowed charges were defined as the lesser of (1) the submitted charges, or (2) the amount determined by a fee schedule based on a relative value scale (RVS). Payments for DME and clinical laboratory services are also based on a fee schedule. Most hospital outpatient services are reimbursed on a prospective payment system, and home health care is reimbursed under the same prospective payment system as HI. If a doctor or supplier agrees to accept the Medicareapproved rate as payment in full (""takes assignment""), then payments provided must be considered as payments in full for that service. The provider may not request any added payments (beyond the initial annual deductible and coinsurance) from the beneficiary or insurer. If the provider does not take assignment, the beneficiary will be charged for the excess (which may be paid by Medigap insurance). Limits now exist on the excess that doctors or suppliers can charge. Physicians are ""participating physicians"" if they agree before the beginning of the year to accept assignment for all Medicare services they furnish during the year. Since Medicare beneficiaries may select their doctors, they have the option to choose those who participate. Medicare payments to Medicare+Choice plans are based on a blend of local and national capitated rates, generally determined by the capitation payment methodology described in section 1853 of the Social Security Act. Actual payments to plans vary based on demographic characteristics of the enrolled population. New ""risk adjusters"" based on demographics and health status are currently being phased in to better match Medicare capitation payments to the expected costs of individual beneficiaries.  46  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2001   Medicare  Claims Processing Medicare's HI and SMI fee-for-service claims are processed by nongovernment organizations or agencies that contract to serve as the fiscal agent between providers and the federal government. These claims processors are known as intermediaries and carriers. They apply the Medicare coverage rules to determine the appropriateness of claims. Medicare intermediaries process HI claims for institutional services, including inpatient hospital claims, SNFs, HHAs, and hospice services. They also process outpatient hospital claims for SMI. Examples of intermediaries are BC/ BS (which utilize their plans in various states) and other commercial insurance companies. Intermediaries' responsibilities include the following: 0  as new authorities to contract with entities to perform specific payment safeguard functions.  Administration The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has the overall responsibility for administration of the Medicare program. Within HHS, responsibility for administering Medicare rests with CMS. SSA assists, however, by initially determining an individual's Medicare entitlement, by withholding Part B premiums from the Social Security benefit checks of beneficiaries, and by maintaining Medicare data on the Master Beneficiary Record, which is SSA's primary record of beneficiaries. The Internal Revenue Service in the Department of the Treasury collects the HI payroll taxes from workers and their employers. A Board of Trustees, composed of two appointed members of the public and four members who serve by virtue of their positions in the federal government, oversees the financial operations of the HI and SMI trust funds. The Secretary of the Treasury is the managing trustee. The Board of Trustees reports to Congress on the financial and actuarial status of the Medicare trust funds on or about the first day of April each year. State agencies (usually State Health Departments under agreements with CMS) identify, survey, and inspect provider and supplier facilities and institutions wishing to participate in the Medicare program. In consultation with CMS, these agencies then certify the facilities that are qualified.       Determining costs and reimbursement amounts. Maintaining records. Establishing controls. Safeguarding against fraud and abuse or excess use.  Conducting reviews and audits.  Making the payments to providers for services.  Assisting both providers and beneficiaries as needed. Medicare carriers handle SMI claims for services by physicians and medical suppliers. Examples of carriers are the BS plans in a state, and various commercial insurance companies. Carriers' responsibilities include the following: 0  Data Summary The Medicare program covers 95 percent of our nation's aged population, as well as many people who are on Social Security because of disability. In 2000, HI covered about 39 million enrollees with benefit payments of $128.5 billion, and SMI covered 37 million enrollees with benefit payments of $88.9 billion. Administrative costs were about 2 percent of HI and about 2 percent of SMI disbursements for 2000. Total disbursements for Medicare in 2000 were $222 billion. 0        Determining charges allowed by Medicare. Maintaining quality-of-performance records. Assisting in fraud and abuse investigations. Assisting both suppliers and beneficiaries as needed. Making payments to physicians and suppliers for services that are covered under SMI.  Peer review organizations (PROs) are groups of practicing health care professionals who are paid by the federal government to generally oversee the care provided to Medicare beneficiaries in each state and to improve the quality of services. PROs educate other health care professionals and assist in the effective, efficient, and economical delivery of health care services to the Medicare population. The ongoing effort to combat monetary fraud and abuse in the Medicare program was intensified after enactment of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-191), which created the Medicare Integrity Program. Prior to this 1996 legislation, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) was limited by law to contracting with its current carriers and fiscal intermediaries to perform payment safeguard activities. The Medicare Integrity Program provided CMS with stable, increasing funding for payment safeguard activities, as well  Note: Medicare enrollment data are based on estimates prepared for the 2001 annual report of the Medicare Board of Trustees to Congress (available on the Internet at www.hcfa.gov/pubforms/tr/). Medicare benefits, administrative costs, and total disbursements for 2000 are actual amounts for the calendar year, as reported by the Department of the Treasury.

Disabled individual under age 65 entitled to disability benefits for at least 24 months, not necessarily consecutive, under the Social Security or Railroad Retirement program. Medicare coverage extended for up to 36 months for disabled individuals whose disability continues, but whose monthly benefit ceased because they engaged in substantial gainful activity. Second waiting period eliminated if a former disabled-worker beneficiary becomes entitled again within 5 years (7 years for disabled widows and widowers and disabled children aged 18 or older). 1982 1983 1986 1987 1989 Federal employees covered under HI based on QC for earnings as federal employees and/ or based on deemed QC for earnings as federal employees before 1983. Employees of nonprofit organizations, effective Jan. 1, 1984. Mandatory coverage for state and local government employees not covered under Social Security and hired after Mar. 31, 1986. Second waiting period eliminated if a former disabled beneficiary becomes entitled again (no time limit). Disabled individuals under age 65 who are no longer entitled to Social Security disability benefits because their earnings exceeded the substantial gainful activity level have the option to purchase Medicare coverage by paying the HI and SMI premiums. The 24-month waiting period (otherwise required for an individual to establish Medicare eligibility on the basis of a disability) is waived for persons with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, effective July 1, 2001.  1967 1972  2000  *  Act refers to legislation enacted in the year shown.  48  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2001   Medicare: History of Provisions Entitlement to Supplementary Medical Insurance Benefits 1965 U.S. resident (citizen or lawfully admitted alien with 5 years continuous residence) aged 65 or older or any individual entitled to HI benefits, upon voluntary participation with payment of SMI premium. Individual under age 65 entitled to HI benefits, upon voluntary participation with payment of SMI premium. Medicare Benefits HI and SMI 1965 1981 Requires that Medicare be secondary payer to benefits provided by liability insurance policies or under no-fault insurance. Requires that Medicare be secondary payer to employer-based group health plans for beneficiaries entitled to Medicare solely due to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) for up to 12 months. For workers and their spouses aged 65-69, Medicare is the secondary payer when benefits are provided under an employer-based group health plan (applicable to employers with 20 or more employees who sponsor or contribute to the group plan). Health maintenance organizations (HMOs) will be authorized as providers of benefits. The Secretary of HHS must certify the prospective payment mechanism for HMOs before implementation. 1984 Medicare secondary payer provisions are extended to spouses aged 65-69 of workers under age 65 whose employer-based group health plan covers such spouses. For HMOs, includes medical and other health services furnished by clinical psychologists. 1985 1986 Provides payment for liver transplant services. Extends the working age secondary payer provision to cover workers and their spouses beyond age 69. For HMOs that offered organ transplants as a basic health service on Apr. 15, 1985, such services may be offered from Oct. 1, 1985, through Apr. 1, 1988. For disabled individuals who are covered by employer-based health plans (with at least 100 employees), Medicare is the secondary payer, effective for 1987-91. 1987 Requires HMOs/competitive medical plans that cease to contract with Medicare to provide or arrange supplemental coverage of benefits related to preexisting conditions for the lesser of 6 months or the duration of an exclusion period. Specifies in law that in order to be eligible for home health care, a Medicare beneficiary must have a restricted ability to leave the home, requiring the assistance of another or the aid of a supportive device (such as crutches, a cane, a wheelchair, or a walker). Clarifies that the secondary payer provision for disabled individuals covered under employerbased health plans for employers with at least 500 employees applies to employers who are government entities. 1990 Requires that Medicare be the secondary payer to employer-based group health plans for beneficiaries entitled to Medicare solely due to ESRD for up to 18 months (extended from 12 months), effective Feb. 1, 1991, to Jan. 1, 1996. The secondary payer provision for disabled beneficiaries covered under large employer plans (see 1986.); effective through Sept. 30, 1995. 1993 The secondary payer provision for disabled beneficiaries covered under large employer plans is effective through Sept. 30, 1998.  1972  1982  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2001  49   Medicare: History of Provisions The secondary payer provision for beneficiaries with ESRD applies to all beneficiaries with end stage renal disease, not only those entitled to Medicare solely on the basis of it. The extension to include the first 18 months of an individual's entitlement on the basis of ESRD is effective through Sept. 30, 1998. 1997 Established an expanded set of options for the delivery of health care under Medicare, referred to as Medicare+Choice. All Medicare beneficiaries can receive their Medicare benefits through the original fee-for-service program. In addition, most beneficiaries can choose instead to receive their Medicare benefits through one of the following Medicare+Choice plans: (1) coordinated care plans (such as HMOs, provider-sponsored organizations, and preferred provider organizations); (2) Medical Savings Account (MSA)/ High Deductible plans (through a demonstration available for up to 390,000 beneficiaries); or (3) private fee-for-service plans. Except for MSA plans, all Medicare+Choice plans are required to provide the current Medicare benefit package (excluding hospice services) and any additional health services required under the adjusted community rate (ACR) process. MSA plans provide Medicare benefits after a single high deductible is met, and enrollees receive an annual deposit in their Medical Savings Account. Transition rules for current Medicare HMO program also provided. The provision making Medicare the secondary payer for disabled beneficiaries covered under large employer plans, previously scheduled to expire Sept. 30, 1998, made permanent. The provision making Medicare secondary payer for the first 12 months of entitlement due to ESRD, which had been extended on a temporary basis (through Sept. 30, 1998) to include the first 18 months of entitlement, has been extended, permanently, to include the first 30 months of entitlement on the basis of ESRD. Hospital Insurance 1965 In each benefit period, inpatient hospital services, 90 days.

Inpatient psychiatric hospital care limited to 190-day lifetime maximum. Outpatient hospital diagnostic services. Post-hospital extended-care services, 100 days (including physical, occupational, and speech therapy). Post-hospital home health services, 100 visits. Deductible and coinsurance provisions (see table 2.C1). Lifetime reserve of 60 additional days of inpatient hospital services. Outpatient hospital diagnostic services transferred to SMI. Services of interns and residents in podiatry training. Unlimited home health visits in a year. Requirement for prior hospitalization eliminated. Home health services provided for up to 4 days a week and up to 21 consecutive days. Alcohol detoxification facility services. 1981 Part A coinsurance is based on the deductible for the calendar year in which services are received rather than the deductible in effect at the time the beneficiary's spell of illness began, starting in 1982. Alcohol detoxification facility services eliminated. 1982 Beneficiaries expected to live 6 months or less may elect to receive hospice care benefits instead of other Medicare benefits. May elect maximum of two 90-day and one 30-day hospice care periods, effective Nov. 1, 1983, to Oct. 1, 1986. For durable medical equipment provided by home health agencies, the payment amount is reduced from 100 percent of costs to 80 percent of reasonable charges.  1967 1972 1980  1984  50  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2001   Medicare: History of Provisions 1986 Set the Part A deductible for 1987 at $520 with resulting increases in cost sharing. Increased the Part A deductible annually by the applicable percentage increase in the hospital prospective payment rates. Hospice care benefit (enacted in 1982) made permanent. 1987 Specifies in law that in order to be eligible for home health care, a Medicare beneficiary must have a restricted ability to leave the home, requiring the assistance of another or the aid of a supportive device (such as crutches, a cane, a wheelchair, or a walker). Enrollee pays annual hospital deductible (set at $560 for 1989) and Medicare pays balance of covered charges, regardless of the number of days of hospitalization (except for psychiatric hospital care, which is still limited by 190-day lifetime maximum). The number of days in a skilled nursing facility changed to 150 per year. Deletes the requirement for a prior hospital stay of 3 or more consecutive days. Expands home health care to provide care for less than 7 days per week and up to 38 consecutive days. Hospice care extended beyond 210 days when beneficiary is certified as terminally ill. All 1988 provisions became effective Jan. 1, 1989. 1989 The spell of illness and benefit period coverage of laws determination of inpatient hospital benefits in 1990 and benefit period, Medicare pays 100 percent of covered c hospital care. Coinsurance applies for the next 30 days prior to 1988 return to the later. After the deductible is paid in osts for the first 60 days of inpatient in a benefit period.  1988  The requirement for a prior hospital stay of 3 or more consecutive days is reinstated for skilled nursing facility services. Coverage returns to 100 days post-hospital care per spell of illness with a daily coinsurance rate in effect for days 21 through 100. Home health services return to a limit of 21 consecutive days of care. Provision providing for home health care for fewer than 7 days per week continued due to a court decision. Hospice care is returned to a lifetime limit of 210 days. 1990 1997 Hospice care is extended beyond 210 days when beneficiary is certified as terminally ill. Home health services not associated with a hospital or skilled nursing facility stay for individuals enrolled in both HI and SMI are transferred from the HI program to the SMI program, effective January 1998. The HI program will continue to cover the first 100 visits following a hospital stay of at least 3 consecutive days or a skilled-nursing facility stay. The cost to the SMI trust fund of the transferred services will phase in over a 6-year period (that is, the HI trust fund will transfer funds to the SMI trust fund during that period). Limits on the number of hours and days that home health care can be provided have been clarified. ""Part-time"" now defined as skilled-nursing and home health aide services (combined) furnished any number of days per week, for less than 8 hours per day and 28 or fewer hours per week. ""Intermittent"" now defined as skilled-nursing care provided for fewer than 7 days each week, or less than 8 hours each day (combined) for 21 days or less. Hospice benefit periods are restructured to include two 90-day periods, followed by an unlimited number of 60-day periods. Medicare coverage provided for a number of prevention initiatives, most of which covered under SMI program. HI program affected mainly by two of the initiatives: (1) annual prostate cancer screening for male beneficiaries aged 50 or older, effective Jan. 1, 2000; and (2) colorectal screening procedures, including fecal-occult blood tests and flexible sigmoidoscopies, for beneficiaries age 50 or older, colonoscopy for beneficiaries at high risk for colorectal cancer, and other procedures, including screening barium enemas under certain circumstances.  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2001  51   Medicare: History of Provisions 2000 Screening colonoscopies are covered for all beneficiaries, not just those at high risk, beginning July 1, 2001. For persons not at high risk, a screening colonoscopy is covered 10 years after a previous one, or 4 years after a screening flexible sigmoidoscopy. (See 1997.) Supplementary Medical Insurance 1965 Physician and surgeon services. In-hospital services of anesthesiologists, pathologists, radiologists, and psychiatrists. Limited dental services. Home health services, 100 visits in calendar year. Other medical services including various diagnostic tests, limited ambulance services, prosthetic devices, rental of durable medical equipment used at home (including equipment for dialysis), and supplies used for fractures.

Includes occupational therapy services provided in certain delivery settings. For ambulatory surgical procedures performed in ambulatory surgical centers, hospital outpatient departments, and certain physician offices, the Part B coinsurance and deductible are no longer waived. 1987 Increases the maximum payment for mental health services and includes outpatient mental health services provided by ambulatory hospital-based or hospital-affiliated programs under the supervision of a physician.  52  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2001   Medicare: History of Provisions Services provided by clinical social workers when furnished by risk-sharing health maintenance organizations/competitive medical plans, physician assistants in rural health manpower shortage areas, clinical psychologists in rural health clinics and community mental health centers, and certified nurse-midwives. Coverage of outpatient immunosuppresive drugs (see 1986) is broadened/clarifed to include prescription drugs used in immunosuppressive therapy. Specifies in law that in order to be eligible for home health care, a Medicare beneficiary must have a restricted ability to leave the home, requiring the assistance of another or the aid of a supportive device (such as crutches, a cane, a wheelchair, or a walker). 1988 Beginning Jan. 1, 1990, the beneficiary pays a $75 deductible and 20-percent coinsurance, but once out-of-pocket expenses for the deductible and coinsurance exceed $1,370, Medicare pays 100 percent of allowable charges for remainder of year. Beginning in 1991, Medicare pays 50 percent of the cost of outpatient prescription drugs above $600. When fully implemented in 1993, Medicare will pay 80 percent of prescription drug costs above a deductible that assumes that 16.8 percent of Part B enrollees will exceed the deductible. Certain prescription drugs administered in an outpatient or home setting, including immunosuppressive drugs (previously covered for 1 year after a covered transplant), home intravenous drugs, and certain others, will be covered in 1990 under a new prescription drug provision. 1989 Provisions enacted in 1988 and to begin in 1990 and 1991 are repealed and benefits are restored to levels in effect prior to Jan. 1, 1989. Limits on mental health benefits eliminated in 1990. Coverage extended to services of clinical psychologists and social workers. The annual payment limits of $500 per beneficiary for outpatient physical therapy services and outpatient occupational therapy services, each, are raised to $750, for 1990 and later. (See 1980.) 1990 Beginning in 1991, routine mammography screenings are covered. The Part B deductible is set at $100 in 1991 and subsequent years.

The annual payment limits of $750 per beneficiary for outpatient physical therapy services and outpatient occupational therapy services, each, are raised to $900 for 1994 and later. (See 1989.) 1997 Home health services not associated with a hospital or skilled nursing facility stay for individuals enrolled in both HI and SMI are transferred from the HI program to the SMI program, effective January 1998. The HI program will continue to cover the first 100 visits following a hospital stay of at least 3 consecutive days or a skilled nursing facility stay. The cost to the SMI Trust Fund of the transferred services will phase in over a 6-year period, while the cost of the home health services will phase into the SMI premium over 7 years.

A separate $1,500 limit will also apply to outpatient occupational therapy services, except for services furnished by hospital outpatient departments. Beginning with 2002, these caps will be increased by the percentage increase in the Medical Economic Index. (See 1993.) 1999 The coverage period for immunosuppressive drugs after a transplant is lengthened to 44 months, for individuals who exhaust their 36 months of coverage in 2000. For those exhausting their 36 months of coverage in 2001, at least 8 more months will be covered. (The Secretary of HHS will specify the increase, if any, beyond 8 months.) For those exhausting their 36 months of coverage in 2002, 2003, or 2004, the number of additional months may be more or less than 8. (The Secretary will specify the increase for each of these years.) (See 1993.) The annual payment limits of $1,500 per beneficiary for outpatient physical services and outpatient occupational therapy services, each, for services furnished by independent practitioners (that is, not by a hospital outpatient department), are suspended for 2000 and 2001. (See 1997.) 2000 Coverage for screening pap smears and pelvic exams (including a clinical breast exam) is provided every 2 years (increased from every 3 years) beginning July 1, 2001.

Increases in the SMI premium may not exceed the dollar amount of the Social Security cost-of-living adjustment. For calculating the amount of SMI premium surcharge for individuals from age 65 up to age 70 not previously enrolled in SMI, the number of years an individual did not enroll because of coverage by employer group health insurance will not be taken into account. 1985 Extends through calendar year 1988 the requirement that SMI premiums be set to cover 25 percent of aged program costs and that increases in the SMI premium may not exceed the dollar amount of the Social Security cost-of-living adjustment. Premium-paying individuals who do not purchase Part A coverage within a specific time after becoming eligible because of age are subject to a 10-percent penalty for each 12 months they are late in enrolling. There is a cutoff on the length of time these individuals will have to pay an enrollment penalty. The 10-percent premium penalty would be limited to twice the number of years enrollment was delayed. Therefore, if enrollment were delayed 1 year, the penalty would be assessed for 2 years. Individuals in this category and already enrolled will have the length of time the higher premium was paid credited to them. 1987 Extends through calendar year 1989 the provisions requiring that the SMI premium be set to cover 25 percent of aged program costs, prohibiting any increase in the premium if there is no Social Security cost-of-living adjustment, and continuing to hold beneficiaries harmless from Social Security check reductions as a result of a premium increase.

It is not an official statement of policy that can be relied upon in lieu of the appropriate law, regulations, and rulings. This narrative is not intended to render legal or other professional advice; therefore, it should not be relied upon for making specific legal decisions. Instead, the law, regulations, and rulings should be consulted for purposes of making such decisions. related groups not receiving cash payments. In addition to their Medicaid programs, most states have additional ""state-only"" programs to provide medical assistance for specified poor persons who do not qualify for Medicaid. Federal funds are not provided for state-only programs. The following enumerates the mandatory Medicaid ""categorically needy"" eligibility groups for which federal matching funds are provided: 0  Overview 0  Title XIX of the Social Security Act is a federal/state entitlement program that pays for medical assistance for certain individuals and families with low incomes and resources. This program, known as Medicaid, became law in 1965 as a cooperative venture jointly funded by the federal and state governments (including the District of Columbia and the territories) to assist states in furnishing medical assistance to eligible needy persons. Medicaid is the largest source of funding for medical and health-related services for America's poorest people. Within broad national guidelines established by federal statutes, regulations, and policies, each state (1) establishes its own eligibility standards; (2) determines the type, amount, duration, and scope of services; (3) sets the rate of payment for services; and (4) administers its own program. Medicaid policies for eligibility, services, and payment are complex and vary considerably, even among states of similar size or geographic proximity. Thus, a person who is eligible for Medicaid in one state may not be eligible in another state, and the services provided by one state may differ considerably in amount, duration, or scope from services provided in a similar or neighboring state. In addition, state legislatures may change Medicaid eligibility and/or services during the year.   Individuals are generally eligible for Medicaid if they meet the requirements for the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program that were in effect in their state on July 16, 1996, or--at state option--more liberal criteria.  Children under age 6 whose family income is at or below 133 percent of the federal poverty level (FPL).  Pregnant women whose family income is below 133 percent of the FPL (services to these women are limited to those related to pregnancy, complications of pregnancy, delivery, and postpartum care).  Supplemental Security Income (SSI) recipients in most states (some states use more restrictive Medicaid eligibility requirements that pre-date SSI).  Recipients of adoption or foster care assistance under title IV of the Social Security Act.  Special protected groups (typically individuals who lose their cash assistance due to earnings from work or from increased Social Security benefits, but who may keep Medicaid for a period of time).  All children born after September 30, 1983 who are under age 19, in families with incomes at or below the FPL (this process phases in coverage, so that by the year 2002 all such poor children under age 19 will be covered).  Certain Medicare beneficiaries (described later). States also have the option of providing Medicaid coverage for other ""categorically related"" groups. These optional groups share characteristics of the mandatory groups (that is, they fall within defined categories), but the eligibility criteria are somewhat more liberally defined. The broadest optional groups for which states will receive federal matching funds for coverage under the Medicaid program include the following: 0  Basis of Eligibility and Maintenance Assistance Status Medicaid does not provide medical assistance for all poor persons. Under the broadest provisions of the federal statute, Medicaid does not provide health care services even for very poor persons unless they are in one of the groups designated below. Low income is only one test for Medicaid eligibility for those within these groups; their resources also are tested against threshold levels (as determined by each state within federal guidelines). States generally have broad discretion in determining which groups their Medicaid programs will cover and the financial criteria for Medicaid eligibility. To be eligible for federal funds, however, states are required to provide Medicaid coverage for certain individuals who receive federally assisted income-maintenance payments, as well as for   Infants up to age 1 and pregnant women not covered under the mandatory rules whose family income is no more than 185 percent of the FPL (the percentage amount is set by each state).  Children under age 21 who meet the AFDC income and resources requirements that were in effect in their state on July 16, 1996.  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2001  57   Medicaid  Institutionalized individuals eligible under a ""special income level"" (the amount is set by each state--up to 300 percent of the SSI federal benefit rate).  Individuals who would be eligible if institutionalized, but who are receiving care under home and community-based services waivers.  Certain aged, blind, or disabled adults who have incomes above those requiring mandatory coverage, but below the FPL.  Recipients of state supplementary income payments.  Certain working-and-disabled persons with family income less than 250 percent of the FPL who would qualify for SSI if they did not work.  TB-infected persons who would be financially eligible for Medicaid at the SSI income level if they were within a Medicaid-covered category (however, coverage is limited to TB-related ambulatory services and TB drugs).  ""Optional targeted low-income children"" included within the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) established by the Balanced Budget Act (BBA) of 1997 (Public Law 105-33).  ""Medically needy"" persons (described below). The medically needy (MN) option allows states to extend Medicaid eligibility to additional persons. These persons would be eligible for Medicaid under one of the mandatory or optional groups, except that their income and/or resources are above the eligibility level set by their state. Persons may qualify immediately or may ""spend down"" by incurring medical expenses that reduce their income to or below their state's MN income level. Medicaid eligibility and benefit provisions for the medically needy do not have to be as extensive as for the categorically needy, and may be quite restrictive. Federal matching funds are available for MN programs. However, if a state elects to have a MN program, there are federal requirements that certain groups and certain services must be included; that is, children under age 19 and pregnant women who are medically needy must be covered, and prenatal and delivery care for pregnant women, as well as ambulatory care for children, must be provided. A state may elect to provide MN eligibility to certain additional groups and may elect to provide certain additional services within its MN program. Currently, 38 states have elected to have a MN program and are providing at least some MN services to at least some MN recipients. All remaining states utilize the ""special income level"" option to extend Medicaid to the ""near poor"" in medical institutional settings. The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-193)--known as the ""welfare reform"" bill--made restrictive changes regarding eligibility for SSI coverage that impacted the Medicaid program. For example, legal resident aliens and other qualified aliens who entered the United States on or after August 22, 1996 are ineligible for Medicaid for 5 years. Medicaid coverage for most aliens entering before that date and coverage for those eligible after the 5-year ban are state options; emergency services, however, are mandatory for both of these alien coverage groups. For aliens who lose SSI benefits because of the new restrictions regarding SSI coverage, Medicaid can continue only if these persons can be covered for Medicaid under some other eligibility status (again with the exception of emergency services, which are mandatory). Public Law 104-193 also affected a number of disabled children, who lost SSI as a result of the restrictive changes; however, their eligibility for Medicaid was reinstituted by Public Law 105-33, the BBA. In addition, welfare reform repealed the open-ended federal entitlement program known as Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) and replaced it with Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), which provides states with grants to be spent on time-limited cash assistance. TANF generally limits a family's lifetime cash welfare benefits to a maximum of 5 years and permits states to impose a wide range of other requirements as well--in particular, those related to employment. However, the impact on Medicaid eligibility is not expected to be significant. Under welfare reform, persons who would have been eligible for AFDC under the AFDC requirements in effect on July 16, 1996 generally will still be eligible for Medicaid. Although most persons covered by TANF will receive Medicaid, it is not required by law. Title XXI of the Social Security Act, known as the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), is a new program initiated by the BBA. In addition to allowing states to craft or expand an existing state insurance program, SCHIP provides more federal funds for states to expand Medicaid eligibility to include a greater number of children who are currently uninsured. With certain exceptions, these are low-income children who would not qualify for Medicaid based on the plan that was in effect on April 15, 1997. Funds from SCHIP also may be used to provide medical assistance to children during a presumptive eligibility period for Medicaid. This is one of several options from which states may select to provide health care coverage for more children, as prescribed within the BBA's Title XXI program. Medicaid coverage may begin as early as the third month prior to application--if the person would have been eligible for Medicaid had he or she applied during that time. Medicaid coverage generally stops at the end of the month in which a person no longer meets the criteria of any Medicaid eligibility group. The BBA allows states to provide 12 months of continuous Medicaid coverage (without reevaluation) for eligible children under the age of 19. The Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999 (Public Law 106-170) provides or continues  58  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2001   Medicaid Medicaid coverage to certain disabled beneficiaries who work despite their impairment. Those with higher incomes may pay a sliding scale premium based on income. offers and manages all health, medical, and social services and mobilizes other services as needed to provide preventative, rehabilitative, curative, and supportive care. This care, provided in day health centers, homes, hospitals, and nursing homes, helps the person maintain independence, dignity, and quality of life. PACE functions within the Medicare program as well. Regardless of source of payment, PACE providers receive payment only through the PACE agreement and must make available all items and services covered under both titles XVIII and XIX, without amount, duration, or scope limitations and without application of any deductibles, copayments, or other cost sharing. The individuals enrolled in PACE receive benefits solely through the PACE program.  Scope of Medicaid Services Title XIX of the Social Security Act allows considerable flexibility within the states' Medicaid plans. However, some federal requirements are mandatory if federal matching funds are to be received. A state's Medicaid program must offer medical assistance for certain basic services to most categorically needy populations. These services generally include the following: 0                  Inpatient hospital services. Outpatient hospital services. Prenatal care. Vaccines for children. Physician services. Nursing facility services for persons aged 21 or older. Family planning services and supplies. Rural health clinic services. Home health care for persons eligible for skillednursing services. Laboratory and x-ray services. Pediatric and family nurse practitioner services. Nurse-midwife services. Federally qualified health-center (FQHC) services, and ambulatory services of an FQHC that would be available in other settings. Early and periodic screening, diagnostic, and treatment (EPSDT) services for children under age 21.  Amount and Duration of Services Within broad federal guidelines and certain limitations, states determine the amount and duration of services offered under their Medicaid programs. States may limit, for example, the number of days of hospital care or the number of physician visits covered. Two restrictions apply: (1) limits must result in a sufficient level of services to reasonably achieve the purpose of the benefits; and (2) limits on benefits may not discriminate among beneficiaries based on medical diagnosis or condition. In general, states are required to provide comparable amounts, duration, and scope of services to all categorically needy and categorically related eligible persons. There are two important exceptions: (1) Medically necessary health care services that are identified under the EPSDT program for eligible children, and that are within the scope of mandatory or optional services under federal law, must be covered even if those services are not included as part of the covered services in that state's plan; and (2) states may request ""waivers"" to pay for otherwise uncovered home and community-based services (HCBS) for Medicaid-eligible persons who might otherwise be institutionalized. As long as the services are cost effective, states have few limitations on the services that may be covered under these waivers (except that, other than as a part of respite care, states may not provide room and board for the recipients). With certain exceptions, a state's Medicaid program must allow recipients to have some informed choices among participating providers of health care and to receive quality care that is appropriate and timely.  States may also receive federal matching funds to provide certain optional services. Following are the most common of the 34 currently approved optional Medicaid services: 0   Diagnostic services.  Clinic services.  Intermediate care facilities for the mentally retarded (ICFs/MR).  Prescribed drugs and prosthetic devices.  Optometrist services and eyeglasses.  Nursing facility services for children under age 21.  Transportation services.  Rehabilitation and physical therapy services.  Home and community-based care to certain persons with chronic impairments. The BBA included a state option known as programs of all-inclusive care for the elderly (PACE). PACE provides an alternative to institutional care for persons aged 55 or older who require a nursing facility level of care. The PACE team  Payment for Services Medicaid operates as a vendor payment program. States may pay health care providers directly on a fee-forservice basis, or states may pay for Medicaid services through various prepayment arrangements, such as health maintenance organizations (HMOs). Within federally imposed upper limits and specific restrictions, each state for the most part has broad discretion in determining the payment methodology and payment rate for services. Gen-  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2001  59   Medicaid erally, payment rates must be sufficient to enlist enough providers so that covered services are available at least to the extent that comparable care and services are available to the general population within that geographic area. Providers participating in Medicaid must accept Medicaid payment rates as payment in full. States must make additional payments to qualified hospitals that provide inpatient services to a disproportionate number of Medicaid recipients and/or to other low-income or uninsured persons under what is known as the ""disproportionate share hospital"" (DSH) adjustment. During 19881991, excessive and inappropriate use of the DSH adjustment resulted in rapidly increasing federal expenditures for Medicaid. However, under legislation passed in 1991, 1993, and again within the BBA of 1997, the federal share of payments to disproportionate share hospitals has become increasingly limited. States may impose nominal deductibles, coinsurance, or copayments on some Medicaid recipients for certain services. The following Medicaid recipients, however, must be excluded from cost sharing: pregnant women, children under age 18, and hospital or nursing home patients who are expected to contribute most of their income to institutional care. In addition, all Medicaid recipients must be exempt from copayments for emergency services and family planning services. The federal government pays a share of the medical assistance expenditures under each state's Medicaid program. That share, known as the federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP), is determined annually by a formula that compares the state's average per capita income level with the national income average. States with a higher per capita income level are reimbursed a smaller share of their costs. By law, the FMAP cannot be lower than 50 percent or higher than 83 percent. In 2001, the FMAPs varied from 50 percent in 10 states to 76.82 percent in Mississippi, and averaged 57 percent overall. The BBA also permanently raised the FMAP for the District of Columbia from 50 percent to 70 percent and raised the FMAP for Alaska from 50 percent to 59.8 percent through 2000. The Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Benefits Improvement and Protection Act (BIPA) of 2000 (Public Law 106-554) further adjusted Alaska's FMAP to a higher level for 20012005. For the children added to Medicaid through the SCHIP program, the FMAP average for all states is about 70 percent, compared to the general Medicaid average of 57 percent. The federal government also reimburses states for 100 percent of the cost of services provided through facilities of the Indian Health Service, provides financial help to the 12 states that furnish the highest number of emergency services to undocumented aliens, and shares in each state's expenditures for the administration of the Medicaid program. Most administrative costs are matched at 50 percent, although higher percentages are paid for certain activities and functions, such as development of mechanized claims processing systems. Except for the SCHIP program, the Qualifying Individuals (QI) program (described later), and DSH payments, federal payments to states for medical assistance have no set limit (cap). Rather, the federal government matches (at FMAP rates) state expenditures for the mandatory services, as well as for the optional services that the individual state decides to cover for eligible recipients, and matches (at the appropriate administrative rate) all necessary and proper administrative costs. The Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999 (as incorporated into Public Law 106-113, the appropriations bill for the District of Columbia for fiscal year 2000) increased the amount that certain states and the territories can spend on DSH and SCHIP payments, respectively. The BIPA set upper payment limits for inpatient and outpatient services provided by certain types of facilities.  Summary and Trends Medicaid was initially formulated as a medical care extension of federally funded programs providing cash income assistance for the poor, with an emphasis on dependent children and their mothers, the disabled, and the elderly. Over the years, however, Medicaid eligibility has been incrementally expanded beyond its original ties with eligibility for cash programs. Legislation in the late 1980s assured Medicaid coverage to an expanded number of low-income pregnant women, poor children, and to some Medicare beneficiaries who are not eligible for any cash assistance program. Legislative changes also focused on increased access, better quality of care, specific benefits, enhanced outreach programs, and fewer limits on services. In most years since its inception, Medicaid has had very rapid growth in expenditures, although the rate of increase has subsided somewhat recently. This rapid growth in Medicaid expenditures has been due primarily to the following factors: 0   The increase in size of the Medicaid-covered populations as a result of federal mandates, population growth, and the earlier economic recession. In recent years Medicaid enrollment has declined somewhat.  The expanded coverage and utilization of services.  The DSH payment program, coupled with its inappropriate use to increase federal payments to states.  The increase in the number of very old and disabled persons requiring extensive acute and/or long-term health care and various related services.  The results of technological advances to keep a greater number of very low-birth-weight babies and other critically ill or severely injured persons alive and in need of continued extensive and very costly care.  The increase in payment rates to providers of health care services, when compared to general inflation.  60  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2001   Medicaid As with all health insurance programs, most Medicaid recipients require relatively small average expenditures per person each year, and a relatively small proportion incurs very large costs. Moreover, the average cost varies substantially by type of beneficiary. The data for 1998, for example, indicate that Medicaid payments for services for 20.6 million children, who constitute 51 percent of all Medicaid recipients, average about $1,150 per child (a relatively small average expenditure per person). Similarly, for 8.6 million adults, who comprise 21 percent of recipients, payments average about $1,775 per person. However, certain other specific groups have much larger per-person expenditures. Medicaid payments for services for 4 million aged, constituting 11 percent of all Medicaid recipients, average about $9,700 per person; for 7.2 million disabled, who comprise 18 percent of recipients, payments average about $8,600 per person. When expenditures for these high- and lower-cost recipients are combined, the 1998 payments to health care vendors for 40.6 million Medicaid recipients average $3,500 per person. Long-term care is an important provision of Medicaid that will be increasingly utilized as our nation's population ages. The Medicaid program has paid for almost 45 percent of the total cost of care for persons using nursing facility or home health services in recent years. However, for those persons who use more than 4 months of this longterm care, Medicaid pays for a much larger percentage. The data for 1998 show that Medicaid payments for nursing facility services (excluding ICFs/MR) and home health care totaled $41.3 billion for more than 3.3 million recipients of these services--an average 1998 expenditure of $12,375 per long-term care recipient. With the percentage of our population who are elderly or disabled increasing faster than that of the younger groups, the need for long-term care is expected to increase. Another significant development in Medicaid is the growth in managed care as an alternative service delivery concept different from the traditional fee-for-service system. Under managed care systems, HMOs, prepaid health plans, or comparable entities agree to provide a specific set of services to Medicaid enrollees, usually in return for a predetermined periodic payment per enrollee. Managed care programs seek to enhance access to quality care in a cost-effective manner. Waivers may provide the states with greater flexibility in the design and implementation of their Medicaid managed care programs. Waiver authority under sections 1915(b) and 1115 of the Social Security Act is an important part of the Medicaid program. Section 1915(b) waivers allow states to develop innovative health care delivery or reimbursement systems. Section 1115 waivers allow statewide health care reform experimental demonstrations to cover uninsured populations and to test new delivery systems without increasing costs. Finally, the BBA provided states a new option to use managed care. The number of Medicaid beneficiaries enrolled in some form of managed care program is growing rapidly, from 14 percent of enrollees in 1993 to 54 percent in 1998. Medicaid data as reported by the states indicate that more than 41.0 million persons received health care services through the Medicaid program in 1999 (the last year for which recipient data are available). Total outlays for the Medicaid program in 2000 included direct payment to providers of $146.4 billion, payments for various premiums (for HMOs, Medicare, etc.) of $33.9 billion, payments to the disproportionate share hospitals of $14.4 billion, and administrative costs of $10.6 billion. The total expenditure for the nation's Medicaid program in 2000, excluding administrative costs, was $194.7 billion ($111.1 billion in federal and $83.6 billion in state funds). With anticipated impacts from the BBA, projections now are that total Medicaid outlays may be $334.9 billion in fiscal year 2006, with an additional $4.3 billion expected to be spent for the new SCHIP.  Medicaid-Medicare Relationship Medicare beneficiaries who have low incomes and limited resources may also receive help from the Medicaid program. For such persons who are eligible for full Medicaid coverage, the Medicare health care coverage is supplemented by services that are available under their state's Medicaid program, according to eligibility category. These additional services may include, for example, nursing facility care beyond the 100-day limit covered by Medicare, prescription drugs, eyeglasses, and hearing aids. For persons enrolled in both programs, any services that are covered by Medicare are paid for by the Medicare program before any payments are made by the Medicaid program, since Medicaid is always the ""payer of last resort."" Certain other Medicare beneficiaries may receive help with Medicare premium and cost-sharing payments through their state Medicaid program. Qualified Medicare beneficiaries (QMBs) and specified low-Income Medicare beneficiaries (SLMBs) are the best-known categories and the largest in numbers. QMBs are those Medicare beneficiaries who have resources at or below twice the standard allowed under the SSI program, and incomes at or below 100 percent of the FPL. For QMBs, Medicaid pays the Hospital Insurance (HI) and Supplementary Medical Insurance (SMI) premiums and the Medicare coinsurance and deductibles, subject to limits that states may impose on payment rates. SLMBs are Medicare beneficiaries with resources like the QMBs, but with incomes that are higher, though still less than 120 percent of the FPL. For SLMBs, the Medicaid program pays only the SMI premiums. A third category of Medicare beneficiaries who may receive help consists of disabled-and-working individuals. According to the Medicare law, disabled-and-working individuals who previously qualified for Medicare because of disability, but who lost entitlement because of their return to work (despite the disability), are allowed to purchase Medicare  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2001  61   Medicaid HI and SMI coverage. If these persons have incomes below 200 percent of the FPL but do not meet any other Medicaid assistance category, they may qualify to have Medicaid pay their HI premiums as qualified disabled and working individuals (QDWIs). According to CMS estimates, Medicaid currently provides some level of supplemental health coverage for 5 million Medicare beneficiaries within the above three categories. For Medicare beneficiaries with incomes that are above 120 percent and less than 175 percent of the FPL, the BBA establishes a capped allocation to states, for each of the 5 years beginning January 1998, for payment of all or some of the Medicare SMI premiums. These beneficiaries are known as qualifying individuals (QIs). Unlike QMBs and SLMBs, who may be eligible for other Medicaid benefits in addition to their QMB/SLMB benefits, the QIs cannot be otherwise eligible for medical assistance under a state plan. The payment of this QI benefit is 100 percent federally funded, up to the state's allocation. 0  Note: Medicaid data are based on the projections of the Midsession Review of the President's Fiscal Year 2002 Budget and are consistent with data received from the states on the Forms HCFA-2082, HCFA-37, and HCFA-64.

Workers in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands are covered under unemployment insurance programs. To induce states to enact unemployment insurance laws, the Social Security Act of 1935 provided a tax offset incentive. A uniform national tax was imposed on payrolls of industrial and commercial employers who employed eight or more workers in 20 or more weeks in a calendar year. Employers who paid taxes to a state with an approved unemployment insurance law could credit (offset) up to 90 percent of the state tax against the federal tax. This insured that employers in states without an unemployment insurance law would not have an advantage competing with similar businesses in states with such a law because they would still be subject to the federal payroll tax, and their employees would not be eligible for benefits. In addition, the Social Security Act authorized grants to states to meet the costs of administering the state systems. By July 1937, all 48 states, the then territories of Alaska and Hawaii, and the District of Columbia had passed unemployment insurance laws. Later, Puerto Rico adopted its own unemployment insurance program, which was incorporated in 1961 into the federal-state system. A similar program for workers in the Virgin Islands was added in 1978. If employers are to receive an offset against federal taxes and if states are to receive federal grants for administration, federal law requires state unemployment insurance programs to meet certain requirements. These requirements are intended to assure that a state participating in the program has an unemployment insurance system that is fairly administered and financially secure. One requirement is that all contributions collected under state laws be deposited in the unemployment trust fund of the U.S. Treasury Department. The fund is invested as a whole, but each state has a separate account to which its deposits and its share of interest on investments are credited. At any time, a state may withdraw money from its account in the trust fund, but only to pay benefits. Thus, unlike the situation in the majority of states having workers' compensation and temporary disability insurance laws, unemployment insurance benefits are paid exclusively through a public fund. Private plans cannot be substituted for the state plan. Aside from federal standards, each state has major responsibility for the content and development of its unemployment insurance law. The state itself decides the amount and duration of benefits (except for certain federal requirements concerning Federal-State Extended Benefits), the contribution rates (with limitations), and, in general, the eligibility requirements and disqualification provisions. The states also directly administer the programs-collecting contributions, maintaining wage records (where applicable), taking claims, determining eligibility, and paying benefits to unemployed workers.  Coverage Originally, coverage had been limited to employment covered by the Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA), which relates primarily to industrial and commercial workers in private industry. However, several federal laws added substantially to the number and types of workers protected under the state programs, such as the Employment Security Amendments of 1970 and the Unemployment Compensation Amendments of 1976. Private employers in industry and commerce are subject to the law if they have one or more individuals employed on 1 day in each of 20 weeks during the current or preceding year, or if they paid wages of $1,500 or more during any calendar quarter in the current or preceding year. Agricultural workers are covered on farms with a quarterly payroll of at least $20,000 or employing 10 or more employees in 20 weeks of the year. Domestic employees in private households are subject to FUTA if their employer pays wages of $1,000 or more in a calendar quarter. Excluded from coverage are workers employed by their families and the self-employed. Before 1976, employment in state and local governments and nonprofit organizations were exempt from FUTA. However, as a result of federal legislation enacted in 1976, most employment in these groups must now be covered by state law as a condition for securing federal approval of the state law. Under this form of coverage, local government and nonprofit employers have the option of making contributions as under FUTA or of reimbursing the state for benefit expenditures actually made. Elected officials, legislators, members of the judiciary, and the state National Guard are still excluded, as are employees of nonprofit organizations that employ fewer than four workers in 20 weeks in the current or preceding calendar year. Many states have extended coverage beyond that provided by federal legislation. Through special federal legislation, federal civilian employees and ex-servicemembers of the Armed Forces were brought under the unemployment insurance system. Benefits for these persons are financed through federal funds but are administered by the states and paid in accordance with the provisions of the state laws. A separate unemployment insurance law enacted by Congress covers railroad workers.  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2001  63   Unemployment Insurance  Eligibility for Benefits Unemployment benefits are available as a matter of right (without a means test) to unemployed workers who have demonstrated their attachment to the labor force by a specified amount of recent work and/or earnings in covered employment. All workers whose employers contribute to or make payments in lieu of contributions to state unemployment funds, federal civilian employees, and ex-servicemembers are eligible if they are involuntarily unemployed, able to work, available for work, and actively seeking work. Workers must also meet the eligibility and qualifying requirements of the state law and be free from disqualifications. Workers who meet these eligibility conditions may still be denied benefits if they are found to be responsible for their own unemployment.  relatives. The amount allowed per dependent varies considerably by state but generally is $24 or less per week and, in the majority of states, the amount is the same for each dependent. All but 7 states require a waiting period of 1 week of total unemployment before benefits can begin. Three states pay benefits retroactively for the waiting period if unemployment lasts a certain period or if the employee returns to work within a specified period. Except for two jurisdictions, states provide a statutory maximum duration of 26 weeks of benefits in a benefit year. However, jurisdictions vary the duration of benefits through various formulas.  Extended Benefits In the 1970s, a permanent federal-state program of Extended Benefits (EB) was established for workers who exhaust their entitlement to regular state benefits during periods of high unemployment. The program is financed equally from federal and state funds. Employment conditions in an individual state trigger Extended Benefits. This happens when the unemployment rate among insured workers in a state averages 5 percent or more over a 13week period, and is at least 20 percent higher than the rate for the same period in the 2 preceding years. If the insured unemployment rate reaches 6 percent, a state may by state law disregard the 20-percent requirement in initiating Extended Benefits. Once triggered, Extended Benefit provisions remain in effect for at least 13 weeks. When a state's benefit period ends, Extended Benefits to individual workers also end, even if they have received less than their potential entitlement and are still unemployed. Further, once a state's benefit period ends, another statewide period cannot begin for at least 13 weeks. State law determines most eligibility conditions for Extended Benefits and the weekly benefit payable. However, under federal law a claimant applying for Extended Benefits must have had 20 weeks in full-time employment (or the equivalent in insured wages) and must meet special work requirements. A worker who has exhausted his or her regular benefits is eligible for a 50-percent increase in duration of benefits for a maximum of 13 weeks of Extended Benefits. There is, however, an overall maximum of 39 weeks of regular and Extended Benefits. Extended Benefits are payable at the same rate as the weekly amount under the regular state program. Prior to the 1992 legislation, the EB program was based on the insured unemployment rate (IUR)the number of unemployed workers receiving benefits in a state as a percent of the number of persons in unemployment-insurance covered employment in that state. By definition, the IUR does not include workers who have exhausted their benefits but are still unemployed. The 1992 legislation (P.L. 102-318) provided states the option of adopting an additional formula for triggering the  Work Requirements A worker's monetary benefit rights are based on his or her employment in covered work over a prior reference period called the ""base period,"" and these benefit rights remain fixed for a ""benefit year."" In most states, the base period is the first 4 quarters of the last 5 completed calendar quarters preceding the claim for unemployment benefits.  Benefits Under all state laws, the weekly benefit amount-that is, the amount payable for a week of total unemployment-varies with the worker's past wages within certain minimum and maximum limits. In most states, the formula is designed to compensate for a fraction of the usual weekly wage, normally about 50 percent, subject to specified dollar maximums. Three-fourths of the laws use a formula that computes weekly benefits as a fraction of wages in one or more quarters of the base period. Most commonly, the fraction is taken of wages in the quarter during which wages were highest because this quarter most nearly reflects full-time work. In most of these states, the same fraction is used at all benefit levels. The other laws use a weighted schedule that gives a greater proportion of the high-quarter wages to lower paid workers than to those earning more. Each state establishes a ceiling on the weekly benefit amount and no worker may receive an amount larger than the ceiling. The maximum may be either a fixed dollar amount or a flexible amount. Under the latter arrangement, which has been adopted in 35 jurisdictions, the maximum is adjusted automatically in accordance with the weekly wages of covered employees. Twelve states provide additional allowances for certain dependents. They all include children under ages 16, 18, or 19 (and, generally, older if incapacitated); 8 states include a nonworking spouse; and 2 states consider other dependent  64  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2001   Unemployment Insurance permanent Extended Benefits program. Effective March 1993, states had the option of amending their laws to use alternative total unemployment rate triggers in addition to the current insured unemployment rate triggers. Under this option, Extended Benefits would be paid when: (1) the state's seasonally adjusted total unemployment rate for the most recent 3 months is at least 6.5 percent, and (2) that rate is at least 110 percent of the state average total unemployment rate in the corresponding 3-month period in either of the 2 preceding years. States triggering on to the Extended Benefits program under other triggers would provide the regular 26 weeks of unemployment benefits in addition to 13 weeks of Extended Benefits, (which is the same number of weeks of benefits provided previously). In addition, states that have chosen the total unemployment rate option will also amend their state laws to add an additional 7 weeks of Extended Benefits (for a total of 20 weeks) where the total unemployment rate is at least 8 percent and is 110 percent of the state's total unemployment rate for the same 3 months in either of the 2 preceding years. As of March 4, 2001, Extended Benefits were payable for 13 weeks in Alaska based on the insured unemployment rate.  CONTACT: Rita L. DiSimone (202) 358-6221 for further information.  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2001  65   Workers' Compensation  Workers' Compensation Workers' compensation provides cash benefits and medical care when employees suffer work-related injuries or illnesses, and survivor benefits to the dependents of workers whose deaths result from a work-related incident. In exchange for receiving benefits, workers who receive workers' compensation are generally not allowed to bring a tort suit against their employers for damages of any kind. Workers' compensation was the first form of social insurance to develop widely in the United States. The federal government was the first to establish a workers' compensation program, covering its civilian employees with an act that was passed in 1908 to provide benefits for workers engaged in hazardous work. The remaining federal workforce was covered in 1916. Nine states enacted workers' compensation laws in 1911. By 1920, all but 7 states and the District of Columbia had workers' compensation laws. Today each of the 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands has its own program. The federal government covers its employees through its own program, and it also administers the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act, enacted in 1927, which covers longshore and harbor workers throughout the United States. Coal miners suffering from pneumoconiosis, or ""black lung"" disease, are covered by the Black Lung Benefits Act of 1972, with the initial benefits enacted as part of the Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969. Under this program, monthly cash benefits are payable to miners disabled by black lung disease and to their dependents or survivors. Medical benefits are also payable on the basis of a diagnosis of pneumoconiosis. The Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act of 2000 instituted a new program that covers employees, contractors, and sub-contractors of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) for exposure to beryllium and the contraction of chronic beryllium disease. In addition, employees of private companies providing beryllium to DOE are covered. Employees' survivors also receive cash benefits. This same act also covers employees disabled or killed by cancers that developed after beginning employment at a DOE or an atomic weapons facility, as long as the cancer was at least ""as likely as not"" related to this employment, subject to a number of guidelines relating to radiation exposure, type of cancer, and other relevant factors. It also provides benefits for silica-related diseases and to uranium miners and their survivors who have received lump sum payments under the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, and establishes an Office of Worker Advocacy in the DOE to deal with other claims of work-related occupational disease.  Coverage In 1999, state and federal workers' compensation laws covered about 123.9 million employees. Covered payroll in 1999--that is, total wages paid to covered workers--was $4.1 trillion. Common exemptions from coverage are domestic service, agricultural employment, small employers, and casual labor. However, 39 programs have some coverage for agricultural workers, and 25 programs have some coverage for domestic workers. Many programs exempt employees of nonprofit, charitable, or religious institutions. The coverage of state and local public employees differs widely from one state program to another. Two other major groups outside the coverage of workers' compensation laws are railroad employees engaged in interstate commerce and seamen in the U.S. Merchant Marine. These workers have health insurance and shortterm and long-term cash benefit plans that cover disabilities whether or not the conditions are work-related. In addition, under federal laws these workers retain the right to bring tort suits against their employers for negligence in the case of work-related injuries or illness. The programs are compulsory for most private employment, except in Texas, where it is elective. That is, in Texas employers may accept or reject coverage under the law. If they reject it, they lose the customary common-law defenses against suits by employees in private industry.  Benefits The benefits provided under workers' compensation include periodic cash payments and medical services to the worker during the period of disablement for the disabling condition. They also include death and funeral benefits to the workers' survivors. Lump-sum settlements are permitted under most programs. Approximately three-fourths of all worker's compensation cases involve only medical benefits. Cash wage replacement benefits are categorized according to the duration and severity of the worker's disability. Temporary and Permanent Total Disability A large majority of compensation cases involving cash payments involve temporary total disability. That is, the employee is unable to work at all while he or she is recovering from the injury but the worker is expected to recover. When workers' lost time exceeds the waiting period (3 to 7 days, depending on the state) they receive a percentage of their weekly wages--typically two-thirds--up to a maximum weekly amount. The maximum generally is set at some percentage of the state's average weekly wage, ranging from 66-2/3 percent to 200 percent, but typically 100 percent.  66  Social Security Bulletin  Annual Statistical Supplement  2001   Workers' Compensation In some cases, workers return to work prior to the date they reach maximum medical improvement and thus have reduced responsibilities and an accompanying lower salary. In those cases, they receive temporary partial disability benefits. After the date of maximum medical improvement, if a disability is severe enough, the worker receives permanent total disability benefits. Very few workers compensation cases are found to have permanent total disabilities. Permanent Partial Disability If the permanent disability of a worker is only partial and may or may not lessen work ability, permanent partial disability benefits are payable. The system for determining benefits in these cases is very complex and varies significantly across jurisdictions. Some states provide benefits based on an impairment rating process. The level of impairment, often expressed as a percent of total disability, is used to determine the benefit amount. Some states provide benefits based on the loss of earning capacity. They use impairment ratings with modifications based on vocational factors, such as the worker's education, job experience, and age. Other states use systems that attempt to compensate workers for actual lost wages. Death Benefits Generally, compensation is related to earnings and to the number of dependents payable to the survivors of workers who die from a work related illness or injury. Benefits are capped in 26 states. Medical Benefits All compensation acts require that medical aid be furnished to workers suffering from a work-related injury or illness witho"
GX267-73-12596959	"Department of Consumer & Business Services  Oregon Insurance  Insurance Division  REGUL ATOR Fall 2003  Lawmakers address varied insurance issues during 2003 legislative session he Oregon Legislature passed a number of bills relating to insurance during its 2003 session. Lawmakers addressed a variety of issues, including credit scoring, privacy of personal health information, rating and underwriting of health insurance, regulation of insurance transactions by depository institutions, professional liability and tort reform, and environmental cleanup.  Rural doctors to get break on insurance Most rural physicians in Oregon will pay less for medical professional liability insurance, thanks to a bill approved in the 2003 session. Governor Ted Kulongoski proposed HB 3630 to give immediate rate relief to rural doctors while a long-term solution is considered for a market-wide problem. Under the bill, the State Accident Insurance Fund Corp. will reimburse insurers for part of the cost of coverage for qualifying physicians for calendar years 2004-2007. In exchange, SAIF will get to claim a credit against its Oregon workers' compensation premium assessment. Rural obstetricians will see up to an 80 percent reduction in premiums. Family or general pr actice doctors who provide obstetrical services will get up to a 60 percent reduction, and other rural physicians can qualify for up to a 40 percent reduction. Please see DOCTORS, Page 7  T  Insurance-related legislation approved in the 2003 session is summarized in this issue of the Oregon Insurance Regulator. These summaries are not intended to be a complete and detailed statement of all insurance-rated laws passed by the 2003 Legislature. For more information, including links to approved bills, visit the Please see LEGISLATURE, Page 5  Legislature restricts use of credit scoring The 2003 Ore g on Le gislature approved a ban on using a policyholder's credit information to raise premiums. Senate Bill 260 also prohibits insurers from canceling or refusing to renew existing policies because of credit history. SB 260 will allow insurers to continue using credit information when deciding whether to issue a new policy, but only if they can document that it helps them predict future claim costs and price their products fairly for consumers. At the same time, insurance companies must demonstrate that credit information is used as part of an evaluation system that also relies on other actuarially-relevant factors. The bill also requires insurers using credit history to file their scoring models with the Department of Consumer & Business Services. The bill augments an Insurance Division administrative rule that prohibited insurers from canceling or refusing to renew existing policies because of credit history problems. SB 260 is effective for policies renewed January 1, 2004, or later.  New premium surcharge may generate consumer questions Insurers and agents may get questions from consumers who notice a new premium surcharge on their property and casualty insurance policies next year. HB 3051, passed in the 2003 legislative session, changes the way insurers recoup assessments paid to the Oregon Insurance Guarantee Association (OIGA). Authorized property and casualty insurers in Oregon are required to participate in the OIGA, which settles unpaid claims when an insurer becomes insolvent. OIGA then assesses other member insurers to cover claim costs. Current law allows insurers to claim tax credits to offset the assessment, thus reducing state revenues. Under HB 3051, insurers will instead recoup any OIGA assessment by surcharging each policyholder. HB 3051 applies to assessments imposed on or after Jan. 1, 2003, and to earlier assessments that haven't been fully recouped. Insurers can start recouping assessments beginning Jan. 1 of the year after the assessment was imposed, so the surcharge will begin showing up in January 2004. The amount of the surcharge will be listed on the policy premium statement or declaration page. The surcharge is estimated to be less than 1 percent of policy premiums in 2004. Policies will be assessed as needed by the OIGA, so the surcharge may not appear at each renewal cycle. For more information, visit the Insurance Division's Web site: oregoninsurance.org. Click on What's New.   Page 2  Oregon Insurance Regulator  Fall 2003  A G E NT L I C E N S I N G  Legislators approve several changes to licensing laws By Margarita Nuez The following changes will take effect Jan. 1, 2004, as a result of passage of Senate Bill 253 by the Oregon Legislature:  Commissions and service fees -- An insurer or insurance producer will be allowed to charge a commission, a service fee, or a combination of the two when transacting insurance except for the following: 1. Insurance covering an individual's person, property, or liability 2. Life or health insurance for groups of fewer than 51 lives 3. Insurance on a commercial or public entity paying combined annual premiums of less than $100,000 for insurance A written agreement with the consumer is required prior to binding or issuing an insurance policy.  License reinstatement period -- The license reinstatement period will be shortened from two years to one year, so if you let your license expire for more than one year, you'll have to reapply for a license. This change brings Oregon into conformance with national licensing standards. We will change all licenses expired for more than one year to an ""expired nonrenewable"" status.  Notice of appointments -- Insurers will no longer be required to file notices of appointments with the Insurance Division. Instead, insurers will need to maintain a current list of contracted insurance producers and make it available to the division upon request. All active appointments in the Agent Licensing database will be terminated as of Jan. 1, 2004. Affiliation notices of agents to agencies will still be required.  Good-bye agents, hello producers -- The term ""producer"" will replace ""agent"" throughout the Oregon Revised Statutes (ORS). All of our forms will be revised to indicate this change. New licenses using the term ""producer"" will be issued for active agents at renewal. Licensing exam update Promissor, our new vendor, has been administering Oregon licensing exams since July. Candidates for licenses now need to pay their exam fees directly to Promissor instead of the Insurance Division as they did in the past. We will refund any exam fees we receive from candidates who mistakenly send them to us. Promissor operates permanent testing sites in Tigard; Kennewick and Vancouver, Washington; and Boise, Idaho. Exams also can be taken at temporary sites in Eugene and Medford. Promissor plans to open permanent sites in Eugene Dec. 5 and in Medford Dec. 13. Exam site addresses, directions, hours, and other information are available on the Insurance Division's Web site, oregoninsurance.org. Click on Agent Information, then Application process for all license categories. Law and ethics requirements Agents are reminded that they must take three hours of law and two hours of ethics before every renewal. The only agents exempt from this continuing-education requirement are those who hold a limited lines license or have been granted a continuing-education exemption. New continuing education course topic Some new continuing education courses are being approved under the agency management topic. This topic includes subject matter on office management, client relations, and improving the operations of an agent's business. Agents can count up to four hours of agency management courses toward their continuing education requirement. These courses can be identified by looking at the course registration number assigned to the course. All course registration numbers for agency management will start with a ""P,"" followed by the number of hours that have been approved for the agency management course or section.  Margarita Nuez is manager of the Agent Licensing Unit.  Insurers, agents flunk Medigap test How accurate is the Medigap information Oregon consumers receive from insurance companies and agents? Not very, according to a ""secret shopper"" survey conducted by staff from the Senior Health Insurance Benefits Assistance (SHIBA) program. Tw enty-eight insurers that sell Medigap plans in Oregon were asked about four common situations involving federal and/or state guaranteed-issue rights for Medicare beneficiaries losing their health insurance. Some companies responded directly and some referred questions to an agent. Companies and agents correctly responded to the survey questions less than a third of the time on average. On one  question regarding Oregon Medigap protections, only 15.4 percent of respondents got the right answer. If you'd like to test your Medigap knowledge, visit the Insurance Division's Web site, oregoninsurance.org. Click on Agent Licensing. SHIBA held a Medigap workshop in November and plans to send training materials to companies selling Medigap plans.

Insurance-related legislation is summarized in this issue of the Oregon Insurance Regulator and on our Web site (oregoninsurance.org), but I wanted to highlight several key measures:  Credit scoring. Passage of Senate Bill 260 gives us significantly improved tools to regulate credit scoring. The legislation, which augments our administrative rules, generally bans use of credit history in rating and underwriting for renewal business. Insurers can still use credit for new business, subject to certain restrictions.  Insurance Division bills. Lawmakers passed several bills we sponsored. SB 235 establishes important consumer safeguards banks must follow when selling insurance. SB 253 allows producers to represent either insurers or insureds, and to charge fees when transacting certain types of commercial insurance.  Medical professionals and contractors. Legislators took action to help two markets in desperate need of good news: liability insurance for medical professionals and contractors. HB 3630 provides a financial mechanism administered by SAIF that will enable insurers to offer reduced rates to rural doctors. Contractors and insurers may see some relief through passage of SB 909, which requires  O  a homeowner to follow certain procedures to remedy problems with a contractor before suing, and SB 943, which allows contractors to pursue insurance alternatives such as self insurance. Governor praises electronic complaint filing Oregon's executive and legislative branches have made regulatory streamlining and improved customer service top priorities during the next two years. I was pleased that Governor Ted Kulongoski recognized the division for making it easy for consumers to file complaints online. Division begins reorganization process A reorganization of the Insurance Division is underway. Jann Goodpaster will manage our new Market Regulation Section, which will allow us to better integrate rates and forms with other compliance functions, including market analysis, market conduct, and investigations. Senior policy advisor joins division I'm pleased to welcome Shelley Bain to our executive team as a senior policy advisor. Her legal background will be invaluable as she analyzes the many complex issues facing insurance regulators today. Shelley joins Michael Morter, who focuses on legislative and stakeholder relations, and Lewis Littlehales, our longtime legislation and administrative rules coordinator.

Unless otherwise specified, the effective date of a bill is Jan. 1, 2004. A bill may also have one or more operative dates that apply to one or more sections, in addition to its effective date. An operative date is the date on which the affected section or sections first apply. Bills passed in 2003 are listed by their bill numbers, and, if known, their Oregon Laws chapter numbers. SB indicates a Senate bill, while HB indicates a House bill. DCBS is the Department of Consumer & Business Services. Insurance regulation generally  The bill makes similar changes relating to compensation for transactions between a wholesale insurance producer and a retail insurance producer, and between a surplus lines licensee and an insurance customer or a producing agent. This bill does not require insurers to amend their contracts, policy forms, and other documents to conform them to the change to ""insurance producer."" HB 2278 -- Insurance regulation HB 2278 mak es miscellaneous changes to the implementation and enforcement of insurance laws by DCBS, although the bulk of the bill deals with non-insurance issues. Changes in the insurance portion of HB 2278 include:  Making health-care service contractors subject to the same regulatory review to which insurers are subject to for transactions involving insurers within an insurance holding company system and for extraordinary dividends by insurers.  Allowing the DCBS director to delegate the title of insurance commissioner.  Repealing the DCBS director's authority to exempt from the Insurance Code entities that transact certain limited types of insurance, but allowing existing exemptions to continue. HB 3145 -- Home service agreements (ch 283) HB 3145 ex cludes ""home service ag reements"" from the definition of ""home protection insurance"" in the Insurance Code. A home service agreement is defined as a contract for a specific and limited duration to service, repair, or replace the mechanical or appliance system of an existing home, or provide incidental service, repair, or replacement to cover leaks and failures in roofing systems. Life and health insurance  The bill provides that the minimum nonforfeiture amount equals the then accumulated value, according to a formula using a minimum interest rate of 3 percent or a calculation based on five-year Treasury notes, whichever is less, but not less than 1 percent. The bill also allows the DCBS director to adopt rules for equity-indexed products. HB 2306 -- Privacy of health insurance information (ch 87) HB 2306 gives the DCBS director rulemaking authority to reconcile state and federal privacy requirements relating to personal records in the hands of health insurers and other licensees transacting health insurance. Effective date: May 24, 2003. HB 2987 -- Individual and smallgroup health insurance market changes (ch 599) HB 2987 authorizes health insurance carriers in the individual market to impose waivers of coverage on pre-existing conditions for up to 24 months. Under current law, exclusions for pre-existing conditions are limited to six months. The bill allows individuals who are offered the longer waiver periods to be eligible for coverage under the Oregon Medical Insurance Pool. The bill also authorizes small-group market carriers to charge the highestrated group up to 2.5 times as much as they charge the lowest-rated group. Under current law, carriers may charge the highest-rated group up to twice as much. The bill authorizes carriers in the small group market to give groups a 5 percent credit if all eligible employees enroll for coverage. Current law does not provide for such credits. HB 2987 authorizes the DCBS director to obtain data from carriers to assess the bill's effect on the marketplace. HB 3431 -- Individual health insurance market changes (ch 590) HB 3431 authorizes a health insurance carrier offering individual health benefit plans to limit the choice of plans in which an individual may enroll. Under current law, if a carrier accepts an individual for a specific plan, the individual can choose among all of the plans offered by the carrier. Please see LEGISLATURE, Page 7  SB 235 -- Transaction of insurance by depository institutions (ch 363) SB 235 conforms existing state regulation of insurance trade practices by depository institutions to guidelines and limitations of the federal Gramm-LeachBliley Act, furthering the federal law's purpose of integrating banking, insurance and securities services. Federal law allows depository institutions to transact insurance but also authorizes a state to impose specific consumer protections governing them when they transact insurance. Regulation of insurance activities by depository institutions is retained in the Insurance Code. SB 253 -- Insurance producers (ch 364) SB 253 further facilitates interstate licensing of insurance agents and otherwise updates Oregon's laws governing their compensation. The bill eliminates the ""agent"" terminology and replaces it with ""insurance producer"" and authorizes an insurance producer to represent an insurer or the purchaser of insurance. The bill also allows an insurance producer to charge a full or reduced commission, a service fee or a combination of the two when transacting commercial insurance. In order to charge a fee, an insurance producer must have a written agreement with the prospective insured that meets conditions established by the DCBS director by rule.  SB 734 -- Individual deferred annuities, nonforfeiture (ch 370) SB 734 amends provisions of the Insurance Code governing nonforfeiture of deferred annuities that ensure a surrender value when the policyholder decides to discontinue further payments. Current law provides that the minimum nonforfeiture amount equals the then accumulated value, according to a formula, at 3 percent interest.   Page 6  Oregon Insurance Regulator  Fall 2003  P R O D U C E R A CT I O N S Actions against insurance producers are summarized below.

If you need to lose a significant amount of weight, consult your doctor          as to what may be the most effective means.         Strategies          may include exercise, nutritional guidance or treatment by prescription.          For those with a prolonged history of obesity, gastric bypass surgery          may be an option.         Gastric          bypass – sometimes called bariatric surgery — can be risky.          During the surgery, a small pouch about an ounce in capacity is created          by stapling off a large section of the stomach. A portion of the small          intestine is then re-routed and connected to the pouch.          This          greatly reduces the amount of food that can be ingested, resulting in          nearly instant weight loss. Here are some pros and cons:                                 Risks                                        Ten              to 20 percent of patients require some sort of follow-up procedure              because of complications.                                                              Some              patients develop gallstones. The risk for gallstones increases during              substantial weight loss.                                                              Approximately              30 percent of patients develop nutritional deficiencies.                                      Benefits                                        Surgery              can improve obesity-related conditions such as diabetes and high blood              pressure.                                                              Most              patients lose weight quickly and continue to lose it for up to 24              months.                                                                Many              patients can maintain a loss of 100 pounds in the long-term.                           Not          all health plans cover this procedure, and those that do have strict guidelines          that must be met.          Check          with your health plan to see if gastric bypass is a covered benefit and          what is required.         If          gastric bypass surgery isn’t for you, talk to your physician about          other alternatives to weight control.

Exempt          employees with at least one year of service have state-paid life insurance          coverage in the amount of their annual salary. The insurance plan is administered          by Medical Life Insurance Company.          Until          now the only option for exempt employees upon leaving state service was          to convert the state-paid basic life policy to an individual, whole life          product. Whole life policies are a more expensive option than term life          insurance, however employees do not have to provide evidence of good health          to convert their coverage.                      Medical          Life is now offering a portability option in which separating employees          may apply to take their existing term insurance policy with them on a          self-pay basis. This less costly option requires that employee’s          provide evidence of good health and is not guaranteed to be issued.          However,          if the portability application is denied, employees still have the option          to convert their coverage. Ask your agency benefits office for the Medical          Life portability and conversion application forms ( Z6098           and  ML9212)  when you leave state service,          or you may download them from the Forms section of the Benefits Web site          at  www.ohio.gov/employeebenefits .                                                    Health        Care Spending Account                         T here          are many medical bills not covered by insurance. Examples include copays          and deductibles, a second pair of glasses, or the remaining expenses for          laser eye surgery or adult orthodontia.         Employees          will have an opportunity to set money aside on a pre-tax basis to help          cover such expenditures beginning Jan. 1, 2005.         The          Health Care Spending Account will allow individuals covered by a health          plan to set aside up to $500 in 2005 to cover these additional health          care costs. Receipts for eligible expenditures can be submitted to the          spending account vendor for reimbursement.                      To          judge the amount of money you may wish to put into your spending account,          you may wish to begin tracking those health care expenditures you make          this year that are not covered by insurance. Then when it is time for          you to determine the amount to set aside in your account, you can base          your decision on this year’s experience. Participation in the HCSA          program will be voluntary. Read more about it in future  Pathways .                                                          What’s        Your Reason for Quitting Tobacco?                         E veryone          has a reason to stop using tobacco. Whether your reason is your children,          your health, your wallet, your morning cough, your unborn child or the          smell of your clothes, there is a new service proven to help tobacco users          quit for good.           The          Ohio Tobacco Quit Line,  1-800-934-4840 ,          is a toll-free telephone counseling service that connects people who want          to quit using tobacco with trained counselors who can guide and support          them through the quitting process.          This          free service, provided by the Ohio Tobacco Use Prevention and Control          Foundation, is available in both English and Spanish to people calling          from anywhere in Ohio. Additionally, hearing -impaired individuals may          utilize a TTY by calling 1-888-229-2182.                                 Quitting now has            big benefits. Tobacco users start to realize the health effects within            20 minutes of quitting, reduce their risk of heart attack by half in            one year, and cut their risk of lung cancer in half by 10 years. It            is never too late.           State employees            also can receive help through the Ohio Employee Assistance Program (Ohio            EAP) which covers counseling service for tobacco cessation and can arrange            for group counseling at work sites.

Health        Care Consumerism                                    H ealth            care consumerism is a term that you will be hearing more and more in            relation to rising health care costs. Consumerism refers to the effect            that a consumer’s choices have and the reaction of providers to            those choices. Laser eye surgery provides a great example of consumerism            in action.           Most            insurance plans do not cover laser eye surgery because it is not considered            a medical necessity, yet patients are flocking to have the surgery performed            at their own cost.            Clinics            advertise discounts and package deals ranging from $2,000 to $990 to            get patients in the door. Patients, as the consumers, are looking at            the cost — and hopefully the quality — of the providers to            find the best product for the least cost, creating marketplace competition,            with the result that costs are held down.                                   For          consumerism to have an effect on the health care marketplace is a challenge.          Employees are inundated with information from a variety of sources, but          do not necessarily know which is the best option. Comparison data is almost          non-existent and expecting patients to comparison shop when they’re          dealing with expensive chronic conditions is unrealistic.          Costs          are increasing at an alarming rate. More and more, employers are forced          to shift these costs to their employees, or cut benefits altogether. Many          employers have begun to realize that viewing health care in a vacuum will          not work.         Managing          health care must be integrated with all facets of an employee’s life          and benefits, from preventive care to lifestyle changes, along with consistent          communication and education in costs and choices.                                   The            State of Ohio, in conjunction with the Joint Health Care Committee,            is examining ways in which state employees can be given more choices            and can become savvy health care consumers. Consumerism will become            a regular topic in  Pathways  for employees to learn more about            the changing health care market and how it is being addressed.                                                                      Long        Term Care Available To State Employees                                    W hat            exactly is long term care? While many people think that long term care            is a type of care provided only in nursing facilities, it is actually            much more than that. Long term care refers to a wide range of personal            care, health care and social services for people of all ages who can            no longer care for themselves because of chronic illness, long-lasting            disability or the effects of aging. It provides help with usual daily            activities such as eating, dressing or walking and it is often called            custodial care. Long term care is not like acute medical care which            helps people recover from an illness or injury.            Often,            long term care does not take place in a nursing home or other facility.            For every person in a nursing facility, it is estimated that there are            two or three people in a home environment with the same level of need.            Some 80 percent of these people are cared for by family members or friends.                                                        The          cost of long term care          In metropolitan areas, some nursing facilities now charge more than $160          per day — that’s $58,400 per year. Even care at home can cost          $20,000 a year. Many people believe that Medicare or their regular health          care benefits will cover these costs. But this is not true. Health plans          primarily pay for short-term medical care, not long-term custodial care.                   Medicaid          does cover long term care, but only for people living at or below the          poverty level. For many people, the personal and financial burdens of          this care are left up to the spouse and family — who often spend          their life savings in less than a year.          Aetna’s          Long Term Care Plan available to state employees is designed to fill this          need. The plan helps pay the cost of long term care, and also gives employees          the option to choose a level of coverage that suits their own needs and          budgets.                                   For            those who qualify for benefits, the plan reimburses daily expenses  from            $50 to $200  to help cover the cost of long term care in nursing            facilities or in home-care settings. You may enroll in this plan at            any time during the year.

How        To Avoid Shock At The Pharmacy                         H ave          you ever tried to get your prescription filled at the local pharmacy,          only to be told that your benefit plan doesn’t cover the drug your          doctor prescribed?            Or,          perhaps you learned the price for a mail-order prescription you fill every          90 days suddenly jumped from $20 to $60? To avoid shock at the pharmacy,          you have to learn the minute details about how your prescription drug          benefit works. Be sure to read carefully communications about your prescription          program.          Most          employment-based prescription drug benefits are administered by companies          known as pharmacy-benefit managers. The Ohio Med Plan and the HMOs use          Medco Health and others, including Express Scripts, as their pharmacy          benefit managers.         Employers          and insurance companies contract with pharmacy benefit managers to help          design prescription benefit plans, process pharmacy claims, and look for          red flags in drug usage. These pharmacy benefit managers negotiate with          pharmaceutical manufacturers for volume discounts on prescription drugs.          They employ medical professionals to recommend drug coverage and courses          of therapy. The pharmacy benefit mangers can decide which drugs will be          covered under the plan and at what price levels.                                  What          emerges is a list of covered prescription drugs, both generic and brand          name, called a formulary. A formulary is a list of medications that have          been determined to be clinically appropriate, and they’re the most          cost-effective for the drug therapy that is required.          Some          formularies are “closed”, meaning, if the prescription drug          is not on the list, it is not covered under the plan. Consumers who wish          to purchase that drug have to pay full price for it. The most generous          formularies, in contrast, are “open”. Plan members may receive          reimbursement for prescription drugs not listed on the formulary.         Tiered          formulary plans try to drive generic use by providing an impressive cost          incentive to consumers. These formularies typically divide prescription          drugs into three tiers: generics, ""preferred"" brands and ""non-preferred""          brands. Progressively higher ""copayments"" are assigned to each          tier. The state plan actually contains a fourth tier for ""non-preferred""          brands that have a generic equivalent. For these drugs, you will pay the          copay plus the difference in cost between the brand name drug and the          generic.Plans with a ""coinsurance"" approach, on the other hand,          require consumers to pay a percentage of the cost of each prescription          drug, regardless of whether it's a generic or brand name.                                   Formularies            usually give consumers a price break for selecting generic drugs. Generics            contain the same active ingredients as the brand names and have the            same medical benefits. Not all brand-name drugs have a generic equivalent            due to patent protections. But as more generics become available each            year, they’re gaining popularity with consumers.           Some            prescription drugs require prior authorization from your physician before            your plan will allow them to be filled at your pharmacy. This means            the drug is not favored as the first line of treatment for your condition.            It’s probably more expensive than the preferred drug but not necessarily            more effective. Your doctor may have to defend the choice before it            will be covered.           To            control rising drug costs, learn the incentives your plan offers. Be            familiar with your formulary and before you leave the doctor’s            office, ask your doctor whether a generic substitute is available for            your prescriptions. Ask about alternative courses of therapy that may            cost less under your plan and also whether you still need the prescriptions            you are currently taking, particularly if you’ve changed providers.

The cost of assisted living varies greatly, ranging from under $1,000 to over $5,000 per month. The average cost for a month is about $2,000. The variation is based on many factors, including:  The kind of and number of services  AND  HOW  TO  PAY  fee,"" ""community fee,"" ""deposit,"" ""activity fee,"" or any other of a number of names. Depending on the contract, you may recover all, part, or none of an initial or monthly fee when you leave. Most facilities base their fee on how much care you need. The facility evaluates you at the time of admission, and conducts re-evaluations regularly while you continue to live there. The more care that you need, the higher the fee. A facility may have several ""levels of care"" for which it charges.

Almost all assisted living services are paid for by residents (or their families) out of their personal funds. Long term care insurance generally will pay for assisted living, but the insurance must be purchased in advance and paid for from personal funds. Health Insurance, Medicare, and Medicaid Many people think Medicare or private health insurance help pay for assisted living and other long-term care services. This is wrong. Medicare and private health insurance usually will not pay for the costs of assisted living. If you have limited resources, Medicaid may provide financial assistance under certain limited circumstances. Ordinarily, Medicaid is available for long-term care only if you reside in a nursing home. However, Maryland has a new Medicaid program that can pay for assisted living services if you meet its strict eligibility requirements. The new program is called the Medicaid Home and Community Based Waiver Services for Older Adults (""Medicaid Waiver Program""). It serves a limited number of people. If all the openings are filled, Medicaid will not be able to pay for your assisted living services.    covered by the basic fee; Medication administration; Special diets, snacks, and room service meals; Maid service; Laundry; Cable television; Private telephone line and utility services; Personal services like barber or beauty parlor services; and Transportation.  The cost of assisted living care may very well exhaust your savings. Assisted living facilities are not obligated to continue to keep you if you cannot pay for services. Nonpayment will be a ground for discharging you. It is important for you to consider what would happen if your money ran out while you lived in assisted living, and to have a plan for that possibility.  24 - Assisted Living in Maryland: What You Need to Know   To qualify for the Medicaid Waiver Program, you must be at least 50 years old and meet both the medical and financial eligibility standards. To satisfy the medical standard, you must require enough care to qualify to live in a nursing home (even though you plan to live in assisted living). The financial eligibility standards are an income test and asset test. You must have limited income and assets to be eligible. The financial eligibility rules are complex, but basically, your assets have to be less than $2,500 or $2,000, depending on eligibility category, and your monthly income cannot exceed three times the SSI amount for a single person. This number is adjusted annually for inflation and is $1,635 in 2002. Medicaid will not count as assets, your or your spouses's, cars or pre-arranged funerals. Also, under certain circumstances, your spouse can keep up to half of your joint assets. The eligibility standards are too complex to be summarized in this booklet so for more information on eligibility for the Medicaid Waiver Program call the Legal Aid Bureau's Assisted Living Project or your local agency on aging. You can also get an application from your local agency on aging. See Chapter 9 for the agency on aging closest to you and the contact information for the Legal Aid Bureau. You can also get information from the Legal Aid Bureau's website at www.mdlab.org.  Senior Assisted Living Group Home Subsidy Program The Maryland Department of Aging has a limited subsidy program that you may be eligible for if you are elderly and live in an assisted living facility that participates in the subsidy program. Only facilities that have between four and sixteen beds participate in this program. There are often waiting lists for the program. To be eligible you have to have limited assets and income. While the numbers change from year to year, in order to be eligible at the time this booklet was printed in 2002 your monthly income would have to be less than $1,945 and your assets less than $11,000. To apply, or for more information, contact your local agency on aging. See Chapter 9 for the agency on aging closest to you. Long-Term Care Insurance Long-term care insurance can pay for assisted living. The cost of long-term care insurance varies greatly, depending on the options you select and your medical condition. If you already need assisted living services, you probably will not be able to purchase a policy. If you are over age 85, even if you are in good health, you may also have a hard time finding a policy.  Assisted Living in Maryland: What You Need to Know - 25   The older a person is when a policy is purchased, the more expensive the policy will be. However, even if it is too late for one spouse to purchase coverage, it may not be too late for the other spouse to buy a policy. Annual premiums can range from a few hundred dollars for a healthy 40-year old to thousands of dollars for a 70-year old. Most policies offer premiums that are ""level,"" that is, the rates do not change as you age. However, an insurance company typically can raise rates for a group of policyholders if it can show the rates are too low. Long-term care insurance policies are offered in many different options. It is very important for you to understand what a particular policy covers, as well as the rules affecting when the policy goes into effect. What services are covered Make sure the insurance policy includes assisted living care. It is a good idea to buy a policy that covers all types of long-term care: home care, day care, assisted living, and nursing home services. Long-term care insurance may not necessarily include assisted living services, although most policies written in the last few years will. Older policies may be limited to nursing home care or at-home care. The ""assisted living"" concept was not common until recently so many older policies do not mention it or cover it.  Tax Deductions Long-term care insurance premiums may be deducted from your federal income taxes. The deduction is based on the age of the person insured. The deduction covers only a small part of the actual insurance policy cost, ranging from about $220 for persons age 40 or less to about $2,700 for persons over age 70, but it should not be overlooked. Maryland offers a one-time state income tax credit of up to $500 for your purchase of long-term care insurance. A credit is different from a deduction in that the full amount is taken directly out of the amount of taxes owed to the State. For More Information For more information about long-term care insurance, contact the United Seniors Health Cooperative, 409 3rd Street SW, Suite 200, Washington, D.C. 20024, telephone (202) 479-6678; the Maryland Insurance Administration at (410) 468-2000 or 1-800-492-6116; or your local Senior Health Insurance Assistance Program. See Chapter 9 for information on your local Senior Health Insurance Assistance Program. Reverse Mortgages Reverse mortgages enable you to convert the equity in your home to cash. The cash can be spent to pay for assisted living. However, in most cases, to qualify for a reverse mortgage, there must be one borrower living in the  26 - Assisted Living in Maryland: What You Need to Know   home. So, if you are single, a reverse mortgage probably will not help with assisted living expenses. A reverse mortgage is based on your age, the value of your home, and interest rates. Reverse mortgages are available to you if you are at least 62 years of age. The value of the home will be less after you take out a reverse mortgage. This means that your heirs will receive less money than they would if there was no reverse mortgage on your home. Banks, mortgage firms, and financial service companies offer reverse mortgages. You should do a lot of research to make sure you find a reputable reverse mortgage lender. There have been unscrupulous people using the reverse mortgage idea to scam seniors. You should also shop around to compare options. For more information, contact the National Center for Home Equity Conversions at (651) 222-6775 or visit their website at www.reverse.org. Reverse mortgages can have substantial financial ramifications so you should contact a financial planner, accountant, or attorney before entering into one. Tax Deductions and Credits If you are paying your own pocket, all of the cost for living may be tax medical expense. out of some or assisted deductible as a To get the deduction,  a resident must be ""chronically ill"" and receive care prescribed by a doctor or another health care provider. See IRS Publication 502 for more information. To be considered ""chronically ill"" your doctor or other licensed health care practitioner must determine that you are unable to perform at least two activities of daily living for at least 90 days without substantial assistance from another or that you have a severe cognitive impairment (such as Alzheimer's disease) and need substantial supervision to be protected from threats to your health and safety. You can only deduct medical expenses that are more than 7.5% of your adjusted gross income. Thus, you can only have a deduction for assisted living costs if your total medical expenses, including your assisted living costs, exceed 7.5 % of your adjusted gross income. Consult your tax advisor for more information about the tax deductibility of assisted living services.

GX266-31-9553099	"INSURANCE DEPARTMENT I. INTRODUCTION: INTERNAL SCAN  The Insurance Department is responsible for supervising and regulating insurance business in New York State. The Department's mission is to ensure the continued sound and prudent conduct of insurers' financial operations; provide fair, timely and equitable fulfillment of insurer obligations; protect policyholders from financially impaired or insolvent insurers; eliminate fraud, other criminal abuse and unethical conduct in the industry; and foster growth of the insurance industry in the State. The State's aging population will greatly impact on the Insurance Department's programs and policies with respect to automobile, property, life and health insurance and consumer protection and education. Since the trend of a healthier, more active senior population is expected to continue, there should be more focus on distribution and innovation in product offerings to better serve the needs of an expanding and multicultural senior population. Some aspects under consideration include: Automobile Insurance : Will seniors in 2015 be driving in daytime Will they be taking shorter, less frequent trips? Will they be subject to renew their drivers' licenses? Are they more or less likely to have they are driving fewer miles? What is the impact on auto premiums or off- peak hours? to re- testing in order accidents because for seniors?  Homeowners Insurance : Will seniors be more likely to own or rent in 2015? Will they live alone? Will the trend toward seasonal residence continue? Do they fully understand the coverages and exclusions that can apply in shoreline communities? Life Insurance : People who are living longer need to purchase products that will enable them to accumulate money (invest) and to liquidate or annuit ize that sum of money over their lifetimes so they will not outlive their funds. Pure protection life insurance (such as term life insurance) is geared more to younger people with dependents to support. The challenge to the industry in 2015 will be to re fine life insurance products to meet these changing needs, while at the same time not leaving out others who need pure protection. Health Insurance : As the population ages, there will be more interest in long- term care insurance, Medicare supplement policies and Medicare HMOs. Continuing Care Retirement Communities (CCRCs) -- which are regulated by the Insurance Department along with the Department of Health and Office for the Aging -- will also play a more significant role by the year 2015. In addition, the financial stability of some health insurers could be at risk should premiums fail to keep up with the rising claims of an aging policyholder base.  159   INSURANCE DEPARTMENT  Consumer Protection and Education: As new products are introduced in the marketplace there will be an increased demand for consumer education and protection against fraud and abuse. Regulators will need to evaluate the implications of the following: Changing Methods of Distribution: There may be a decline in the role of agents for certain products and an increase of the Internet as a distribution channel of insurance. New Products : The insurance community (insurers, agents and regulators) attitudes and practices toward the senior market need to be redirected in order to identify this market and its emerging lifestyle changes and evolving needs. Information Technology : Baby boomers reaching retirement age may be more likely to use the Internet for research and pricing of insurance products than the current senior population as many are already familiar with computers and have access to the web. Regulators need to recognize the role of e- business in product administration, distribution and information sharing. For each line of insurance, the Department must ensure that new products developed for the aging population and others are easily understandable and provide meaningful coverage. The Department will continue to consider new and innovative means of educating aging citizens about the products most useful to them. The Department has over the past decade initiated numerous policies and procedures designed with the senior market in mind. The following reflects departmental initiatives to address demographic changes: Long -term Care Insurance : In 1993, the New York State Partnership for Long- term Care was initiated in New York State to encourage more people to purchase long- term care insurance policies. The Partnership Program allows those persons who purchase Partnership approved long- term care policies to qualify for Medicaid without spending down their assets once the benefits under the long- term care policy are exhausted. Medicare Supplement Insurance (aka Medigap insurance): Medicare supplement insurance is designed to supplement Medicare's benefits by paying some of the amounts that Medicare does not cover. A Medicare beneficiary cannot be turned down or charged higher premiums because of poor health. All standard Medicare supplement policies are guaranteed renewable. The Department provides information and assistance to senior citizens concerning Medicare supplement insurance and other coverages available to the elderly, such as long- term care insurance.  160   INSURANCE DEPARTMENT  Continuing Care Retirement Communities (CCRC): CCRCs provide living arrangements, including long- term care commitments, to seniors who purchase living units within the community. The Department is responsible for: reviewing the contract and disclosure documents provided to residents as well as an initial determination of the financial feasibility of a proposed project; reviewing the rating str ucture of a community; assessing the adequacy of reserves; and conducting periodic on- site examinations of the financial condition of CCRCs. New Assisted Living Product : The number of persons residing at assisted living care facilities has dramatically increased in the 1990s. The Department has recently approved an ""Assisted Living Care Coverage Endorsement"". This optional endorsement extends coverage in the Homeowners policy to provide limited coverage for personal property, additional living expenses and liability to persons who reside in such facilities and are related to an insured. Senior Discounts on Homeowners Insurance : Some insurers offer discounts on home insurance to retirees or senior citizens. The Department has approved discounts when the homeowner is 55 years or older and the insured location is not unoccupied for an extended period of time. Senior Discounts on Automobile Insurance : Premium discounts for the mature driver are available from some insurers. There are several different age classifications, within which premiums generally tend to decrease as a person matures. However, some insurers also charge higher premiums for higher- age categories, as insurer statistics indicate that beyond a certain age the claims experience as a group worsens. Many senior citizens or retirees may also benefit from those insurers that vary their prices by the number of miles a car is driven each year, since they may drive fewer miles than the average insured. Viatical Settlement Companies/Senior Settlement Companies/Life Settlement Companies: Viatical settlements refer to the selling of life insurance policies by the insured party to a third party. The insured owner must be terminally ill (death anticipated within 24 months). The Department provides protections for seniors who decide to sell such policies. Senior or life settlement companies have begun to arise. These companies purchase policies of individuals who are not necessarily terminally ill. These types of settlements currently are not regulated by the Department. Consequently, seniors may become particularly vulnerable to fraud associated with this type of business. HIICAP: The Department's consumer services staff are members of the Health Insurance Information, Counseling and Assistance Program (HIICAP) consortium. This group is comprised of representatives from the Medicare servicing carriers, Medicare contractors, New York State Office for the Aging (NYSOFA), the Elderly Pharmaceutical Insurance Coverage (EPIC), State Department of Health, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and IPRO (Island Peer Review Organization, a peer review organization for Medicare). The consortium meets annually to determine the training needs for HIICAP counselor and volunteers and whether there are changes at the Federal and state levels that might impact the insurance concerns of the aging.  161   INSURANCE DEPARTMENT  Department staff assists in developing the Training Manual for the program, conducting training, and responding to technical insurance questions. Consumer Education and Outreach: The Department routinely sends Consumer Services Bureau staff to senior centers to explain insurance issues and answer questions. The Frauds Bureau is gearing up to educate the public in the area of no - fault insurance fraud through a series of presentations in public and private venues. Emphasis will be placed on working with senior groups. Web Site : The Department's Web site provides senior citizens and others with access to comprehensive, up - to- date information on links to insurance companies, online complaint filings, disaster assistance, the Healthy New York program, Holocaust Victims resources, instructions on how to report frauds, tips on how to avoid becoming a victim. Publications on long- term care insurance and Medicare supplement coverage are also available on our Web site and through our toll- free publications telephone line. The Web site also has an interactive feature that allows visitors to have an online ""conversation"" with a NetRep. II. PRIORITY ISSUE AREAS  Priority Issue #1: Promote high quality health insurance products and ensure sound financial and market conduct operations. Health insurance is a key issue facing the aging population. The demands for long- term care (LTC) insurance and continuing care retirement communities (CCRC) products will increase dramatically over the next five to ten years. Effective and efficient planning is essential to accommodate the need for meaningful health insurance coverage and to ensure the financial solvency and market conduct of insurers providing such coverage. Priority Issue #2: Increase consumer education and protection programs. Education through outreach programs provides opportunities for seniors and others to learn about a multitude of existing and new insurance products such as longterm care, Medicare supplement, viatical settlements, homeowners and automobile discount programs. Many of these products are complex and not easily understood. Moreover, older citizens are frequent victims of fraud that can result in major financial, emotional and psychological hardship. This segment of the population is particularly vulnerable to fraud associated with cash settlement of life insurance policies prior to death to pay for care needs (viatical settlements), ""staged"" automobile accidents and sale of fraudulent investment instruments. Education and prevention initiatives can help safeguard seniors from fraud, criminal abuse and other unethical conduct.  162   INSURANCE DEPARTMENT  Priority Issue #3: Increase the use of information technology to benefit senior cons umers and to bridge the ""digital divide."" By 2015, a greater number of seniors will have access to the Internet to research and purchase insurance products online. It is important that we provide insurance information geared toward seniors on our Web site. We should also be working with other agencies to help bridge the ""digital divide"" that separate computer users from nonusers. III. ACTIONS AND RESULTS  Priority Issue #1: Promote high quality health insurance products and ensure sound financial and market conduct operations. Action: Amend Section 3111 of the Insurance Law to require third party notification, such as spouse or children, for long- term care policies regarding premiums due. Currently, this provision applies to Medicare supplement and other t ypes of insurance but not to long- term care. Result : The lapse rate for long- term care policies will decrease as a result of such legislation. As time passes some seniors may forget to pay their premium. When these policies lapse, it is virtually impossible to have them reinstated if the insured is in poor health. Action: Amend the Insurance Law Section 3216(c)(10) to extend the ""free look"" period after the purchase of long- term care policies from 10 to 30 days to provide consumers sufficient time to evaluate their policies. Currently, this is required for Medicare supplement policies. Result : The 30- day ""free look"" provision affords policyholders additional time to review and decide whether to keep the policy or return it for a full refund. Ten da ys is too short a period in which to review an insurance contract and make informed decisions. Action: Encourage more senior- oriented insurance products that will meet the needs of an aging population. For example, life insurance policies might combine a long- term care element with a life insurance component, while continuing care retirement communities could offer contracts that wrap around existing long- term care policies. Result : New York seniors would gain increased access to flexible, comprehensive insurance products that fit their needs. Action: Foster the growth of financially stable CCRCs for New York seniors.  163   INSURANCE DEPARTMENT  Result : Currently, only five CCRCs operate in New York State. As the aged population increases, these types of facilities would provide key health insurance and residential services to seniors who wish to remain in the State. Priority Issue #2: Increase consumer education and protection programs. Action: Establish, in conjunction with the Office for the Aging, a Seniors Advisory Council comprised of representatives from AARP and other senior groups to advise the Department regarding the insurance needs of New York's seniors. Result : A Seniors Advisory Council would provide valuable information on insurance issues facing that commun ity and provide feedback on Department initiatives directed towards seniors. Actions : Expand educational outreach and marketing programs to include:  Increased attendance and/or presentations at public events that attract the elderly, such as county fairs, meetings and conventions of senior citizens groups, etc.  Increased advertisements that attract an elderly audience.  Develop/update multi- lingual pamphlets and guides on senior issues, formatted for ease of readability and comprehension.  Develop a Mobile Information Center to disseminate information to seniors. A van would travel throughout the State with trained staff to answer insurance questions and solve problems.  Increase training to HIICAP volunteers and NYSOFA staff. Result : Ensure that information on health insurance and related topics is available to a greater segment of the older population including those who are not able to obtain information online and/or whose primary language is not English. Priority Issue #3: Increase the use of informa tion technology to benefit senior consumers and to bridge the ""digital divide."" Action: Establish a senior citizen section on the Department's Web site to include information on long- term care insurance, frauds prevention, CCRCs, Medicare HMO's (Health Maintenance Organizations), Medicare supplement insurance, senior discount programs, etc. This Web site will have a font size, layout and functionality to best meet the needs of the aged population and enable visitors to use the Net Rep feature currently available to all visitors. Further, coordinate the Insurance Department's information with other State agencies via online links from the NYS Citizen Guide, NYSOFA, Consumer Protection Board, NYS Department of Health, and others. Result : Provide user friendly, comprehensive information on the products and services available to senior citizens on a separate section of our Web site exclusively devoted to this segment of the population and via other senior- related Web sites.  164   INSURANCE DEPARTMENT  Action: Install kiosks in the I nsurance Department's offices and in other agencies to provide computer access to Department Web site and other information resources. Result : Increase consumer access to information and awareness of insurance services, products and issues.  165   INSURANCE DEPARTMENT  166"

Senior Fellow The Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the   Uninsured 1450 G Street, NW, Suite 250       Washington, DC, 20005                        Thank you for the opportunity to offer  testimony on Transitional Medical Assistance.      I am Cindy Mann, Senior Fellow with the Kaiser  Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured.    The  national nonpartisan Commission services as a policy institute and forum for  analyzing health care coverage and access for low-income populations and  assessing options for reform.    Before  joining the Commission, I served as the Director of the Family and Childrens  Health Program Group at the Health Care Financing Administration (now the  Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services) overseeing the administration of  Medicaid for families and children, including Transitional Medical Assistance.           Low-income people (those with incomes below 200%  of the federal poverty line, or $30,040 for a family of three), including  parents who have left welfare and are now employed, have a much higher risk than  others of being uninsured.    A third  of low-income parents, including 40 percent of parents with incomes below  poverty, lack health insurance coverage.    (The  poverty level is $15,020 for a family of three.)      Figure 1.     Ironically,  poor parents are more likely to be uninsured if they are employed than if they  are not employed (43% uninsured v. 31% uninsured) because low-wage workers often  do not have access to employer-based coverage and, in most states, Medicaid  eligibility standards for parents are so low that even parents with very low  wages are over income and cannot qualify for ongoing Medicaid coverage.                  Transitional Medical Assistance (TMA) is one  policy that helps address this troubling dynamic.     TMA offers critical support to many of the most vulnerable families in  this nation.    It provides temporary health care coverage to families with  low wages, primarily those who have left welfare to take a job.     TMA covers children and their parents, but it is particularly important  for low-income working parents for whom TMA is often their only source of  coverage.     If TMA lapses at  the end of this fiscal year, poor and near-poor parents will become uninsured,  with adverse effects for their health, their ability to care for their children,  and their capacity to retain employment and support their families.     On the other hand, if TMA is extended and improved, even more low-income  working parents will have a guarantee of coverage at least for a limited period  of time.           TMA has been supported and expanded over the  years           TMA is a common-sense welfare-to-work  initiative that was created with strong bipartisan support years before the  current era of welfare reform.     It  was first established in 1984 and was revised and expanded in 1988 as part of  the Family Support Act of 1988.       During this time, Medicaid eligibility for families with children was  linked to welfare.    In general, this  meant that families that received welfare (Aid to Families with Dependent  Children, or AFDC) were automatically enrolled in Medicaid and that when a  family left welfare its Medicaid coverage would end.     Congress recognized that parents leaving welfare for work are often not  offered coverage at their workplace and was concerned that the loss of Medicaid  coverage could discourage families from seeking jobs and make it difficult for  them to retain employment.    The 1987  Report of the House Energy and Commerce Committee accompanying the measure that  broadened TMA noted that    (F)ormer  AFDC families that work their way off welfare have the greatest need for health  care coverage, because they are least able to pay for services out of pocket and  because their health is more likely to be poor.     Yet these are precisely the families that are among those most likely to  be uninsured. [i]     TMA assured that parents receiving welfare could take a job without  losing Medicaid at least for a limited period of time. [ii]               In 1996, when Congress drafted the Personal  Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (PRWORA) to  replace AFDC with the Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) block grant,  it revisited Medicaid coverage rules, including TMA.     Welfare reform underscored the important role Medicaid plays for  low-income families, including those who may not be receiving welfare.    PRWORA broke the historic link between Medicaid and welfare  and created in its place a new Medicaid eligibility category for families with  children.    Under these new rules,  families qualify for Medicaid based on their income, not based on their status  as welfare recipients.    PRWORA also  extended TMA to 2001, demonstrating Congress continued commitment to assuring  that families would not immediately lose health care coverage if they left  welfare because a parent in the family found employment.     The TMA sunset date was extended for one more year in legislation enacted  in 2000. [iii]            Under current law, states must provide TMA to  families who otherwise would become ineligible for ongoing Medicaid coverage  under the new family coverage category (section 1931) created by PRWORA. [iv]     TMA is available if the family was receiving Medicaid for three out of  the prior six months and is losing regular Medicaid because of earnings or child  support payments.     If the receipt of child support triggers TMA coverage,  the family is eligible for four months of coverage.    If TMA is based on earnings, the family is eligible for six  months of coverage, plus an additional six months if family income, less child  care expenses, stays below 185 percent of the poverty level ($27,787 for a  family of three) and the family complies with federal reporting requirements.     Families with access to employer-based coverage can combine this coverage  with Medicaid.    TMA would cover some medical services not covered by the  employer plan, and help pay premiums and cost sharing imposed by the employer  plan.            Employer-based coverage is often not available to  parents leaving welfare           While most Americans receive their health care  coverage through employer-subsidized plans, low-wage workers are substantially  less likely to have job-based coverage.    In  1998, only half of the workers earnings less than $7 an hour (which is close to  the average wage earned by those leaving welfare who are employed) were covered  by plans offered either by their employers or their spouses employer.    Forty percent were not offered health insurance and an  additional 10 percent declined an offer of coverage, largely as a result of  costs.    Figure 2.     Even without considering deductibles and  co-payments, the average cost of maintaining coverage offered through the work  place is often well beyond the reach of parents leaving welfare.      The average employee contribution for family  coverage in 2001 would consume 11 percent of the average gross earnings reported  by families leaving welfare for employment ($1,360 a month). [v]       Individual coverage  is less costly but still difficult for many families living below or close to  the poverty level to afford, and premium costs are rising rapidly.            Other factors that typify the circumstances of  many of the families leaving welfare also contribute to low rates of  employer-based coverage among TANF leavers.     Parents leaving welfare are often new employees both because they may be  entering the labor market for the first time and because they change jobs often  due to the dynamics of the low-wage labor market and the challenges of  maintaining child care and reliable transportation.      New employees are often not offered employer-based coverage even in firms  that offer longer-term employees coverage.      In addition, women leaving welfare frequently find work at retail or  service firms where employer-based coverage is less prevalent.              For all these reasons, only a small portion of  families leaving welfare have employer-based coverage.     The Urban Institute found that, in 1999, on average, only one out of five  parents had employer-based coverage in the first year after leaving welfare.    Employer-based coverage picked up substantially after one  year, but still, even at a time when the economy was particularly strong, only a  minority (44%) of parents had employer-based coverage more than one year after  leaving welfare. [vi]                For parents, regular Medicaid often does not fill  the gap left by employer-based coverage            Medicaid and now the State Childrens Health  Insurance Program (SCHIP) fill in much of the gap in coverage for children left  by relatively low rates of job-based coverage among low-income workers and their  dependents.    Under federal minimum  eligibility standards, all states must provide Medicaid coverage to children  under age six if their incomes are below 133 percent of the federal poverty line  ($19,977 for a family of three).    Older  children must be covered if their income is below the poverty level.    Options available to states to receiving federal matching  funds to cover children at higher levels have prompted most states to expand  coverage through Medicaid and SCHIP beyond these minimum levels.     As of January 2002, every state covered children with incomes up to at  least 140 percent of the poverty line, and all but 11 states covered children  with incomes up to 200 percent of FPL.    As  a result, most (83%) low-income children are now eligible for Medicaid or SCHIP. [vii]      Many immigrant children are still left out of coverage, but for most  other children the primary challenge is to improve participation rates in  Medicaid and SCHIP.            The story is far different for the parents of  these children.    There is no uniform  national minimum eligibility standard applicable to parents under Medicaid; the  federal minimum standard varies by state pegged to the states 1996 AFDC  income standard.     States have  options to broaden their family coverage to reach more low-income working  parents, but to date, only 18 states cover parents with incomes at 100 percent  of the poverty level through regular Medicaid (or through a waiver).     In seven states the income eligibility standard for a parent with  earnings is  below  33 percent of the poverty line ($4,957 for a family of  three).    Figure 3.            As a result of these low eligibility standards,  in most states low-income working parents, including many of those leaving  welfare, have too much income to qualify for regular Medicaid.     The earnings of those who leave welfare and find jobs average $1,360 a  month. [viii]      This is below the poverty level for a family of three, yet in 39 states a  parent with two children earning this amount will be over income for  regular Medicaid. [ix]      In the absence of TMA, most parents at these wage levels would not have  any route to Medicaid coverage unless they are pregnant or disabled.     Given limited access to employer-based coverage, parents moving into the  labor market earning these wages would be at great risk of being uninsured if  TMA were not available.      TMA implementation issues            While TMA has been a valuable source of coverage  for millions of people in low-income working families, TMA has not always  operated smoothly for either families or for states.     Some problems have arisen as a result of implementation problems at the  state and local level.    In addition,  some families do not take advantage of TMA because they are unaware of the  coverage it offers.    Families often  close their Medicaid case when someone in the household finds employment,  unaware that they may continue to be eligible for Medicaid.      Many families wrongly assume that they have to be receiving welfare in  order to qualify for Medicaid. [x]            Implementation problems were identified following  the enactment of the federal welfare law in 1996.     The welfare rolls plummeted, and, in many states, Medicaid enrollment  dropped sharply as well even though most families leaving welfare should have  been eligible for Medicaid at least for a temporary period of time. [xi]      Some of the decline occurred because state and local procedures and  computer systems did not ensure that families who were leaving welfare were  being properly evaluated for continuing Medicaid eligibility, including TMA.     Studies have found that only one third to one half of the adults leaving  welfare had Medicaid coverage following their TANF exit.     According to an analysis by the Urban Institute relying on 1999 data,  half of the women leaving welfare had Medicaid coverage during the year after  leaving TANF.    More than one-third  (37%) percent were uninsured. [xii]     Figure 4.     TANF leavers studies funded by the Department  of Health and Human Services had similar findings. [xiii]            As a result of the unanticipated drop in Medicaid  enrollment following welfare reform, many states began to focus in on the  problem and make corrections, sometimes as a result of litigation or the threat  of litigation. [xiv]      In 1999 through 2000, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services  (formerly HCFA) visited each of the 50 states and issued reports on state and  local policies and procedures, and in April of 2000, CMS instructed all states  to take steps to address any problems that might continue to exist and to  restore coverage to children and parents who had been terminated from coverage  improperly. [xv]                   Partly as a result of these state and federal  efforts, Medicaid enrollment began to rebound in 1998, although enrollment  trends varied significantly across states.     Indianas experience is instructive.     The state identified implementation problems and outreach needs and took  a number of steps to improve policies and procedures so that families moving in  and out of the welfare system as well as those who did not apply for welfare did  not lose out on Medicaid coverage.    After  three years of enrollment declines, Indiana saw its family caseload in Medicaid  rise by 40 percent between May 1998 and April 2000.     TMA enrollment quadrupled during this period. [xvi]     Indianas experience shows that proper implementation coupled with  aggressive outreach can make a substantial difference in the extent to which  Medicaid generally and TMA specifically live up to their potential for covering  low-income working families.            TMA design issues            There appears to be broad consensus that TMA is  an important component of the Medicaid program and state and federal  welfare-to-work initiatives.    Some  changes in the federal design of TMA could, however, boost participation.     Some of these changes have been proposed in pending legislation.  [xvii]                        Currently,      TMA is available only to families that have been enrolled in regular      Medicaid for at least three out of the last six months.         Some states have noted that this requirement is not consistent with      their welfare programs work first approach, which stresses a quick      attachment to the labor market.    If      a family begins receiving welfare and Medicaid in January and the parent      finds a job in February with wages that would make the family ineligible for      regular Medicaid, that family would not be eligible for TMA because it would      not have satisfied the three out of six months requirement.             The      federal law includes prescriptive TMA reporting requirements.         In order to retain eligibility throughout the full 12-month period,      families must submit written reports of their earnings and child care      expenses in the 4 th , 7 th , and 10 th  months.    These reporting requirements create administrative      burdens for states and can cause coverage problems for families.         The GAO has recommended that Congress consider allowing states      flexibility to change or eliminate these reporting requirements. [xviii]                           Some      states have been interested in extending TMA beyond the 12 months allowed      under the law.    A few states have waivers extending TMA, but these      waivers are generally no longer available due to budget neutrality rules. [xix]          A legislative change would be necessary to allow states the option to      provide TMA for longer periods of time.         Health Coverage Makes a Difference              With  or without improvements in the way TMA operates, there is nearly universal  agreement that TMA plays an important role promoting welfare-to-work efforts and  providing health care coverage to some of the most vulnerable families.     Health care coverage alone does not guarantee quality health care, but  coverage makes it much more likely that people will get the health care they  need.    A recent study showed that low-income adults are almost three  times more likely to have an unmet medical need if they are uninsured. [xx]     Those with Medicaid coverage do not report these same levels of unmet  needs.    For example, a study found  that low-income women are 2.5 times more likely to report unmet or delayed  health care needs than are low-income women with either Medicaid or private  coverage. [xxi]     Figure 5.            As the Congress recognized when it expanded TMA  in the Family Support Act of 1988, parents relying on welfare and those leaving  welfare for work are often in poor health.      Poor health status is generally correlated with low incomes.  [xxii]      Health-related problems take their toll on poor womens ability to care  for their families and to work and retain employment.     The National Governors Association has identified health-related problems  as a key barrier to work and a challenge to state welfare-to-work initiatives. [xxiii]     Recent reports have highlighted the importance of quality coverage as a  means of decreasing absenteeism and increasing productivity at work. [xxiv]      While coverage does not assure good health, it affords individuals access  to health care, which can help them manage and address health problems and  better care for their children and participate in the work force .          TMA is a critical component of the labyrinth of  mechanisms by which some of the people who do not have access to employer-based  coverage can obtain health care coverage.      It has a limited reach both because it is a targeted program and because  it provides time-limited coverage.    Even  with TMA, four out of ten poor parents are uninsured, and with a souring  economy, rising health costs, and state budget cutbacks, the number of  low-income people who lack health insurance coverage is expecting to rise.     By extending TMA and perhaps improving how it works, Congress will be  assuring that some of Americas hardest working families do not join the ranks  of the uninsured.         Attached Figures  (Adobe  Acrobat Required)                                                [i]       H.R. Rep. No. 159, 100 th  Congress, 1 st  Sess., Part 3,      at 12.                  [ii]   TMA      was also extended to families who might otherwise lose Medicaid due to child      support income so that successful efforts to increase child support payments      from absent parents did not result in the immediate loss of health care      coverage.                    [iii]       Congress extended the sunset date to September 30, 2002 in P.L. 106-554,      section 707(a).                  [iv]  Technically this means      that a family does not have to be receiving welfare in order to qualify for      TMA, since welfare receipt is no longer an eligibility requirement for      Medicaid.    However, as explained      below, in most states the income standards for the family coverage category      are so low that in those states TMA still largely functions as a      welfare-to-work initiative.                    [v]       Data on average premium costs for employees are from Kaiser Family      Foundation and Health Research and Educational Trust,  Employer Health      Benefits, 2001 Annual Survey,  2001; data on average wages of parents      leaving welfare are from P.

Private   spending for nursing home care for the elderly totalled about $19.0 billion in   1989, and private home care expenditures totalled another $2.4 billion. 1      Most elderly persons who enter nursing homes do not receive coverage   from Medicare, Medicaid or any other public program. Either they do not meet   the criteria for Medicare SNF coverage (i.e., they did not enter a skilled   facility directly from a hospital) or they have sufficient income and/or assets   to disqualify them from Medicaid. In 1990, the average daily cost of a private   nursing home stay was about $80 per day, $560 per week, $2,400 per month, or   $30,000 per year. Although most nursing home stays are not long, even a three   month stay could cost $7,000 to $8,000, not including other health care   expenses such as drugs, physician visits, or physical therapy. A long nursing   home stay can, of course, be financially devastating.      Many elderly persons are seeking ways to gain financial protection   against the potentially high costs of long-term care. A number of private   financing mechanisms are available which provide various levels of protection.   Most possess the common characteristic of  pooling risks . Risk pools are   mechanisms by which individuals spread the costs of incurring a risk among all   persons who contribute to the pool. For example, private long-term care   insurance is a mechanism by which individuals create financial reserves (i.e.   by paying premiums) which are used to pay the costs of those individuals in the   pool who actually end up needing long-term care.      Risk pools also provide financial protection to those who do not use   long-term care, for these persons are relieved of the worry that they will be   financially ruined by the cost of an extended nursing home stay. In this   manner, risk pools benefit  all  persons in the pool, not just those who   actually use long-term care services.      Today, most elderly persons do not participate in long-term care risk   pools and are therefore not protected from the potentially high cost of   long-term care. There is a marked difference between the elderly's lack of   protection from long-term care costs and the comprehensive protection which   most elderly persons have against the costs of acute illness. Medicare provides   broad coverage for most acute illnesses, particularly the costs of hospital   care, and most elderly persons buy supplemental insurance (Medigap policies)   for coverage of Medicare deductibles and co-payment requirements. As elderly   individuals enter their late 70s and early 80s, many begin to realize that   while Medicare is a comprehensive health insurance program for people who are   in basically good health, it does not provide much help for people who need   non-acute care for chronic conditions.      Consequently, over the last decade, there has been growing interest in   private sector approaches to financing long-term care. Although still emerging,   private sector approaches are increasing in importance. These initiatives can   be divided into two categories. Some approaches, such as private long-term care   insurance, Continuing Care Retirement Communities (CCRCs), and social/health   maintenance organizations (SHMOs), involve  risk pooling . They pool the   costs associated with long-term care over a broad population, most of whom will   never incur substantial long-term care expenditures, thereby reducing the cost   of long-term care to any one person.      Other approaches, such as home equity conversions and accelerated life   insurance benefits, encourage people to save or to use their assets in new ways   to finance their current or future long-term care needs. These are referred to   as  individual asset accumulation  approaches.      Currently, less than five percent of the elderly participate in any   private long-term care financing mechanism. Participants in risk pooling   approaches include about 2.4 million purchasers of private long-term care   insurance, about 250,000 persons who live in Continuing Care Retirement   Communities, and about 15,000 persons who have enrolled in Social/Health   Maintenance Organizations.      Participation in formal asset accumulation plans is much less frequent.   Only about 5,000 elderly persons have sought home equity conversions. Moreover,   not all home equity conversions are used to pay for long-term care. A small but   unknown number of persons have used accelerated life insurance benefits to   finance long-term care services ( Figure 1 ).      This section describes the basic features of private long-term care   financing mechanisms, recent trends in the market for these financial products,   and some of the barriers which exist to future market growth. The chapter   addresses the following specific questions:                  What private financing mechanisms are presently available and what     are the basic characteristics of these products?             What trends are emerging in marketing and sales of these     products?             What barriers exist to future market growth of private long-term     care financing mechanisms?                LONG-TERM CARE INSURANCE      Long-term care insurance is a method for pooling the risk of long-term   care costs. It is the most widely used private financing approach. The National   Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) defines long-term care insurance   as ""any insurance policy or rider which provides coverage for not less than   twelve consecutive months on an expense incurred, indemnity, prepaid or other   basis for one or more necessary or medically necessary diagnostic, preventive,   therapeutic, rehabilitative, maintenance or personal care services, provided in   a setting other than an acute care unit of a hospital."" 2  Thus, in contrast to general health insurance, long   term insurance is distinguished by two major characteristics: (1) it provides   coverage for  extended  care services (at least 12 months); and (2) it   covers services not provided in acute care settings (i.e. hospitals).      Like other types of health insurance, long-term care insurance products   can vary greatly in cost, covered benefits, and benefit criteria (definition of   the ""insured event""). Most long-term care insurance policies sold to date are   indemnity products, which cover both nursing home stays and home care visits at   a fixed rate per day or per home care visit. Typically, the policies will pay   for between two and unlimited years in a nursing home, with a deductible period   (e.g. no coverage for the first 20 to 100 days).      Long-term care insurance premiums are based upon the age of the   purchaser. The age rated premiums can take two forms: (1) issue age premiums,   where the premium charged is based upon the age at which an individual   initially purchases insurance; and (2) attained age premiums, where the premium   charged changes according to the age of the purchaser. 3  Both types of premiums can change based on the   experience of the group (i.e., if more claims than expected are incurred   premiums may be increased).      Characteristics of Long-Term Care Insurance Policies and   Policyholders      One way to categorize long-term care insurance policies is according to   how they are sold: (1) individual and group association policies; (2)   employer-sponsored plans; and (3) riders linked with life insurance policies   ( Figure 2 ).      Approximately 85 percent of private long-term care insurance policies   sold by 1990 were sold to individuals directly by an insurance company or   through a group association. 4  At   this early stage of market development, when both products and State regulation   of long-term care insurance are rapidly changing, the ""typical"" policy varies   according to the year it was purchased. In 1991, the policies  offered  by   the 15 top-selling companies, who together accounted for four out of five of   all policies sold, had the following characteristics: 5                  All offered nursing home care, home care, and adult day care     coverage;             Nine plans provided additional alternative care benefits (a plan of     nonconventional care and services developed by a physician that can serve as an     alternative to nursing home care);             Six plans provided additional respite care;             None of the plans condition nursing home coverage on a prior     hospital stay;             Most (10) plans required physician certification of need and     medically necessary care  or  need for assistance in specific activities     of daily living (ADLs) or cognitive impairment to qualify for nursing home     admission. Four plans triggered nursing home benefits based on medical     necessity only;             Most plans (nine of 15) offer home care benefits as a rider with up     to unlimited coverage while the remaining plans offer the same maximum benefit     period for nursing home and home care; and             All plans offered ways to  increase benefit payments  over     time, to protect against increases in the price of long-term care services. Of     15 sellers, 13 offer the NAIC 1991 Model regulation requirement that benefits     increase at an annual 5 percent compounded rate for life with level premiums.     Inflation adjustments were generally of three types: (1) annual percentage     increases in benefit payments (e.g. 5 percent) with no premium increase; (2)     benefits increase annually and the cost also increases annually; or (3)     periodic options to upgrade the policy, where purchasers could pay higher     premiums for desired increases in benefit amounts. The first method could     possibly over protect or may not fully protect the purchaser from price     inflation, while the second and third methods could lead to significant     increases in premium costs over time.           Figure 3  presents the typical benefits,   restrictions, and premium features of the 15 top-selling individual long-term   care insurance policies being sold in 1991. The characteristics of policies    offered  in 1991 do not necessarily represent the characteristics of   policies which have actually been  bought , since policy characteristics   evolved rapidly throughout the 1980s and purchasers do not always choose all   the features offered.      A survey of persons age 55 and older who purchased longterm care   insurance in 1990 provides information on the characteristics of policies    bought , not just  offered . 6  The relevant findings from this survey include:                  Almost all policies (96 percent) covered at least two years of     nursing home care, a little over one-half covered five or more years and     one-third were lifetime policies.             The average daily benefit was $72; approximately one-quarter chose     less than $60/day; slightly less than one-quarter chose amounts exceeding     $90/day; while the remaining one- half chose between $60 and $90 per     day.             Nearly two-thirds brought policies with deductible periods of 20     days or less.             Less than two out of five purchasers (37 percent) opted to include     home health care coverage. 7             Forty percent of purchasers chose some form of inflation protection     when offered it. 8           In addition to individual and group association policies, several other   types of long-term care insurance coverage or related products are available,   including:                  Employer-Sponsored Plans : Like group association plans, these     are not true group plans but are mostly administrative arrangements by which     individual policies are offered to company employees, and sometimes to their     spouses and parents. However, in almost all cases, the employee, not the     company, pays the full cost of the policy. 9  While rates may be lower because of lower     administrative costs and the younger age of purchasers, there is little     discounting of rates.        Medical underwriting of employees is often required prior to     purchase (and almost always required for spouses and parents), so that poor     risks may be screened out. Policies can generally be taken with employees     should they leave the company.        Information from December 1991 for 288 long term care insurance     plans offered by employers indicates that almost 2.2 million employees or     retirees (plus their eligible family members) had been offered the option to     purchase long term care insurance. Of the 2.2 million employees, 72 percent     were employees, their spouses, parents or grand parents, while the remaining 28     percent were retirees and their spouses. As of 1991, 202,500 policies had been     sold. Eight insurers representing about 70 percent of all employer-sponsored     enrollees across 146 plans, report 53 percent were active employees, 18.9     percent were spouses, 1.9 percent were parents or grandparents, 12.1 percent     were retirees, and 5.3 percent were retiree's spouses. The average enrollment     rate among active employees was 5.3 percent. In 1991, employer-sponsored plans     represented nine percent of policies sold. The average age of active workers     purchasing such plans was 43, much lower than the average age of persons buying     individual policies.             Life Insurance Riders : Life insurance riders provide     long-term care coverage which meets National Association of Insurance     Commissioners (NAIC) model guidelines through an addition to a life insurance     plan. 10  For a small extra premium     (generally between five and ten percent of the base premium) these life     insurance riders will pay a percentage of the policyholder's death benefit each     month that the policyholder needs long-term care. Death benefits are reduced     accordingly. These life insurance riders are distinct from accelerated death     benefits that advance the death benefit in a lump sum in the event of terminal     illness, a specified disease, or nursing home confinement because: (1) they     meet NAIC guidelines; (2) payments must be used for long-term care services;     and (3) payments cannot be made in a lump sum. Life insurance riders are also     only available on level-premium (whole-life) policies, not on term     insurance.        Riders represented less than six percent of all long-term care     policies in 1991, up from one percent in 1989. Much of this increase is due to     one insurer adding the benefit to all existing life insurance policies. The     average age of purchasers was 37 years. The average face value of life     insurance policies purchased in 1991 with this type of rider was $60,000. Such     a policy would generate $1,200 per month in long-term care benefits for over     four years.           Long-Term Care Insurance Prices      The cost of long-term care insurance generally depends on two major   factors: (1) the age of the policyholder at initial purchase; and (2) the   amount of coverage. Persons who buy policies when they are relatively young pay   much less than persons who initially purchase policies at older ages. For   example, as shown in  Table 1 , a policy covering the same   benefits costs more than twice as much if purchased at age 65 than if purchased   at age 50, and about eight times as much if purchased at age 79 instead of age   50. Lower premium costs for younger purchasers reflect both their lower risk of   needing long-term care, and the opportunity for premium investments to build up   financial reserves over time. Most premiums that are based upon age of initial   purchase will not increase over time except if premiums are increased for all   policies sold by that company in a State.      The cost of a long-term care policy which covered four years of nursing   home care at $80 per day, and home care visits at $40 per visit, with a 20-day   deductible, for a purchaser who was 65 years old, averaged $1,103 per year in   1991, or about $91.92 per month. In comparison, the average premium cost of   individually purchased Medigap insurance, which about 40 percent of the elderly   have, was about $70 per month in 1990, about $25 per month less. 11      Adding inflation protection and nonforfeiture benefits significantly   affect the price of long-term care insurance. Inflation protection adds between   40 and 80 percent to the price of long-term care insurance, with the higher   increases occurring for younger persons. Nonforfeiture benefits return premiums   paid, usually in the form of reduced benefits levels or period of coverage, to   purchasers who discontinue paying premiums (lapse). This feature adds between   35 and 65 percent to the cost of policies.      For purchasers in 1990, the average annual premium paid was $1,071;   persons age 55 to 64 paid $720, persons age 65 to 74 paid $1,068; and persons   age 75 and over paid $1,740. Among these purchasers, one-fifth paid less than   $500 annually and one-fifth paid $1,500 or more. 12      Long-term care insurance prices also vary according to the amount of   coverage offered by the policy. Coverage can vary in terms of the types of   services covered, the amount of benefit paid for a service, the length of the   deductible period, the length of coverage, and whether the policy offers   inflation protection. But even examining policies with similar characteristics,   one finds that annual premiums vary significantly.      Using projections of long-term care utilization for the elderly from the   Brookings/ICF Long-Term Care Financing Model, researchers from the Brookings   Institution estimated the expected premium cost for a number of alternative   prototype policies. 13  The   estimated premium cost was then compared to some policies with similar   characteristics which were currently on the market. As shown in    Table 2 , annual premiums for policies offering   essentially the same benefit package at age 65 to 69 can vary two to three   times over, from $587 to $1,604. These price differences could be due to a   number of factors, including different estimates of assumed risk and the   expected costs of nursing home care, and particularly home care; interest rate   assumptions; and assumed lapse rates.      Another point which the Brookings analysis highlights is that   comprehensive coverage for long-term care is expensive. 14  For example, a comprehensive policy that covers up   to four years of nursing home and home care at an initial indemnity benefit for   $60 per day, indexed for inflation on a compound basis, and with a full return   of benefits when a purchaser discontinues paying premiums, would have an   estimated premium cost of over $60 per month for purchasers between ages of 40   and 44. As the age of the purchaser increases, premiums can rise up to $400 per   month for persons between 80 and 84. These analyses show that the exclusion of   certain benefits can dramatically lower the cost of private long-term care   insurance, making it more affordable to a larger number of elderly households.   Purchasers have to decide how to balance the trade-off between depth of   coverage and affordability in making the purchasing decision that is best for   them.      Growth Trends in Long-Term Care Insurance      In 1988, private long-term care insurance financed only about one   percent of all nursing home costs. In recent years, however, the private   long-term care insurance market has grown quickly. In 1984, only twelve   companies offered long-term care insurance and there were only 50,000 policies   in force. 15  In 1991, more than 130   companies were marketing long-term care insurance and the number of policies   sold exceeded 2.4 million ( Figure 4 ).      Between 1986 and 1987, there was a substantial increase in the number of   long-term care insurance policies sold, when a large number of new companies   entered the market. In the same year, the National Association of Insurance   Commissioners (NAIC) began recommending regulatory practices specifically for   long-term care insurance.      Much of the increase in the number of  companies  offering   long-term care insurance has been the result of individual Blue Cross/Blue   Shield plans entering the market. Unlike most of the policies sold by   commercial insurers, Blue Cross/Blue Shield policies tend to pay a    percentage  of charges, up to a specified maximum, rather than paying a   fixed amount per day. They also tend to give greater emphasis to linking   eligibility for benefits (the insured event) to functional assessments of need   (ADLs), rather than a physician's certification of medical necessity. Case   managers are often used to conduct functional assessments. In 1989, the average   age at initial purchase among Blue Cross/Blue Shield policyholders was 70   years. By the end of 1988, Blue Cross/Blue Shield plans represented about 10   percent of all insurers in the market, but held fewer than one percent of all   policies in force. 16      Long-term care insurance policies have improved considerably over the   past five years, largely due to market pressures and the demands of State   regulatory agencies. The first generation of long-term care insurance policies   often paid benefits under limited circumstances. Faced with uncertainties and   lacking actual experience with an insured population, insurers initially   protected themselves against induced demand or ""moral hazard"" by imposing high   deductibles, covering only skilled nursing care, requiring prior   hospitalizations before providing nursing home benefits, and only covering home   care that followed a nursing home stay.      To protect against adverse selection, insurers usually screened for   health problems, did not sell policies to persons over age 80, and did not   provide coverage for preexisting conditions and most mental illnesses. To   protect against the general uncertainty of the future, insurers typically   offered only fixed indemnity benefits that did not increase with inflation, and   often reserved the right to unilaterally cancel policies. 17      The most popular long-term care insurance policies offered today no   longer require prior hospitalization or higher levels of care to receive   nursing home benefits. Most offer home care benefits, and nearly all offer   inflation protection. Some policies even offer a compounded inflation   adjustment for a fixed premium. Although these changes have improved the   quality of the products on the market, they have also increased prices.           OTHER PRIVATE FINANCING MECHANISMS      Other emerging private financing mechanisms for long-term care include:   life-care oriented arrangements, Social Health Maintenance Organizations   (SHMOs), accelerated life insurance benefits, and vehicles to tap home   equity.      Continuing Care Retirement Communities (CCRCs)      A growing number of elderly persons are electing to spend their last   years of life in Continuing Care Retirement Communities (CCRCs). Most   Continuing Care Retirement Communities combine supported housing (housing plus   services) with a risk pooling feature for long-term care services. In CCRCs,   the buyer usually pays a one-time entry fee and monthly charges to live in a   closed community setting which offers independent housing supplemented by   on-site medical care, supportive services such as housekeeping and meals, and   nursing home care. CCRCs are distinguished from other housing options for   senior citizens (such as rental units, assisted living facilities, or nursing   homes) by the offer of a long term contract that provides a residence,   supportive services, and guaranteed access to nursing care--a continuum of   care. Many CCRCs offer long-term care benefits financed by risk pools that are   created from entrance fees and monthly charges, although the amount of   long-term care coverage varies from CCRC to CCRC. Other CCRCs do not offer any   risk pooling for long-term care, but rather provide long-term care services on   a fee-for-service basis.      In 1989, there were about 800 CCRCs in operation. There are three basic   types of CCRCs, distinguished by the amount of long-term care coverage provided   in the resident's contract. A 1988-89 survey of CCRCs by Ernst and Young for   the American Association of Homes for the Aging (AAHA) estimated that: 18                  About one-third of CCRCs offered  extensive continuing care      contracts that make available long term nursing care, fully paid through     monthly fees (i.e., the community is obligated to provide care at no extra cost     beyond the resident's monthly fee);             A little over one-fourth offered  modified continuing care      contracts in which a specified amount of long term nursing care in each year or     during a resident's lifetime is provided for little or no substantial increase     in monthly payments. After the specified amount of nursing care (usually fewer     than 15 days) is used, residents pay the full per diem rates for nursing care     required, or, in some cases, a discounted per diem rate; and             Nearly two-fifths (38 percent) of CCRCs offered      fee-for-service  continuing care contracts that included emergency and     short-term nursing care, but guaranteed access to long term nursing care only     at full per diem nursing care rates. This last type of CCRC arrangement for     nursing care is not a true risk pooling mechanism because the users of nursing     care are at full risk for its cost.           Entrance and maintenance fees for CCRCs vary depending upon the level of   services and the size of the residential unit. In 1988, entrance fees ranged   from an average of $38,000 for CCRCs which only guaranteed access to nursing   care to an average of $109,000 for CCRCs with extensive nursing care contracts.   According to the AAHA-Ernst and Young survey, the median entry fee was $47,500   in 1988. Monthly fees ranged between $600 and $1,600. Couples are generally   charged an additional fee.      A recent trend in the CCRC market has been away from risk pooling   financing approaches. This is partly to avoid the insolvency problems   experienced by some CCRCs in the late 1970s and early 1980s because of poor   actuarial estimates of long-term care utilization. Thus, many CCRCs are   abandoning their long-term care insurance components and are simply providing   long-term care services on a fee-for-service basis. 19      Another trend has been for CCRCs to separately contract with a private   insurer to provide long-term care coverage for its residents. In this manner,   CCRCs delegate the actuarial risk for future long-term care utilization among   their residents to a third-party, protecting their own financial position. As   of December 1991, 170 CCRCs reportedly had contracts with commercial insurers.   The average age of residents buying a long term care plan was 79 years. In   these situations where coverage is optional, between 5 and 50 percent of CCRC   residents had elected coverage.      Most CCRC residents are over the age of 75; the average age is 81. The   majority of residents are single (73 percent) and female (76 percent). Most new   enrollees to CCRCs are not disabled when they first enter the CCRC, but may   require increasing levels of service as they age.      Almost all CCRCs are nonprofit organizations, although more for-profit   CCRCs have entered the market in recent years. 20  Many of the new for-profit communities under   construction by hotel chains, nursing home operators, and real estate   developers are luxury rental and condominium complexes marketed to elderly with   high incomes and assets. 21  These   communities tend to place the financial obligation and risk of long-term care   on the residents themselves.      Approximately 250,000 elderly persons are in CCRCs, less than one   percent of the elderly population. The future growth of the CCRC market remains   unclear. Although many of the better CCRCs have long waiting lists, others have   become insolvent, and the residents of these CCRCs have incurred large   financial losses. Also, given the high cost of most CCRCs, it is unlikely they   will become a long-term care solution for the majority of elderly persons.   However, as with other private financing mechanisms, we are still witnessing   the initial phases of a new approach to meeting the elderly's long-term care   needs, and we are likely to see continued evolution in the CCRC market over the   next decade.      Social Health Maintenance Organizations (SHMOs)      Another risk pooling method for long-term care is provided by four   Social Health Maintenance Organizations (SHMOs) which have been in operation   since 1985 under a demonstration sponsored by the Health Care Financing   Administration (HCFA). These experimental programs are similar to HMOs, except   that SHMOs provide and manage long-term care benefits, as well as standard   medical services, within their capitated financing structures. SHMOs pool   capitation payments from Medicare, Medicaid and member premiums and provide   both acute and long-term care to a broad cross-section of the elderly with   diverse needs. Key features of SHMOs are:                  the availability of a comprehensive array of acute and chronic,     ambulatory, in-home and inpatient services from a single provider     organization;             enrollment of both functionally impaired and non-impaired elderly     persons in order to pool long-term care risks and maintain affordable premium     payments for members;             a coordinated case-management system to ensure both the     appropriateness and the cost-effectiveness of service use; and             financing via prepaid capitation payments. 22           Evaluations of the initial years of the SHMO demonstration showed that   the sites generally were not able to keep expenses below revenues, although   financial performance generally improved each year. 23  Losses were primarily attributable to high   marketing and administrative costs associated with initial start-up, not to   excessive service utilization. By 1989, the SHMOs had entered a new phase of   tightened management and reduced costs that they hoped would lead to future   profitability. As of 1988, about 16,000 persons were enrolled at the four SHMO   sites. Monthly premiums for enrollees ranged from $25 to $57. Under OBRA 1990,   Congress mandated that up to four additional sites be added to the SHMO   demonstration program.      The SHMO sites provide less long-term care coverage than most private   long-term care insurance policies. Annual chronic-care benefit limits at the   four sites ranged from $6,500 to $12,000 per year. In comparison, the average   annual cost of nursing home care is in the range of $30,000. Thus, the SHMO   capitation plans do not provide financial protection from the costs of extended   nursing home stays. In the SHMOs, greater emphasis is placed on home and   community-based services, case management, and other utilization control   mechanisms which help to reduce nursing home utilization.      Outside the SHMO demonstration, other HMOs have yet to adopt the SHMO   financing concept, partly due to general difficulties in the Medicare HMO   program. Enrollment of Medicare beneficiaries into HMO plans has been slow for   a variety of reasons, including the ongoing debate over the adequacy of   Medicare HMO capitation payments. Until more elderly persons enroll in HMO   plans in general, HMOs are not likely to expand into the long-term care   insurance market, by offering supplemental long-term care coverage for an   additional premium cost. 24      Another capitated demonstration program for long-term care services has   been operated by On Lok, a community-based provider of comprehensive care in   San Francisco, California, since 1983. On Lok, unlike the SHMO sites, does not   operate on a long-term care insurance model because it only enrolls elderly   individuals who are already functionally impaired and in need of long-term   care. Most clients are Medicaid eligible and On Lok receives a relatively high   capitation rate from the California Medicaid program for its enrollees,   comparable to the average monthly cost of Medicaid-financed nursing home care.   In FY 1989-1990, the monthly Medicaid capitation rate was $1,420, or over   $17,000 per year. 25      The emphasis in the On Lok demonstration is more on controlling per   capita long-term care costs through alternative service programs and more   efficient service delivery mechanisms, centered around the core service of   adult day care. For example, On Lok recipients average much shorter hospital   stays than other Medicare beneficiaries in San Francisco. Under OBRA 1986,   Congress mandated the replication of the On Lok demonstration, called the   Program for All-inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE). As of January 1991,   eight PACE replication sites had been selected by HCFA.      Accelerated Life Insurance Benefits      A very new approach to financing long-term care services is    accelerated life insurance benefits . This approach allows elderly   persons to convert existing universal or whole life insurance policies into   long-term care coverage through a lump sum payment of accelerated death   benefits in the event of a terminal illness, a specific disease, or confinement   to a nursing home.      For example, if an elderly person has a life insurance policy that pays   $50,000 to a designated beneficiary upon his or her death, an accelerated death   benefit allows the policyholder to receive a reduced benefit  prior  to   death to help pay for nursing home care. The benefit is generally reduced by   the amount of interest that would otherwise be earned on the cash value of the   policy between the accelerated date of payment and the estimated date of death   (e.g. one year). Because policyholders merely receive payments that would have   otherwise gone to the beneficiary of the policy in the event of death, there is   no risk pooling component in this financing approach; it is rather an    individual asset accumulation approach .      Recent estimates are that 60 percent of the elderly have some life   insurance, the vast majority of which is permanent (i.e. whole life) rather   than term coverage. Unfortunately, the value of most of these policies is   small: in 1984, 80 percent of the elderly had less than $10,000 worth of   coverage, 14 percent had between $10,000 and $25,000, and only six percent had   $25,000 or more in life insurance ( Table 3 ). 26      Many observers believe that because the need for life insurance   decreases with age, the current generation of elderly persons has deliberately   maintained only small amounts of life insurance, sufficient to cover burial   expenses. Future generations may be more motivated to maintain higher amounts   of life insurance if they realize that it could be useful in paying for   long-term care.      Home Equity Conversion (HEC) Plans      Another potential source of private financing for long-term care is the   equity which the elderly have built up in their homes. Although many of the   elderly have accumulated significant amounts of home equity, gaining access to   that equity without actually selling their homes can be difficult. Many cannot   obtain home equity loans because they do not have sufficient income to pay off   the loan. In addition, some lenders are more reluctant to extend loans to the   elderly because they do not want to risk the negative publicity associated with   foreclosing a loan on an elderly borrower, should that be necessary.      Home equity conversion plans--also known as reverse mortgages--enable   elderly homeowners to tap their home equity without principal or interest   payments until the house is sold, often after death. There are generally two   types of reverse mortgages: (1) fixed-term loans which generally make payments   from 5 to 15 years; and (2) open-ended loans which make payments until death,   institutionalization, or the resident moves out of the house. Thus, if one   spouse of an elderly couple entered a nursing home, a reverse mortgage could be   used to pay for nursing home care for months or years. Then, later on, when the   house was sold, the loan would be paid back, along with accumulated   interest.      While home equity conversion plans have existed since the 1970s, only   about 500 had been made as of 1985. Between 1985 and 1990, the number of home   equity conversions grew considerably. By 1990, at least 75 HEC programs were in   existence covering some 38 States, and approximately 5,000 reverse mortgages   had been written. 27  Although most   of this growth took place in the private sector, about one third of existing   reverse mortgages have been sponsored by public and foundation programs.      One attractive feature of HEC plans is that they are available to many   elderly persons with relatively low incomes. Many elderly persons have low   incomes and few financial assets, but relatively large amounts of home equity.   For example, as shown in  Table 4 , 36 percent of the   elderly with annual incomes below $10,000 have $25,000 or more in home equity.   In existing HEC plans, the typical borrower is a 75-77 year old single female   living alone with an annual income between $8,000 and $11,000.      Although there has been growth in HEC vehicles over the past five years,   participation in HEC plans is still low. One factor affecting consumer demand   for HEC plans is that many elderly are reluctant to place their homes at risk.   Many of today's elderly grew up during the Depression, when many homes were   lost due to failed institutions.      Another factor is that, in most States, the home remains a protected   asset under Medicaid. Thus, most elderly persons can qualify for Medicaid   long-term care coverage without having to tap their home equity. Rather than   use their home equity to pay for long-term care, they can keep these assets   while on Medicaid, and then pass them on to their children in their   estates.           BARRIERS TO THE GROWTH OF PRIVATE FINANCING   METHODS      While there has been considerable growth in private financing mechanisms   for long-term care in recent years, less than five percent of the elderly have   used one or more of these mechanisms to protect themselves from the financial   risk of long-term care. Why is this so? Affordability is clearly not the only   issue, for most analysts estimate that between 10 and 40 percent of the elderly   could afford to purchase long-term care insurance.      This section discusses the  potential  barriers to private   financing methods. These barriers can be divided into two categories: (1)   demand factors; and (2) supply factors ( Figure 5 ). Most   barriers are associated with all of the emerging forms of private financing,   and many of the potential barriers could be eliminated or reduced through   public and private sector strategies. 28      Barriers Facing Potential Consumers      The decision to protect oneself against the risk of needing long-term   care services is a personal one. Some persons are highly risk averse and will   spend large amounts of money to protect themselves. Out of fear, they may buy   products of low value, or more protection than they need, or duplicative   protection. At the other extreme, some persons refuse to entertain the   possibility that they will become disabled and need long-term care,   particularly in a nursing home. These individuals would probably not buy   insurance or enroll in a CCRC, regardless of the product's value.      The vast majority of the elderly, however, lie between these two   extremes. For them, the basic decision of whether to buy protection relates to   their  perceived value of the product , its  price , and whether they   can  afford  it. Is this insurance policy worth the premium cost? Will it   really cover the long-term care services I am going to need? Can I afford to   buy it, given my other expenses? Is this CCRC the right place for me to spend   the remaining years of my life?      The market for private financing products is still maturing and there   are many reasons why consumers may not be buying them. Some of these are   discussed below:      Misperceptions About the Risks of Long-Term Care and/or   Public Coverage      Many elderly persons underestimate their risk of needing long-term care.   They do not realize that two out of five individuals turning age 65 in 1990   will enter a nursing home before they die, and about one in five will be in a   nursing home for a year or more. 29      Many elderly persons also mistakenly believe that Medicare or Medigap   policies will cover the cost of a nursing home stay. 30  Medicare only covers short-term post acute-care   stays. Others do not understand that they must spend nearly all of their income   and assets before they can qualify for Medicaid assistance, and that even after   they qualify for Medicaid, they must still contribute nearly all their income   toward the cost of their care.      Delayed Planning for Long-Term Care Needs      Many people do not think about preparing for their future long-term care   needs until they are too old to purchase affordable insurance, too old to start   saving, or too disabled to gain access to risk pools. Most companies do not   sell insurance to persons over age 84 (if they did, the price would be close to   the cost of nursing home care itself).      Except for the very wealthy, preparing for long-term care requires   saving for the future. Current income must be reduced to protect against future   financial risks (i.e. being disabled and needing formal care). It is difficult   enough for people to plan for retirement, but even more difficult to plan for   events that will probably not occur until one reaches the age of 80 or 85. Many   elderly persons do not realize their need to plan for long-term care until an   illness or disabling condition forces them to, by which time they have become   an uninsurable risk.      Consumer Confusion About Products      Few people will buy products they do not understand. Many private   financing mechanisms, such as long-term care insurance, are legal contracts   that can be quite complicated regarding what services are covered under what   circumstances and at what payment rate. Unlike health insurance, potential   buyers do not have a sophisticated sponsor (e.g. an employer, the Medicare   program) to buy it for them. Each product is different, may use different   technical terms, or terms that the potential consumer does not even understand.   Consumers may be uncertain how particular products compare with each other.        Many policies contain vague language that makes it unclear under what   conditions benefits will be paid and under what circumstances premiums may   increase. 31  For example, some   policies state that benefits will be paid for a ""medical necessity"" with no   explanation of what constitutes a medical necessity. Other policies that   trigger benefits based upon the policyholder's disability status do not explain   how disability will be determined and who will make the determination. Also,   policies offering ""level premiums"" that are ""guaranteed renewable"" still may   have increased premiums as long as premiums are increased for all purchasers in   a category.      Long-term care insurance products are changing rapidly in response to   consumer demand. The policies offered in 1991 differ considerably from those   offered before 1987. Many elderly persons may be aware that the private   insurance market is evolving and are waiting until the market matures before   buying a policy. Also, persons who have already bought policies may be confused   about whether it would be prudent to up-grade their current policy to a better   product, even though they would be subject to underwriting provisions again and   a higher age-rated premium cost.      Affordability      Many elderly cannot afford long-term care insurance premiums that   average almost $100 per month at age 65, or the entry and maintenance fees of   CCRCs. Many elderly persons may believe that it is more important to use their   available income to buy Medigap insurance instead of long-term care insurance.   One advantage of Medigap insurance is that it provides immediate benefits in   the same year in which it is purchased, rather than delayed benefits in the   distant future. In the future, the increased financial resources of the   elderly, along with increased opportunities to purchase insurance at earlier   ages should expand the market for private financing mechanisms.      Inability to Use Resources      Individuals may have adequate financial resources but are unable to use   them to pay for long-term care. For example, working-aged persons are unable to   use their vested pension assets to buy insurance; most elderly persons are   unable to tap into the equity of their homes; and most non-elderly persons are   unable to use their group purchasing power through their employer to obtain   long-term care insurance.      Uncertain Value of Products      In addition to being confused about private financing products, many   consumers may have an underlying lack of confidence in the insurance industry   in general. In addition to having confidence in the product, they must have   confidence in the insurer. In this regard, reliable insurers offering products   of good value are hindered by disreputable companies selling products of poor   value.      Many long-term care insurance products are ambiguous in regard to the   circumstances under which benefits will be paid (i.e. how exactly will the need   for long-term care be determined and who will make the determination?). Indeed,   much of the language used in policies gives the impression that insurers have   significant leeway to deny payment for filed claims if they choose to. Faced   with this uncertainty, buyers must have confidence that submitted claims will   be paid when services are needed. This requires both confidence in the   integrity of the insurer to pay claims, and in the future financial solvency of   the company as a whole. For example, if the insurer has actually underestimated   long-term care utilization among its policyholders (and therefore underpriced   premium costs) it will not have the financial reserves to pay future claims,   regardless of its intentions. Given the immaturity of the private long-term   care insurance market, there is no industry track record on which potential   consumers can base their trust.      Misleading Marketing Practices      In some cases, dishonest and/or ignorant insurance agents, or   disreputable insurance companies or CCRC representatives, may employ fraudulent   or misleading marketing practices. Congressional hearings and investigations by   consumer groups have revealed problems with the marketing, sale, and payment of   benefits of long-term care insurance. 32  Media reports of fraudulent marketing practices,   denial of claims, premium increases, and policy cancellations have raised many   elderly individuals' fears of being the targets of consumer abuse. Although   these practices may be few and far between, consumers must have confidence that   adequate regulatory mechanisms are in place to protect them from fraudulent   suppliers in the marketplace.      Barriers Facing Suppliers      In addition to factors which inhibit potential consumers from buying   products, other factors are inhibiting suppliers from entering the market,   increasing market penetration, and improving their products. These include:        Lack of Data for Pricing the Risk of Long-Term Care   Use      In order to price their products correctly, insurers (and CCRCs) must be   able to estimate future long-term care utilization rates by those who are   buying the products (policyholders). Since private insurance and CCRCs are   relatively new products, insurers cannot examine historical claims experience   to predict future utilization rates. Without data to accurately predict future   long-term care use among their policyholders, insurers risk the possibility of   not having sufficient financial reserves to pay future claims. A number of   CCRCs have gone bankrupt precisely for this reason.      Medicaid is the largest long-term care insurance program currently in   operation, and therefore Medicaid data provide the best source of information   for estimating long-term care use among the elderly. However, Medicaid   insurance for long-term care differs significantly from private insurance   coverage. The insured population is vastly different (Medicaid recipients are   poor), low Medicaid payment rates in many States may limit access to services,   and high Medicaid co-payment requirements (i.e. all income except $30 per   month) may reduce utilization rates. Nursing home utilization rates among a   privately insured population are likely to be different from the rates observed   in the Medicaid insured population.      Of particular concern to insurers is whether nursing home use will   increase dramatically as a result of insurance coverage (moral hazard), and   whether persons who buy long-term care insurance or enter CCRCs are more likely   to use long-term care services than those who do not (adverse selection). 33      The lack of good data for developing actuarial estimates is compounded   by the fact that both CCRCs and long-term care insurance companies enter into    long term  agreements with residents and policyholders. There are   significant uncertainties associated with pricing products which may not be   used for 30 years. Over this time horizon, small differences in mortality,   interest rates, disability rates, or the availability of nursing home beds can   make a large difference in the number and amount of benefits that will have to   be provided. This uncertainty has led some insurers to limit their risk by   obscuring the events which trigger benefits (ambiguously defining the ""insured   event"" as previously discussed) or by employing conservative underwriting   practices (to protect against adverse selection).      Uncertainty of Tax Status      The uncertain tax status of accelerated life insurance payments and   long-term care insurance benefits has prevented some insurers from entering the   market. At present, it is not clear whether benefits paid out prior to death   under an accelerated life insurance rider will receive the same preferential   tax treatment that death benefits currently receive. Insurers and employers are   also reluctant to widely offer long-term care insurance in a group market,   largely because of the uncertainty of the tax laws concerning long-term care   insurance reserves and the deductibility of premiums. Insurers would like the   IRS or Congress to clarify the treatment of long-term care insurance so that it   is treated more like other accident and health insurance products.      The Lack of a Developed Group Market to Lower Costs        Insurance companies have large group markets for health insurance,   disability insurance, and life insurance. Large group markets, particularly   employee-based groups, substantially reduce marketing and overhead costs. Group   markets also spread risks over larger populations, thereby reducing the   possibility of adverse selection.      Long-term care insurance currently does not have the advantage of having   large group markets to market to; the great majority of policies are sold on an   individual basis. In 1991, employers offered long-term care insurance to almost   two million employees, spouses, retirees, and parents of employees, where the   purchaser was responsible for the full cost of the policy. To date, 200,000   policies have been sold representing only nine percent of all policies. 34      The Lack of Consistent Regulation Across States      The regulation of insurance and CCRCs is primarily a State   responsibility. As a result, the requirements that must be met by companies   offering long-term care insurance or wishing to establish CCRCs vary from State   to State. This situation can make it more costly for companies to expand their   market because often different products must be designed to meet the specific   regulatory requirements of each State. Some companies may decline altogether to   enter a particular State if they believe that regulatory requirements are so   stringent that the market cannot be made profitable. Alternatively, stringent   regulation in some States may limit product availability to only the   highest-priced products, limiting the size of the market, and reducing   opportunities for middle-class elderly persons to purchase less expensive   products that still offer good value.      Regulation of Private Long-Term Care Insurance      As with other insurance products, States are responsible for the   regulation and monitoring of long-term care insurance. There are three primary   areas of State regulation:                  Prior approval of policies to be marketed, based on criteria of     policy readability, standardization of policy terms, and minimum benefit     requirements;             Monitoring marketing and business practices to protect consumers     from unfair or deceptive acts under unfair trade practice regulations;     and             Premium rate review and efforts to ensure solvency of companies     selling policies.           State legislatures have considerable leeway in establishing minimum   standards for benefit plans, financial reserves, solvency, loss ratios,   cancellation of policies, and other regulatory requirements. Because long-term   care insurance is a relatively new product, there is little uniformity in its   regulation across States. Insurers, therefore, must tailor their products to   the regulatory provisions of each State.      Most States have based their regulation of long-term care insurance on   model standards developed by the National Association of Insurance   Commissioners (NAIC). In 1986, the NAIC, in conjunction with the Department of   Health and Human Services (DHHS) and insurance representatives, developed a    model act , which outlines recommended minimum requirements for long-term   care insurance in legislative language. In 1987, this was followed by  model   regulation , which spelled out in greater detail the provisions of the model   act.      The NAIC attempts to balance the need for adequate consumer protection   with the need to encourage flexibility and innovation in the development of a   new market. 35  To some extent, it   is reasonable for the market, rather than regulators, to determine what is a   good product. At the same time, consumers must be protected from clearly   inferior products and fraudulent marketing of inferior products.      In the last few years, the NAIC has reviewed the model act and   regulation about every six months, and several revisions have subsequently been   issued. States do not always amend their own legislation or regulation as often   as the NAIC updates the model act because State adherence to the NAIC model   legislation is voluntary. Also, some States only partially adopt the NAIC   guidelines. Therefore, even in States that have adopted ""the NAIC model act,""   standards may differ from the  most recent  NAIC model act. The most   important standards in the January 1993 NAIC Model act and regulation are   presented in  Figure 6 .      Before the development of the NAIC model act, only a few States had   specifically regulated long-term care insurance. By 1992, 49 States had   statutes and/or regulations governing long-term care insurance, and 44 of these   had adopted some form of the NAIC model act or regulation. However, as of   November 1992, most States did not have legislation or regulation in place that   conformed to the most recent revisions of the NAIC model act and regulations,   although some lag between approval of model standards by the NAIC and State   adoption of the standards is to be expected. For example, only Utah and   Michigan had prohibited attained age rating for long-term care insurance.      Information on the number of policies currently in force which meet   current NAIC standards is not available. In general, the top-selling policies    currently  offered meet the most recent NAIC standards. Most of the major   companies in the long-term care insurance market--those companies marketing the   15 top-selling products and which account for 80 percent of all policies   sold--market on a national basis. In general, these companies design a product   that adheres to NAIC standards and then alter the product on a State-specific   basis to conform to particular State provisions, which may be more or less   stringent than NAIC standards.      The NAIC currently is considering two issues related to long term care   insurance: 1) mandating nonforfeiture benefits; and 2) premium stabilization.   Mandating nonforfeiture benefits would ensure that purchasers who discontinued   paying premiums their policy (lapsed) would receive some of their prefunded   premiums. As indicated earlier, it would also probably increase premiums   between 35 and 65 percent. Premium stabilization is an effort on the part of   regulators to encourage companies to accurately price their products. The main   methods of stabilizing premiums are not permitting premiums to increase more   than a specified percentage and establishing improved criteria for regulators   to evaluate rate requests.      Although States may adopt the NAIC model act and model regulations for   governing the sale of private long-term care insurance, this is no assurance   that regulatory requirements are actually enforced. In a Congressional   investigation in 1991, the insurance departments of all 50 States were   contacted about their efforts to enforce long-term care insurance regulation.   The investigation's findings were that ""the majority appear to know little   about what is going on in their States...and although they rely heavily on   complaints to monitor companies selling long-term care insurance, few have   organized complaint gathering systems. Regulators lack clear actuarial   standards and centralized data on companies and agents."" 36  The Subcommittee felt State insurance   departments are ""understaffed and under-informed, and their ability to resolve   problems and willingness to reach out-of-State offenders is distinctly   limited."" 37           CONCLUSIONS      In recent years, a growing number of private financing mechanisms for   protecting elderly persons from the potentially high costs of long-term care   have emerged. These mechanisms include private long-term care insurance, CCRCs,   SHMOs, home equity conversion plans, accelerated life insurance benefits, and   others. Presently, we are still in the initial phases of market development of   these products, and both the products and the market are changing rapidly.      This section has discussed both demand and supply factors which serve as   barriers to the continued growth of the private financing market. Some of these   barriers, such as lack of consumer awareness and the lack of data for   developing sound actuarial estimates, will be mitigated over time, with or   without policy interventions. However, other barriers, such as the uncertain   tax status of private long-term care insurance, and the absence of an adequate   regulatory environment, may require new public initiatives at both the Federal   and State levels. There are a variety of public policy initiatives in the areas   of consumer education, market regulations, tax policy, data base development,   and long-term care research that would help to ensure the future viability and   growth of private financing methods.

On  the other hand, it can be legitimately     argued that some persons may correctly perceive that their own risk for needing     formal long-term care is less than average, for example, if they have many     family and friends who are available and willing to care for them at     home.

Medicaid enrollment for children and their parents has been shrinking as well (although less so than welfare), in spite of state efforts to expand their Medicaid eligibility policies. These declines in Medicaid enrollment were not expected, given the many ways family members can remain eligible for Medicaid after welfare (especially children). In addition, there has not been a decline in the number of uninsured.   This study analyzed the 1995 Medicaid enrollment patterns of children and their parents in five states--Alabama, California, Florida, Michigan and New Jersey--to increase our understanding of the enrollment interactions between welfare and Medicaid. Each of these states experienced a decline in their welfare caseloads during 1995. Using Medicaid administrative data, we explored the association of the welfare declines with overall Medicaid enrollment patterns. One part of the analysis focused on persons who left welfare during the year to see how many stayed on Medicaid. We also examined whether welfare leavers who stayed on Medicaid had different Medicaid expenditure patterns from those who left. A second part of the analysis looked at the dynamics of overall Medicaid enrollment during 1995, with a focus on the extent of turnover.   State Medicaid Research Files (SMRF) from the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA(now known as CMS)) are the primary data source. For each state, these files include monthly eligibility information for all Medicaid enrollees during a calendar year, as well as information about individual expenditure levels.    FINDINGS     Study findings add to the body of evidence that declines in the welfare caseload which began in 1995 are likely to have a noticeable effect on state Medicaid programs, in terms of overall enrollment, caseload mix, and per capita expenditure levels. The findings also point to problems of continuity in Medicaid enrollment, which may be contributing to the lack of insurance among low- income children and their parents. Medicaid enrollment patterns that are cause for concern include:   ·  Declines in state welfare caseloads are associated with declines in Medicaid enrollment, particularly for parents.  Every state showed a decrease in Medicaid enrollment during 1995, among family members qualifying for coverage through welfare. Some of the states were able to increase enrollment through the nonwelfare eligibility groups by making greater use of the child poverty-related, transitional assistance, and medically needy groups. Nevertheless, all the states had a net decline in the Medicaid enrollment of children and their parents. The Medicaid declines ranged from 1 to 4 percent, compared to a 2 to 12 percent decline in welfare caseloads. In every state, declines were greater for adults than children.   ·  Many welfare leavers are not staying on Medicaid and are at risk of becoming uninsured.  At least half the children and adults leaving welfare in every study state also left Medicaid. While we expected that a sizable proportion of parents leaving welfare might not continue on Medicaid, this result was not expected for children, given the availability of the poverty-related expansion coverage in all the states. This pattern is troubling since the work of other researchers suggests that while not all persons leaving welfare and medicaid lose their insurance coverage, a significant number of welfare leavers become uninsured.   ·  Medicaid programs appear to disproportionately lose low-cost welfare leavers while continuing to cover those with higher costs.  Study results show that children and adults who left welfare and Medicaid generally had lower average Medicaid expenditures compared to those who remained enrolled. Findings also showed that adults and children with any amount of Medicaid expenditures were more likely to maintain Medicaid coverage upon leaving welfare. In addition, at least among children, as monthly expenditures increased, so did the probability of remaining enrolled in Medicaid. These findings suggest that the Medicaid casemix may be changing. Medicaid managed care programs are understandably worried that those who remain on Medicaid may have more health problems, and that capitated payments may not adequately reflect casemix changes.   ·  States are experiencing considerable turnover in their Medicaid caseloads . Turnover in Medicaid enrollment was especially high for adults, ranging from 26 to 40 percent during 1995 across the study states. The annual turnover rates for children went from 21 to 29 percent. Turnover is a problem to the extent that individuals leaving Medicaid continue to be eligible. Other researchers have found that many children who are uninsured were previously enrolled in Medicaid, and that many still appeared to be eligible. The sheer numbers of individuals moving off of Medicaid in 1995 dwarfed the year end declines in enrollment. Across the study states, monthly enrollment had declined about by 180,000 individuals at year end; however, nearly 1.5 million children and almost a million adults disenrolled from Medicaid during the year.   Since state welfare caseloads declined at much greater rates after 1995, there is concern that Medicaid enrollment will drop even more, and that Medicaid reductions may be contributing to the continuing problem of the uninsured. The recently implemented State Child Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) expansions for children (and the associated outreach) provide some hope that these Medicaid enrollment declines eventually will be reversed, and that fewer low-income children will be uninsured. However, the situation for parents seems less likely to improve less unless they receive greater attention.   State officials report that many families leave welfare without providing the information needed to redetermine their continued eligibility for Medicaid. Some families leaving welfare may not need Medicaid, since they will be able to secure private insurance through employment; but others who become uninsured may mistakenly believe that they no longer qualify for Medicaid. It is also likely that some welfare leavers perceive the effort associated with maintaining Medicaid coverage not worth the benefit; some families have indicated that they know they can reapply for Medicaid if they need to.   In one sense, it is reassuring that welfare leavers who also leave Medicaid may be healthier (since they appear to have used fewer medical services prior to welfare exit). However, if these individuals leave welfare and become uninsured, they may jeopardize their future health status if they lack ready access to care and delay needed services. Lack of insurance may keep children, in particular, from obtaining appropriate preventive services.   Congress and the states continue to be concerned about the high rate of uninsured. The results from this study suggest that the dynamics of Medicaid enrollment may be at least part of the problem. If state Medicaid programs could increase the number of children and parents leaving welfare who continue on Medicaid, uninsurance rates might decline. In addition, greater attention needs to be given to inappropriate turnover among children and adults qualifying for Medicaid through the nonwelfare groups. Although states may continue to make policy changes to expand Medicaid coverage provisions in an effort to reduce the number of uninsured, these changes are not likely to be effective unless steps are also taken to improve individual continuity in Medicaid coverage.      INTRODUCTION      State welfare caseloads have been declining at an unprecedented rate since 1994, partly as a result of state and federal welfare reform efforts and partly because of a strong economy. From a peak of 14.2 million recipients in 1994, by 1998 monthly welfare enrollment had dropped more than 40 percent to an average of 8.3 million recipients. Medicaid enrollment for children and their parents has been shrinking as well, in spite of state efforts to expand their Medicaid eligibility policies (Ellwood and Ku 1998). The Medicaid declines are much more modest, due to the offsetting coverage available through the poverty-related groups for children and other eligibility provisions not tied to cash assistance. Recent analyses suggest that the number of children enrolled in Medicaid decreased by 2.7 percent from 1995 to 1997, whereas adult (or parental) enrollment decreased by 10.6 percent (Ku and Bruen 1999). This represents a decline in enrollment of about 1.6 million children and adults. States have substantially increased the number of children and their parents qualifying for Medicaid under the noncash eligibility groups, but this increase has not been sufficient to mitigate the declining number who qualify for Medicaid because they meet cash assistance-related rules.   These declines in Medicaid enrollment were not expected. Under the federal welfare reform legislation, called the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA) of 1996, Congress tried to minimize any adverse effects of welfare reform on Medicaid, leaving in place the 12 months of extended Medicaid coverage for families leaving welfare for work and prohibiting states from imposing work requirements or time limits for Medicaid. The PRWORA legislation also provided states with considerable flexibility to make their Medicaid eligibility rules less restrictive, and PRWORA did not change the continued phase-in of the poverty-related Medicaid expansions for children. In addition, the State Child Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) legislation of 1997 provided enhanced matching funds to states to further accelerate their coverage of uninsured low-income children. Thus, States were enabled to follow several paths in expanding their Medicaid eligibility policies. There are several means by which families leaving welfare should continue to qualify for Medicaid, but to date, these provisions have not been sufficient to stem a decline in Medicaid caseloads. In view of the fact that the number of uninsured according to Current Population Survey data has risen every year since 1987, this trend is causing concern.   An earlier paper by Ellwood and Lewis (1999) used Medicaid administrative data from California and Florida for 1995 to analyze how declines in welfare enrollment were affecting Medicaid. Generally, they found that at least half of children and one-half to two-thirds of parents leaving welfare also left Medicaid, even though a greater proportion would be expected to remain eligible. Ellwood and Lewis found, too, that one-quarter to one-third of the child and adult Medicaid caseloads turned over during the year, and that 7 to 10 percent of the enrollees had short-term interruptions in their Medicaid enrollment during the year (usually referred to as “churning”). Their research suggests that the problem of continuity in Medicaid enrollment existed before the enactment of PRWORA in 1996 and may be a factor in the Medicaid enrollment decline, primarily because a sizable proportion of welfare leavers do not remain on Medicaid.   This study builds on that research by extending the analysis to additional states and examining the relationship between Medicaid expenditure levels for people leaving welfare and the likelihood of continued Medicaid enrollment. Managed care organizations are understandably concerned that the individuals who leave welfare and Medicaid may be healthier, leaving a disproportionate number of those who are sicker and more expensive on Medicaid. Obviously, this could affect the adequacy of capitation rates that are being used under Medicaid managed care programs.   We focus on the 1995 Medicaid caseloads of children and their parents in five states--Alabama, California, Florida, Michigan and New Jersey. Each of these states experienced a decline in their welfare caseloads during 1995 (Table 1). California’s welfare enrollment dropped less than 2 percent, but the decline in the other states ranged from 8 to 12 percent, according to AFDC data. Specific analyses include:           What happened with Medicaid enrollment in each state in 1995         The extent to which persons leaving AFDC during 1995 remained on Medicaid,     with separate analyses of children and adults 1          Whether Medicaid expenditure levels differed for welfare leavers who stayed     on Medicaid, compared to those who left both programs         The level of turnover and churning within the Medicaid caseload in each state     State Medicaid Research Files (SMRF) files from the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA(now known as CMS)) are the primary data source. For each state, these files include monthly eligibility information for all Medicaid enrollees during a calendar year, as well as information about individual expenditure levels. These five states were chosen for study because by 1995 their welfare caseloads had started to decline, and their SMRF data were readily available.      PREVIOUS RESEARCH       Concerns about Medicaid enrollment patterns are not new. Although Medicaid enrollment of children and their parents increased by just over 60 percent during the period from 1987 to 1995,    Table 1     research during that period indicated that many seemingly eligible individuals were not enrolled in Medicaid, and that individuals were leaving Medicaid without insurance. Generally, lower participation rates were reported for persons eligible under the nonwelfare routes to Medicaid eligibility. For 1993, Dubay and Kenney (1996) estimated a participation rate of 69 percent for uninsured children who would qualify under the child poverty-related expansion provisions, compared to a 90 percent rate for children qualifying under the welfare-related rules. Ellwood and Adams (1990) found that the majority of cases leaving Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) in California and Georgia were not continuing on Medicaid, despite the availability of transitional coverage for families going from welfare to work. Short and Freedman (1998), using data from the 1990 panel of the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), found that two- thirds of mothers who left Medicaid became uninsured. Short and Freedman also reported that 10 percent of the Medicaid caseload they were studying turned over in a four-month period.   Studies using more recent data confirm the persistence of Medicaid enrollment problems and raise other concerns as well. Selden et al. (1998), using 1996 data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, found that 4.7 million children in 1996 were uninsured despite being eligible for Medicaid. Using a national survey of welfare leavers from 1995 to 1997, Garrett and Holahan (2000 a and b) found that 44 percent of mothers and 30 percent of children who left welfare less than six months earlier were not enrolled in Medicaid. They also found that rates of uninsurance for families leaving welfare increased with the number of months since leaving welfare. Important to this study, a person’s health status, they found, was important in determining whether Medicaid coverage was maintained after leaving welfare. Women who had health conditions that limited their ability to work were more likely to stay on Medicaid after leaving welfare, compared to women without limiting health conditions. Results were similar, though weaker, for children. These findings are important because they suggest that welfare leavers remaining on Medicaid are likely to have greater health care needs and incur greater expenses than those who leave both welfare and Medicaid.   Theories abound as to why eligible families do not participate in Medicaid, including families who may have had some period of enrollment in the past. Focus groups and surveys have identified the following barriers to participation (Smith et al. 1998; Perry et al. 1998; and Shuptrine et al. 1998):           The stigma associated with welfare receipt extends to Medicaid as well, and     keeps many families from applying for coverage or continuing on Medicaid     once they are off welfare.         Many low-income people think Medicaid is for families on welfare, not working     families.         Some people confuse the new rules associated with welfare reform with Medicaid     rules, leading them to believe mistakenly that Medicaid is now time-limited,     like welfare, or that Medicaid coverage (without welfare) counts as part     of the new welfare lifetime limit, or that the welfare work requirements     extend to Medicaid.         Immigrants, in particular, are worried that participation by any family member     in Medicaid (even children who are citizens) may cause parents to be considered     public charges and thus disqualify them from eventual citizenship.         Families who have been on welfare and Medicaid in the past say they dropped     out because the eligibility process is burdensome and demeaning, or they     were frustrated by the complexity of the rules.         Families say they are healthy, and they believe they can get Medicaid if     they need it.     Thus, even when states make their Medicaid eligibility policies more generous, other barriers to participation may prevent the expansions from maintaining or increasing enrollment.      ELIGIBILITY POLICIES OF STUDY STATES IN 1995      By 1995, interstate differences in Medicaid eligibility policy had been considerably reduced as a result of the federally mandated poverty-related expansions for children. That same year, all states were required to extend Medicaid coverage to children under age six and pregnant women with family income below 133 percent of the federal poverty level (FPL) and to children born after September 30, 1983, with family income below 100 percent FPL. The study states exceeded these federal requirements only with a few groups in 1995 (Table 2). Four of the states (California, Florida, Michigan, and New Jersey) used income thresholds ranging from 185 to 200 percent FPL for infants and pregnant women, and Michigan covered children ages 1 through 15 years to 150 percent FPL.   Nevertheless, there continued to be substantial variation among the study states with their AFDC and medically needy income levels, which in particular affected Medicaid eligibility for adults. California’s AFDC benefit levels were at 58 percent of FPL, among the highest in the United States. In contrast, the AFDC levels of Alabama and Florida at 15 to 29 percent of FPL were considerably less generous and well below the median state. Among the study states, Alabama did not have medically needy coverage in 1995, and New Jersey’s medically needy program was somewhat restrictive, since it covered children and pregnant women but no other parents. The medically needy income thresholds ranged from 29 to 78 percent FPL, with those of all the states but California below the median state.   All the states were required to extend up to 12 months of transitional Medicaid coverage to children and their parents if families were leaving welfare due to earnings. All the study states also used other more obscure, noncash eligibility groups to establish eligibility for Medicaid-only benefits for families not poor enough to qualify for welfare. 2     Table 2     It is difficult to predict exactly which eligibility groups will be important to a state in extending Medicaid coverage. Children and other family members often can qualify under more than one Medicaid eligibility provision. Which provision is used may depend on numerous factors, including whether the family reported earnings, the level of family income, whether any family member had unusually high medical expenses, and the ages of the children in the family. Other factors include the extent of automation of eligibility determination in each state and the structure and internal logic of the automated system. For example, the systems in many states employ a hierarchical approach to eligibility determination, testing families for cash assistance and Medicaid first (using the lowest income thresholds) and poverty-related coverage last (using the highest income thresholds), with the other eligibility groups (such as transitional assistance and medically needy coverage) somewhere in between.      RESULTS        Did Medicaid Enrollment Decline?     Consistent with the national pattern, all five study states experienced a decline in Medicaid enrollment for children and adults during 1995, although the extent of the decline varied (Table 3). New Jersey’s Medicaid enrollment in December was only 0.8 percent below its January level, compared to a 4.2 difference in Florida by year end. The other three states had declines of 2.1 to 3.8 percent.    Table 3     The level of Medicaid decline attributable to reduced AFDC enrollment was fairly consistent with the level of decline reported by each state’s welfare program (shown in Table 1).(3) Helping offset the welfare declines in every state were increases in the poverty-related groups, although the extent of the increase varied. The increase in poverty-related coverage was only 3.2 percent in Alabama, but this lower rate occurred in part because the poverty-related group already accounted for nearly half the state’s Medicaid enrollees at the beginning of the year. At the other extreme, poverty-related coverage increased by almost 23 percent during 1995 in California, but it still accounted for only 2.4 percent of overall enrollment at year’s end. Michigan also had a high growth rate (23.4 percent) for poverty-related coverage during the year. By year’s end, the poverty-related groups accounted for 15.1 percent of Medicaid enrollment in Michigan. Alabama and Florida, which had the lowest AFDC benefit levels and no or marginal medically needy coverage among the study states, had the lowest rates of increase for poverty-related coverage, but they were making greater use of the poverty-related coverage at the start of 1995 than the other three states.   There were no clear changes in enrollment patterns across the states for persons covered under either the medically needy group or the residual “other” eligibility group. Michigan was the only state with growth in medically needy enrollment during 1995. Michigan and New Jersey reported sizable increases in enrollment under the other coverage group (27.8 percent and 17.8 percent, respectively). This residual coverage group includes families qualifying for transitional assistance. California’s 7.9 percent decrease in enrollment under the other coverage group occurred because of a decline during the year in the number of families affected under a class-action court decision. 4    In all five states, the drop in adult Medicaid enrollment during 1995 was greater than that reported for children. This pattern was expected, since adults in all the states had fewer options for noncash coverage than children.    Did Welfare Leavers Stay on Medicaid?      A key part of our analysis was to see what happened to the Medicaid status of individuals leaving AFDC. We focused on those who left from February through July 1995, so that we could follow the Medicaid status for six months after AFDC exit. Six months seemed to us a sufficient time to assess whether Medicaid coverage continued. We counted persons as having left AFDC only if they did not receive benefits for two consecutive months. This standard reduced the likelihood of counting persons whose AFDC coverage was interrupted temporarily because of failure to comply with reporting or other administrative requirements.   What proportion of adults who left AFDC stayed on Medicaid? Across the five states, from 49.3 percent (California) to 66.6 percent (Florida) of adults were no longer enrolled in Medicaid three months after leaving AFDC (Table 4). This overall pattern changed very little at the six-month interval. At six months, three of the states had a slight increase in the proportion of adults who were covered by Medicaid, but only because more adults had returned to the AFDC rolls (and were thus automatically reenrolled in Medicaid). Transitional benefits were used by a relatively small proportion of adults in the three states in which data on transitional coverage were available, ranging from 8.4 percent of adults in California to 19.1 percent in New Jersey. By the sixth month after AFDC exit, between 12 percent (New Jersey) and 18.8 percent (California) of adults across the study states had returned to the AFDC program.    Table 4     As we expected, children leaving AFDC were more likely than their parents to remain on Medicaid (Table 5). The margin of difference, however, was not large, except in Florida. Three months after leaving AFDC, the proportion of children not enrolled in Medicaid ranged from 46.7 percent (California) to 57.9 percent (Florida) across the five states. Similar to adults, the situation improved somewhat by the sixth month, but only because more children had returned to the AFDC program. The eligibility groups used to continue coverage varied across the states. California and New Jersey were less likely to use the poverty-related provisions to continue child coverage after AFDC than the other study states. However, it is difficult to compare the states on the basis of which eligibility groups they used to continue Medicaid eligibility. For example, California’s medically needy income threshold was considerably higher than the AFDC threshold, so that more children could qualify under the medically needy provisions, before they were tested for coverage under the poverty-related group. If California's medically needy income threshold had been closer to the AFDC threshold, more children would likely have qualified under the poverty-related provisions.   Thus, in all the study states, close to half or more of children and their parents who left welfare in 1995 also left Medicaid. We cannot be certain what happened to the insurance status of each of these individuals; however, previous research suggests that many became uninsured. In addition, it seems likely that the vast majority of children could have retained their Medicaid eligibility, given the poverty-related provisions available in all the states.    Table 5     Were the Welfare Leavers Staying on Medicaid Different From Those Who Left?     Policymakers and Medicaid officials are understandably interested in whether welfare leavers who also leave Medicaid are different from those who remain enrolled in Medicaid. In particular, they want to know whether welfare leavers who continue on Medicaid are likely to be more costly than those who leave Medicaid would have been. Differences in expected expenditure levels could cause State Medicaid programs to experience adverse selection among those leaving welfare. Welfare leavers with few medical-care needs at the time of welfare exit may be less inclined to maintain Medicaid coverage, particularly if they believe that they will be able to reestablish Medicaid coverage if they need it. Conversely, welfare leavers with medical needs--especially those with considerable needs--can be expected to maintain Medicaid coverage in order to maintain access to care. As a result, State Medicaid programs may be continuing coverage for welfare leavers with greater anticipated medical expenditures, while losing healthier welfare leavers who are likely to cost less.   SMRF data enabled us to explore whether there were differences in expenditure patterns among welfare leavers who left Medicaid, compared to those who remained enrolled. We first looked at unadjusted expenditure differences and then differences that adjusted for age, sex, and race/ethnicity in a regression framework. However, the SMRF expenditure data had important limitations. First, we could only use expenditure data for welfare leavers not participating in managed care programs. Because services provided through managed care are not available in the SMRF data, the expenditure information for these individuals is not equivalent to those in fee-for-service. We were able to identify those individuals in managed care in all the study states but California; therefore, California is excluded from the expenditure analysis. 5  Second, the person summary files in the SMRF data only included annual expenditure levels. As a result, we could not separate Medicaid expenditures for individuals into the time periods before and after welfare exit. To adjust for varying lengths of enrollment, we computed an average monthly expenditure level.   The sample used in the previous analysis was further restricted for this analysis of expenditures. First, we limited our sample for the expenditure analysis to persons who left welfare in July through October. Our earlier analysis also included persons who left welfare in February through June. This restriction allowed us to minimize the time period over which expenditures could be incurred after welfare exit. Nevertheless, some bias to our results is possible if the level of Medicaid expenditures after welfare exit (for those who remained on Medicaid) was markedly different from the expenditure level prior to exit. Second, the sample for the expenditure analysis was further restricted to welfare leavers who were enrolled continuously until the point of welfare exit in order to minimize the problem of enrollment periods that were too short for individuals to obtain medical care. As a result, all individuals in our sample had at least six months of enrollment during 1995.   As we expected, study results showed that most individuals who left welfare, but did not maintain Medicaid coverage, had lower average monthly expenditures compared to those who remained on Medicaid. Unadjusted data are presented in Tables 6 and 7. These data show that adults and children who left welfare but did not maintain Medicaid coverage, were less likely to have had at least some Medicaid expenditures when they were on welfare; they were less likely to have had an inpatient admission; their median monthly Medicaid expenditures were lower; and most had average monthly expenditures that were lower than the expenditures of welfare leavers who remained on Medicaid.    Table 6      Table 7    Among the adults who left both welfare and Medicaid, the proportion incurring no Medicaid expenditures while enrolled ranged from 22.5 percent (Michigan) to 35.0 percent (Alabama). In comparison, only 5.5 percent (Michigan) to 12.2 percent (Florida) of the adult welfare leavers who remained on Medicaid had zero Medicaid expenditures while enrolled. Inpatient admissions ranged from 7.4 percent (Alabama) to 10.0 percent (Michigan) among those leaving Medicaid, and from 13.6 percent (New Jersey) to 16.8 percent (Florida) among adults maintaining coverage. Median monthly Medicaid expenditures were less among those leaving Medicaid and ranged from $19 (Alabama and Florida) to $36 (Michigan and New Jersey). Adults maintaining Medicaid coverage had median monthly expenditures that ranged from $46 (Alabama) to $69 (Florida). Average monthly Medicaid expenditures for adults leaving welfare and Medicaid were significantly less in two of the four states and ranged from $123 (Alabama) to $280 (New Jersey), compared to a range of $139 (Alabama) to $235 (New Jersey) among adults who remained on Medicaid after leaving welfare. 6    Expenditure patterns among children were similar to those of adults: children who left Medicaid were less likely to have expenditures while enrolled and less likely to have an inpatient admission; they had lower median and average monthly Medicaid expenditures. From 30.3 percent (Michigan) to 46.0 percent (Florida) of children leaving welfare and Medicaid did not incur any expenditures while enrolled. This compares to a range of 6.3 percent (Michigan) to 12.0 percent (Florida) for those who maintained their Medicaid coverage. Across the study states, between two and three percent of children leaving Medicaid had inpatient hospital admissions prior to welfare exit, compared to a rate of four to seven percent among children who remained on Medicaid. Average monthly Medicaid expenditures for children leaving welfare and Medicaid were significantly less in three of the four states (the exception was Michigan), ranging from $49 (Alabama) to $84 (New Jersey), compared to a range of $66 (Michigan) to $99 (New Jersey) among children who remained on welfare after Medicaid.   We also analyzed the relationship between monthly Medicaid expenditures and whether an individual maintained Medicaid after leaving welfare in a regression framework. Logistic regression was used to determine whether greater monthly Medicaid expenditures were associated with an increased probability that a welfare leaver would maintain Medicaid coverage. Tables 8 and 9 present the results of the regression analysis and Appendix Tables 1 and 2 present the full regression specification. The analysis is based on comparing each quintile of expenditures to having no expenditures. The use of quintiles rather than a continuous measure of average monthly expenditures allowed us to look at sections of the distribution of expenditures and compare and contrast those with few expenditures and in the first quintile to those with relatively large expenditures and in the fifth quintile. 7    Similar to the unadjusted data, across all states adults and children with any positive amount of monthly Medicaid expenditures while enrolled were significantly more likely to maintain Medicaid coverage when leaving welfare. For example, in Alabama, adults in the first quintile of expenditures were two times more likely to maintain coverage compared to adults with no expenditures. If an adult had expenditures in the fifth quintile, the probability of maintaining coverage was 2.6 times.    Table 8      Table 9     A similar pattern is seen among children--when they had at least some Medicaid expenditures while enrolled, they were significantly more likely to maintain Medicaid coverage and the magnitude of a child’s monthly expenditures was more likely to be related to the probability of maintaining Medicaid coverage. For example, in Alabama, children with expenditures in the first quintile were more than four times as likely to maintain Medicaid coverage compared to children with no expenditures. When children in Alabama had expenditures in the fifth quintile, they were nine times more likely to maintain Medicaid when leaving welfare. Clearly, in Alabama whereas having any expenditures significantly increased the probability that a child leaving welfare would maintain Medicaid coverage, children with greater levels of expenditures were much more likely to maintain coverage, compared to those with fewer expenditures.        How Much Turnover and Churning Occurs in Medicaid Caseloads?      A final study objective was to look at the extent to which turnover and churning in each state’s Medicaid caseload might be contributing to enrollment declines. As background for understanding these additional measures, it is useful to review the different ways Medicaid enrollment is counted. Most analyses of trends in Medicaid enrollment rely on year-to-year counts of the number of persons ever enrolled during the year, which states report to HCFA(now known as CMS) on Form 2082. These aggregate annual counts of the persons ever enrolled in Medicaid are a good measure of what is happening to overall enrollment, but they provide only limited information. Important to this discussion, annual counts do not reveal the extent to which persons remain enrolled from one year to the next. It is theoretically possible that individuals enrolled one year differ significantly from those enrolled the next year. There may be a tendency with Form 2082 data to think that most of the people enrolled from year to year are the same, but this may be erroneous.   Annual counts of the ever-enrolled, like those used in HCFA(now known as CMS)'s Form 2082, are derived by adding the number of persons enrolled at the start of the year to the number of new entries throughout the year. The level of exits or turnover during a given year do not affect this number. In addition, a person enrolled 1 month is counted the same as a person enrolled all 12 months. Those exiting the program during a year have an effect on the next year’s enrollment numbers, but only to the extent that fewer people are enrolled at the start of the next year.   As reported earlier, the SMRF data used for this study allowed us to look at monthly Medicaid enrollment counts for each state, similar to those used to track enrollment in state AFDC/TANF programs. Monthly counts are compiled as a net of persons entering, exiting, and continuing enrollment each month. We think they are a better barometer of enrollment, since they measure a shorter time period and immediately take exits into account. For analysis, it is helpful to have both sets of numbers.   For our analysis, we chose to measure turnover by comparing average monthly enrollment for each state during 1995 to the number of persons ever enrolled in Medicaid at any point during the year. We calculate a turnover rate for each state, based on the difference between the average monthly enrollment and the annual number ever enrolled. The closer a state’s average monthly enrollment is to the annual ever enrolled number, the lower the turnover rate. Among the study states, Florida experienced the greatest turnover in its Medicaid programs in 1995 (Table 10). In Florida, the average monthly enrollment was 68.3 percent of the annual ever-enrolled count. Thus, almost one-third of Florida’s Medicaid caseload turned over during the year. The other four states reported average monthly enrollment ranging from 73 to 78 percent of the annual count, for a turnover rate closer to 25 percent. As expected, in all the states, turnover was greater for adults than children.    Table 10     Turnover is appropriate when persons exiting the program are no longer eligible. Usually, turnover is thought of as inappropriate when eligible persons leave the program. Because state Medicaid data do not include information on why people disenroll from Medicaid, we have no way of knowing the extent of turnover that may be inappropriate. However, other researchers have shown that, although some children and adults leaving welfare become insured, a sizable proportion become uninsured.   Related to the turnover patterns, more than half the children in Alabama, California, Michigan, and New Jersey were enrolled throughout 1995 (Table 11). California, Michigan, and New Jersey also had close to half their adult Medicaid population enrolled throughout the year. Average lengths of enrollment for 1995 ranged from an average of 8.6 months for children in Florida, to 9.5 months for children in Michigan. The average length of enrollment during 1995 for adults ranged from 7.3 months in Alabama and Florida, to 8.9 months in Michigan. At the same time, it is important to remember that data on length of enrollment are restricted to 1995 and do not reflect the true average duration of Medicaid enrollment. 8    Further detail is provided in Table 12, which compares average monthly entry rates (the proportion of persons currently enrolled in Medicaid who were not enrolled the previous month) and exit rates (the proportion of persons not currently enrolled in Medicaid who were enrolled the previous month) for the general population and for the poverty-related child group in 1995. In every state, the average monthly exit rate exceeded the entry rate, as we expected, given the overall decline in enrollment during the year. Also, as expected, given its higher turnover rates, Florida showed the highest rates of entry and exit for the general Medicaid population.    Table 11      Table 12     The turnover rate among the child poverty-related group is shown in the lower panel of Table 12. We were particularly interested in the level of turnover among this group, since policymakers have expected its enrollment to grow as more children became eligible under phased-in coverage and as outreach efforts made more parents aware of the availability of this coverage. In addition to showing the rates of entrants and exits for this group, Table 12 shows the average percentage of children who transferred in and out of poverty-related coverage from other eligibility groups each month. We expected that many children would be exiting the poverty-related groups, since these children usually are from higher-income families (making their Medicaid eligibility more tenuous) and some children would always be aging out of poverty-related coverage. In addition, during 1995, the economy was beginning to improve in many states, which might have caused a reduction in the number of children eligible for poverty-related coverage.   The average monthly rate of entrants into the poverty-related child group was greater than the exit rate in all the study states but California and Florida. In addition, in three of the states, the proportion transferring in (from other Medicaid groups) exceeded the proportion transferring out. On net, as reported above, enrollment in the child poverty-related group grew in all the study states during 1995.   In some respects, the sheer number of children and parents who exited Medicaid (or turned over) during 1995 may be just as important a measure as the overall caseload declines across the study states. Across the five study states, monthly Medicaid enrollment dropped about 180,000 from January to December of 1995. However, nearly 1.5 million children and almost a million adults were enrolled at some point during 1995, but not in December (Table 13). In California alone, more    Table 13     than 750,000 children left Medicaid during the year. As a point of comparison, California’s target for SCHIP enrollment in 1998 was 200,000 children. The state might be well served to focus on children exiting Medicaid each month as part of its SCHIP outreach effort. Nationwide, the SCHIP target is 2 million children.   As a final part of our analysis, we looked at the extent to which churning accounted for caseload turnover. Churning refers to persons whose enrollment in Medicaid is interrupted during the year-- they were on, then off, then back on, and so forth. Managed care organizations complain about the loss of revenue and administrative expense associated with churning. We excluded the medically needy group from our churning analysis, since there is often some interruption in enrollment as a result of the spend-down requirements.   Florida had the highest level of churning during 1995, with 10.2 percent of its overall caseload experiencing interruptions in coverage during the year (Table 14); New Jersey had the lowest level, involving only 3.9 percent of its caseload. In Alabama, the level of churning was about the same across eligibility groups. In the other states, however, the poverty-related group had a higher level of churning than either the AFDC or the residual “other” group. This was particularly true in California, where the churning rate for the poverty-related group was 14.4 percent, which far exceeded the rates for the AFDC and the other group. We are unclear about why this pattern would occur.      DISCUSSION       Study findings add to the body of evidence--that declines in the welfare caseload which began in 1995 are likely to have a noticeable effect on state Medicaid programs in the future, in terms of overall enrollment, caseload mix, and per capita expenditure levels. The findings also point to problems of continuity in Medicaid enrollment, which may be contributing to the lack of insurance among low-income children and their parents. Medicaid enrollment patterns that are cause for concern include:    Table 14     ·  Declines in state welfare caseloads are associated with declines in Medicaid enrollment, particularly for parents.  Every state showed a decrease in Medicaid enrollment during 1995, among family members qualifying for coverage through welfare. Some of the states were able to increase enrollment through the nonwelfare eligibility groups by making greater use of the child poverty-related, transitional assistance, and medically needy groups. Nevertheless, all the states had a net decline in the Medicaid enrollment of children and their parents during the study year. Since state welfare caseloads declined at much greater rates after 1995, there is concern that Medicaid enrollment will drop even more, and that Medicaid reductions may be contributing to the continuing problem of the uninsured. However, the SCHIP expansions for children (and the associated outreach) provide some hope that these Medicaid enrollment declines for children eventually will be reversed, and that fewer low-income children will be uninsured.   The situation for parents is less hopeful unless states make major changes for this group as well. To start, states could review their procedures for making sure that families formally or informally diverted from applying for welfare are encouraged to apply for Medicaid. As we discuss further below, states also need to give greater attention to the process for making sure eligible families leaving welfare continue their enrollment in Medicaid. Finally, states could make greater use of the provisions in the PRWORA legislation that allow expansion of Medicaid coverage provisions for low-income families. A few states--including Rhode Island, the District of Columbia and Connecticut--have used the PRWORA provisions to change their requirements for the poorest families. In these states, Medicaid coverage for parents will be more equivalent to the coverage available to children through the poverty-related expansion groups. Even modest expansions in coverage for parents may also have the added benefit of improved participation rates among children.   ·  Many welfare leavers are not staying on Medicaid and are at risk of becoming uninsured.  At least half the children and adults leaving welfare in the study states also left Medicaid. Work by Short et al. (1998) and Garret and Holahan (1999) suggests that a significant number of welfare leavers become uninsured. This problem existed prior to PRWORA, but the rapid declines in welfare caseloads after 1995 may have exacerbated the effect on Medicaid enrollment levels. State officials report that many families leave welfare without providing the information needed to redetermine their continued eligibility for Medicaid. Some families leaving welfare may not need Medicaid, since they will be able to secure private insurance through employment; but others who become uninsured may mistakenly believe that they no longer qualify for Medicaid. It is also likely that some welfare leavers perceive the effort associated with maintaining Medicaid coverage not worth the benefit; some families have indicated that they know they can reapply for Medicaid if they need to.   ·  Medicaid programs appear to disproportionately lose low-cost welfare leavers while continuing to cover those with higher costs.  Study results show that most adults and children who left welfare and Medicaid had lower average Medicaid expenditures compared to those who stayed on Medicaid. Findings also showed that adults and children with any amount of Medicaid expenditures were more likely to maintain Medicaid coverage upon leaving welfare. In addition, at least among children, as monthly expenditures increased, so did the probability of remaining enrolled in Medicaid. These results are similar to the findings of Garret and Holahan (1999), which suggest that health status is an important determinant of maintaining Medicaid coverage upon leaving welfare.   Welfare leavers who also leave Medicaid may be healthier and use fewer medical services prior to welfare exit. However, if these individuals leave welfare and become uninsured, they may jeopardize their future health status if they lack ready access to care and delay needed services. There is also concern for children in particular, that lack of insurance may keep them from obtaining appropriate preventive services.   Another issue involves managed care capitation rates. If Medicaid programs experience disproportionately higher rates of disenrollment of healthy, low-cost welfare leavers, the casemix of the Medicaid population may be affected, especially as it relates to managed care plans. States may find that capitated payment rates for managed care need to be adjusted upward if healthy welfare leavers continue to disenroll from Medicaid at greater rates. Alternatively, states will need to implement strategies that enable them to maintain Medicaid coverage for  all  welfare leavers who are Medicaid-eligible.   ·  States are experiencing considerable turnover in their Medicaid caseloads . Turnover in Medicaid enrollment was especially high for adults, ranging from 26 to 40 percent across the study states. This is consistent with the finding of brief Medicaid spells for adults by Short et al. (1998) using SIPP data. The turnover rates for children were considerably lower, but there was still an enormous number of children who left the Medicaid program during 1995. Recent research has shown that many children who are uninsured were previously enrolled in Medicaid. Czajka (1999), using 1992-1994 SIPP data, found that nearly 40 percent of the new spells of uninsurance among children were preceded by Medicaid. He also found that just over half of children who left Medicaid were without insurance the next month, and more than half of these still appeared to be eligible. Finally, some state SCHIP programs are finding that many of the children they locate through their outreach efforts were previously enrolled in Medicaid (Shenkman et al. 1998).   Across the five study states, almost 1 million adults and nearly 1.5 million children were enrolled at some point during 1995, but had disenrolled by the end of the year. This level of turnover may well be contributing to the sustained problem of the uninsured. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 gave state Medicaid programs a new option to address the problem of turnover, at least for children. States can now elect to guarantee child Medicaid enrollment for up to 12 months (after each eligibility redetermination). It will be important to track the experience of states who choose this option to see what impact it has on enrollment and expenditure levels.   Congress and the states continue to be concerned about the high rate of uninsured, in spite of the robust economy and continued Medicaid expansions. The results from this study suggest that the dynamics of Medicaid enrollment may be at least part of the problem. If state Medicaid programs could reduce the number of children and parents leaving welfare without continuing on Medicaid, that would be a step in the right direction. In addition, greater attention needs to be given to inappropriate turnover among children and adults qualifying for Medicaid through the nonwelfare groups. Although states may continue to make policy changes to expand Medicaid coverage provisions in an effort to reduce the number of uninsured, these changes are not likely to be effective unless steps are also taken to improve individual continuity in Medicaid coverage.   (1)The “adult” group in Medicaid generally covers the parents and other caretaker relatives of children.   (2)Noncash eligibility groups include families eligible for cash assistance but not participating; families eligible for less than $10 in AFDC benefits (who would not get AFDC, but only Medicaid benefits); families who would qualify for AFDC if AFDC were as broad as federally allowed; families who would qualify for AFDC if child care costs were paid from earnings; persons who would be eligible if they were not in medical institutions; and those who were not lawful, permanent residents (who qualified only for emergency services).   (3)We did not expect the AFDC declines reported in the SMRF data to match exactly the declines reported in the AFDC program data for the same period. State Medicaid programs report that there is often some lag before AFDC disenrollments are reflected in Medicaid data. In addition, Medicaid data include retroactive adjustments for eligibility that do not occur with AFDC program data.   (4)Beginning in 1990, a class-action court decision ( Edwards  v.  Kizer ) required California to allow families discontinued under cash assistance to remain on Medicaid until their eligibility under other coverage groups was redetermined. At the beginning of 1995, California had a large backlog of families in this group, due to staff shortages and delays; by the end of 1995, this backlog had been considerably reduced.   (5)Because the Medicaid system in California is county-based and county identifiers are available in the SMRF data, we initially attempted to identify managed care and nonmanaged care counties. We found this definition unsatisfactory and the resulting sample of persons in nonmanaged care counties had expenditure distributions that were not similar enough to the fee-for-service samples from the other states to make us confident that our California sample was adequately defined.   (6)Monthly Medicaid expenditures were based on total Medicaid expenditures for calendar year 1995 adjusted for the number of months a person was enrolled in 1995.   (7)As an example, among adults in Michigan the first quintile of monthly expenditures ranged from less than one dollar to $20.78, the second from $20.83 to $46.58, the third from $46.63 to $97.08, the fourth from $97.11 to $264.33, and the fifth quintile ranged from $264.42 to $17,042.50. Among children the quintiles were: (1) less than one dollar to $9.58; (2) $9.60 to $19.00; (3) $19.08 to $33.00; (4) $33.08 to $65.83; and (5) $65.89 to $19,357.92.   (8)The SMRF 1995 enrollment data are both right- and left-censored. We do not have information on Medicaid enrollment prior to January 1995 and subsequent to December 1995. The length of enrollment data relate only to the duration of enrollment during 1995.

GX267-41-11037578	"MARYLAND HEALTH CARE COMMISSION UPDATE OF ACTIVITIES October 2001  DATA SYSTEMS & ANALYSIS Data Base Development Maryland Long-Term Care Survey The Commission released the 2000 Long Term Care Survey to 755 comprehensive care, assisted living, sub-acute, and adult data care facilities on October 15th. The number of facilities completing the survey has increased by over 60 percent from the 1999 survey. This increase is due to a dramatic jump in assisting living facilities and to the inclusion of approximately 41 subacute care facilities. The increase in assisted living facilities represents actual growth and better reporting at the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DHMH) Office of Health Care Quality (OHCQ). In previous years, the Commission surveyed sub-acute care facilities using a separate instrument.

The 2000 survey contains 74 questions, with most facilities answering approximately 50 questions. The staff has reduced much time-consuming data entry associated with the survey. Comprehensive care facilities will no longer complete patient and discharge-level components. The Commission will rely on the CMS Nursing Home Minimum Data Set for information on patient stays at comprehensive care facilities. CMS recently approved our continued use of MDS data through 2001. The Commission staff will provide long term care survey training at four National Guard sites around the state beginning on October 16th. The National Guard sites are equipped with large training rooms contain Internet-enabled workstations. The survey application was developed under contract to MetroData, Inc of Hunt Valley, Maryland. Metro Data will host the survey on a secure Internet web site.   Medical Care Data Base Development The Commission's data base contractor has completed initial edits on data submissions for the 2000 Medical Care Data Base. Total service volume has increased steadily from 53 to 70 million services in the last three years. A preliminary review of the information shows that about 83 percent of all services are provided in either preferred provider organization (PPO) or health maintenance organization (HMO) settings (as shown in Figure 1 below). This compares to 81 percent and 76 percent shares of services in 1999 and 1998 respectively. The percent of services attributable to HMOs increased from 28 percent to 31 percent from 1999 to 2000. During that period, enrollment in private HMOs declined by approximately 100,000 covered lives, suggesting that utilization increases, better reporting, and a shift away from capitation, are the principal possible causes for the increase.  Figure 1: Delivery System for Services Provided By Private Payers Indemnity PPO & Other Managed Care HMO/POS HMO Not Specified  2000 1999 1998  0  10  20  30  40  50  Cost and Quality Analysis A U.S. Census Bureau analysis of their most recent Current Population Survey (CPS) data indicates that the 1999-2000 two-year average uninsured rate for Maryland (all ages) is 10.4 percent. This translates to approximately 551,000 residents without health insurance coverage throughout 2000. Maryland's 10.4 percent rate is lower than rates reported in previous years because it reflects the impact of new verification questions that were added to the survey in 1999. These verification questions identify additional persons with insurance -- especially those with private coverage. The CPS results continue to underreport Medicaid and Medicare coverage, compared to administrative sources for the same information. In Maryland, the verification questions reduced the number lacking insurance by an average of 11 percent in the 1999 and 2000 data. The 1999-2000 rate is 2.4 percentage points below the comparable 1998-1999 average, a statistically significant decline. But the 1998 data omitted the name ""HealthChoice"" in asking about Medicaid coverage, so the 1998-1999 average is artificially higher to some degree. When staff compared the 10.4 percent to an equivalent average for 1997 and 2000, the result was 11.4 percent. The difference was not statistically significant using a 90 percent confidence interval.  2   (For these comparisons, the 1997 and 1998 Maryland rates were adjusted downward by 11 percent to approximate the likely rates had these surveys used the new verification questions.) Nationwide, the number and proportion without insurance declined from 1999 to 2000, from 14.3 to 14.0 percent. This decline was driven by an increase in the number and percentage of persons covered by employer-sponsored health insurance as employers competed for workers in a tight labor market by offering health insurance benefits to their employees and their dependents. Employer-sponsored coverage was also the primary cause of a reduction in the proportion of children lacking coverage, from 12.6 to 11.6 percent. The national uninsured rates for the poor and for those ages 18 to 24 -- two groups with the worst insurance rates -- also declined. Persons in households with incomes below $50,000 had improved rates of coverage, while the rate for those with incomes above $75,000 remained stable. But among persons with household incomes of $50,000 to $74,999, the proportion lacking insurance increased and this is the only sub-group examined which evidenced a growth in their uninsured rate from 1999 to 2000. The CPS estimates do not reflect the general economic downturn that has occurred throughout 2001. No hard evidence is yet available on the number of uninsured in recent months, although the MHCC/Gallup survey will provide more recent estimates. Even absent hard evidence, the number of uninsured will surely climb, as employer-sponsored health insurance is the primary source of coverage for the under-65 population. Special Studies and Analyses Project Hope will present a report on the use of prescription drugs by Maryland residents at the November Commission meeting. This analysis is the first to take advantage of the pharmacy information collected as part of the Medical Care Data Base. EDI Programs and Payer Compliance HIPAA Awareness The Commission is currently conducting a beta test of the software product Early View-Privacy. The North Carolina HealthCare Information and Communication Alliance (NCHICA) and MHCC are jointly developing the product under a memorandum of understanding that was presented to the Commission in September. The Commission has made a preliminary agreement with a fulfillment house to distribute the software for $10. per CD to Maryland licensed providers. EHNAC Accreditation Effective as of September 18th, the Electronic Healthcare Network Commission has agreed to authorize this Commission to act as an agent in reviewing electronic health network (EHN) selfassessments when annual revenue of the applicant is $1 million or less. EHNAC requested that MHCC provide a status update of progress in expanding EHNAC accreditation to small EHNs in six months. MHCC will act as an industry consultant to EHNs with less than $1 million in revenue, review a vendor's application, and make a recommendation to EHNAC. EHNAC will conduct an independent site review of the applicant prior to approval. Applicant fees will range from $500 to $900, depending upon revenue and the type of accreditation.  3   PERFORMANCE & BENEFITS Benefits and Analysis Comprehensive Standard Health Benefit Plan (CSHBP) A public hearing on proposed benefit changes to the CSHBP was held on September 24th. The Commission heard testimony and received written comments on coverage for treatment of morbid obesity, coverage for hearing aids for children, and concerns over adding more benefits to the CSHBP. The Commission will be voting on these issues and the staff recommendations set forth in the report that was presented at the September meeting. Any changes adopted by the Commission will be posted in the Maryland Register for the 45-day comment period. After final adoption, the changes will be promulgated into regulation and implemented on July 1, 2002. Study of the Small Group Market SB 457 of 2001 requires the Commission to contract with an independent consultant to: (1) conduct a study comparing the performance of Maryland's small group heath insurance market reform law to other states; (2) meet with and provide periodic updates to an independent advisory committee; and (3) present the results of the survey to the Commission so that the Commission can report the findings and recommendations of the study to the Governor and the General Assembly by the statutorily set due date of January 1, 2002. Commission staff issued an RFP for this requirement. Three proposals were received. The contract was awarded to Health Management Associates of Maryland (HMA). HMA has assembled the Independent Advisory Committee and will hold its initial meeting on Wednesday, October 17th, beginning at 1:00 p.m., at the Commission's offices. Evaluation of Mandated Health Insurance Services The Commission's consulting actuary, William M. Mercer, Inc., (Mercer) is in the process of preparing the mandated benefits report as to the fiscal, medical, and social impact on the CSHBP. This report is scheduled to be reviewed by the Commission at its November public meeting. Substantial Available and Affordable Coverage (SAAC) Legislation passed by the 2000 Maryland General Assembly extended the existing differential provisions of the SAAC product administered by the Health Services Cost Review Commission (HSCRC) through January 1, 2002. Regulations to conform the SAAC benefit plan to the CSHBP became effective with open enrollment periods beginning December 1, 2000. At the October 2000 meeting, the Commission approved regulations to further conform the SAAC benefit plan to reflect changes to the CSHBP that became effective July 1, 2001. During the current open enrollment period, the three eligible carriers are offering the improved CSHBP-type benefits. CareFirst has raised the issue of rates with the Maryland Insurance Administration (MIA) as well as MIA's authority in SAAC. The Insurance Commissioner held public hearings on these issues. Commissioner Larsen rejected CareFirst's proposed rate increase of over 50 percent. With CareFirst's elimination of FreeState from the SAAC market, additional SAAC differential decisions will be required by MIA, HSCRC, and CareFirst.  4   Legislative and Special Projects Nursing Home Report Card Chapter 382 (SB 740) of 1999 requires the Commission, in consultation with the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene and the Department of Aging, to develop a system to comparatively evaluate the quality of care and performance of nursing facilities. The initial version of the new web-based Nursing Home Performance Evaluation Guide is available through the Commission's website. Work continues with the vendor to update the website based on new information and feedback that the Commission has been receiving since the public release. An updated version of the Guide is expected to be released in January 2002. Hospital/Ambulatory Surgical Facility Report Card Chapter 657 (HB 705) of 1999 requires the Commission to develop similar performance reports on hospitals and ambulatory surgical facilities (ASFs). The required progress report has been forwarded to the General Assembly. The Commission has contracted with the Delmarva Foundation, in partnership with Abt Associates, to: (1) analyze hospital data to develop appropriate indicators for inclusion in the Hospital Performance Evaluation Guide, and (2) design and execute a consumer-oriented website for the Guide. The Commission has requested a delay until later this year because of the emphasis given to the release of the nursing home report card. The initial release of the Hospital/ASF Guide is planned for January 2002. The first iteration of the Guide will feature structural or descriptive information including a list of high volume hospital procedures by frequency and risk-adjusted length-of-stay. Also, risk-adjusted readmission rates based on DRGs (diagnosis related groups) will be included. Data for those facilities with less than 20 discharges in the reporting period will not be presented. State-Level Survey of the Uninsured A state-level survey of the uninsured has been developed by a team of staff from DHMH's Office of Planning, Development and Finance and DHMH's Office of Public Health Assessment in coordination with the Commission. The contract has been awarded to the Gallup Organization, which has conducted a number of similar surveys in other states. Gallup's subcontractor, REDA International, began conducting interviews in Maryland on October 5th. Reports based on the results on the survey are due in January 2002. Patient Safety Chapter 318 (HB 1274) of 2001 requires the Commission, in consultation with DHMH, to study the feasibility of developing a system for reducing preventable adverse medical events. A Maryland Patient Safety Steering Committee has been initiated by the Delmarva Foundation and, at this time, will serve as the Commission's sounding board for its activities related to patient safety. At its October meeting, representatives from New York and Massachusetts presented an overview of the patient safety programs in their respective states. Also, surveys have been forwarded to health care facilities, professional associations, state regulatory agencies, and licensing boards to obtain a baseline of the various patient safety initiatives currently underway in Maryland.  5   HMO Quality and Performance Final Distribution of 2000 HMO Publications Cumulative distribution beginning with release of each publication Comparing the Quality of Maryland HMOs: 2000 Consumer Guide (41,600 printed) Paper 9/20/09/30/01 32,700  Elec./web hits 9/20/00-9/30/01 Interactive version Visitor sessions = 2,316 Hits = 9,397 Hits = 45,578  .pdf version  2000 Comprehensive Performance Report: Commercial HMOs in Maryland (1,200 printed)(&300 unbound photocopies) = 1,500  761  Hits Total = 3,179  Policy Report on Maryland Commercial HMOs: The Quality of Managed Care (released Jan. 2001) (1,000 printed)  925  Hits (posted 2/01) Total = 3,997  Distribution of 2001 HMO Publications Cumulative distribution beginning with release of each publication Comparing the Quality of Maryland HMOs: 2001 Consumer Guide (30,000 printed) 9/28/01 - 9/30/01 Paper 15,441  Electronic Web Interactive version* Visitor sessions = N/A Hits = N/A Hits = 690  .pdf version  2001 Comprehensive Performance Report: Commercial HMOs in Maryland (700 printed) *  255  Hits Total = 74  The small number of sessions and hits (<50) recorded during this 2 day period, has been reported under the category of the 2000 Guide for Consumers.  Completion of 2001 Publications, Plan-Specific Reports, Mailings, Postings, etc. During September, work by contracted and Commission staff was completed on the three publications (HMO Guide for Consumers, HMO Guide for State Employees, and the Comprehensive Performance Report) to be released during open enrollment and the publications were printed. MEDSTAT, the report development contractor, created a ""plan-specific"" report for each of the 12 HMOs showing the plan's own score and the HMO average score for each CAHPS and HEDIS measure included in the consumer and comprehensive reports. The plan-specific reports were sent to each HEDIS coordinator a week before the HMO press conference, as required under the MHCC contract with MEDSTAT. Commission staff also sent embargoed copies of the publications to the CEO or local plan manager, HEDIS coordinator, legislative  6   contact, and each Maryland legislator. Commission staff worked with media relations staff at the University of Maryland to organize the HMO press conference. A 2001 edition of an Interactive HMO Guide for Consumers was created by Commission contractor, Glows in the Dark, and was online and linked to the Commission's web site by the September 28th press conference. By the same date, .pdf versions of each of the three reports, along with media advisories and press releases, were posted on the Commission's web site. 2001 HMO Publication Press Conference A press conference to release the State of Maryland's fifth annual HMO ""Report Card"" was held on September 28th at the University of Maryland Medical School. All three publications were spotlighted: the HMO Guide for Consumers, the Guide for State Employees, and the 2001 Comprehensive Performance Report. Drs. Wilson and Malouf; Barbara McLean; Andy Webber, Vice President of NCQA; DHMH Deputy Secretary Debbie Chang; and Maryland Delegates Hurson and Busch all spoke at the press conference. The Washington Post, Baltimore Sun, and Annapolis Capital all covered the event and ran stories. Metro Media, a regional radio news organization, also covered the event. 2001 Publication Distribution All public libraries within the State of Maryland have been targeted as one of the primary means of reaching consumers with hard copies of the HMO Guide for Consumers. Again this year, each of the 24 main libraries was asked how many copies of the Guide for Consumers and how many reference copies of the Comprehensive Performance Report it could use to distribute to the branches within its jurisdiction. The large number of each publication disseminated prior to the end of September reflects the bulk mailing to public libraries, mailing of advance, embargoed copies to CEOs or local plan managers, legislative, and HEDIS contacts at each health plan, and Maryland legislators, and distribution of about 100 copies at the press conference on September 28th. Staff continues the distribution process to academic libraries, health services academic programs, and departments at universities in Maryland, as well as to Chambers of Commerce, unions, and businesses. Distribution of the HMO Guide for State Employees occurs during October open enrollment. The Department of Budget and Management, Employee Benefits Division distributes that report along with all other information about health benefits. The Commission, which produces the annual report, keeps only a few copies on hand as examples. 2001 Performance Reporting (CAHPS Survey and Audit of HEDIS Data) On October 3rd, the Board of Public Works approved contracts for the 2002 and 2003 CAHPS survey of Maryland HMOs with Market Facts, and the 2001 contract with Healthcare Data.Com to conduct HEDIS audits of Maryland HMOs. With renewal options, each contract covers a threeyear period from October 2001 through September 2004. Maryland plans have been notified of the new contracts and a meeting has been scheduled with Market Facts to discuss the 2002 CAHPS survey protocol. 2000 Policy Report Development Weekly conference calls are resuming with MEDSTAT, the Commission's contractor for report development, as publication work moves to the 2001 Policy Report. That report will be released at the beginning of the upcoming legislative session.  7   HEALTH RESOURCES Certificate of Need (CON) During the past month, Commission staff has issued determinations of non-coverage by CON review requirements in response to a variety of actions proposed by, or on behalf of, regulated health care facilities. The Commission received a notice of proposed acquisition of an existing two-operating room freestanding ambulatory surgical facility in Mt. Airy by a subsidiary of Carroll County General Hospital. Also with regard to ambulatory surgical capacity during this period, staff issued determinations of non-coverage to four physicians or groups proposing to establish single operating rooms (or other, non-covered entities such as endoscopy centers) in Baltimore and Wicomico Counties. In other actions, staff issued determinations of non-coverage for two hospital capital projects for which the institutions involved will pledge not to seek a rate increase related to the project beyond the minimal amount permitted under the statute. For both of these projects, the Commission received the confirmation required from the HSCRC that ""the pledge"" was supported by the financial projections of both the hospital and the proposed project. Mercy Medical Center in Baltimore City will undertake a $76 million capital expenditure for an ambulatory services building, a new parking garage, an expansion of its Emergency Department, relocation and renovation of various other services, and purchase of equipment related to the new construction. Shady Grove Adventist Hospital in Rockville will expand and renovate two existing dedicated inpatient operating rooms, and will also add a second cardiac catheterization laboratory. In addition, during this period staff received, researched, and granted a waiver bed request from the Brightwood Center, in Baltimore County. As a follow-up to last month's Update on the resolution of the temporary delicensure status of the nursing homes with beds remaining out of service, staff issued affirmative determinations related to new temporary delicensure at two nursing homes (in Baltimore City and County), to a planned schedule for re-licensure of most of the delicensed beds at another Baltimore County nursing facility, and to a proposed relinquishing of 18 beds by an Anne Arundel Count facility. Staff also notified two Baltimore City nursing homes (one with 86 beds and another with 225 beds) that the authority to operate those beds is considered by the Commission to be abandoned, pursuant to the Commission's regulations at COMAR 10.24.01.03C(9). One nursing home, in St, Mary's County, documented that it had applied to relicense its 20 off-line beds before the deadline of August 5, 2001, and so received confirmation that its authority to operate those beds remained in good standing. Acute and Ambulatory Care Services Acute and Ambulatory Care Services staff released for public comment the Working Paper: Ambulatory Surgical Facilities and Services. This working paper was also posted on the Commission's website. Public comments are due on Friday, October 19, 2001. Staff attended a meeting of the Maryland chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics' Fetus and Newborn Committee on August 28th to update the committee on the draft State Health Plan for Facilities and Services chapter on acute inpatient obstetrics services. Staff attended the Racial and Cultural Disparities in Health Care and Health Outcomes in Baltimore on September 14th. This conference was the fourth annual ""New Directions in Perinatal Care"" sponsored by the Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene's Center for Maternal and Child Health.  8   On September 21st staff met with the DHMH Office of Health Care Quality (OHCQ) to discuss issues related to ambulatory surgery centers. At that meeting, plans were discussed to coordinate their licensure process with the Commission's ambulatory surgery survey. Staff met with representatives of several providers to discuss potential projects still in preliminary planning stages, including McCready, Shady Grove and Suburban hospitals and several ambulatory surgery providers. Staff is providing analytic support for several CON reviews. In addition to supporting a very busy CON staff, this work will contribute to the upcoming revisions of the State Health Plan for Facilities and Services chapters on acute inpatient services and ambulatory surgical services. On September 19th the Joint Work Group on Emergency Department Utilization met to continue discussion of the group's draft report and recommendations. A joint staff meeting with the HSCRC was held on October 4th to discuss several issues, including pending CON applications, pledge requests, the study of ED utilization, State Health Plan for Facilities and Services updates and the upcoming open heart surgery CON review. Long Term Care and Mental Health Services The Long Term Care section of the State Health Plan for Facilities and Services (COMAR 10.24.08), which was presented to the Commission at its September meeting, was released for informal public comment. Comments are due to the Commission by Friday, October 12, 2001. Comments will be reviewed, any necessary modifications will be made, and the section will be presented to the Commission at its November meeting as proposed permanent regulations. Staff is currently working on gathering and analyzing data on continuing care retirement communities. A FAX survey was sent to all CCRCs in Maryland to complete basic information for the time period of July 1, 2000-June 30, 2001. The State Health Plan for Facilities and Services: Alcoholism and Drug Abuse Intermediate Care Facility Treatment Services (COMAR 10.24.14), which was adopted as proposed permanent regulations at the September meeting, has been submitted to the Maryland Register for publication. The formal thirty-day public comment period is tentatively scheduled for November 2, 2001-December 3, 2001. Specialized Health Care Services Four applications were received in the CON review for an Open Heart Surgery Program in the Metropolitan Washington area from: Holy Cross Hospital (Montgomery County); Shady Grove Adventist Hospital (Montgomery County); Suburban Hospital (Montgomery County); and Southern Maryland Hospital Center (Prince George's County). In response to the request for public comments on the options paper, Organ Transplant Services: Regulatory Issues and Policy Options, the Commission received correspondence from Johns Hopkins Hospital, MedStar, and University of Maryland Hospital.  9"

TERM      Federal Disability Programs           DEFINITION      Federal disability programs, which provide services such as cash   support, health care coverage, and direct supportive services to eligible   people with disabilities, are typically limited to people under the age of   65.           DESCRIPTION      This entry contains information about the Americans with Disabilities   Act and nine major Federal programs targeted on disability which serve sizable   proportions of the non-elderly population aged 50 or over.           ENTRY      BACKGROUND      Federal disability programs serve people of all ages, but most   disability programs tend to be targeted either on children or on adults in   their working years, typically defined as from 18 through 64 years of age.   Because the risk of having a disability increases with age, many programs   serving the working-age population include large proportions of people in their   later working years of 50 through 64.      Billions of dollars are spent on Federal programs targeted on persons   with disabilities. In fiscal year 1989, $85 billion or 8 percent of all Federal   outlays was spent on disability programs targeted primarily on people under the   age of 65. (Burwell, 1990)      Nine major Federal disability programs which include sizable proportions   of people aged 50 to 64 are: (1) Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI),   (2) Supplemental Security Income (SSI), (3) Medicare, (4) Medicaid, (5)   Workers' Compensation, (6) Black Lung, (7) the VA Disability Compensation   Program, (8) the VA Pension Program, and (9) the VA Health Services   Program.      People may receive benefits from more than one program if they meet   eligibility requirements. Specific eligibility requirements typically vary,   depending on the purpose of the program. Eligibility requirements may change   over time, as the result of amendments to the law, new regulations, or court   decisions which affect eligibility criteria. Eligibility requirements consist   of factors related to disability and to other factors, such as age, income,   veterans' status, or work experience. It is suggested that the federal offices   administering specific disability programs be contacted directly for the most   up-to-date eligibility requirements.      UNDERLYING RESEARCH      The concept of disability in recent years has generally shifted from   diseases, conditions, and impairments to a focus on functional deficits caused   by these factors. Disability measures used in clinical settings or research   often underlie or are incorporated into how programs determine eligibility.   Disability is generally defined in research as significant difficulty with or   the inability to perform certain day-to-day functions, as a result of a health   condition or impairment. For adults, these functions often involve working or   keeping house for those aged 18 through 64 and carrying out daily tasks for   those aged 65 or over. (Weiner) Some commonly used factors in assessing   disability in research are:                  Sensory Impairments--Difficulty with or the inability to see, hear,     or speak.             Cognitive/Mental Impairments--The presence of or resulting     disabilities from cognitive/mental impairments (e.g. Alzheimer's disease,     mental illness, mental retardation).             Functioning of Specific Body Systems--Capacity of specific body     systems (e.g. climbing stairs, walking 3 blocks, lifting 10 lbs).             ADLs/IADLs--Difficulty with or the inability to perform without the     help of another person or a device the Activities of Daily Living (ADLs); which     typically include bathing, dressing, eating, toileting, getting in or out of a     bed or chair, and walking; and/or the Instrumental Activities of Daily Living     (IADLs), which generally include using the telephone, shopping, preparing     meals, keeping house, doing laundry, doing yard work, managing personal     finances, and managing medications.             Working--Inability to work, limitations in the amount or kind of     work, and/or ability to work only occasionally, irregularly, or     part-time.          THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT      PURPOSE : The intent of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)   of 1990 is to protect the civil rights of persons with disabilities. Equal   opportunity provisions pertain to employment, public accommodation,   transportation, State and local government services, and   telecommunications.      DEFINITION OF DISABILITY : Disability is present for purposes of   the ADA if an individual meets one of the following three tests: (a) there is a   physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the   major life activities; (b) there is a record of such an impairment; or (c) the   individual is regarded as having an impairment. The ADA definition is identical   to the one used in Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and in the   Fair Housing Amendments of 1988. (Adler)      MAJOR FEDERAL DISABILITY PROGRAMS      1. SOCIAL SECRUTIY DISABILITY INSURANCE      PURPOSE : Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) is the   primary social insurance program which protects workers from loss of income due   to disability. SSDI provides monthly cash benefits to disabled workers under   age 65 and to certain of their dependents. SSDI is intended for workers who   retire early, that is before age 65, because of a disability. (Committee on   Ways and Means)      HISTORY : The 1935 Social Security Act established the federal   social security system to provide old-age benefits for retired workers. The   SSDI program was enacted in 1956 to provide benefits to workers aged 50 through   64 years who retired early because of a disability. Subsequent amendments   widened SSDI coverage to include certain dependents and workers younger than   age 50. (Social Security Administration, August 1993)      ADMINISTRATION : SSDI is federally administered by the Social   Security Administration (SSA).      SCOPE : In November 1993, 4.5 million disabled Americans received   SSDI benefits: 3.7 million disabled workers under age 65, 143 thousand disabled   widows/widowers aged 50 to 59, and 655 thousand adults under age 65 who were   disabled in childhood. Half of disabled workers were between the ages of 50 and   64. In November 1993, the average monthly benefit was $625 for disabled   workers, $423 for disabled widows/widowers, and $397 for adults disabled in   childhood. SSDI benefits end at age 65 when workers who retired early due to   their disability are administratively converted to regular retirement benefits.   (Social Security Administration, August 1993; Social Security Administration   Winter 1993)      FUNDING : Funding is provided through the Disability Insurance   (SSDI) portion of the Social Security payroll tax on earnings. The payroll tax   is 7.65 percent of earnings, of which 5.6 percent is for the Old-Age and   Survivors Insurance (OASI) portion of Social Security, 0.6 percent for the SSDI   portion, and 1.45 percent for the Hospital Insurance (HI) portion of Medicare.   A matching 7.65 percent tax is borne by employers. Self-employed people have a   payroll tax of 15.3 percent, because they pay both the employer and employee   shares. As of 1994, the OASI and DI parts of the payroll tax are collected for   the first $60,000 of earnings, but there is no earnings limit for the HI   payroll tax. (Committee on Ways and Means)      ELIGIBILITY : In order to become eligible for SSDI, an individual   must first have enough Social Security covered work-quarters and secondly have   a severe impairment which makes him or her unable to do his or her previous   work or any other kind of substantial gainful activity which exists in the   national economy. There is no means-test.      Insured work quarters are credited annually for those years during which   an individual works, is covered by Social Security, and earns a specified   amount, which is adjusted upward each year. No more than four quarters can be   credited each year. In 1994, one quarter of coverage was credited for $620 of   earnings.      Workers must be fully insured and (except for persons who are blind or   who are younger than age 31) must have at least 20-quarters of coverage during   the 40-quarter period up to time of disability in order to receive SSDI.   Persons who are fully insured under Social Security have at least one quarter   of coverage for every four quarters up to the time of disability. Those who   have forty quarters are fully insured for life. Workers younger than age 31 and   individuals who are blind need fewer quarters, but a minimum of six quarters is   needed. (Committee on Ways and Means)      Disability for SSDI is defined as the inability to do any substantial   gainful activity (earn more than $500 per month for disabled and $810 for blind   persons) by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment   which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected   to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months. (Adler)      After it is established that the applicant has enough quarters and is   not earning more than the substantial gainful activity amount, a State   Disability Determination unit examines medical evidence to determine if the   applicant's mental or physical impairment is severe enough to have more than a   minimal effect on the applicant's ability to work. If so, the applicant's   medical condition is compared to the SSA Listing of over 100 Impairments (e.g.   loss of two limbs; fracture of vertebra with cord involvement, substantiated by   appropriate sensory and motor loss; vision of 20/200 or less after correction).   (Mather)      Applicants whose medical conditions are at least as severe as those in   the Listing are considered disabled. Applicants who are not found disabled at   this point are evaluated at two additional steps. First, a determination is   made as to whether or not the applicant could do his or her past work. This   decision is based on assessments of factors such as physical abilities (e.g.   strength, walking, standing) and/or mental abilities (e.g. the ability to carry   out and remember instructions, to respond appropriately in work settings).      For applicants who cannot perform past work, an assessment is done to   ascertain their ability to perform other work that exists in the national   economy. This assessment is based on the individual's functional capacity, age,   education, and work experience. In general, persons under age 50 are considered   to be able to adapt to new work situations. Jobs are said to exist in the   national economy if there are significant numbers with requirements that are   within the functional abilities and vocational qualifications of applicants.   Isolated jobs which exist only in very limited numbers in relatively few   locations outside of where the applicant lives are not regarded as ""work that   exists in the national economy"". (Social Security Administration 1986)      Dependent coverage and survivor benefits are offered through SSDI to   certain persons. Disabled individuals can receive SSDI in three ways: on their   own as disabled workers (described above), as widows or widowers (who are aged   50-59) of insured individuals, and as adults aged 18 through 64 who became   disabled in childhood whose parent(s) either receive SSDI, are Social Security   retirees, or who are deceased (but had been insured under Social Security).        The determination of disability for disabled widows/widowers is   identical to the one used for disabled workers and adults disabled in   childhood, although a somewhat different standard existed prior to 1991.   (Committee on Ways and Means)      Dependent coverage is also provided to certain non-disabled family   members (spouses who are either aged 60 or over or who care for one or more   entitled children under the age of 16). Survivor benefits are paid to   widow/widowers aged 60 or over, to widow/widowers of any age if he or she are   caring for a dependent child who is either under age 16 or disabled, to   unmarried children under age 18 (or 19 if in elementary or secondary school),   or to dependent parents aged 62 or more. (Committee on Ways and Means)      2. SUPPLEMENTAL SECURITY INCOME      PURPOSE : The Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program provides   monthly cash payments to low-income aged, blind, and disabled persons.   (Committee on Ways and Means)      HISTORY : The SSI program was established by the 1972 amendments   to the Social Security Act, which replaced earlier federal grants to the states   for old-age assistance, aid to the blind, and aid to the permanently disabled.   (Committee on Ways and Means)      ADMINISTRATION : The SSI program is administered by the Social   Security Administration.      SCOPE : In November 1993, 4.5 million blind or disabled persons   received SSI with monthly payments averaging about $390. Approximately 39   percent of those receiving SSI because of blindness or disability are aged 50   or over. (Burwell, Social Security Administration, August 1993; Social Security   Administration Winter 1993)      FUNDING : Funding comes from federal general revenues. Many states   have chosen the option to supplement federal SSI payments with their own funds.   (Burwell, 1990)      ELIGIBILITY : Unlike SSDI, people receiving SSI because of   blindness or disability have no work requirements, but must meet a financial   means-test. Persons under age 65 must meet both disability and financial   criteria, whereas those aged 65 or over need only meet the financial   means-test.      Persons may receive SSI payments either as individuals or as couples.   Both members of a couple must be aged, blind, or disabled and must meet the   financial means-test in order to collect payments. Besides these provisions for   couples, there are no dependent or survivor benefits in SSI. (Adler)      The determination of disability for adults is identical to the one used   in the SSDI program. For children under age 18, the determination of disability   is based on a standard of comparable severity.      The SSI means-test depends on income and resources. There are   complicated ways of counting various types of income and resources; but, in   general, the maximum monthly income in 1994 for individuals applying for SSI   was $454 and $672 for couples if they receive only Social Security and $953 for   individuals and $1,389 for couples if their income is only from wages.   Countable resources are limited to $2,000 for individuals and $3,000 for   couples. (Committee on Ways and Means)      3. MEDICARE      PURPOSE : Medicare, enacted in 1965, provides health insurance   coverage to aged (aged 65 or over) and disabled persons insured under Social   Security. Medicare coverage has two parts. Part A, or Hospital Insurance (HI),   is subject to deductibles and limits, covers inpatient hospital care, provides   skilled nursing and/or rehabilitative post-hospital care in a skilled-nursing   facility, home health care, and hospice care. Part B or Supplementary Medical   Insurance (SMI), which has monthly premiums and deductibles, covers physician   services, outpatient services from certain other medical providers, approved   medical equipment and supplies, and drugs which cannot be self-administered.   Because HI is financed through the Social security payroll tax, HI is   automatically extended to eligible individuals. SMI is a voluntary program   available only by paying monthly premiums. (Burwell, 1990; Committee on Ways   and Means)      HISTORY : Medicare and Medicaid were established by the Social   Security Amendments of 1965. Medicare was enacted to provide health insurance   to the population aged 65 or over. As part of the 1972 amendments to the Social   Security Act, Medicare was extended, under certain circumstances, to persons   receiving SSDI and to those with kidney disease. (Social Security   Administration, August 1993)      ADMINISTRATION : The Medicare program is federally administered by   the Health Care Financing Administration in the Department of Health and Human   Services.      SCOPE : In 1991, 31.5 million aged, 3.4 million disabled persons   under age 65, and 72 thousand persons with End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) were   eligible for Medicare. There were $110.9 billion in Medicare payments in 1991,   of which $12.5 billion were for those under 65 receiving SSDI. (Social Security   Administration, Winter 1993) In July 1993, approximately 2.5 million disabled   individuals between the ages of 45 and 64 were enrolled in Medicare.   (Lazenby)      FUNDING : Funding for the HI portion of Medicare comes from the   Hospital Insurance (HI) portion of the Social Security payroll tax and is   automatically deposited in the Medicare Trust Fund. In 1994, the HI payroll tax   is was 1.45 percent of earnings for employees and 1.45 percent for employers.   Self-employed persons were taxed 2.9 percent of payroll for HI. The SMI part of   Medicare is financed by a combination of monthly premiums, which cover about 25   percent of program expenditures, and federal general revenues, which cover the   remaining 75 percent. In 1994, the monthly SMI premium was $41.10. (Committee   on Ways and Means)      ELIGIBILITY : Persons aged 65 or over who are entitled to Social   Security are also enrolled in Medicare. There are two ways that persons under   age 65 can be eligible for Medicare: (1) SSDI beneficiaries are enrolled in   Medicare 24 months after receiving SSDI benefits and (2) persons in the   End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) program are enrolled in Medicare after 3 months.   Persons in the ESRD portion of Medicare must be medically determined to have   end-stage renal disease (that stage of kidney impairment that appears   irreversible and permanent and requires a regular course of dialysis or kidney   transplantation to maintain life) and either be insured themselves through   Social Security or be the spouse or dependent child of an insured   worker/retiree. Persons on Medicare who are eligible because of SSDI range in   age from 20 through 64, while those eligible because of ESRD patients can be   any age from infancy through age 64. (Adler)      4. MEDICAID      PURPOSE : Medicaid is a joint federal and state program that pays   for the health care of low-income, as well as medically indigent   individuals.      HISTORY : Medicaid was established, along with Medicare, by the   Social Security Amendments of 1965. Medicaid was enacted to pay for the medical   care of certain needy persons. Medicaid combined and replaced earlier programs,   which provided medical payments for needy individuals. (Committee on National   Statistics; Social Security Administration, August 1993)      ADMINISTRATION : Medicaid is jointly administered by the   individual states and territories along with the federal Health Care Financing   Administration, located in the Department of Health and Human Services.   (Burwell, 1990)      SCOPE : During fiscal year 1992, $91.3 billion in Medicaid   payments were made on behalf of 30.2 million persons. Nearly 4.4 million   disabled or blind persons accounted for $34 billion of total Medicaid payments.   That is, the nearly 15 percent of Medicaid recipients who were blind or   disabled accounted for 37 percent of payments. Approximately 3.3 million of the   4.4 million persons received SSI and 500 thousand did not. They accounted for   $20.2 billion and $13.8 billion in Medicaid payments, respectively. Payments   for nursing facility services (nursing homes) totaled $21.7 billion or 24   percent of all Medicaid payments, although only 1.4 million persons received   these services. (Burwell, 1994)      FUNDING : Medicaid is jointly funded by the federal and state   governments. Federal dollars come from federal general revenues. The federal   match rate is derived annually for each state by comparing the states's average   per capita income to national figures. The federal share of total Medicaid   spending was 57.4 percent in 1992. By law, this share can range from 50 percent   to 83 percent. During 1992, the federal match rate was 50 percent for twelve   states and the District of Columbia. Mississippi had the highest federal match   rate at 79.99 percent. (Congressional Research Service; Social Security   Administration, Winter 1993)      SERVICES : Medicaid covers both required and optional services.   Some required services include inpatient hospital services and physician   services. Optional services include intermediate care facilities for the   mentally retarded, prescription drugs and personal care. In addition, services   provided under the Home and Community-based Care waivers may include personal   care services, chore services, respite care services, and adult day care.   States may also set limits on the amount, duration, and/or scope of mandated   and optional services (e.g. a limit on the number of hospital days) within   broad federal guidelines. (Burwell, 1990)      Three Medicaid services which are important for people with disabilities   are: (1) nursing facilities (i.e. nursing homes); (2) home health services;   and, (3) personal care services. Nursing facilities are mandatory for people   aged 21 or over who receive cash payments from SSI or AFDC, but are optional   services for everyone else. Home health services are, in effect, mandatory for   the same Medicaid recipients for whom nursing facility services are provided.   Personal care services are provided in a person's home by a qualified person   under the guidance of a registered nurse. These services can include bathing,   dressing, ambulation, feeding, grooming, and meal preparation, cleaning,   laundry, and shopping. Personal care services may be provided under the Home   and Community-based Care waivers or as an other optional medical services.   (Health Care Financing Administration, Congressional Research Service)      ELIGIBILITY : Medicaid coverage is automatically extended to   persons receiving cash assistance under the Aid to Families with Dependent   Children (AFDC) and generally to those who receive SSI. Medicaid coverage is   also mandatory for many pregnant women and children near the poverty level.   Many of those eligible for Medicaid for reasons of disability (or blindness)   also receive SSI cash assistance. However, there are a number of optional state   programs through which ill or disabled persons who do not get SSI can receive   Medicaid. (Burwell, 1990; Congressional Research Service)      Eligibility for Medicaid is complex and varies from state to state.   People with comparable illnesses, disabilities, and incomes may be eligible for   Medicaid in one state, but not in another.      Receipt of SSI guarantees eligibility for Medicaid in most states.   (Burwell, 1990) As of December 1992, twelve states had exercised an authority   to impose more restrictive eligibility criteria for Medicaid than SSI uses.   These twelve states were Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Minnesota,   Missouri, New Hampshire, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, and   Virginia. (Congressional Research Service)      These twelve states had to permit individuals to deduct their medical   expenses from their incomes in determining eligibility. Under this system,   known as ""spend down"", if an otherwise eligible applicant's income exceeded the   state's income standard for Medicaid eligibility, the applicant would become   eligible after incurring sufficient medical expenses to reduce his or her   income to below the standard. States must extend Medicaid eligibility to   certain groups of disabled people who may not actually receive SSI, but who are   deemed to meet SSI income and resource standards. (Congressional Research   Service, Committee on Ways and Means)      States have a variety of other means by which they can extend Medicaid   to persons with disabilities who do not receive SSI. First, states have the   option to provide Medicaid coverage to poor disabled persons. As of January   1992, eight states (Florida, Hawaii, Maine, Massachusetts, Nebraska, New   Jersey, Pennsylvania, South Carolina) and the District of Columbia took the   option of providing Medicaid coverage to elderly or disabled poor individuals   whose incomes are below the federal poverty standard and whose resources are   below the SSI standard. (Congressional Research Service) For example, in 1992,   individuals who lived alone were under the federal poverty standard if their   annual incomes were under $6,810, while the maximum SSI standard (for those   receiving income only from Social Security) was $5,448 per year.      Secondly, among other options, states can elect to establish a medically   needy program, under which disabled individuals whose income exceeds SSI   standards but who need assistance with medical expenses can obtain eligibility   by ""spending down"". By April 1992, the medically needy option was exercised by   Arkansas, California, Connecticut, the District of Columbia, Georgia, Hawaii,   Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts,   Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York,   North Carolina, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island,   South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West   Virginia, and Wisconsin. (Congressional Research Service)      In addition, the home and community-based care waiver program has been   elected in every state, except Arizona whose entire Medicaid program operates   under a demonstration waiver. The intent of this program is to keep disabled   persons in the community rather than in institutions when possible.   Specifically, states can provide home and community-based services not   otherwise included in their State Medicaid plans to disabled persons living in   the community who would otherwise reside in institutions. (Congressional   Research Service)      5. WORKERS' COMPENSATION      PURPOSE : Workers' Compensation provides cash payments and medical   and rehabilitation services to workers (or their survivors) who have   disabilities or who have died, because of accidents on the job or occupational   diseases. (Hagen)      HISTORY : The first workers' compensation law was enacted in 1908.   Most states had Workers' Compensation programs in 1920. By 1949, all states had   Workers' Compensation programs. (Social Security Administration, August   1993)      ADMINISTRATION : There are 53 separate Workers' Compensation   programs administered by the states, the District of Columbia, the Virgin   Islands, and Puerto Rico. The Departments of Labor within each state typically   administer Workers' Compensation. In addition, the Department of Labor in the   federal government administers Workers' Compensation programs for Federal Civil   Servants, Longshore and Harbor Workers, and the Black Lung program. (Social   Security Administration, August 1993)      SCOPE : In 1991, $42.2 billion in benefits were paid.   Approximately 60 percent of benefits provided cash payments and 40 percent of   benefits paid for medical and rehabilitation services. Weekly cash payments for   workers vary by state, but are typically limited to no more than two-thirds of   a state's average weekly wage. There are no national figures on the number of   people receiving Workers' Compensation benefits. (Social Security   Administration, Winter 1993)      FUNDING : Premiums from employers account for nearly all Workers'   Compensation funds. These premiums average about 2 percent of payroll. Many   employers have private insurance, some large employers are self-insured, and   others operate in states which have state funds allotted for Workers'   Compensation. In some instances, modest amounts are paid by employees for   medical benefits. Workers' Compensation coverage for most jobs in private   industry is compulsory. Nationwide, about 88 percent of the labor force is   covered by Workers' Compensation. (Social Security Administration, August   1993)      ELIGIBILITY : Disabilities or death can be due to either   workrelated injuries or occupational diseases, the latter of which are often   difficult to establish. Employer negligence is not an issue. In general,   Workers Compensation benefits are not paid if the cause of the injury was   intoxication of the worker, willful misconduct, or gross negligence.      Unlike the SSDI and SSI programs, where eligibility is limited to those   with permanent total disabilities, worker's compensation can provide for three   types of disability: permanent total disability, temporary total disability,   and permanent partial disability. Temporary total disabilities are those in   which a worker is unable to work, but is expected to fully recover. Most cases   involve temporary total disability.      Benefits in these instances are typically paid until the person is   recovered, but there are limits in some States. In most cases, permanent   partial disabilities are limited to injuries in which disabilities are due   either due to the loss of a part of the body (e.g. limb, eye) or to a   generalized part of the body (e.g. head, back, nervous system). (Hagen, Social   Security Administration, August 1993)      6. BLACK LUNG      PURPOSE : Black Lung benefits are paid to coal miners who are   totally disabled as a result of pneumoconiosis (a disease of the lungs caused   by the habitual inhalation of irritant mineral or metallic particles), to   widows of miners who died from Black Lung disease, and to their dependents.   (Burwell, 1990)      HISTORY : The Black Lung program was established by the Federal   Coal Mine Health Safety Act of 1969. (Social Security Administration, August   1993)      ADMINISTRATION : The Black Lung program is administered by the   Department of Labor.      SCOPE : About 182 thousand persons were paid Black Lung benefits   in December 1992. Only 36 thousand were coal miners, the remainder were widows   (109 thousand) or dependents (37 thousand). Over 99 percent of people receiving   Black Lung benefits are aged 45 or over. (Burwell, 1990; Social Security   Administration, Winter 1993)      FUNDING : The Black Lung program is funded by an excise tax on   coal, which is the lesser of $1 per ton of coal from underground mines (50   cents from surface mines) or 4 percent of the coal's selling price. (Social   Security Administration, Winter 1993)      ELIGIBILITY : A miner must meet three general conditions: (1) must   have (or, if deceased, have had) pneumoconiosis; (2) must be totally disabled   by the disease (or have been totally disabled at the time of death); and (3)   the pneumoconiosis must have arisen out of coal mine employment. (Burwell,   1990)      7. VA DISABILITY COMPENSATION PROGRAM      PURPOSE : The VA Disability Compensation program provides cash   assistance to veterans with service-connected disabilities, that is, they   incurred illness or injury while in service. Employment is not a factor:   veterans can be employed and still receive benefits. (Seavey)      HISTORY : Veterans' health, disability, and pension programs have   grown out of a long history of benefits provided to veterans. Disability   pensions were provided to veterans of the Revolutionary War by the Continental   Congress. In 1789, Congress enacted a veterans' pension program. (Social   Security Administration, August 1993)      ADMINISTRATION : The VA Disability Compensation program is   administered by the Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA).      SCOPE : In fiscal year 1992, 2.2 million veterans with   serviceconnected disabilities and survivors of 314 thousand deceased veterans   received $12.6 billion through this program. (Committee on Ways and Means) The   largest share of veterans receiving benefits for service-connected disabilities   served in World War II (36.9 percent). Another 30.8 percent served during the   Vietnam Era. Altogether, approximately 43 percent of veterans with a   service-connected disability were aged 65 or over in fiscal year 1992.   (Department of Veterans' Affairs, Social Security Administration, Winter   1993)      FUNDING : Funding is provided from federal general revenues.   (Burwell, 1990)      ELIGIBILITY : An individual must have a partial or total   impairment by injury or disease incurred or aggravated during military service.   A Veterans' Affairs (VA) Rating Board employs criteria developed by the DVA to   rate the extent of a disability. Specifically, the illness, injury, or disease   manifestations must arise during service, but time can elapse. Dishonorably   discharged veterans are not eligible. While the SSDI, SSI, and Black Lung   programs have an ""all or nothing disability determination process"" wherein a   person either is or is not determined to receive benefits, a range or band of   eligibility exists in the VA Disability Compensation program. This range is the   disability ratings system, which goes from 0 to 100 percent and is based on the   presumed reduction in income caused by the disability.      Dependent allowances and survivor benefits are paid under certain   circumstances. In general, dependent allowances are paid to veterans with at   least a 30 percent service-connected disability. Survivor benefits are paid if   the veteran was receiving or was entitled to receive benefits at the time of   death and the service-connected disability was continuously rated totally   disabling for at least 10 years or 5 years after discharge. Survivors are   limited to spouses (who have been married to the veteran for at least one year   or who have had a child with the veteran), children under age 18, disabled, or   students, and parents in certain cases. (Seavey; Burwell, 1990)      8. VA DISABILITY PENSION PROGRAM      PURPOSE : The VA Disability Pension programs pays cash benefits to   elderly low-income war veterans who have become permanently and totally   disabled from non-service-connected causes. This program is similar to SSDI in   that there are employability standards. (Seavey)      HISTORY : Veterans' health, disability, and pension programs have   grown out of a long history of benefits provided to veterans. Disability   pensions were provided to veterans of the Revolutionary War by the Continental   Congress. In 1789, Congress enacted a veterans' pension program. (Social   Security Administration, August 1993)      ADMINISTRATION : The VA Disability Compensation program is   administered by the Department of Veterans' Affairs.      SCOPE : In fiscal year 1989, this program served 1.1 million   living and deceased veterans (with survivors) at a cost of $3.9 billion.   (Committee on Ways and Means) About 72 percent of veterans in this program were   aged 65 or over in 1992. (Social Security Administration, Winter 1993)      FUNDING : Funding is provided from federal general revenues.   (Burwell, 1990)      ELIGIBILITY : An individual must have an injury or disease   sustained outside of military service rendering a veteran permanently and   totally impaired. Impairment is determined based on the veteran's ability to   function at work and at home. Persons with dishonorable discharges are not   eligible. Low-income criteria are based on income and family size. During   December 1991, income limits were $7,397 for a veteran living alone and $9,689   for a veteran living with one other person. (Committee on Ways and Means)   Benefits are paid to surviving spouses and children if the veteran served in   specified wartime periods. Survivors must meet the same conditions as for the   DVA Disability Compensation program. (Seavey; Burwell, 1990)      9. VETERANS' HEALTH SERVICES      PURPOSE : The Veterans' Health Services programs, administered by   the DVA, consists of a nationwide health care network which provides medical   care to eligible veterans. Services must be provided to veterans with a   service-connected disability, former prisoners of war, and those with   low-incomes. Other veterans are served on a space available basis. Services   provided include hospital care, nursing home care, and outpatient care,   including rehabilitation. Care is provided through DVA facilities. However,   nursing home care can be provided for a limited time in a non-DVA facility   under certain circumstances. (Social Security Administration, August 1993)      HISTORY : Veterans' health, disability, and pension programs have   grown out of a long history of benefits provided to veterans. Disability   pensions were provided to veterans of the Revolutionary War by the Continental   Congress. In 1789, Congress enacted a veterans' pension program. (Social   Security Administration, August 1993)      ADMINISTRATION : The Veterans' Health Services programs are   administered federally by the Department of Veterans' Affairs. (Social Security   Administration, August 1993)      SCOPE : During fiscal year 1993, net outlays for the entire   Veterans' Health Services program was $14.8 billion. Approximately 910 thousand   patients were discharged from DVA hospitals, of whom 31 percent were under age   50, 27 percent were between 50 and 64 years of age, and the remaining 42   percent were aged 65 or older. (Department of Veterans' Affairs)      FUNDING : Funding is provided from Federal general revenues.   (Social Security Administration, August 1993)      ELIGIBLITY : VA hospitals and nursing homes must serve certain   groups and serve others if space is available. The mandatory groups served   include persons: rated as ""service-connected; retired from active duty for a   disability incurred or aggravated while in military service; receiving a VA   pension; eligible for Medicaid; who were former prisoners of war; who need care   for a condition possibly related to exposure to dioxin or other toxic   substances; who need care for a condition possibly related to exposure to   radiation from nuclear tests or in the American occupation of Japan; or who are   veterans of the Spanish-American War, the Mexican Border Period, or World War   I. Care on a space-available basis is provided to low income veterans, whose   disabilities are not service-connected. Outpatient care is also contingent on a   number of factors. Outpatient care for any condition is available to veterans   who have a service-connected disability rating of 50 percent or more, former   prisoners of war, or veterans of World War I. Such care is also available for   the treatment of service-connected disabilities or for care which would prevent   a hospital stay.

Introduction: Internal Scan              II. Priority           Issue Areas              III. Actions           and Results                           I.                           INTRODUCTION:         INTERNAL SCAN          The Insurance Department is responsible         for supervising and regulating insurance business in New York State. The         Department's mission is to ensure the continued sound and prudent conduct of         insurers' financial operations; provide fair, timely and equitable fulfillment         of insurer obligations; protect policyholders from financially impaired or         insolvent insurers; eliminate fraud, other criminal abuse and unethical conduct         in the industry; and foster growth of the insurance industry in the         State.          The State's aging population will greatly         impact on the Insurance Department's programs and policies with respect to         automobile, property, life and health insurance and consumer protection and         education. Since the trend of a healthier, more active senior population is         expected to continue, there should be more focus on distribution and innovation         in product offerings to better serve the needs of an expanding and         multi-cultural senior population. Some aspects under consideration         include:          Automobile Insurance:  Will seniors         in 2015 be driving in daytime or off-peak hours? Will they be taking shorter,         less frequent trips? Will they be subject to re-testing in order to renew their         drivers' licenses? Are they more or less likely to have accidents because they         are driving fewer miles? What is the impact on auto premiums for         seniors?          Homeowners Insurance:  Will seniors         be more likely to own or rent in 2015? Will they live alone? Will the trend         toward seasonal residence continue? Do they fully understand the coverages and         exclusions that can apply in shoreline communities?          Life Insurance:  People who are         living longer need to purchase products that will enable them to accumulate         money (invest) and to liquidate or annuitize that sum of money over their         lifetimes so they will not outlive their funds. Pure protection life insurance         (such as term life insurance) is geared more to younger people with dependents         to support. The challenge to the industry in 2015 will be to refine life         insurance products to meet these changing needs, while at the same time not         leaving out others who need pure protection.          Health Insurance:  As the population         ages, there will be more interest in long-term care insurance, Medicare         supplement policies and Medicare HMOs. Continuing Care Retirement Communities         (CCRCs) (which are regulated by the Insurance Department along with the         Department of Health and Office for the Aging) will also play a more         significant role by the year 2015. In addition, the financial stability of some         health insurers could be at risk should premiums fail to keep up with the         rising claims of an aging policyholder base.          Consumer Protection and Education:          As new products are introduced in the marketplace there will be an increased         demand for consumer education and protection against fraud and         abuse.          Regulators will need to evaluate the         implications of the following:          Changing Methods of Distribution:          There may be a decline in the role of agents for certain products and an         increase of the Internet as a distribution channel of insurance.          New Products:  The insurance         community (insurers, agents and regulators) attitudes and practices toward the         senior market need to be redirected in order to identify this market and its         emerging lifestyle changes and evolving needs.          Information Technology:  Baby         boomers reaching retirement age may be more likely to use the Internet for         research and pricing of insurance products than the current senior population         as many are already familiar with computers and have access to the web.         Regulators need to recognize the role of e-business in product administration,         distribution and information sharing.          For each line of insurance, the Department         must ensure that new products developed for the aging population and others are         easily understandable and provide meaningful coverage. The Department will         continue to consider new and innovative means of educating aging citizens about         the products most useful to them. The Department has over the past decade         initiated numerous policies and procedures designed with the senior market in         mind.          The following reflects departmental         initiatives to address demographic changes:          Long-term Care Insurance:  In 1993,         the New York State Partnership for Long-term Care was initiated in New York         State to encourage more people to purchase long-term care insurance policies.         The Partnership Program allows those persons who purchase Partnership approved         long-term care policies to qualify for Medicaid without spending down their         assets once the benefits under the long-term care policy are         exhausted.          Medicare Supplement Insurance (aka         Medigap insurance):  Medicare supplement insurance is designed to supplement         Medicare's benefits by paying some of the amounts that Medicare does not cover.         A Medicare beneficiary cannot be turned down or charged higher premiums because         of poor health. All standard Medicare supplement policies are guaranteed         renewable. The Department provides information and assistance to senior         citizens concerning Medicare supplement insurance and other coverages available         to the elderly, such as long-term care insurance.          Continuing Care Retirement Communities         (CCRC):  CCRCs provide living arrangements, including long-term care         commitments, to seniors who purchase living units within the community. The         Department is responsible for: reviewing the contract and disclosure documents         provided to residents as well as an initial determination of the financial         feasibility of a proposed project; reviewing the rating structure of a         community; assessing the adequacy of reserves; and conducting periodic on-site         examinations of the financial condition of CCRCs.          New Assisted Living Product:  The         number of persons residing at assisted living care facilities has dramatically         increased in the 1990s. The Department has recently approved an ""Assisted         Living Care Coverage Endorsement."" This optional endorsement extends coverage         in the Homeowners policy to provide limited coverage for personal property,         additional living expenses and liability to persons who reside in such         facilities and are related to an insured.          Senior Discounts on Homeowners         Insurance:  Some insurers offer discounts on home insurance to retirees or         senior citizens. The Department has approved discounts when the homeowner is 55         years or older and the insured location is not unoccupied for an extended         period of time.            Senior Discounts on Automobile         Insurance:  Premium discounts for the mature driver are available from some         insurers. There are several different age classifications, within which         premiums generally tend to decrease as a person matures. However, some insurers         also charge higher premiums for higher-age categories, as insurer statistics         indicate that beyond a certain age the claims experience as a group worsens.         Many senior citizens or retirees may also benefit from those insurers that vary         their prices by the number of miles a car is driven each year, since they may         drive fewer miles than the average insured.          Viatical Settlement Companies/Senior         Settlement Companies/Life Settlement Companies:  Viatical settlements refer         to the selling of life insurance policies by the insured party to a third         party. The insured owner must be terminally ill (death anticipated within 24         months). The Department provides protections for seniors who decide to sell         such policies. Senior or life settlement companies have begun to arise. These         companies purchase policies of individuals who are not necessarily terminally         ill. These types of settlements currently are not regulated by the Department.         Consequently, seniors may become particularly vulnerable to fraud associated         with this type of business.          HIICAP:  The Department's consumer         services staff are members of the Health Insurance Information, Counseling and         Assistance Program (HIICAP) consortium. This group is comprised of         representatives from the Medicare servicing carriers, Medicare contractors, New         York State Office for the Aging (NYSOFA), the Elderly Pharmaceutical Insurance         Coverage (EPIC), State Department of Health, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid         Services, and IPRO (Island Peer Review Organization, a peer review organization         for Medicare). The consortium meets annually to determine the training needs         for HIICAP counselor and volunteers and whether there are changes at the         Federal and state levels that might impact the insurance concerns of the aging.                   Department staff assists in developing the         Training Manual for the program, conducting training, and responding to         technical insurance questions.          Consumer Education and Outreach:          The Department routinely sends Consumer Services Bureau staff to senior centers         to explain insurance issues and answer questions. The Frauds Bureau is gearing         up to educate the public in the area of no-fault insurance fraud through a         series of presentations in public and private venues. Emphasis will be placed         on working with senior groups.          Web Site:  The Department's Web site         provides senior citizens and others with access to comprehensive, up-to-date         information on links to insurance companies, online complaint filings, disaster         assistance, the Healthy New York program, Holocaust Victims resources,         instructions on how to report frauds, tips on how to avoid becoming a victim.         Publications on long-term care insurance and Medicare supplement coverage are         also available on our Web site and through our toll-free publications telephone         line. The Web site also has an interactive feature that allows visitors to have         an online ""conversation"" with a NetRep.          II.                           PRIORITY         ISSUE AREAS          Priority Issue #1: Promote high quality health insurance         products and ensure sound financial and market conduct operations.          Health insurance is a key issue facing the         aging population. The demands for long-term care (LTC) insurance and continuing         care retirement communities (CCRC) products will increase dramatically over the         next five to ten years. Effective and efficient planning is essential to         accommodate the need for meaningful health insurance coverage and to ensure the         financial solvency and market conduct of insurers providing such         coverage.          Priority Issue #2: Increase consumer education and         protection programs.          Education through outreach programs         provides opportunities for seniors and others to learn about a multitude of         existing and new insurance products such as long-term care, Medicare         supplement, viatical settlements, homeowners and automobile discount programs.         Many of these products are complex and not easily understood.          Moreover, older citizens are frequent         victims of fraud that can result in major financial, emotional and         psychological hardship. This segment of the population is particularly         vulnerable to fraud associated with cash settlement of life insurance policies         prior to death to pay for care needs (viatical settlements), ""staged""         automobile accidents and sale of fraudulent investment instruments. Education         and prevention initiatives can help safeguard seniors from fraud, criminal         abuse and other unethical conduct.          Priority Issue #3: Increase the use of information         technology to benefit senior consumers and to bridge the ""digital divide.""                By 2015, a greater number of seniors will         have access to the Internet to research and purchase insurance products online.         It is important that we provide insurance information geared toward seniors on         our Web site. We should also be working with other agencies to help bridge the         ""digital         divide"" that separate computer users from non-users.          III.                  ACTIONS         AND RESULTS          Priority Issue #1: Promote high quality         health insurance products and ensure sound financial and market conduct         operations.            Action:  Amend Section 3111 of the         Insurance Law to require third party notification, such as spouse or children,         for long-term care policies regarding premiums due. Currently, this provision         applies to Medicare supplement and other types of insurance but not to         long-term care.          Result:  The lapse rate for         long-term care policies will decrease as a result of such legislation. As time         passes some seniors may forget to pay their premium. When these policies lapse,         it is virtually impossible to have them reinstated if the insured is in poor         health.          Action:  Amend the Insurance Law         Section 3216(c)(10) to extend the ""free look"" period after the purchase of         long-term care policies from 10 to 30 days to provide consumers sufficient time         to evaluate their policies. Currently, this is required for Medicare supplement         policies.          Result:  The 30-day ""free look""         provision affords policyholders additional time to review and decide whether to         keep the policy or return it for a full refund. Ten days is too short a period         in which to review an insurance contract and make informed         decisions.          Action:  Encourage more         senior-oriented insurance products that will meet the needs of an aging         population. For example, life insurance policies might combine a long-term care         element with a life insurance component, while continuing care retirement         communities could offer contracts that wrap around existing long-term care         policies.          Result:  New York seniors would gain         increased access to flexible, comprehensive insurance products that fit their         needs.          Action:  Foster the growth of         financially stable CCRCs for New York seniors.          Result:  Currently, only five CCRCs         operate in New York State. As the aged population increases, these types of         facilities would provide key health insurance and residential services to         seniors who wish to remain in the State.          Priority Issue #2: Increase consumer         education and protection programs.          Action:  Establish, in conjunction         with the Office for the Aging, a Seniors Advisory Council comprised of         representatives from AARP and other senior groups to advise the Department         regarding the insurance needs of New York's seniors.          Result:  A Seniors Advisory Council         would provide valuable information on insurance issues facing that community         and provide feedback on Department initiatives directed towards         seniors.          Actions:  Expand educational         outreach and marketing programs to include:                     Increased attendance and/or         presentations at public events that attract the elderly, such as county fairs,         meetings and conventions of senior citizens groups, etc.                              Increased advertisements that attract         an elderly audience.                              Develop/update multi-lingual pamphlets         and guides on senior issues, formatted for ease of readability and         comprehension.                              Develop a Mobile Information Center to         disseminate information to seniors. A van would travel throughout the State         with trained staff to answer insurance questions and solve         problems.                              Increase training to HIICAP volunteers         and NYSOFA staff.                   Result:  Ensure that information on         health insurance and related topics is available to a greater segment of the         older population including those who are not able to obtain information online         and/or whose primary language is not English.          Priority Issue #3: Increase the use of information         technology to benefit senior consumers and to bridge the ""digital divide.""                Action:  Establish a senior citizen         section on the Department's Web site to include information on long-term care         insurance, frauds prevention, CCRCs, Medicare HMO's (Health Maintenance         Organizations), Medicare supplement insurance, senior discount programs, etc.         This Web site will have a font size, layout and functionality to best meet the         needs of the aged population and enable visitors to use the Net Rep feature         currently available to all visitors. Further, coordinate the Insurance         Department's information with other State agencies via online links from the         NYS Citizen Guide, NYSOFA, Consumer Protection Board, NYS Department of Health,         and others.          Result:  Provide user friendly,         comprehensive information on the products and services available to senior         citizens on a separate section of our Web site exclusively devoted to this         segment of the population and via other senior-related Web sites.          Action:  Install kiosks in the         Insurance Department's offices and in other agencies to provide computer access         to Department Web site and other information resources.          Result:  Increase consumer access to         information and awareness of insurance services, products and         issues.

The focus of this letter is not on health reform demonstration projects also conducted under section 1115. Below are guidelines regarding the interpretation of section 1931 of title XIX as added by section 114 of PRWORA, continuation of title XIX waivers under section 1115 welfare reform demonstrations, budget neutrality, evaluation requirements, and the process for informing HCFA of your intent to continue waivers. In addition, a list of  Questions and Answers  on related issues is attached. The Medicaid Bureau has issued a  ""State Medicaid Manual""  that outlines basic policies related to the impact of welfare reform on Medicaid outside of waiver situations.    The welfare reform demonstration projects approved under the authority of section 1115 primarily involve waivers of pre-welfare reform title IV-A. Many of these projects also involve waivers of provisions of title XIX and/or provisions of the Food Stamp Act of 1977. In addition, States have been granted Costs Not Otherwise Matchable (CNOM) authority under section 1115(a)(2) as part of their demonstrations by both the Administration for Children and Families and HCFA. This authority allows States to receive Federal matching payments for specified expenditures that would not ordinarily be matchable. These expenditures are usually incurred as the result of eligibility liberalizations affecting the AFDC and/or Medicaid programs. The most common example of a CNOM granted by HCFA allows for the extension of transitional Medicaid benefits beyond the 12 months provided for in section 1925. As part of welfare reform demonstrations, HCFA has also granted CNOMs to many States to liberalize the section 1925 eligibility requirements for transitional Medicaid benefits (e.g., not requiring that individuals receive AFDC in 3 of the 6 months prior to becoming ineligible for AFDC due to employment). The term ""waiver"" as used below, should be understood to include both the actual waivers and CNOMs. The PRWORA directly affects only waivers of pre-welfare reform title IV-A provisions. Waivers of title XIX granted by HCFA as part of welfare reform demonstrations are not affected.    Interpretation of section 1931 relating to title IV-A waivers    Section 1931(d) permits States to continue certain waivers of provisions of the pre-welfare reform title IV-A that affect Medicaid eligibility. These waivers may be continued whether or not a State elects to continue any other title IV-A or title XIX provisions of its welfare reform demonstration.    Section 1931(b)(1) defines the basic criteria for determining Medicaid eligibility based upon AFDC eligibility criteria. These criteria include the income and resource standards and methodologies for determining eligibility under the title IV-A State plan that was in effect on July 16, 1996, and the State plan deprivation and specified relative rules that were in effect on that date. (The ""title IV-A State plan that was in effect on July 16, 1996"" refers to your AFDC State plan itself and not to any waivers of title IV-A you may have had in effect on that date.)    Section 1931(b)(2) provides some flexibility for a State to change these criteria. In particular, section 1931(b)(2)(C) allows States to use less restrictive income and resource methodologies than were used under the title IV-A State plan in effect on July 16, 1996. In many, if not most cases, this authority can be used to adopt more liberal policies which previously required use of the waiver authority. Many of the policies in your current (or pending) welfare reform demonstration projects can now be adopted or modified for determinations of Medicaid eligibility simply by submitting a Medicaid State plan amendment. In this case, you will not need to use section 1931(d) authority to continue waivers of pre-welfare reform title IV-A, as explained below.    Section 1931(d) permits the State to continue indefinitely any provision approved under waivers of the pre-welfare reform title IV-A affecting Medicaid eligibility if it was granted by the Department as of July 16, 1996, or submitted to the Department before August 22, 1996, and approved by the Secretary on or before July 1, 1997. However, section 1931(d) authorizes the continuation only of title IV-A waivers affecting Medicaid eligibility as established by section 1931(b) criteria, i.e., income and resource standards and methodologies, deprivation, and specified relative requirements. States cannot continue waivers under section 1931(d) that involve, for example, sanctions restricting Medicaid eligibility.    A State may decide prior to the expiration of its existing welfare reform demonstration project to exercise the option under section 1931(d) to continue for an indefinite period specified waivers of the pre-welfare reform title IV-A after the expiration of the demonstration project. If a State also dropped its Medicaid waivers, it would actually be discontinuing the Medicaid component of the welfare reform demonstration, but it would be retaining waivers of pre-welfare reform title IV-A provisions that affect Medicaid eligibility.    Some States with section 1115 welfare reform demonstrations have a special term and condition protecting the Medicaid eligibility of individuals who are terminated from AFDC due to AFDC demonstration provisions. With minor variations from State to State, the term and condition reads as follows:    For the purposes of Medicaid coverage, all individuals subject to the provisions of the demonstration will retain their Medicaid eligibility if they would have been eligible in the absence of these [AFDC] demonstration provisions.    The authority in section 1931(d) does not relieve a State of its responsibility to comply with the terms and conditions under which the waivers were granted. It only permits a State to continue a waiver subject to the limitations that apply to the waiver. The term and condition was added to assure that title IV-A demonstration waivers do not negatively affect Medicaid eligibility. In our review of your State's request for continuation of title IV-A waivers under section 1931(d), we will determine if your request is consistent with the term and condition, if this term and condition is part of your State's demonstration.    Continuation of title XIX waivers    Many States with welfare reform demonstrations also received waivers of title XIX, which expire at the end of the demonstration. However, States may elect to terminate their title XIX waivers at any time prior to expiration of the demonstration. This decision is independent of the decision to continue pre-welfare reform title IV-A waivers that affect Medicaid eligibility, as provided for in section 1931(d).    Budget neutrality for title XIX waivers    States will not be required to demonstrate budget neutrality for previously accrued cost liabilities if they elect to terminate existing title XIX waivers. Also, States will not be required to demonstrate budget neutrality for liabilities accrued in the future if they choose to continue their existing title XIX waivers. In the case of continued waivers, budget neutrality will be forgiven through the expiration date of the welfare reform demonstration. On the other hand, any new Medicaid waivers that are approved after August 22, 1996, will be subject to a budget neutrality test. This includes waivers approved as amendments to existing demonstrations as well as any Medicaid waivers a State may request as part of a new demonstration project.    Evaluation requirements    States with continued or newly approved Medicaid waivers will be required to conduct an evaluation. Because these are demonstration projects, States will be expected to assess the impact of the Medicaid waivers (especially extended Medicaid transitional benefits). Use of a control group design is strongly recommended, although States may propose other designs expected to yield reliable results.    Process for informing HCFA of intent to continue waivers    Each State must select one of the following options regarding its existing Medicaid waivers (including Costs Not Otherwise Matchable authority). Medicaid waivers may be continued only through the end of the welfare reform demonstration.    1) Continue all Medicaid waivers    2) Continue only some Medicaid waivers    3) Continue none of the Medicaid waivers    In addition, each State must select one of the following options regarding its existing waivers of pre-welfare reform title IV-A affecting Medicaid eligibility (i.e., income and resource standards and methodologies, deprivation, and specified relative rules). This group of waivers may be continued indefinitely.    1) Continue all pre-welfare reform title IV-A waivers eligible for continuation under section 1931    2) Continue only some of the pre-welfare reform title IV-A waivers eligible for continuation under section 1931    3) Continue none of the title pre-welfare reform IV-A waivers eligible for continuation under section 1931    Your decisions regarding these two groups of waivers, including a list of the specific waivers and CNOMs to be continued (if any), should be communicated in writing to the HCFA project officer who is responsible for the demonstration(s) in your State. Please send this information to:    (Name of project officer)    Health Care Financing Administration    Office of State Health Reform Demonstrations    7500 Security Boulevard, Mail Stop C3-18-26    Baltimore, Maryland 21244-1850    Questions may be directed to Alisa Adamo (410) 786-6618, Maria Boulmetis (410) 786-0552, or Joan Peterson, Team Leader (410) 786-0621. These project officers will review the materials you submit. They will also work with you in the coming months to revise your evaluations and remaining terms and conditions for the demonstration, as necessary.    With regard to the two sets of options listed above, a State may elect to continue some or all of its title XIX waivers and also some or all of its pre-welfare reform waivers of title IV-A affecting Medicaid eligibility. Another possibility is for a State to terminate all Medicaid waivers and keep some or all of its pre-welfare reform title IV-A waivers affecting Medicaid eligibility (but no other title IV-A waivers). The latter scenario is equivalent to discontinuing the Medicaid component of the welfare reform demonstration. If your State chooses either of these two approaches, please notify the demonstration project officer in writing and also submit a Medicaid State plan amendment to your HCFA Regional Office in order to incorporate the policies regarding Medicaid eligibility that are to be continued.    Sincerely,    Barbara S. Cooper    Acting Director    Office of Research and Demonstrations    Enclosure    cc:    HCFA Regional Administrators    HCFA Associate Regional Administrators for Medicaid    Lloyd Bishop, OLIGA    Olivia Golden, Acting Assistant Secretary, Administration for Children and Families    State Welfare Reform Demonstration Project Officers    Jennifer Bexendall, NGA    Lee Partridge, APWA    Joy Wilson, NCSL                 QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS    1) May a State continue its section 1115 Medicaid waivers granted by HCFA as part of a welfare reform demonstration if it decides to drop the ACF portion of the welfare reform demonstration?    Yes. In many cases, States can accomplish their welfare reform objectives under PRWORA, and so no longer need all (or possibly any) of the title IV-A waivers they received as part of their welfare reform demonstrations. In addition, a State may decide to continue only those title IV-A waivers affecting Medicaid eligibility, in accordance with section 1931(d) of PRWORA. However, a State may elect to retain any or all of its Medicaid waivers and Costs Not Otherwise Matchable authority, regardless of what it decides to do with its title IV-A waivers.    2) What policies in a welfare reform demonstration project can be adopted for determinations of Medicaid eligibility through a Medicaid State plan amendment rather than continuation of a waiver of pre-welfare reform title IV-A? Please provide examples.    A State may use a Medicaid State plan amendment to adopt more liberal methods of determining either countable income and resources or deprivation. A Medicaid State plan amendment may also be used to adopt less restrictive policies concerning the requirement that a child live with a specified relative. Any policy adopted by a Medicaid State plan amendment must apply to all determinations of Medicaid eligibility under the new eligibility group created by section 1931.    Example 1.  Under a welfare reform demonstration project, a State has been granted a waiver of section 402(a)(8)(B) to enable the State to disregard the first $100 of earned income and « of the remainder. This is more liberal than the $30 and 1/3 disregard in the title IV-A State plan in effect on July 16, 1996 and can be implemented by a Medicaid State plan amendment. The State does not need to continue the title IV-A waiver of section 402(a)(8)(B).    Example 2.  As part of its welfare reform demonstration, a State has been granted a waiver of 45 CFR 233.20(a)(3)(I)(B)(2) to enable the State to exclude one car of any value. This is more liberal than the $1,500 exclusion in the title IV-A State plan on July 16, 1996 and can be implemented by a Medicaid State plan amendment. The State does not need to continue the waiver of title 45.    In addition, a State with pending title IV-A waivers submitted prior to August 22, 1996, involving more liberal methods of determining either countable income and resources or deprivation can implement these more liberal methods through a Medicaid State plan amendment rather than by obtaining waivers of pre-welfare reform title IV-A.    3) Does section 415 of PRWORA have any applicability to Medicaid waivers in welfare reform demonstrations?    This section of the law permits States to continue all or some of the title IV-A demonstration waivers granted under section 1115 of the Social Security Act either in effect as of August 22, 1996, or submitted prior to August 22, 1996, and approved on or before July 1, 1997. These title IV-A waivers may remain in effect until the expiration of the welfare reform demonstration (without regard to any extensions). However, section 415 does not address the continuation of Medicaid waivers granted as part of a welfare reform demonstration and so does not apply to Medicaid.    4) May existing substate demonstrations involving Medicaid waivers be extended statewide?    No. These demonstrations were approved to test provisions on a limited geographic basis. There is no rationale for automatically extending them statewide. However, if a State were to propose an expansion that would be budget neutral, HCFA would consider it.    However, a State may apply title IV-A waivers affecting Medicaid eligibility under section 1931(d) on a statewide basis if these waivers had previously been applied to a statewide treatment group as part of the randomized design required by ACF as part of the previous welfare reform demonstration. In other words, the State could apply the title IV-A waivers to individuals who had been in the control group during the previous welfare reform demonstration.    5) May States with section 1115 health reform demonstrations cover individuals as uninsured if they lose Medicaid eligibility because of welfare reform?    States will not be able to cover new qualified immigrants during the 5-year bar as uninsured individuals under health reform demonstrations. For States that cover the uninsured as part of their health reform demonstrations, these States may cover other individuals who lose eligibility for Medicaid by virtue of the loss of eligibility for SSI if these individuals otherwise meet the eligibility requirements for the uninsured of the health reform demonstrations.    6) May States with section 1115 health reform demonstrations expand eligibility through a State plan amendment using the less-restrictive-methodology provision in welfare reform?    States with section 1115 health reform demonstrations may expand eligibility using the State plan amendment process. However, they will need to discuss budget neutrality considerations with HCFA prior to submitting any State plan amendments.

A booming national economy combined with          innovative state policies and investments have helped millions of          low-income Americans make the transition from dependency to work and          self-sufficiency and resulted in steadily declining welfare caseloads.          An essential pillar of family self-sufficiency is the ability to          obtain and keep health insurance coverage.                          Until recently, many low-income families obtained health insurance          through their eligibility for cash assistance programs. Under the old          Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program, poor families          automatically received Medicaid coverage when they qualified for cash          assistance. The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity          Reconciliation Act of 1996 replaced AFDC with a new state-run          Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program and ended the          automatic link between eligibility for cash assistance and eligibility          for Medicaid.                          To preserve Medicaid coverage for low-income families with children,          the welfare reform law created a new Medicaid eligibility category.          Under the new ""Section 1931"" group, families who would have          qualified for Medicaid under a state's AFDC program are generally          eligible for Medicaid now, regardless of whether they receive TANF          assistance. The law also made available to states $500 million in          enhanced matching funds to support the systems changes and outreach          necessary to address the effects of ""delinking"" Medicaid          from welfare.                          Beyond preserving Medicaid eligibility as it was prior to welfare          reform, new options have been created. Specifically, Congress provided          states with broad flexibility under Section 1931 to expand Medicaid to          cover more low-income families at their option. Also, as a result of          regulations published in August 1998, states can expand coverage to          more two-parent working families through Section 1931. Finally,          seeking to extend free or affordable health coverage to uninsured          children in low-income families, President Clinton and Congress          created the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP).                          The dramatic changes in welfare laws and policies, and the challenges          and opportunities they continue to present, require that states          establish new strategies and procedures to ensure that as many          children and families as possible retain or obtain health care          coverage under Medicaid or CHIP. To achieve this result, we need to          find new ways to reach children and families with these health          programs—outside as well as through the welfare system.                          This guide serves three major purposes:                                        First, it assists state policymakers and others in understanding             what the Medicaid statute and regulations require of states in             terms of Medicaid eligibility, enrollment, redetermination, notice             and appeal rights, and other program and policy areas. These             requirements apply generally in Medicaid, and also specifically to             Medicaid applications and eligibility determinations in the welfare             context — that is, when families seek or leave TANF             assistance. The guide includes information on the ways in which             states can work within the statute to strengthen their outreach             efforts, simplify their application processes, and broaden Medicaid             coverage to reach low-income families with children, independent of             TANF.                                   Second, it discusses the Medicaid requirements and options that             apply in three common scenarios: 1) when families seek TANF             assistance; 2) when families leave TANF assistance; and 3) when             families have no contact with the TANF program.                                   Third, it points the reader to the various sources of funding that             are available to states to pay for outreach, training, and other             activities to help states bring their systems into compliance with             the law and increase health insurance coverage for low-income             families with children.                                                               The          guide is organized into four chapters:                            Reaching Families Who Seek TANF Assistance.  This          chapter addresses the specific circumstances of families seeking TANF          assistance. It outlines the Medicaid and CHIP requirements that states          must meet when receiving and processing applications from these          families, and identifies practices and techniques that states may wish          to consider in designing their TANF programs and their application and          enrollment processes to ensure maximum participation of families.                           Maintaining Coverage for Families Who Leave TANF          Assistance.  This chapter focuses on the circumstances of          families leaving the TANF system. It outlines applicable Medicaid          legal requirements and options, and strategies and techniques that          states may wish to consider in designing their Medicaid programs and          the administration of their TANF programs to ensure maximum continued          eligibility for Medicaid and CHIP.                           Reaching Families Outside the TANF System.  This          chapter focuses on the ways in which states can help low-income          families who are not seeking TANF assistance to obtain health          insurance through Medicaid and/or CHIP. States have an opportunity          here to capitalize on the delinkage of Medicaid from welfare          eligibility by marketing Medicaid as well as CHIP coverage as a          freestanding support for working families — untied to TANF. This          chapter also emphasizes the need to reach out to lowincome families          and inform them of the health coverage available to them under          Medicaid and CHIP.                           Funding Opportunities.  The final chapter identifies          sources of funds that are available to states to pay for outreach,          training, and other activities critical to supporting compliance with          Medicaid requirements and maximizing coverage of lowincome families          with children.                                                                                       Reaching Families Who Seek TANF          Assistance                           Families seeking assistance under the Temporary Assistance for Needy          Families (TANF) program typically first complete an application. All          states currently report that they use joint applications for TANF and          Medicaid. Therefore, the nature of coordination between the TANF and          Medicaid agencies and their procedures has a critical impact on          whether or not eligible low-income families obtain Medicaid coverage.                          Not every person seeking TANF assistance actually completes the          application process. In some states, for example, completion of an          application is delayed until a parent conducts a job search. In other          cases, an individual may decide not to apply for TANF after all          because she secures employment, or for other reasons. Many parents do          not realize that, regardless of their eligibility for or receipt of          TANF assistance, they, or at least their children, may be eligible for          Medicaid or CHIP. In such cases, TANF offices can be instrumental in          ensuring that eligible families get enrolled in Medicaid or CHIP.                          This chapter outlines the statutory and regulatory requirements under          TANF and Medicaid that states must follow in establishing the          eligibility rules for low-income families, as well as requirements          concerning the Medicaid application and enrollment processes. To help          state officials and others considering implementation issues, this          chapter also identifies administrative steps and programmatic          strategies designed to promote the maximum enrollment of families.                           State          Requirements and Options under Federal Medicaid Law                            A.          Mandatory Eligibility Policies                                                           Section 1931 group                                    . Medicaid eligibility is no longer tied to or based on eligibility          for welfare. Nor can states limit Medicaid eligibility only to          families receiving TANF benefits. Section 1931 of the Social Security          Act establishes rules for Medicaid eligibility for low-income families          based on the income and resources of the family. Under Section 1931,          states must provide Medicaid coverage to families who:                         ¨ have a dependent child living with them;                                   ¨ have income and resources that would have qualified them for             AFDC under the State plan in effect on July 16, 1996; and                                   ¨ meet certain deprivation requirements (e.g., absent parent)             that were in the state's AFDC plan as of July 16, 1996. Most             states have amended their Medicaid state plans to add the new             Section 1931 eligibility group for low-income families to replace             the former AFDC recipient eligibility group.                                                                            Comparable standards.  Section 1902 (a) (17) of                the Social Security Act requires states to establish eligibility                standards for a given Medicaid group that are the same for all                members of that group. This means that, generally, the                eligibility rules must be the same for all Medicaid applicants                and recipients within the Section 1931 group.                                             Statewide application.  Medicaid statute                requires states to apply their policies through all subdivisions                of the state. Accordingly, a state's Section 1931                eligibility rules must be the same throughout the state.                                                                                    B. Optional             Eligibility Policies                                    Under Section 1931, states have the option to modify their July 16,             1996 AFDC state plan requirements by using the flexibilities             outlined below  1 . To exercise any of these             flexibilities under Section 1931, a state must submit a Medicaid             state plan amendment.                                    1 Note that, consistent with the requirement for             comparable standards described above, the policies states adopt             under the Section 1931 group must apply equally to families             receiving and applying for Medicaid. Earned income disregards (see             under  Use less restrictive financial             methodologies ) constitute the sole exception to the             comparable standards rule; that is, states can apply earned income             disregards differently for Medicaid applicants and recipients under             Section 1931, because the AFDC rules that underlie Section 1931             eligibility allowed AFDC applicants and recipients to be treated             differently in this respect.                                                     Use less restrictive financial methodologies.                 States can use less restrictive income and/or resource                methodologies to determine Medicaid eligibility than those in                effect under the July 16, 1996 AFDC state plan. By doing so,                states can expand coverage to more low-income families with                children without obtaining a Federal waiver. For example, a                number of states have chosen to disregard a car of any value, as                well as interest income, under their TANF programs. Some of                these states have adopted the same disregards for their Section                1931 group under Medicaid as they have in their TANF programs.                (These types of disregards must be applied equally to all                applicants and recipients under the Section 1931 group.)                                     In addition, some states have chosen to apply more generous                    earned income  disregards under TANF and have adopted                   the same disregards for the Medicaid Section 1931 group.                   States can apply these disregards to applicants and                   recipients or, without violating comparability requirements,                   they can apply such disregards to Medicaid recipients but not                   applicants, by replacing the ""$30 and 1/3""                   disregards, which applied only to recipients under the AFDC                   program.                                                                                    Ease deprivation requirements (repeal ofthe                ""100-hour"" rule).  Under regulations published                August 7, 1998, states have increased flexibility to define the                deprivation requirements for Medicaid eligibility. Prior                regulations prohibited states from providing Medicaid                eligibility to two-parent families if the principal wage-earner                worked more than 100 hours per month. The new regulation removes                the 100-hour definition of deprivation and instead allows states                to set a reasonable standard based on hours of work and/or                dollar amounts that may take into account family size and/or                time elements. This new flexibility allows states to treat                one-parent and two-parent families the same under Medicaid even                if a distinction existed under the states' 1996 AFDC and                Medicaid state plans.                                             Use less restrictive financial standards .                States can raise their income and resource standards by as much                as the rise in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) since July 16,                1996. (Section 1931 also allows states to use income standards                that are lower than the July 16, 1996 AFDC standard, but no                lower than those in place on May 1, 1988.) Exercising this                flexibility, a state may, for example, pass legislation indexing                the income and asset standards for its Section 1931 families                 2  — without obtaining a Federal waiver                and without regard to its policies under TANF.                                    2  Because of the CPI constraint, a state that has          chosen to apply income standards under TANF that are significantly          higher than those under its AFDC state plan in effect on July 16, 1996          may not be able to raise the  standards for its Section 1931 group          to the same level. However, such a state could effectively raise the          income standard for its Section 1931 group by using the authority to          liberalize its financial  methodologies  as explained above. For          example, if a state raised the income standard under TANF from $250          per month to $500 per month and wanted to do the same under its          Section 1931 group, the state could get the desired result by          disregarding an additional $250 of income (or disregarding ""the          difference between the AFDC standard and the TANF standard by family          size"") for purposes of Medicaid eligibility.                                           Continue certain AFDC waivers . Finally, states                are allowed to continue AFDC waivers that were in effect as of                July 16, 1996 that relate to income and resource methodologies,                deprivation, and the requirement that a child live with a                specified relative. Section 1931 provides that these waivers may                be continued permanently for Medicaid purposes even after the                date the AFDC waiver expires. However, any AFDC provisions that                were more restrictive than those in place for Medicaid cannot be                continued for Medicaid purposes beyond their expiration.                                                                                    C. Mandatory             Application and Enrollment Policies                                                                          Opportunity to apply                                             . Medicaid regulations (42 CFR 435.906) require states to provide             the opportunity for families to apply for Medicaid  without             delay . When states use joint TANF-Medicaid applications or use             the state TANF agency to make Medicaid eligibility determinations,             the TANF office is considered a Medicaid office. Therefore, TANF             offices in these states must furnish the joint application (or a             separate Medicaid application) immediately upon request and may not             impose a waiting period before providing the application for             Medicaid or processing it. These Medicaid requirements also apply             to CHIP programs that are Medicaid expansions, and states are             encouraged to apply them in the same manner for non-Medicaid CHIP             programs as well.                               In states where the TANF application or eligibility is delayed                (i.e., because families receive diversionary assistance, are                required to conduct an up-front job search, or face any other                initial administrative steps), the state must make a separate                Medicaid application available immediately, or make the joint                application available immediately for purposes of determining                Medicaid eligibility. The evaluation of the Medicaid application                and the Medicaid eligibility determination must be made by state                personnel who are authorized to perform these functions.                                                                   Time frame for eligibility determination .                Federal regulations (42 CFR 435.911) require that Medicaid                eligibility for most families and children must be determined                within 45 days from the date of application. The date that a                TANF-Medicaid application is filed begins the 45-day                ""clock"" for Medicaid eligibility determination. While                a few limited exceptions to the 45-day time frame are allowed,                such as an administrative or other emergency beyond the                state's control, a TANF requirement may not delay a Medicaid                eligibility determination. For example, when a family applies                for Medicaid and TANF through a joint application but does not                qualify for TANF assistance because of a TANF requirement that                does not relate to Medicaid (e.g., the living arrangements for                teens), the state must make a timely determination of Medicaid                eligibility based on the joint application.                                     States may grant Medicaid eligibility retroactive to the date                   of application, or to the first day of the month of                   application. Eligibility must be granted three months                   retroactive to the month of application if the applicant                   received services during that period and would have been                   eligible at the time the services were furnished.                                                              Exhaust all avenues to eligibility before denial or                termination . Because Medicaid eligibility is not based                on TANF eligibility, states may not deny Medicaid eligibility to                a family or any family member simply because the family is                ineligible for TANF due to employment, time limits, sanctions,                or any other reason. Nor can a state deny Medicaid eligibility                because a family member loses eligibility under a particular                Medicaid eligibility category. Further, it is not acceptable for                a state to deny joint applications and then advise families to                reapply if they think they may be eligible under another                Medicaid category.  States are prohibited from denying or                terminating Medicaid eligibility unless all possible avenues to                Medicaid eligibility have been affirmatively explored and                exhausted.                                      Since Medicaid eligibility for families no longer hinges on                   eligibility for welfare, and since Medicaid generally covers                   a broader group of children and families than may be eligible                   for TANF, some or all members of a family that fails to meet                   TANF eligibility criteria are likely to be eligible for                   Medicaid. There are many possible avenues to Medicaid                   eligibility for family members denied or terminated from TANF                   assistance, including the Section 1931 group (depending on                   family income and other state eligibility rules for the                   group), poverty-level groups, and transitional Medicaid.                                                              Medicaid denial notice and appeal rights .                Federal regulations (42 CFR, Part 431, Subpart E and 42 CFR                435.912) require that applicants who are denied Medicaid                eligibility or individuals who are terminated from Medicaid                receive timely notices informing them of the denial, the reasons                for the denial, and their appeal rights. With very few                exceptions Medicaid coverage for current recipients continues                during an appeal. These rights apply to all Medicaid denials and                terminations, including those that flow from joint TANF-Medicaid                applications.                                     When a family applies for Medicaid and TANF through a joint                   application and the family does not qualify for TANF, the                   denial notice should inform the family that the TANF denial                   does not mean the family is ineligible for Medicaid.                                                                   D. Optional             Application and Enrollment Policies                                                                          Facilitate Enrollment in Medicaid and CHIP.                                             M aking both joint TANF-Medicaid applications and Medicaid-only             applications available in TANF offices is an important step toward             assuring that families get connected with Medicaid or CHIP, no             matter what decision they ultimately make about seeking TANF             assistance.                               ¨  Use joint applications.  TANF                offices are a critical site for reaching low-income families                since, in most states, virtually all TANF recipients are likely                to be eligible for Medicaid. In states that use a joint                TANF-Medicaid application, the opportunity to apply for Medicaid                must be provided without delay, whether the family applies for                TANF or receives diversionary payments or any other assistance.                The family cannot be told to come back another time or be sent                elsewhere to obtain the application.                                            South Dakota uses a joint application for TANF and Medicaid.                However, while both programs are supervised by the same                operating division and the same case management staff administer                the programs, the state's use of separate computer systems                for TANF and Medicaid eligibility ensures that when a TANF case                is denied, an independent Medicaid eligibility determination is                made.                                             ¨ Use separate applications.  If a                state does not use a joint application, it should ensure that                Medicaid applications are available at all TANF sites. States                with non-Medicaid CHIP programs should also ensure that CHIP                applications are available at TANF sites.                                             ¨ Use both joint and separate                applications.  An effective strategy for maximizing                the Medicaid participation of families who come into TANF                offices is for states to make both joint and Medicaid-only                applications available. This way, no matter what course a family                takes with regard to seeking TANF assistance, the family can                apply for Medicaid easily.                                                  Administrative Strategies and             Considerations                                    Effective implementation of the new Medicaid rules requires             procedures that ensure that eligibility for Medicaid is considered             when TANF assistance is provided, denied, delayed, or terminated.             State procedures should assure that caseworkers are proactive in             offering families the opportunity to apply. Families should not be             expected to take the initiative to ask about Medicaid. Rather, all             those who come to TANF offices should be asked about their health             coverage needs and informed of the process for applying for             Medicaid and CHIP. Following are suggestions for how to assure such             an outcome:                                                                            Provide Medicaid and CHIP outreach to families at TANF                sites . The key to any effort to identify and enroll                eligible children and families is outreach. Success in outreach                and enrollment requires the involvement of TANF offices and                personnel. Families who inquire about or apply for TANF should                also receive information about Medicaid and CHIP, including how                to apply for these programs. TANF agency staff should be trained                to conduct this outreach and education.                                             Place Medicaid/CHIP workers in TANF offices.                 States are encouraged to place Medicaid and CHIP eligibility                workers at TANF offices to take applications and assist in their                preparation. This practice is especially important at sites                where, by state or local policy, low-income people are often                directed to job searches, receive diversion payments, or                otherwise receive assistance that may result in their not                filling out an application for TANF assistance.                                             Conduct staff training.  States can send a                strong and clear message to their employees about the importance                of Medicaid and CHIP eligibility through special staff training,                supervisor reviews, and other mechanisms. Such efforts should                call attention to the differences between the TANF rules and                Medicaid and CHIP eligibility rules, and to the procedures                necessary to ensure that Medicaid and CHIP eligibility are                considered. States should consider offering similar training to                hospitals, clinics, health providers, child care centers, Head                Start programs, WIC offices, community-based organizations, and                other programs that come into contact with low-income families                and children.                                             Encourage Medicaid application when the TANF application                process halts.  States should ensure that the Medicaid                application process is completed when a family does not qualify                for TANF-funded assistance or abandons the TANF application                process. It is important to inform families early in the                application process about the different eligibility rules for                TANF and Medicaid. Otherwise, families may not understand that                even if they don't qualify for TANF, their Medicaid                application can and should be processed and could well be                approved.                                     To give an example, a person who applies for TANF might be                   required to meet an up-front job search requirement before                   becoming eligible for cash assistance. Although that                   person's TANF application might be suspended, he or she                   should be guided to proceed with the application for                   Medicaid. As another illustration, a parent might not carry                   through with a joint application if he or she finds a job,                   thinking that the family is no longer eligible for Medicaid                   coverage. Rather than just accepting a withdrawal of a                   TANF-Medicaid application, a state should send a letter                   informing the family that all or some of its members might                   still be eligible for Medicaid, laying out the steps the                   family needs to take to complete the Medicaid aspects of the                   application, and urging them to pursue application.                                                              Educate families.  Informing families early in                the TANF application process and regularly thereafter about how                the Medicaid and TANF rules differ, and reminding them that                Medicaid eligibility is not tied to TANF receipt, can help                encourage families to submit and complete Medicaid applications.                One reason families may not sign up for Medicaid is that they                are under the mistaken impression that Medicaid eligibility                depends on welfare eligibility. Therefore, states should make                clear in all of their informational materials about TANF that                coverage under Medicaid and CHIP does not require welfare                eligibility and that, no matter whether or not families apply                for or receive TANF assistance, they are encouraged to apply for                Medicaid and/or CHIP.                                     For individuals facing language barriers, states should                   consider developing culturally-appropriate materials in                   languages other than English.                                                              Simplify application and enrollment.  States                have considerable flexibility under Medicaid and CHIP to                simplify the application and enrollment processes. HCFA has                provided states with suggestions on how to do so in a letter to                state health officials dated September 10, 1998, which can be                found on the HCFA website (  http://www.cms.hhs.gov ).                                     Many states have simplified their application and enrollment                   processes for children under Medicaid and CHIP by shortening                   application forms, allowing the use of mail-in applications,                   reducing or eliminating verification and documentation                   requirements that go beyond Federal requirements, and                   speeding up processing of applications. States should                   consider taking similar steps to simplify the application                   process for low-income families.                                                              Coordinate TANF and Medicaid Section 1931                eligibility.  The alignment of TANF and Medicaid                eligibility requirements for low-income families can greatly                facilitate families' participation in Medicaid. Medicaid and                TANF requirements can be aligned by taking advantage of the                flexibility to modify financial methodologies and standards                under Section 1931, loosen the deprivation requirements for                two-parent families, and continue certain AFDC waivers. By                exercising these options, states can provide automatic Medicaid                eligibility for TANF recipients as they did for AFDC recipients                prior to the enactment of welfare reform.                                     States have begun to take advantage of the flexibility to                   harmonize TANF and Medicaid eligibility in several ways. For                   example, several states have adopted earnings disregards in                   their TANF programs that are more generous than the old AFDC                   earnings disregards. To ensure that TANF recipients also                   qualify for Medicaid, many of these states have adopted the                   same disregards under the Section 1931 eligibility group.                   With the exception of earned income disregards, the financial                   rules under the Section 1931 group must be applied to all                   members of the group, including those families who do not                   receive TANF benefits.                                                              Eliminate or ease the Medicaid resource test.                 Most states have dropped the Medicaid resource test for children                and now, under Section 1931, states have the ability to drop or                ease the resource test for parents as well. Taking this step                makes it easier to establish Medicaid eligibility, and can also                make Medicaid rules more compatible with welfare reform                initiatives. Some states that have not dropped their resource                requirements under Section 1931 have made their resource rules                less restrictive, for example, by exempting the value of a car.                                                                                                                                   Maintaining Coverage for Families Who Leave             TANF Assistance                                    This chapter focuses on the statutory and regulatory requirements             with which states must comply in providing Medicaid to adults and             children in families leaving the welfare rolls. This chapter also             identifies administrative practices that can increase the             likelihood that parents and children who leave welfare will             continue to receive Medicaid and/or CHIP.                                    State             Requirements and Options under Federal Medicaid Law                                     A.             Mandatory Eligibility Policies                                                      Exhaust all avenues to eligibility before denial or                termination.  Because Medicaid eligibility is not based                on TANF eligibility, states may not deny Medicaid eligibility to                a family or any family member simply because the family is                ineligible for TANF because of employment, time limits,                sanctions, or for any other reason. Nor can a state deny                Medicaid eligibility because a family member loses eligibility                under a particular Medicaid eligibility category. Further, it is                not acceptable for a state to deny a joint application and then                advise families to reapply if they think they may be eligible                under another Medicaid category.  States are prohibited from                denying or terminating Medicaid eligibility unless all possible                avenues to Medicaid eligibility have been affirmatively explored                and exhausted.                                      Since Medicaid eligibility for families no longer hinges on                   eligibility for welfare, and since Medicaid generally covers                   a broader group of children and families than may be eligible                   for TANF, some or all members of a family that fails to meet                   TANF eligibility criteria are likely to be eligible for                   Medicaid. There are many possible avenues to Medicaid                   eligibility for family members denied or terminated from TANF                   assistance, including the Section 1931 group (depending on                   family income and other state eligibility rules for the                   group), poverty-level groups, and transitional Medicaid.                                                              Provide transitional Medicaid for families.                 Under Section 1925 of the Social Security Act, states must                provide extended Medicaid benefits (""transitional                Medicaid"") to families who, because of hours of work or                income from employment (or loss of the earned income disregard),                lose their eligibility for Medicaid under the Section 1931                group. (States must also provide transitional Medicaid when                eligibility would otherwise be lost due to child support                income.) It is important to note that it is the loss of coverage                under Section 1931 — not the loss of TANF assistance                — that is now the trigger for transitional Medicaid.                                     States are required to provide an initial six-month period of                   transitional Medicaid and, subject to certain reporting                   requirements and the income limit explained below, an                   additional six months of coverage. Some states provide a                   longer period of transitional Medicaid under Section 1115                   waivers. (Four months of coverage are available when child                   support payments trigger eligibility.)                                                     To be eligible for transitional Medicaid, a family must have                   received Medicaid under Section 1931 in three out of the                   preceding six months before becoming ineligible under this                   category. No income limit applies to families for the initial                   six-month period of transitional Medicaid. However, the                   second six-month period is limited to families whose earned                   income (less necessary child care expenses) does not exceed                   185% of the Federal poverty level for the size of the family.                                                                   B.             Optional Eligibility Policies                                                      Provide continuous eligibility for children.                 Under Section 1902(e)(12) of the Social Security Act, states may                grant continuous Medicaid eligibility to children under age 19                for up to 12 months, even if there is a change in family income,                assets, or composition. Such eligibility must end when the child                reaches age 19. By granting children eligibility for up to one                year without regard to changes in circumstances, states can                minimize the burden on families seeking to maintain coverage for                their children. Most importantly, continuous eligibility can                minimize coverage losses among children that occur because                families are in financial transition and because of the barriers                to continued participation that recertification requirements                impose. To adopt the continuous eligibility option, states must                amend their Medicaid state plans. States may also grant                continuous eligibility under CHIP.                                             Termination for failure to meet TANF work                requirements. States can terminate Medicaid coverage for                a TANF recipient (excluding pregnant women and children eligible                under a poverty-level group and minor children who are not                heads-of-household under TANF) if the recipient's TANF                assistance is terminated because of a refusal to cooperate with                TANF work requirements. This sanction extends only to the person                violating the TANF work requirement, in most cases the adult                head-of-household. A state cannot terminate Medicaid benefits                for other family members, including the children of an adult who                fails to meet a TANF work requirement. States that wish to adopt                this option to terminate Medicaid for refusal to cooperate with                work requirements must submit a Medicaid state plan amendment.                                             Medicaid payment of premiums and cost-sharing for                employer-based health coverage.  Under Section 1906 of                the Social Security Act, states have the option of paying a                low-income worker's share of the premium for                employer-sponsored health insurance along with any cost-sharing,                if such action would be cost-effective relative to providing                Medicaid for that person. That is, the cost to the state of the                premiums and cost-sharing must not exceed the cost to the state                of providing Medicaid benefits. The family or individual must be                otherwise eligible for Medicaid and agree to enroll in the                employer-based health insurance as a condition of Medicaid                eligibility. Under Section 1925, states have the option of                requiring that individuals receiving transitional Medicaid                enroll in employer-sponsored insurance, whether or not it is                cost-effective.                                                  Administrative Strategies and             Considerations                                    States may want to consider the following administrative strategies             to maximize enrollment in Medicaid and CHIP:                                                     Prevent inappropriate Medicaid denials and                terminations.  The key to states ensuring that                Medicaid-eligible families continue to receive Medicaid after                their TANF benefits have been terminated is the set of                procedures they use to prevent inappropriate Medicaid                eligibility terminations. In no event should closure of a TANF                case automatically result in closure of a Medicaid case.                                     In many situations in which a TANF case is closed, the state                   will have all the information it needs to determine whether                   Medicaid eligibility for a family should continue; in these                   cases, the state must make the Medicaid redetermination                   without seeking additional information from the family. In                   other situations, families will need to be informed that they                   must provide additional information to allow the state to                   evaluate their ongoing Medicaid eligibility. One way states                   can help families understand that their Medicaid benefits are                   not affected by the actions taken in their TANF case is to                   make sure that TANF case-closing notices state this fact very                   clearly.                                                              Educate families about transitional Medicaid.                 To maximize the participation of families in transitional                Medicaid, it is critical that states educate families about this                benefit and the steps they need to take — such as                reporting earnings, rather than closing their cases — to                safeguard and facilitate their Medicaid eligibility when they                leave TANF assistance.                                             Delink Medicaid and TANF redeterminations.  To                avoid inappropriate Medicaid termination, states can establish                different redetermination periods for Medicaid and TANF, thereby                delinking Medicaid and TANF eligibility reviews. Under Medicaid                regulations, states must conduct redeterminations at least every                12 months, or promptly upon notification of a change in the                family's or child's circumstances that may affect                eligibility (unless the state has adopted the 12-month                continuous eligibility option for children, as described next).                                             Adopt continuous eligibility for children.                 Under Section 1902(e)(12) of the Social Security Act, states may                grant continuous Medicaid eligibility to children under age 19                for up to 12 months, even if there is a change in family income,                assets, or composition. Such eligibility must end when the child                reaches age 19. By granting children eligibility for up to one                year without regard to changes in circumstances, states can                minimize the burden on families seeking to maintain coverage for                their children. Most importantly, continuous eligibility can                minimize coverage losses among children that occur because                families are in financial transition and because recertification                requirements impose barriers to continued participation.                                             Simplify redeterminations.  Eligibility reviews                can be simplified. To avoid time-consuming face-to-face meetings                and help working parents avoid missing work, states can be kept                informed of changes in family circumstances by telephone or                mail. States can respond to requests for eligibility reviews by                simplifying the review process, much as they have simplified                their Medicaid applications for children. Redetermination forms                can be shortened, most of the necessary information can be                filled in by the state based on the information on hand, and the                family can be asked to send in the signed form with any changes                noted.                                             Review closed TANF cases.  A state review of                TANF cases that have been closed and in which Medicaid was not                continued may identify families likely to be eligible for                Medicaid. States have the authority to re-open erroneously                closed cases on their own motion, and should, at a minimum,                conduct aggressive outreach to families in this situation.                                             Expand Medicaid coverage for low-income working                families.  States have the flexibility to use less                restrictive financial methodologies and standards under the                Section 1931 group, as well as authority to loosen deprivation                requirements, in order to expand Medicaid to cover more working                families (see pages 6-7 for a detailed discussion of state                flexibility). States adopting such policies provide health                security — a critical support — to families who have                made or are making the transition to selfsufficiency. When                states take this route to broadening eligibility for Medicaid,                families at the higher income levels remain eligible as long as                their income does not exceed the Medicaid income threshold and                they continue to meet other applicable requirements.                                             Improve the reach of transitional Medicaid.  To                be eligible for transitional Medicaid, a family must have                received Medicaid under Section 1931 in three out of the                preceding six months before becoming ineligible under this                category. The same flexibility under Section 1931 that states                can use to expand coverage quite broadly (e.g., via income and                asset disregards) can also be used for the narrower purpose of                increasing access to transitional Medicaid for working families                who may be diverted from TANF or leave TANF assistance in less                than the three months typically required to trigger transitional                Medicaid.                                     For example, states that offer lump-sum ""diversion""                   payments in lieu of recurring cash assistance can prevent                   these lump-sum payments from making the family ineligible for                   Medicaid by disregarding them as either income or resources                   when they determine eligibility under Section 1931. To give                   another example, a state can disregard all earnings below the                   poverty level for 12 months; this way, a low-income working                   family can obtain Medicaid eligibility under the Section 1931                   group for 12 months, and subsequently qualify for                   transitional Medicaid for up to an additional 12 months.                   Alternatively, a state can adopt a more limited disregard of                   all earned income for three months, enabling families to                   obtain Medicaid eligibility under Section 1931 for the                   three-month period necessary for the family to qualify for                   transitional Medicaid.                                                     As the illustrations make clear, limited changes in Medicaid                   rules can ensure that families in the earliest stages of                   their connection to the workforce do not lose their Medicaid                   coverage. Such programmatic coordination is key to the                   development of a coherent state strategy for supporting                   families in transition.                                                              Pay private health insurance premiums and                cost-sharing.  States' use of the option to cover                Medicaid-eligible working families by paying the family's                share of premiums for employersponsored health insurance, along                with deductibles, coinsurance, and other costsharing, gives                families an incentive not to drop employersponsored insurance,                preserving continuity in their health coverage and supporting                their employment. The approach also builds on the private                insurance system, and may result in savings to the state.                                                                                                                                   Reaching Families Outside the TANF System                                    This chapter deals with ways to ensure coverage for low-income             families who do not come in contact with the TANF system. As states             succeed in helping families move to self-sufficiency, more families             will remain outside the welfare system. Thus, it is critical that             new strategies for reaching families outside the TANF system be             developed and implemented.                                   The longstanding linkage between cash assistance and Medicaid was             often seen as an inequitable and counter-productive feature of the             old system. When families learn that they can receive Medicaid             coverage without having to receive welfare, they may be less likely             to turn to welfare in the first place or to return to the welfare             system in the event that they have significant health care needs.             This chapter highlights the historic opportunity that the delinkage             of Medicaid from welfare presents to promote Medicaid and CHIP             coverage as a freestanding support for low-income families with             children, and outlines approaches states can take toward this goal.                                   This chapter also emphasizes the importance of information and             outreach efforts, and of simplifying the application and enrollment             processes, as means of identifying and enrolling low-income             families and children in Medicaid and CHIP.                                    State             Requirements and Options under Federal Medicaid Law                                     A. Mandatory             Eligibility Policies                                                      Outstation eligibility workers.  Medicaid law                and regulations require that states provide an opportunity for                children under age 19 and pregnant women to apply for Medicaid                at locations other than welfare offices. States are required to                have outstationing arrangements at facilities designated as                ""disproportionate share hospitals"" and Federally                Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs). HCFA regulations (42 CFR                435.904) permit alternative outstationing arrangements under                certain limited conditions, and allow states to use additional                sites where children and pregnant women receive services. States                are free to station Medicaid eligibility workers at any location                to take applications, provide assistance, and, if authorized,                evaluate applications and make eligibility determinations.                                                  B. Optional             Eligibility Policies                                                      Expand coverage for families under Section                1931.  Section 1931 authorizes states to use financial                standards and methodologies for low-income families that are                more generous than the standards and methodologies in AFDC state                plans in effect on July 16, 1996. Together with the new                flexibility to define deprivation (e.g., by substituting another                definition of unemployment for the 100-hour rule), states can                use Section 1931 to take two significant policy actions. (See                pages 6-7 for a detailed discussion of state flexibility.)                First, they can equalize their treatment of single- and                two-parent families for Medicaid purposes. Second, they can                expand coverage of families as far as state budget and policy                preferences permit. States can accomplish these policy changes                through amendments to their Medicaid state plan; they do not                need to obtain Federal waivers.                                     Recognizing that Section 1931 coverage expansions will                   require additional state expenditures to draw down Federal                   matching payments (see under  Cover children under                   CHIP  regarding enhanced Federal match for uninsured                   children in families covered under a Section 1931 expansion),                   it should be noted that states' expansions of coverage to                   low-income families under Section 1931 can be as broad or as                   narrow as state resources and other considerations permit.                   For example, states can:                                                                  ¨  Expand Medicaid to cover all families up to a             specified income level. By using more generous             financial methodologies and standards, states can expand coverage             under Section 1931 to reach single- and two-parent families with             more income than Medicaid has traditionally covered. Such             expansions present an opportunity for states to recast and market             Medicaid as a freestanding health insurance program for low-income             families, improving the possibility of de-stigmatizing Medicaid and             enhancing the potential of the program to reach families who do not             come into contact with the TANF system. The law leaves states free             to raise their effective income eligibility thresholds for Section             1931 to whatever level they wish.                                   ¨  Phase in expansions.  States can             expand coverage under Section 1931 more narrowly initially and,             based on their evaluation of the expansion and its success in             meeting state welfare reform and health coverage objectives,             consider broadening those expansions further to include families             with more income and/or resources.                                   ¨  Improve the reach of transitional             Medicaid.  The same flexibility under Section 1931             (e.g., income and asset disregards) that states can use to achieve             a broad expansion of coverage can also be used for the narrower             purpose of increasing access to transitional Medicaid for families             who do not come into contact with the TANF system. States can             extend Medicaid to working families temporarily, by using income             and asset disregards that permit families to obtain Medicaid             eligibility for at least three months, and thus give them access to             up to 12 months of transitional Medicaid as well. Such limited             changes in Medicaid rules can ensure that families' success in             attaining self-sufficiency does not preclude their qualifying for             health coverage — a coherent result that supports the twin             goals of reducing the numbers of people without insurance and             supporting state welfare reform initiatives.                                   ¨  Expand coverage to two-parent             families.  States can expand Medicaid to cover more             two-parent families by replacing the 100-hour rule with a broader             definition of unemployment.                                                     Cover children under CHIP.  Under CHIP, enhanced                matching funds are available to states to provide coverage for                uninsured children who are not otherwise eligible for Medicaid.                Coverage can be provided through a Medicaid expansion, a                separate CHIP program, or a combination of both. Under Medicaid                expansions, the usual Medicaid eligibility rules apply. Under a                separate CHIP program, states have flexibility to establish                eligibility requirements.                                     Nearly all states have approved CHIP plans and are                   implementing their programs. States should consider further                   expansions of coverage for uninsured children; such                   expansions promote both health care coverage and welfare                   reform goals by improving health security and providing                   needed support to low-income working families.                                                     States implementing CHIP through a Medicaid expansion can                   claim enhanced Federal matching funds under Title XIX                   (section 1905(u)(2)(B)) for children who become eligible for                   coverage as a result of an expansion of family coverage under                   Section 1931. The enhanced match can be claimed only for                   uninsured children who would not have qualified for Medicaid                   coverage under the Medicaid state plan in effect on March 31,                   1997. The funds claimed for CHIP-eligible children under                   Section 1931 would count against the state's CHIP                   allotment. To claim the enhanced match, states must have a                   means of identifying children who are uninsured and otherwise                   qualify for enhanced Federal matching payments for the                   medical assistance they receive. For children who do not meet                   the criteria for the enhanced match, the state may continue                   to claim its regular Medicaid match.                                                              Cover families under CHIP.  CHIP also grants                states the authority to obtain a ""variance"" to                purchase family coverage that includes coverage of CHIP children                if the state can demonstrate that the cost to the CHIP program                of purchasing the family coverage does not exceed the cost of                obtaining CHIP coverage for the children alone, and that the                family coverage will not otherwise substitute for other health                insurance coverage for the children. While these statutory                constraints limit use of the family coverage option under CHIP,                a few states, including Massachusetts, have utilized this option                to extend coverage to poor working families.                                     It should be noted that a CHIP family coverage program would                   not extend coverage to the parents of children who are                   eligible for Medicaid. To avoid an anomalous result in which                   higher income families are covered under CHIP, but the                   parents of lower-income children lack coverage, states would                   also need to implement a Medicaid expansion under Section                   1931.                                                              Presumptive eligibility for children and pregnant                women.  States have the option to provide presumptive                Medicaid eligibility to children and to pregnant women. Under                Section 1920A of the Social Security Act, certain entities can                determine, based on preliminary information, whether the family                income of a child is within the state's income eligibility                limits for Medicaid. If it is, the child (or, under Section 1920                the pregnant woman) can be granted temporary eligibility for                Medicaid and has until the end of the following month to submit                a full Medicaid application. A similar approach may be used                under a separate CHIP program. It should be noted that states                that use a simplified Medicaid application can also use this                form to establish presumptive eligibility, eliminating the need                for a two-step application. As always, however, an authorized                state employee must make the Medicaid eligibility determination.                                                    Presumptive eligibility provides the opportunity to grant                   immediate health care coverage without first requiring a full                   Medicaid eligibility determination. This option also offers                   the advantage of providing additional ""entry                   points"" into the Medicaid system because health care                   providers and others can grant temporary coverage on the spot                   when children and pregnant women go to receive health care                   services and other forms of assistance.                                                     Under the law, the entities that can establish presumptive                   eligibility for children include: Medicaid providers,                   entities that determine eligibility for Head Start, WIC, and                   child care subsidies under the Child Care and Development                   Block Grant, and other entities designated by the state.                   Presumptive eligibility for pregnant women can be established                   by specified entities likely to have contact with pregnant                   women seeking pregnancy-related services. While TANF offices                   are not specifically mentioned in the statute, TANF offices                   can establish presumptive eligibility if they determine                   eligibility for one of the programs listed.                                                              Continuous eligibility for children.  Under                Section 1902(e)(12) of the Social Security Act, states may grant                continuous Medicaid eligibility to children under age 19 for up                to 12 months, even if there is a change in family income,                assets, or composition. Such eligibility must end when the child                reaches age 19. By granting children eligibility for up to one                year without regard to changes in circumstances, states can                minimize the burden on families seeking to maintain coverage for                their children. Most importantly, continuous eligibility can                minimize coverage losses among children that occur because                families are in financial transition and because recertification                requirements impose barriers to continued participation.                                                                                    Administrative Strategies and             Considerations                                    States may want to consider some or all of the following             administrative strategies and other measures to improve outreach             and increase coverage of low-income families with children:                                                     Create application sites outside the welfare                office.  States may make Medicaid applications regularly                available at sites outside of welfare offices. For example,                sites can be established at state or county offices that handle                child care subsidies or at ""Medicaid-only"" offices.                States may also place eligibility workers at locations that                provide services to low-income families (see just below) subject                to the regulations on outstationing cited on page 19. Federal                law does not limit states' options along these lines as long                as all final eligibility determinations are performed by state                personnel who are authorized by the state to perform these                functions. This approach can help promote the program as one                that offers health insurance coverage to low-income families,                generally, and not just to families receiving TANF.                                             Place Medicaid and CHIP eligibility workers in                communities.  The opportunity to apply for Medicaid or                CHIP can be enhanced by placing outreach and eligibility workers                in locations where they are likely to interact with low-income                families who are eligible for those programs (e.g., hospitals,                community and migrant health centers, community action agencies,                schools, community colleges, Head Start programs, and one-stop                career centers).                                     Medicaid permits only authorized state eligibility workers to                   evaluate the information on the application and supporting                   documentation and to make eligibility determinations. But                   other individuals, including volunteers, provider and                   contractor employees and TANF workers may take applications                   at the outstation locations described on page 19, and perform                   initial processing activities, including interactions with                   applicants. The regulations on outstationing do not prohibit                   the use of volunteers to help applicants complete                   applications at sites other than outstation locations.                   Therefore, states can work with a very broad range of public                   and private organizations to identify eligible families,                   educate them about Medicaid and CHIP, and have them complete                   applications for health insurance. Again, the evaluation of                   Medicaid application information and the eligibility                   determination itself must be performed by state personnel who                   are authorized by the state to perform these functions.                                                     States have greater flexibility to determine the sites where                   non-Medicaid CHIP applications may be taken and who may                   conduct initial application processing activities and make                   eligibility determinations.                                                              Improve the availability of application sites.                 It is important that states make it easy for low-income                families, including working families, to apply for Medicaid and                CHIP. Keeping application sites open during evening hours and on                weekends makes it more convenient for working families to apply.                                             Simplify the application and enrollment                processes.  Application and enrollment processes should                not be a barrier to low-income families applying for Medicaid.                As noted earlier, states have taken several steps to simplify                the application and enrollment process for children under                Medicaid and CHIP, including simplifying application forms,                reducing documentation requirements, allowing mail-in                applications, and expediting processing of applications. States                also should consider allowing families who are not applying for                TANF to use simplified Medicaid and CHIP applications and                application processes. This approach would facilitate Medicaid                and CHIP participation among these families. (HCFA's                guidance on simplifying the Medicaid and CHIP application and                enrollment processes was provided in a letter to state health                officials dated September 10, 1998, which can be found on the                HCFA website (http://www.cms.hhs.gov).)                                             Educate families.  It is important that                low-incomefamilies understand that the coverage available under                Medicaid and CHIP for families and children is not linked to                receipt of TANF assistance. The misconception that Medicaid                eligibility is linked to TANF is widespread. Vigorous                educational efforts are needed to correct this belief so that                enrollment in Medicaid and CHIP can be maximized.                                             Conduct outreach.  It is critical that                aggressive outreach be conducted to provide Medicaid and CHIP                information to low-income families. States have used a variety                of valuable approaches to help them locate children and                facilitate their enrollment in Medicaid and CHIP, which should                also be used to reach out to low-income families as a whole.                They include:                                     ¨ implementing a toll-free telephone hotline for                   enrollment information;                                                     ¨ placing billboards and posters in places frequented by                   low-income families;                                                     ¨ producing public service announcements for radio and                   television;                                                     ¨ distributing information through other public and                   private programs designed for low-income families (e.g.,                   child care, Head Start, food pantries, one-stop centers, and                   community-based organizations);                                                     ¨ stationing state eligibility workers in places                   frequented by low-income families, such as TANF offices, WIC                   offices, hospitals, and one-stop centers); and,                                                     ¨ working with local community-based organizations to                   develop creative outreach programs.                                                     States should also maximize publication of the national                   toll-free number that automatically connects callers with the                   CHIP program in their state. The number is 1-877-KIDS-NOW.                                                              Integrate health and social service systems.                 States should aim to integrate their programs to ensure that                low-income families receiving any of an array of services learn                about and apply for Medicaid and CHIP. The recently enacted                Workforce Investment Act (WIA) promoted this concept by                establishing an innovative ""one-stop"" system designed                to provide a comprehensive array of job training, education, and                employment services at a single neighborhood center. The WIA                specifies several Federal programs and activities that must                participate in each local onestop system. Although not required                partners, the TANF and Medicaid programs can link up with                onestop systems as optional partners, enhancing the support                available to low-income working families and families making the                transition from welfare to selfsufficiency.                                     Several states have taken advantage of this new opportunity.                   For example, the Kenosha County Job Center in Wisconsin has                   combined services, including Medicaid, at its job center.                   Although the one-stop center was initially designed to                   include services fairly directly related to job training,                   job-seeking, and education, it evolved to include Medicaid,                   child support, child care, and Head Start.                                                                                                                                                    Funding Opportunities                                    This chapter sets out the funding sources available under Medicaid,             CHIP, and TANF for outreach activities, systems changes, training,             and other investments critical to supporting compliance with             Medicaid requirements in the new welfare context and to maximizing             health care coverage of low-income families with children. States             have several options for claiming Federal matching funds for their             spending on efforts to find and enroll families and children in             Medicaid and CHIP. The Medicaid and CHIP funds for outreach were             described in detail in a January 23, 1998 letter to state health             officials (available at http://www.cms.hhs.gov) highlighting new             and existing opportunities for outreach to uninsured children. In             addition, options to receive Federal funds for outreach spending             are available under TANF. These options are described below.                                    Medicaid             Funds                                    Medicaid law does not limit the amount of money a state can spend             on outreach efforts to enroll people in Medicaid. The Federal             government will match such spending dollar for dollar. In addition,             a special $500 million Medicaid fund was created under the welfare             reform law to help states with the additional administrative costs             of eligibility determinations resulting from the delinkage of             Medicaid from welfare eligibility and the establishment of Section             1931. These funds are available for matching certain allowable             administrative expenditures incurred by states during the first             three years in which the states' TANF programs are in effect.             State spending is matched by the Federal government at either a 90             percent or a 75 percent rate. (For more details, see the notice             published in the  Federal Register  on May 14, 1997, Vol. 62,             No. 93, pages 26545-26550.)                                   Each state has an allocation from the $500 million fund from which             it can claim matching funds. Each state's allocation is             composed of a ""base allocation"" and a ""secondary             allocation."" The base allocation for each state is $2 million;             the secondary allocation varies by state based on state-specific             factors. Federal matching funds are available from the base             allocation at the enhanced matching rate of 90 percent for             allowable administrative activities (including outreach),             regardless of the type of activity. Federal matching funds are             available from the secondary allocation at enhanced matching rates             of either 90 percent or 75 percent, depending on the type of             activity. Activities whose costs are claimable from the secondary             allocation at the enhanced rate of 90 percent include: educational             activities, public service announcements, outstationing of             eligibility workers, training, outreach, developing and             disseminating new publications, and local community activities.             Activities whose costs are claimable from the secondary allocation             at the enhanced rate of 75 percent include: hiring new eligibility             workers, designing new eligibility forms, identifying at-risk TANF             recipients, intergovernmental activities, and eligibility systems             changes.                                   In order to be allowable, activities must be attributable to             administrative costs of eligibility determinations that are             incurred due to the enactment of Section 1931. However, it is clear             that outreach efforts conducted by states to implement the             provisions of Section 1931 may also result in Medicaid eligibility             determination activities for individuals covered under other             groups. It is neither administratively efficient nor practical,             with respect to claims for Section 1931 outreach activities, to             distinguish between activities resulting in eligibility             determination under Section 1931 and activities related to Medicaid             eligibility under other statutory authorities. Therefore, so long             as the outreach activities are designed principally to address the             eligibility determinations related to Section 1931, states may             claim the costs of such activities at the enhanced Federal matching             rate.                                    CHIP             Funds                                    State spending on CHIP-related outreach activities is matched from             the state's CHIP allotment. States may spend up to 10 percent             of their total CHIP expenditures (Federal and state) on non-benefit             activities, including outreach. These expenditures are matched at             the enhanced CHIP matching rate. At state option, outreach             activities related to a CHIP Medicaid expansion can be matched             either from the state's CHIP allotment (at the CHIP enhanced             matching rate) or at the regular Medicaid administrative matching             rate. If a state elects to claim the CHIP match rate for outreach             expenditures related to the CHIP Medicaid expansion, then the             Federal matching payments count against 10 percent limit and the             CHIP allotment. If the state exceeds either limit, it may claim             matching for the additional costs of these activities at the             regular administrative matching rate under the Medicaid program.                                    TANF             Funds                                    States can also use their Federal TANF or state             maintenance-of-effort (MOE) funds for outreach and training             activities for Medicaid and CHIP. However, MOE funds cannot be used             as state Medicaid matching funds. While Section 408(a)(6) of the             Social Security Act prohibits the use of Federal TANF funds to             provide medical services (except for pre-pregnancy family planning             services), TANF funds can be used for non-medical services, such as             outreach to ensure medical coverage.

The focus of this letter is not on health reform demonstration projects also conducted under section 1115. Below are guidelines regarding the interpretation of section 1931 of title XIX as added by section 114 of PRWORA, continuation of title XIX waivers under section 1115 welfare reform demonstrations, budget neutrality, evaluation requirements, and the process for informing HCFA of your intent to continue waivers. In addition, a list of  Questions and Answers  on related issues is attached. The Medicaid Bureau has issued a  ""State Medicaid Manual""  that outlines basic policies related to the impact of welfare reform on Medicaid outside of waiver situations.    The welfare reform demonstration projects approved under the authority of section 1115 primarily involve waivers of pre-welfare reform title IV-A. Many of these projects also involve waivers of provisions of title XIX and/or provisions of the Food Stamp Act of 1977. In addition, States have been granted Costs Not Otherwise Matchable (CNOM) authority under section 1115(a)(2) as part of their demonstrations by both the Administration for Children and Families and HCFA. This authority allows States to receive Federal matching payments for specified expenditures that would not ordinarily be matchable. These expenditures are usually incurred as the result of eligibility liberalizations affecting the AFDC and/or Medicaid programs. The most common example of a CNOM granted by HCFA allows for the extension of transitional Medicaid benefits beyond the 12 months provided for in section 1925. As part of welfare reform demonstrations, HCFA has also granted CNOMs to many States to liberalize the section 1925 eligibility requirements for transitional Medicaid benefits (e.g., not requiring that individuals receive AFDC in 3 of the 6 months prior to becoming ineligible for AFDC due to employment). The term ""waiver"" as used below, should be understood to include both the actual waivers and CNOMs. The PRWORA directly affects only waivers of pre-welfare reform title IV-A provisions. Waivers of title XIX granted by HCFA as part of welfare reform demonstrations are not affected.    Interpretation of section 1931 relating to title IV-A waivers    Section 1931(d) permits States to continue certain waivers of provisions of the pre-welfare reform title IV-A that affect Medicaid eligibility. These waivers may be continued whether or not a State elects to continue any other title IV-A or title XIX provisions of its welfare reform demonstration.    Section 1931(b)(1) defines the basic criteria for determining Medicaid eligibility based upon AFDC eligibility criteria. These criteria include the income and resource standards and methodologies for determining eligibility under the title IV-A State plan that was in effect on July 16, 1996, and the State plan deprivation and specified relative rules that were in effect on that date. (The ""title IV-A State plan that was in effect on July 16, 1996"" refers to your AFDC State plan itself and not to any waivers of title IV-A you may have had in effect on that date.)    Section 1931(b)(2) provides some flexibility for a State to change these criteria. In particular, section 1931(b)(2)(C) allows States to use less restrictive income and resource methodologies than were used under the title IV-A State plan in effect on July 16, 1996. In many, if not most cases, this authority can be used to adopt more liberal policies which previously required use of the waiver authority. Many of the policies in your current (or pending) welfare reform demonstration projects can now be adopted or modified for determinations of Medicaid eligibility simply by submitting a Medicaid State plan amendment. In this case, you will not need to use section 1931(d) authority to continue waivers of pre-welfare reform title IV-A, as explained below.    Section 1931(d) permits the State to continue indefinitely any provision approved under waivers of the pre-welfare reform title IV-A affecting Medicaid eligibility if it was granted by the Department as of July 16, 1996, or submitted to the Department before August 22, 1996, and approved by the Secretary on or before July 1, 1997. However, section 1931(d) authorizes the continuation only of title IV-A waivers affecting Medicaid eligibility as established by section 1931(b) criteria, i.e., income and resource standards and methodologies, deprivation, and specified relative requirements. States cannot continue waivers under section 1931(d) that involve, for example, sanctions restricting Medicaid eligibility.    A State may decide prior to the expiration of its existing welfare reform demonstration project to exercise the option under section 1931(d) to continue for an indefinite period specified waivers of the pre-welfare reform title IV-A after the expiration of the demonstration project. If a State also dropped its Medicaid waivers, it would actually be discontinuing the Medicaid component of the welfare reform demonstration, but it would be retaining waivers of pre-welfare reform title IV-A provisions that affect Medicaid eligibility.    Some States with section 1115 welfare reform demonstrations have a special term and condition protecting the Medicaid eligibility of individuals who are terminated from AFDC due to AFDC demonstration provisions. With minor variations from State to State, the term and condition reads as follows:    For the purposes of Medicaid coverage, all individuals subject to the provisions of the demonstration will retain their Medicaid eligibility if they would have been eligible in the absence of these [AFDC] demonstration provisions.    The authority in section 1931(d) does not relieve a State of its responsibility to comply with the terms and conditions under which the waivers were granted. It only permits a State to continue a waiver subject to the limitations that apply to the waiver. The term and condition was added to assure that title IV-A demonstration waivers do not negatively affect Medicaid eligibility. In our review of your State's request for continuation of title IV-A waivers under section 1931(d), we will determine if your request is consistent with the term and condition, if this term and condition is part of your State's demonstration.    Continuation of title XIX waivers    Many States with welfare reform demonstrations also received waivers of title XIX, which expire at the end of the demonstration. However, States may elect to terminate their title XIX waivers at any time prior to expiration of the demonstration. This decision is independent of the decision to continue pre-welfare reform title IV-A waivers that affect Medicaid eligibility, as provided for in section 1931(d).    Budget neutrality for title XIX waivers    States will not be required to demonstrate budget neutrality for previously accrued cost liabilities if they elect to terminate existing title XIX waivers. Also, States will not be required to demonstrate budget neutrality for liabilities accrued in the future if they choose to continue their existing title XIX waivers. In the case of continued waivers, budget neutrality will be forgiven through the expiration date of the welfare reform demonstration. On the other hand, any new Medicaid waivers that are approved after August 22, 1996, will be subject to a budget neutrality test. This includes waivers approved as amendments to existing demonstrations as well as any Medicaid waivers a State may request as part of a new demonstration project.    Evaluation requirements    States with continued or newly approved Medicaid waivers will be required to conduct an evaluation. Because these are demonstration projects, States will be expected to assess the impact of the Medicaid waivers (especially extended Medicaid transitional benefits). Use of a control group design is strongly recommended, although States may propose other designs expected to yield reliable results.    Process for informing HCFA of intent to continue waivers    Each State must select one of the following options regarding its existing Medicaid waivers (including Costs Not Otherwise Matchable authority).

With regard to the two sets of options listed above, a State may elect to continue some or all of its title XIX waivers and also some or all of its pre-welfare reform waivers of title IV-A affecting Medicaid eligibility. Another possibility is for a State to terminate all Medicaid waivers and keep some or all of its pre-welfare reform title IV-A waivers affecting Medicaid eligibility (but no other title IV-A waivers). The latter scenario is equivalent to discontinuing the Medicaid component of the welfare reform demonstration. If your State chooses either of these two approaches, please notify the demonstration project officer in writing and also submit a Medicaid State plan amendment to your HCFA Regional Office in order to incorporate the policies regarding Medicaid eligibility that are to be continued.    Sincerely,    Barbara S. Cooper    Acting Director    Office of Research and Demonstrations    Enclosure    cc:    HCFA Regional Administrators    HCFA Associate Regional Administrators for Medicaid    Lloyd Bishop, OLIGA    Olivia Golden, Acting Assistant Secretary, Administration for Children and Families    State Welfare Reform Demonstration Project Officers    Jennifer Bexendall, NGA    Lee Partridge, APWA    Joy Wilson, NCSL                 QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS    1) May a State continue its section 1115 Medicaid waivers granted by HCFA as part of a welfare reform demonstration if it decides to drop the ACF portion of the welfare reform demonstration?    Yes. In many cases, States can accomplish their welfare reform objectives under PRWORA, and so no longer need all (or possibly any) of the title IV-A waivers they received as part of their welfare reform demonstrations. In addition, a State may decide to continue only those title IV-A waivers affecting Medicaid eligibility, in accordance with section 1931(d) of PRWORA. However, a State may elect to retain any or all of its Medicaid waivers and Costs Not Otherwise Matchable authority, regardless of what it decides to do with its title IV-A waivers.    2) What policies in a welfare reform demonstration project can be adopted for determinations of Medicaid eligibility through a Medicaid State plan amendment rather than continuation of a waiver of pre-welfare reform title IV-A? Please provide examples.    A State may use a Medicaid State plan amendment to adopt more liberal methods of determining either countable income and resources or deprivation. A Medicaid State plan amendment may also be used to adopt less restrictive policies concerning the requirement that a child live with a specified relative. Any policy adopted by a Medicaid State plan amendment must apply to all determinations of Medicaid eligibility under the new eligibility group created by section 1931.    Example 1.  Under a welfare reform demonstration project, a State has been granted a waiver of section 402(a)(8)(B) to enable the State to disregard the first $100 of earned income and « of the remainder. This is more liberal than the $30 and 1/3 disregard in the title IV-A State plan in effect on July 16, 1996 and can be implemented by a Medicaid State plan amendment. The State does not need to continue the title IV-A waiver of section 402(a)(8)(B).    Example 2.  As part of its welfare reform demonstration, a State has been granted a waiver of 45 CFR 233.20(a)(3)(I)(B)(2) to enable the State to exclude one car of any value. This is more liberal than the $1,500 exclusion in the title IV-A State plan on July 16, 1996 and can be implemented by a Medicaid State plan amendment. The State does not need to continue the waiver of title 45.    In addition, a State with pending title IV-A waivers submitted prior to August 22, 1996, involving more liberal methods of determining either countable income and resources or deprivation can implement these more liberal methods through a Medicaid State plan amendment rather than by obtaining waivers of pre-welfare reform title IV-A.    3) Does section 415 of PRWORA have any applicability to Medicaid waivers in welfare reform demonstrations?    This section of the law permits States to continue all or some of the title IV-A demonstration waivers granted under section 1115 of the Social Security Act either in effect as of August 22, 1996, or submitted prior to August 22, 1996, and approved on or before July 1, 1997. These title IV-A waivers may remain in effect until the expiration of the welfare reform demonstration (without regard to any extensions). However, section 415 does not address the continuation of Medicaid waivers granted as part of a welfare reform demonstration and so does not apply to Medicaid.    4) May existing substate demonstrations involving Medicaid waivers be extended statewide?    No. These demonstrations were approved to test provisions on a limited geographic basis. There is no rationale for automatically extending them statewide. However, if a State were to propose an expansion that would be budget neutral, HCFA would consider it.    However, a State may apply title IV-A waivers affecting Medicaid eligibility under section 1931(d) on a statewide basis if these waivers had previously been applied to a statewide treatment group as part of the randomized design required by ACF as part of the previous welfare reform demonstration. In other words, the State could apply the title IV-A waivers to individuals who had been in the control group during the previous welfare reform demonstration.    5) May States with section 1115 health reform demonstrations cover individuals as uninsured if they lose Medicaid eligibility because of welfare reform?    States will not be able to cover new qualified immigrants during the 5-year bar as uninsured individuals under health reform demonstrations. For States that cover the uninsured as part of their health reform demonstrations, these States may cover other individuals who lose eligibility for Medicaid by virtue of the loss of eligibility for SSI if these individuals otherwise meet the eligibility requirements for the uninsured of the health reform demonstrations.    6) May States with section 1115 health reform demonstrations expand eligibility through a State plan amendment using the less-restrictive-methodology provision in welfare reform?    States with section 1115 health reform demonstrations may expand eligibility using the State plan amendment process. However, they will need to discuss budget neutrality considerations with HCFA prior to submitting any State plan amendments.

The focus of this letter is not on health reform demonstration projects also conducted under section 1115. Below are guidelines regarding the interpretation of section 1931 of title XIX as added by section 114 of PRWORA, continuation of title XIX waivers under section 1115 welfare reform demonstrations, budget neutrality, evaluation requirements, and the process for informing HCFA of your intent to continue waivers. In addition, a list of  Questions and Answers  on related issues is attached. The Medicaid Bureau has issued a  ""State Medicaid Manual""  that outlines basic policies related to the impact of welfare reform on Medicaid outside of waiver situations.    The welfare reform demonstration projects approved under the authority of section 1115 primarily involve waivers of pre-welfare reform title IV-A. Many of these projects also involve waivers of provisions of title XIX and/or provisions of the Food Stamp Act of 1977. In addition, States have been granted Costs Not Otherwise Matchable (CNOM) authority under section 1115(a)(2) as part of their demonstrations by both the Administration for Children and Families and HCFA. This authority allows States to receive Federal matching payments for specified expenditures that would not ordinarily be matchable. These expenditures are usually incurred as the result of eligibility liberalizations affecting the AFDC and/or Medicaid programs. The most common example of a CNOM granted by HCFA allows for the extension of transitional Medicaid benefits beyond the 12 months provided for in section 1925. As part of welfare reform demonstrations, HCFA has also granted CNOMs to many States to liberalize the section 1925 eligibility requirements for transitional Medicaid benefits (e.g., not requiring that individuals receive AFDC in 3 of the 6 months prior to becoming ineligible for AFDC due to employment). The term ""waiver"" as used below, should be understood to include both the actual waivers and CNOMs. The PRWORA directly affects only waivers of pre-welfare reform title IV-A provisions. Waivers of title XIX granted by HCFA as part of welfare reform demonstrations are not affected.    Interpretation of section 1931 relating to title IV-A waivers    Section 1931(d) permits States to continue certain waivers of provisions of the pre-welfare reform title IV-A that affect Medicaid eligibility. These waivers may be continued whether or not a State elects to continue any other title IV-A or title XIX provisions of its welfare reform demonstration.    Section 1931(b)(1) defines the basic criteria for determining Medicaid eligibility based upon AFDC eligibility criteria. These criteria include the income and resource standards and methodologies for determining eligibility under the title IV-A State plan that was in effect on July 16, 1996, and the State plan deprivation and specified relative rules that were in effect on that date. (The ""title IV-A State plan that was in effect on July 16, 1996"" refers to your AFDC State plan itself and not to any waivers of title IV-A you may have had in effect on that date.)    Section 1931(b)(2) provides some flexibility for a State to change these criteria. In particular, section 1931(b)(2)(C) allows States to use less restrictive income and resource methodologies than were used under the title IV-A State plan in effect on July 16, 1996. In many, if not most cases, this authority can be used to adopt more liberal policies which previously required use of the waiver authority. Many of the policies in your current (or pending) welfare reform demonstration projects can now be adopted or modified for determinations of Medicaid eligibility simply by submitting a Medicaid State plan amendment. In this case, you will not need to use section 1931(d) authority to continue waivers of pre-welfare reform title IV-A, as explained below.    Section 1931(d) permits the State to continue indefinitely any provision approved under waivers of the pre-welfare reform title IV-A affecting Medicaid eligibility if it was granted by the Department as of July 16, 1996, or submitted to the Department before August 22, 1996, and approved by the Secretary on or before July 1, 1997. However, section 1931(d) authorizes the continuation only of title IV-A waivers affecting Medicaid eligibility as established by section 1931(b) criteria, i.e., income and resource standards and methodologies, deprivation, and specified relative requirements. States cannot continue waivers under section 1931(d) that involve, for example, sanctions restricting Medicaid eligibility.    A State may decide prior to the expiration of its existing welfare reform demonstration project to exercise the option under section 1931(d) to continue for an indefinite period specified waivers of the pre-welfare reform title IV-A after the expiration of the demonstration project. If a State also dropped its Medicaid waivers, it would actually be discontinuing the Medicaid component of the welfare reform demonstration, but it would be retaining waivers of pre-welfare reform title IV-A provisions that affect Medicaid eligibility.    Some States with section 1115 welfare reform demonstrations have a special term and condition protecting the Medicaid eligibility of individuals who are terminated from AFDC due to AFDC demonstration provisions. With minor variations from State to State, the term and condition reads as follows:    For the purposes of Medicaid coverage, all individuals subject to the provisions of the demonstration will retain their Medicaid eligibility if they would have been eligible in the absence of these [AFDC] demonstration provisions.    The authority in section 1931(d) does not relieve a State of its responsibility to comply with the terms and conditions under which the waivers were granted. It only permits a State to continue a waiver subject to the limitations that apply to the waiver. The term and condition was added to assure that title IV-A demonstration waivers do not negatively affect Medicaid eligibility. In our review of your State's request for continuation of title IV-A waivers under section 1931(d), we will determine if your request is consistent with the term and condition, if this term and condition is part of your State's demonstration.    Continuation of title XIX waivers    Many States with welfare reform demonstrations also received waivers of title XIX, which expire at the end of the demonstration. However, States may elect to terminate their title XIX waivers at any time prior to expiration of the demonstration. This decision is independent of the decision to continue pre-welfare reform title IV-A waivers that affect Medicaid eligibility, as provided for in section 1931(d).    Budget neutrality for title XIX waivers    States will not be required to demonstrate budget neutrality for previously accrued cost liabilities if they elect to terminate existing title XIX waivers. Also, States will not be required to demonstrate budget neutrality for liabilities accrued in the future if they choose to continue their existing title XIX waivers. In the case of continued waivers, budget neutrality will be forgiven through the expiration date of the welfare reform demonstration. On the other hand, any new Medicaid waivers that are approved after August 22, 1996, will be subject to a budget neutrality test. This includes waivers approved as amendments to existing demonstrations as well as any Medicaid waivers a State may request as part of a new demonstration project.    Evaluation requirements    States with continued or newly approved Medicaid waivers will be required to conduct an evaluation. Because these are demonstration projects, States will be expected to assess the impact of the Medicaid waivers (especially extended Medicaid transitional benefits). Use of a control group design is strongly recommended, although States may propose other designs expected to yield reliable results.    Process for informing HCFA of intent to continue waivers    Each State must select one of the following options regarding its existing Medicaid waivers (including Costs Not Otherwise Matchable authority). Medicaid waivers may be continued only through the end of the welfare reform demonstration.    1) Continue all Medicaid waivers    2) Continue only some Medicaid waivers    3) Continue none of the Medicaid waivers    In addition, each State must select one of the following options regarding its existing waivers of pre-welfare reform title IV-A affecting Medicaid eligibility (i.e., income and resource standards and methodologies, deprivation, and specified relative rules). This group of waivers may be continued indefinitely.    1) Continue all pre-welfare reform title IV-A waivers eligible for continuation under section 1931    2) Continue only some of the pre-welfare reform title IV-A waivers eligible for continuation under section 1931    3) Continue none of the title pre-welfare reform IV-A waivers eligible for continuation under section 1931    Your decisions regarding these two groups of waivers, including a list of the specific waivers and CNOMs to be continued (if any), should be communicated in writing to the HCFA project officer who is responsible for the demonstration(s) in your State.

A Medicaid State plan amendment may also be used to adopt less restrictive policies concerning the requirement that a child live with a specified relative.

With minor variations from State to State, the term and condition reads as follows:    For the purposes of Medicaid coverage, all individuals subject to the provisions of the demonstration will retain their Medicaid eligibility if they would have been eligible in the absence of these [AFDC] demonstration provisions.    The authority in section 1931(d) does not relieve a State of its responsibility to comply with the terms and conditions under which the waivers were granted. It only permits a State to continue a waiver subject to the limitations that apply to the waiver. The term and condition was added to assure that title IV-A demonstration waivers do not negatively affect Medicaid eligibility. In our review of your State's request for continuation of title IV-A waivers under section 1931(d), we will determine if your request is consistent with the term and condition, if this term and condition is part of your State's demonstration.    Continuation of title XIX waivers    Many States with welfare reform demonstrations also received waivers of title XIX, which expire at the end of the demonstration. However, States may elect to terminate their title XIX waivers at any time prior to expiration of the demonstration. This decision is independent of the decision to continue pre-welfare reform title IV-A waivers that affect Medicaid eligibility, as provided for in section 1931(d).    Budget neutrality for title XIX waivers    States will not be required to demonstrate budget neutrality for previously accrued cost liabilities if they elect to terminate existing title XIX waivers. Also, States will not be required to demonstrate budget neutrality for liabilities accrued in the future if they choose to continue their existing title XIX waivers. In the case of continued waivers, budget neutrality will be forgiven through the expiration date of the welfare reform demonstration. On the other hand, any new Medicaid waivers that are approved after August 22, 1996, will be subject to a budget neutrality test. This includes waivers approved as amendments to existing demonstrations as well as any Medicaid waivers a State may request as part of a new demonstration project.    Evaluation requirements    States with continued or newly approved Medicaid waivers will be required to conduct an evaluation. Because these are demonstration projects, States will be expected to assess the impact of the Medicaid waivers (especially extended Medicaid transitional benefits). Use of a control group design is strongly recommended, although States may propose other designs expected to yield reliable results.    Process for informing HCFA of intent to continue waivers    Each State must select one of the following options regarding its existing Medicaid waivers (including Costs Not Otherwise Matchable authority). Medicaid waivers may be continued only through the end of the welfare reform demonstration.    1) Continue all Medicaid waivers    2) Continue only some Medicaid waivers    3) Continue none of the Medicaid waivers    In addition, each State must select one of the following options regarding its existing waivers of pre-welfare reform title IV-A affecting Medicaid eligibility (i.e., income and resource standards and methodologies, deprivation, and specified relative rules). This group of waivers may be continued indefinitely.    1) Continue all pre-welfare reform title IV-A waivers eligible for continuation under section 1931    2) Continue only some of the pre-welfare reform title IV-A waivers eligible for continuation under section 1931    3) Continue none of the title pre-welfare reform IV-A waivers eligible for continuation under section 1931    Your decisions regarding these two groups of waivers, including a list of the specific waivers and CNOMs to be continued (if any), should be communicated in writing to the HCFA project officer who is responsible for the demonstration(s) in your State. Please send this information to:    (Name of project officer)    Health Care Financing Administration    Office of State Health Reform Demonstrations    7500 Security Boulevard, Mail Stop C3-18-26    Baltimore, Maryland 21244-1850    Questions may be directed to Alisa Adamo (410) 786-6618, Maria Boulmetis (410) 786-0552, or Joan Peterson, Team Leader (410) 786-0621. These project officers will review the materials you submit. They will also work with you in the coming months to revise your evaluations and remaining terms and conditions for the demonstration, as necessary.    With regard to the two sets of options listed above, a State may elect to continue some or all of its title XIX waivers and also some or all of its pre-welfare reform waivers of title IV-A affecting Medicaid eligibility. Another possibility is for a State to terminate all Medicaid waivers and keep some or all of its pre-welfare reform title IV-A waivers affecting Medicaid eligibility (but no other title IV-A waivers). The latter scenario is equivalent to discontinuing the Medicaid component of the welfare reform demonstration. If your State chooses either of these two approaches, please notify the demonstration project officer in writing and also submit a Medicaid State plan amendment to your HCFA Regional Office in order to incorporate the policies regarding Medicaid eligibility that are to be continued.    Sincerely,    Barbara S. Cooper    Acting Director    Office of Research and Demonstrations    Enclosure    cc:    HCFA Regional Administrators    HCFA Associate Regional Administrators for Medicaid    Lloyd Bishop, OLIGA    Olivia Golden, Acting Assistant Secretary, Administration for Children and Families    State Welfare Reform Demonstration Project Officers    Jennifer Bexendall, NGA    Lee Partridge, APWA    Joy Wilson, NCSL                 QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS    1) May a State continue its section 1115 Medicaid waivers granted by HCFA as part of a welfare reform demonstration if it decides to drop the ACF portion of the welfare reform demonstration?    Yes. In many cases, States can accomplish their welfare reform objectives under PRWORA, and so no longer need all (or possibly any) of the title IV-A waivers they received as part of their welfare reform demonstrations. In addition, a State may decide to continue only those title IV-A waivers affecting Medicaid eligibility, in accordance with section 1931(d) of PRWORA. However, a State may elect to retain any or all of its Medicaid waivers and Costs Not Otherwise Matchable authority, regardless of what it decides to do with its title IV-A waivers.    2) What policies in a welfare reform demonstration project can be adopted for determinations of Medicaid eligibility through a Medicaid State plan amendment rather than continuation of a waiver of pre-welfare reform title IV-A? Please provide examples.    A State may use a Medicaid State plan amendment to adopt more liberal methods of determining either countable income and resources or deprivation. A Medicaid State plan amendment may also be used to adopt less restrictive policies concerning the requirement that a child live with a specified relative. Any policy adopted by a Medicaid State plan amendment must apply to all determinations of Medicaid eligibility under the new eligibility group created by section 1931.    Example 1.  Under a welfare reform demonstration project, a State has been granted a waiver of section 402(a)(8)(B) to enable the State to disregard the first $100 of earned income and « of the remainder. This is more liberal than the $30 and 1/3 disregard in the title IV-A State plan in effect on July 16, 1996 and can be implemented by a Medicaid State plan amendment. The State does not need to continue the title IV-A waiver of section 402(a)(8)(B).    Example 2.  As part of its welfare reform demonstration, a State has been granted a waiver of 45 CFR 233.20(a)(3)(I)(B)(2) to enable the State to exclude one car of any value. This is more liberal than the $1,500 exclusion in the title IV-A State plan on July 16, 1996 and can be implemented by a Medicaid State plan amendment. The State does not need to continue the waiver of title 45.    In addition, a State with pending title IV-A waivers submitted prior to August 22, 1996, involving more liberal methods of determining either countable income and resources or deprivation can implement these more liberal methods through a Medicaid State plan amendment rather than by obtaining waivers of pre-welfare reform title IV-A.    3) Does section 415 of PRWORA have any applicability to Medicaid waivers in welfare reform demonstrations?    This section of the law permits States to continue all or some of the title IV-A demonstration waivers granted under section 1115 of the Social Security Act either in effect as of August 22, 1996, or submitted prior to August 22, 1996, and approved on or before July 1, 1997. These title IV-A waivers may remain in effect until the expiration of the welfare reform demonstration (without regard to any extensions). However, section 415 does not address the continuation of Medicaid waivers granted as part of a welfare reform demonstration and so does not apply to Medicaid.    4) May existing substate demonstrations involving Medicaid waivers be extended statewide?    No. These demonstrations were approved to test provisions on a limited geographic basis. There is no rationale for automatically extending them statewide. However, if a State were to propose an expansion that would be budget neutral, HCFA would consider it.    However, a State may apply title IV-A waivers affecting Medicaid eligibility under section 1931(d) on a statewide basis if these waivers had previously been applied to a statewide treatment group as part of the randomized design required by ACF as part of the previous welfare reform demonstration. In other words, the State could apply the title IV-A waivers to individuals who had been in the control group during the previous welfare reform demonstration.    5) May States with section 1115 health reform demonstrations cover individuals as uninsured if they lose Medicaid eligibility because of welfare reform?    States will not be able to cover new qualified immigrants during the 5-year bar as uninsured individuals under health reform demonstrations. For States that cover the uninsured as part of their health reform demonstrations, these States may cover other individuals who lose eligibility for Medicaid by virtue of the loss of eligibility for SSI if these individuals otherwise meet the eligibility requirements for the uninsured of the health reform demonstrations.    6) May States with section 1115 health reform demonstrations expand eligibility through a State plan amendment using the less-restrictive-methodology provision in welfare reform?    States with section 1115 health reform demonstrations may expand eligibility using the State plan amendment process. However, they will need to discuss budget neutrality considerations with HCFA prior to submitting any State plan amendments.

The focus of this letter is not on health reform demonstration projects also conducted under section 1115. Below are guidelines regarding the interpretation of section 1931 of title XIX as added by section 114 of PRWORA, continuation of title XIX waivers under section 1115 welfare reform demonstrations, budget neutrality, evaluation requirements, and the process for informing HCFA of your intent to continue waivers. In addition, a list of  Questions and Answers  on related issues is attached. The Medicaid Bureau has issued a  ""State Medicaid Manual""  that outlines basic policies related to the impact of welfare reform on Medicaid outside of waiver situations.    The welfare reform demonstration projects approved under the authority of section 1115 primarily involve waivers of pre-welfare reform title IV-A. Many of these projects also involve waivers of provisions of title XIX and/or provisions of the Food Stamp Act of 1977. In addition, States have been granted Costs Not Otherwise Matchable (CNOM) authority under section 1115(a)(2) as part of their demonstrations by both the Administration for Children and Families and HCFA. This authority allows States to receive Federal matching payments for specified expenditures that would not ordinarily be matchable. These expenditures are usually incurred as the result of eligibility liberalizations affecting the AFDC and/or Medicaid programs. The most common example of a CNOM granted by HCFA allows for the extension of transitional Medicaid benefits beyond the 12 months provided for in section 1925. As part of welfare reform demonstrations, HCFA has also granted CNOMs to many States to liberalize the section 1925 eligibility requirements for transitional Medicaid benefits (e.g., not requiring that individuals receive AFDC in 3 of the 6 months prior to becoming ineligible for AFDC due to employment). The term ""waiver"" as used below, should be understood to include both the actual waivers and CNOMs. The PRWORA directly affects only waivers of pre-welfare reform title IV-A provisions. Waivers of title XIX granted by HCFA as part of welfare reform demonstrations are not affected.    Interpretation of section 1931 relating to title IV-A waivers    Section 1931(d) permits States to continue certain waivers of provisions of the pre-welfare reform title IV-A that affect Medicaid eligibility. These waivers may be continued whether or not a State elects to continue any other title IV-A or title XIX provisions of its welfare reform demonstration.    Section 1931(b)(1) defines the basic criteria for determining Medicaid eligibility based upon AFDC eligibility criteria. These criteria include the income and resource standards and methodologies for determining eligibility under the title IV-A State plan that was in effect on July 16, 1996, and the State plan deprivation and specified relative rules that were in effect on that date. (The ""title IV-A State plan that was in effect on July 16, 1996"" refers to your AFDC State plan itself and not to any waivers of title IV-A you may have had in effect on that date.)    Section 1931(b)(2) provides some flexibility for a State to change these criteria. In particular, section 1931(b)(2)(C) allows States to use less restrictive income and resource methodologies than were used under the title IV-A State plan in effect on July 16, 1996. In many, if not most cases, this authority can be used to adopt more liberal policies which previously required use of the waiver authority. Many of the policies in your current (or pending) welfare reform demonstration projects can now be adopted or modified for determinations of Medicaid eligibility simply by submitting a Medicaid State plan amendment. In this case, you will not need to use section 1931(d) authority to continue waivers of pre-welfare reform title IV-A, as explained below.    Section 1931(d) permits the State to continue indefinitely any provision approved under waivers of the pre-welfare reform title IV-A affecting Medicaid eligibility if it was granted by the Department as of July 16, 1996, or submitted to the Department before August 22, 1996, and approved by the Secretary on or before July 1, 1997. However, section 1931(d) authorizes the continuation only of title IV-A waivers affecting Medicaid eligibility as established by section 1931(b) criteria, i.e., income and resource standards and methodologies, deprivation, and specified relative requirements. States cannot continue waivers under section 1931(d) that involve, for example, sanctions restricting Medicaid eligibility.    A State may decide prior to the expiration of its existing welfare reform demonstration project to exercise the option under section 1931(d) to continue for an indefinite period specified waivers of the pre-welfare reform title IV-A after the expiration of the demonstration project. If a State also dropped its Medicaid waivers, it would actually be discontinuing the Medicaid component of the welfare reform demonstration, but it would be retaining waivers of pre-welfare reform title IV-A provisions that affect Medicaid eligibility.    Some States with section 1115 welfare reform demonstrations have a special term and condition protecting the Medicaid eligibility of individuals who are terminated from AFDC due to AFDC demonstration provisions. With minor variations from State to State, the term and condition reads as follows:    For the purposes of Medicaid coverage, all individuals subject to the provisions of the demonstration will retain their Medicaid eligibility if they would have been eligible in the absence of these [AFDC] demonstration provisions.    The authority in section 1931(d) does not relieve a State of its responsibility to comply with the terms and conditions under which the waivers were granted. It only permits a State to continue a waiver subject to the limitations that apply to the waiver. The term and condition was added to assure that title IV-A demonstration waivers do not negatively affect Medicaid eligibility. In our review of your State's request for continuation of title IV-A waivers under section 1931(d), we will determine if your request is consistent with the term and condition, if this term and condition is part of your State's demonstration.    Continuation of title XIX waivers    Many States with welfare reform demonstrations also received waivers of title XIX, which expire at the end of the demonstration. However, States may elect to terminate their title XIX waivers at any time prior to expiration of the demonstration. This decision is independent of the decision to continue pre-welfare reform title IV-A waivers that affect Medicaid eligibility, as provided for in section 1931(d).    Budget neutrality for title XIX waivers    States will not be required to demonstrate budget neutrality for previously accrued cost liabilities if they elect to terminate existing title XIX waivers. Also, States will not be required to demonstrate budget neutrality for liabilities accrued in the future if they choose to continue their existing title XIX waivers. In the case of continued waivers, budget neutrality will be forgiven through the expiration date of the welfare reform demonstration.

Section 114 of the law (Section 1931(h) of the Social Security Act) provides a special fund of $500 million for enhanced Federal matching for States' expenditures attributable to the administrative costs of Medicaid eligibility determinations due to the law. The specific features of this provision are described below:     Federal Financial Participation (FFP) Rates     The normal FFP rate for States' administrative costs for eligibility determinations in the Medicaid program is 50 percent. However, under this new law, the Secretary is given discretion to increase the FFP rate above 50 percent, up to a fixed national cap of $500 million for this enhanced funding. This enhanced funding is for extra administrative costs applicable to the increased cost of eligibility determinations due to welfare reform.     National Limitation on Total Funding     The total Federal funds available for enhanced match are limited to $500 million.     Time Limitations     The $500 million initially was made available nationally for expenditures during the Fiscal Years 1997 through 2000. For each state, however, the enhanced funding was available for only the first 12 calendar quarters in which a State's Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) program is in effect after August 21, 1996.   In 602 of the Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999, P.L. 106-113, Congress removed national and state-specific expiration dates for the $500 million fund.  Currently, there is no sunset date, and each state's allotment remains available until exhausted.

Financing the Social Security and Medicare Programs (1) The tax rate schedule for Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI) should be changed so that the program is adequately financed over the next 75 years and maintains, on the average, a contin gency reserve of at least one year's outgo (see Table 4-5 in Chapter 4 for details on the tax schedule). (2) One-half of the cost of the Hospital Insurance program should be financed from general revenues, beginning in 1983. (3) The other half of the Hospital Insurance program should be financed from payroll taxes. The payroll tax rate schedule for Hospital Insurance (HI) should be revised so that the program is adequately financed over the next 75 years and maintains, on the average, a contingency reserve of at least one year's outgo (see Table 4-5 in Chapter 4 for details on the tax schedule). (4) In general, the reduction in the HI payroll tax rates (as described in Recommendations (2) and (3)) should be utilized for the purposes of financing the OASDI program (as described in Recommendation, (1)) .  - Dissenting and supplementary statements of individual Commission members will be found in footnotes in other parts of the report and in Chapter 18.   (5) In recognition of the general-revenues cost for reducing the employee tax rate for Hospital Insurance, a percent surcharge should be added to the Federal personal income tax. (6) The combined employer-employee tax rate for OASDI and HI combined should not exceed 18 percent-09 percent for employers and 9 percent for employees. When this would otherwise occur, the excess over 18 percent is financed from general revenue payments to OASDI (see Table 4-5 in Chapter 4 for details on the tax schedule). (7) The tax rate for the self-employed should continue to be times the employee rate for OASDI and the  same as the employee rate for HI (see Table 4-6 in Chapter 4 for details on the tax schedule). (8) The maximum taxable earnings base for both OASDI and HI for both 1985 and 1986 should be maintained at its 1984 level (estimated to be $39,000) and then auto matically adjusted thereafter. (9) Borrowing should be authorized among the OASI, DI, and HI Trust Funds, on a permanent basis, repayable with interest. (10) As an emergency measure only, borrowing should be authorized by any of the trust funds from the General Treasury until the end of 1985, the. loans to be repayable with interest.   The operations of the OASI , DI , HI, and Supplementary   Medical Insurance Trust Funds should be removed from  the unified budget of the United States government.   The chief actuarial officers should provide a certification in   the annual Trustees Reports as to the assumptions and  methodology used in preparing their actuarial cost estimates  and valuations.   No changes should be made in the financing of the Supple  mentary Medical Insurance program, because it is now  adequately funded.   Payments to the Railroad Retirement Account under the  financial interchange provisions between the Social Security  and Railroad Retirement programs should not be made in  those cases where the Railroad Retirement program does  not pay benefits to the individuals for whom such payments  are made (e.g., divorced widows).   B. Retirement Age under Social Security (1) Beginning in the year 2001, the minimum age at which retirement benefits are available should be increased gradually from 65 to 68, reaching 68 in 2012. The corresponding minimum ages for other types of benefits (including those for spouses, widows, and widowers) should similarly be increased, and this should also be done in tandem for persons claiming reduced . benefits at earlier ages.   (2) Larger increases in benefits should be available for persons who delay retirement beyond the normal retire ment age. (Those reaching 65 before 1982 would not qualify because under present law they are more favorably treated in the computation of benefits with regard to earnings after 65.) C. Earninas Test under Social (1) The earnings test, which measures whether a worker has retired, should be retained. (2) The age at which the earnings test no longer applies, which is scheduled to be lowered from 72 to 70 in 1982, should be left at age 72 (until 2001, when it should move up in tandem with the minimum age for ment benefits). (3) To partially offset the effect of the earnings test in withholding tax-free Social Security benefits, a refundable credit under the Federal income tax should be provided, increasing with the age of the individual. (This would  not be available to those reaching age 65 before 1982 for the reason stated in Recommendation B (2)). D. Benefit Amounts under Social Security (1) The Maximum Family Benefit for disability cases should be increased, so that it is the smaller of (a) 80 percent of the highest 5 consecutive years of earnings (indexed) or (b) the maximum applicable to retirement and survivor benefits.   (2) The special minimum benefit, applicable to persons with long periods of coverage and low earnings, should be changed by increasing the maximum number of years creditable from 30 to 35 and by permitting up  to 10 years of child care (for care of children under age 6) to be counted as creditable -years for these purposes. (3) Widow's and widower's benefits for persons who are widowed before age 60 (and before the deceased spouse reached age 60) should be computed by indexing the earnings record of the deceased worker by wages during the period between death of the worker and the time benefits are payable. (At present, such indexing is done by prices.) (4)  The automatic benefit increases resulting from changes in the Consumer Price Index should be limited when, over a 2-year period, the CPI has risen more rapidly than wages. (The increase should then be reduced by the excess of the 2-year average annual rise in the CPI over that in wages.) This procedure should only be used when the benefit increase which would be based on the CPI rise is 5 percent or more. There should be a retroactive ""catch in  future years, if wages rise more rapidly than the CPI, to make up for such reductions. (5) The automatic benefit increases resulting from changes in the CPI should be based on the CPI for all urban consumers, rather than on that for urban clerical and manual workers only.   (6) A special index to measure price changes for the elderly should be constructed and considered for use in indexing Social Security benefits. Separate indexes should not be  used for every beneficiary group. (7) The windfall portion of benefits arising from periods of noncovered government employment in the future (due to the weighted benefit formula) should be eliminated. E. Disability Benefits under Social Security (1) For the purpose of determining continued eligibility for disability benefits, the dollar amount of Substantial Gainful Activity should be raised to the exempt amount under the retirement earnings test for persons under age (2) The dollar amount used in determining whether a month is included in the trial work period should be indexed for future years by changes in average wages. (3) The Maximum Family Benefit applicable to disability cases should be liberalized (see Recommendation D (1)). ' F. Social Security Hearings and Appeals (1) In disability cases, applicants should be informed of their right to have their treating physician comment on the findings of consultative examinations ordered during the adjudicative process. (2) Administrative Law Judges should hold pre-hearing confer ences when requested by disability represented by counsel. who are   (3) A new Social Security Court should be established to take over the functions of the Federal District Courts in appeals of Social Security cases. (4) Hearings under the Supplementary Medical Insurance program should be conducted by a Federal employee, instead of a representative of the insurance carrier. G. Miscellaneous Social Security Benefit Provisions (1) Child's benefits payable to children aged 18-21 because of school attendance should be suspended for months when the beneficiary is not attending school full-time, and greater efforts should be made to collect overpayments of child school-attendance benefits. (2) When either spouse elects to receive a separate benefit check, the total benefit payable to the two spouses should be divided equally between them. (3) Marriage and remarriage should be eliminated as terminating events for Social Security benefit entitlement.' H. Extension of Social Security and Hospital Insurance Coverage (1) Hospital Insurance coverage should be extended in 1982, on a mandatory basis, to all governmental employees (Federal, State, and local). (2) Social Security coverage should be extended in 1982 (on a mandatory basis) to all governmental employees not now under a retirement system. .   (3) Social Security and Hospital Insurance coverage should be extended in 1982 (on a mandatory basis) to the President, the Vice President, members of the Cabinet, the Commissioner of Social Security, and Members of Congress. Civil Service  Retirement benefits and contributions for these officials should be reduced by the Social Security benefits accruing and the Social Security taxes, respectively. (4) Social Security and Hospital Insurance coverage should be extended in 1982 (on a mandatory basis) to all employees of nonprofit organizations (except that any such organization operated by a religious sect which is opposed to public insurance could opt out). (5) Social Security coverage should be extended in 1985 to all new governmental employees in positions which are covered by a retirement system now in existence. (6) The option for State and local governments and `nonprofit organizations to withdraw from coverage that had previously been elected should be eliminated, after a 1 -year grace period. (7) The portion of benefits accruing for governmental employees who have future periods of noncovered governmental employment which are windfalls should be eliminated (see Recommendation D (7)).   (8) A Federal Employee Benefit Protection Board should be created to review and make recommendations to the President and Congress on the implementation of coverage for Federal employees and how the existing govern ment-employee plans should be modified and coordinated with Social Security and Medicare. The Board should  include representatives of Federal employee organizations. (9) The minimum-earnings requirements for coverage should be increased as follows: domestic workers, from $50 per  quarter to $150; casual labor, from $100 per year to $150 per quarter; and self-employed persons, from $400 per year to $600. (The test of $150 per year for farm workers should be retained, but the alternate test of 20 days per year of work for one employer should be eliminated.) (10) All payments made directly by an employer to an employee on account of sickness should be considered wages, but only for periods up to 6 months after the last month worked . Medicare Benefit Provisions (1) The minimum age for eligibility for Medicare benefits, except in disability cases, should be moved up gradually from 65 to 68, beginning in 2001, in the same manner as Social Security retirement benefits. (2) The waiting period for Medicare .benefits coverage for disabled beneficiaries should be reduced from 24 months on the Social Security roll to 12 months.   (3) A catastrophic cap should be placed on a person's annual cost-sharing payments for Hospital Insurance and Supple mentary Medical Insurance. It should be $2,000 for 1982,  to be indexed in subsequent years by the change in the CPI. (4) Hospital benefits should be determined on a calendar-year basis, rather than a spell-of-illness basis. No more than one initial deductible should be payable in any one year. (5) The daily coinsurance for hospital benefits should be changed from 25 percent of the initial deductible for days 61-90 (and 50 percent for the lifetime reserve of 60 days) to 10 percent for days 51-100 and 5 percent for days 150, with no lifetime reserve days. The initial deductible would remain the only cost sharing for the first 50 days. (6) Home health visits should be reimbursed under Supple mentary Medical Insurance, except for persons who have only Hospital Insurance, who would be reimbursed under that program. .  (7) The maximum benefit for outpatient psychiatric services under Supplementary Medical Insurance should be increased from $250 to $375 per year. The services of  community health centers should be reimbursed. (8) Benefits should be paid for hospital care outside of the United States which is not now covered. The maximum amount of the benefit would be at the rate of 50 percent of the initial deductible per day of hospitalization, less the usual cost-sharing payments.   (9) The costs of laboratory services for hospital inpatients should be billed under the Hospital Insurance program, rather than under Supplementary Medical Insurance, even when the services are provided through an outside laboratory. J. Medicare Reimbursement and Health Care Costs (1) Experiments with negotiated fee schedules for physicians and prospective reimbursement for hospitals should be continued and extended. (2) Medicare and Medicaid should not be used as instruments to limit the rise in health care costs. However; the programs  should encourage further experimentation with groups Ii ke Health Maintenance Organizations. Federal and State  governments should encourage competition in the delivery of health care services in order to restrain cost increases. (3) Hospitals participating in Medicare should retain the right to nominate intermediaries. K. S upplemental Security Income (1) Payments under the Supplemental Security Income program should be increased by 25 percent, and recipients should no longer be eligible for food stamps. States should be ,  required to maintain their current level of supplementation. (2) The assets test for eligibility should be eliminated. (3) The reduction of one-third in the basic payment when the recipient lives with others should be eliminated.   (4) The general income disregard should be increased from $20 to $40 and, in the future, should be indexed by the CPI. (5) The earned income disregard should be indexed to changes in the level of wages, beginning in 1981. (6) SSI payments should be indexed in the same manner as Social Security benefits, including a maximum limit in periods when wages rise less rapidly than prices. L. Medicaid (1) All individuals whose income is 65 percent or less of the poverty standard should be eligible for Medicaid. This should be a requirement for Federal approval of a State's Medicaid plan. (2) The ""medically needy"" should be eligible for Medicaid (with a spend-down provision), with a effort provision being applicable to the States. (3) Medicaid eligibility for disabled recipients of Supplemental Security Income should not terminate before the person becomes entitled to Medicare, in cases where ineligibility is based solely on receipt of Disability Insurance benefits. (4) The States' option to base Medicaid eligibility for SSI recip ients on 1972 Medicaid standards, resulting in some SSI recipients not being eligible for Medicaid, should be eliminated. (5) Reimbursement to physicians for Medicaid should be raised to the levels paid by Medicare.   (6) Coverage of abortions under Medicaid should be the same as that for any other covered medical procedure. M. Proqram Administration (1) An independent government agency should be established to administer the Social Security, Medicare, Supplemental Security Income, and Medicaid programs. (2) Additional resources should be made available to improve the administration and delivery of services to beneficiaries. Arbitrary limits on personnel and resources for the adminis tration of these programs should be eliminated. (3) Social Security District Offices should have at least one specialist in disability cases and also staff trained to provide information about Medicare, and efforts should be made to tell beneficiaries that such information is available. (4) The W-2 income tax forms should provide more specific information as to the meaning of terms and of the Social Security and Hospital Insurance payroll taxes. N. Private Pensions (1) should not be required by law to establish pension programs for their employees. (2) The present $1,500 annual limit on contributions which can be made under the individual Retirement Account (I RA) program should be increased. .   0.  Other Recommendations (1) The States should be encouraged to establish standards of eligibility under needs-tested programs for persons who divest themselves of assets, within the limits prescribed under present law. A separate program should be established to provide term care for the aged and the chronically disabled. It should include nursing home services, home health and homemaker services, adult day-care, and nutritional services."

Long term care can mean many different things but any chronic or disabling condition that requires nursing care or constant supervision can bring on the need for long term care services. Long term care means not only care in a nursing home, it can also mean nursing care in your own home and help with the activities of daily living, such as dressing, eating, bathing and taking medicine.  There are many different services that would fall under the definition of long term care. These services include institutional care, i.e., nursing facilities, or noninstitutional care such as home health care, personal care, adult day care, long term home health care, respite care and hospice care.  Nursing homes in New York State are licensed under the Public Health Law as nursing facilities.   2  There are other long term care services that provide people with an option other than nursing home care. These services are defined below:  Home health care health aide services.  consists of services received in your home, and can  include skilled nursing care, speech, physical or occupational therapy or home  Home care (personal care)  consists of assistance with personal hygiene,  dressing or feeding, nutritional or support functions and health-related tasks.  Adult day care  is for persons living at home, and provides supervision for  elderly persons during the day when family members are not at home. It is a method of delivering a variety and range of services including social and recreational, and in some cases, health services, in a group setting.  Assisted living facilities living or a cognitive impairment.  provide ongoing care and related services to  support those needs resulting from a person's inability to perform activities of daily  An alternate level of care in a hospital  is care received as a hospital  inpatient when there is no medical necessity for being in the hospital and is for those persons waiting to be placed in a nursing home or while arrangements are being made for home care.   3  Respite care  includes services that can provide family members a rest or  vacation from their caregiving responsibilities. It can be provided in a variety of settings including an individual's home or a nursing home.  Hospice care of six months or less.  is a program of care and treatment, either in a hospice care  facility or in the home, for persons who are terminally ill and have a life expectancy   4  THE NEED FOR INSURANCE COVERAGE OF LONG TERM CARE SERVICES Long term care is very expensive, and most people cannot afford to privately pay for long term care services for very long. In New York State, skilled nursing facilities currently charge over $228 per day on average or $83,000 per year or more. In the New York City Metropolitan Area, which includes the five boroughs of New York City, Long Island and Westchester County, the average skilled nursing facility charge is about $272 per day or about $99,000 per year. It is estimated that persons in nursing homes stay for 2 years on average.  Home health care is also expensive. In New York State, three home health care visits per week by a registered nurse can cost over $13,000 per year. Even custodial home care at three visits a week can cost over $9,000 per year.   5  The chance of needing some type of long term care services is fairly high. It is estimated that over 40% of all persons who were 65 years old in 1990 will enter a nursing home during their lifetimes.   6  LONG TERM CARE BENEFITS PAID BY OTHER HEALTH INSURANCE Medicare  does NOT pay for most long term care services. Individuals  should not rely on Medicare to meet their long term care service needs. Medicare does not pay for custodial care when that is the only kind of care needed. Even skilled nursing facility care is covered by Medicare only on a very limited basis.  In order to obtain Medicare coverage of a skilled nursing facility stay, the following five conditions must be met:    Your condition must require daily skilled care which, as a practical matter, can only be provided in a skilled nursing facility on an inpatient basis. You must have been in a hospital at least three days in a row (not counting the day of discharge) before you are admitted to a certified skilled nursing facility. You must be admitted to the facility within a short time (generally within 30 days) after you leave the hospital. You must have received treatment in a hospital for the condition for which you are receiving skilled nursing care. You must receive certification from a medical professional that you need skilled nursing care or skilled rehabilitation services on a daily basis.          7  If the skilled nursing facility stay continuously meets all of the above conditions, Medicare will provide benefits for up to 100 days of skilled care in a skilled nursing facility during a benefit period. In 2003, for the first twenty days of care, all covered services are fully paid by Medicare. For the next 80 days of care, Medicare requires a copayment (the amount you must pay) of up to $105 per day.  If you need skilled health care in your home for the treatment of an illness or injury, Medicare can pay for home health services furnished by a home health agency. You do not need a prior hospital stay to qualify for home health care. Medicare pays for home health visits only if all four of the following conditions are met:    The care you need includes intermittent skilled nursing care, physical therapy, or speech language pathology. You are confined to your home. You are under the care of a physician who determines you need home health care and sets up a plan for you to receive care at home. The home health agency providing services participates in Medicare.    Once all four of these conditions are met, Medicare will pay for covered services as long as they are medically reasonable and necessary. Coverage is   8  provided for the services of skilled nurses, home health aides, medical social workers and different kinds of therapists. The services may be provided either on a  part-time or intermittent basis, not full-time.  Medicare pays the full cost of medically necessary home health visits by a Medicare-approved home health agency. You do not have to pay a deductible or coinsurance for services, however, if you need durable medical equipment, you are responsible for a 20% coinsurance payment for the equipment. Medicare will NOT pay for full-time nursing care at home, drugs, meals delivered to your home, and homemaker services that are primarily to assist you in meeting personal care or housekeeping needs. More information on Medicare and changes to the deductibles and copayments under Medicare is available on the web site of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services at: http://cms.hhs.gov  Medicare supplement insurance TERM CARE SERVICES.  is designed to fill in some of the  major gaps in Medicare coverage, but IT DOES NOT COVER MOST LONG   9  Other private health insurance  that you might already have covers  mainly acute conditions and probably does NOT cover custodial care.  Medicaid,  a governmental program for low-income individuals and  families, is currently the major source of funding for long term care services. In  order to qualify for Medicaid coverage, persons must meet certain income and asset tests. Because of the high cost of nursing home care, more than half of those who enter nursing homes privately paying for their care reach this level in less than a year. In New York State in 2003, if only one spouse needs nursing home care, the married couple is allowed to keep a home, a car and assets up to $90,660. A single person who requires such care may only keep assets of $3,850. The Partnership for   10  Long Term Care's web site provides more information on Medicaid Eligibility at www.nyspltc.org.  The Partnership for Long Term Care --In  1993, New York State  initiated the Partnership for Long Term Care (see page 21). Under the Program, if you purchase a Partnership-approved long term care policy and meet certain other requirements, you will be able to obtain Medicaid coverage, after the benefits under  the long term care policy are exhausted. Qualification will be based on your income only, without ""spending down"" (i.e., exhausting) your assets. In other words, the Partnership allows you to qualify for Medicaid based on your income only, regardless of how much in assets you own. There is no spend-down requirement for assets under the Partnership.   11  OTHER OPTIONS FOR ASSISTANCE IN PAYING FOR LONG TERM CARE SERVICES There are other options that you should be aware of that may help you pay for long term care services:  Savings and Investments:  A savings or investment plan may help pay  for long term care services. A retirement plan such as an IRA or 401K plan may also be available to you.  Life Insurance:  A life insurance policy may offer the opportunity for a  loan or withdrawal of the cash value. In addition, a person who is terminally ill may arrange for an accelerated cash lump sum death benefit from his life insurance company or for a cash lump sum (called a viatical settlement) from an outside firm. (Note: not all life insurance companies offer an accelerated death benefit option). These cash lump sum benefits are paid in lieu of the policy's death benefit.  Equity in Your Home:  If you have built up equity in your home, you  could use the profit from the sale of your home to fund long term care costs and move to less expensive accommodations. Another option is a ""reverse mortgage,"" which is a loan based on the amount of equity you have built up in your home.   12  Other Housing:  You may be able to buy into a continuing care retirement  community where the cost includes future access to long term care services. (See page 33) You may also find shared housing with supportive services.   13  INSURANCE COVERING LONG TERM CARE SERVICES It is important to realize that insurance policies covering long term care services are a relatively new form of insurance. The New York State Insurance Department has encouraged insurance companies to offer policies covering long term care services, and has established minimum standards for four classifications of insurance policies covering such services. The services covered under these policies can be significantly different among policies. Therefore, it is very important to read the policies carefully and compare the benefits to determine which policy will best meet your own personal needs. Insurance policies covering long term care services in New York are sold on both an individual and a group basis. Some employers and association groups offer such policies to their employees or members. If you are unable to obtain such a policy through a group, the policies are also sold on an individual basis. At the end of this booklet are listings of insurance companies selling individual and group insurance policies covering long term care services, along with their addresses, phone numbers and Web sites (see Appendices F and G). All insurance policies covering long term care services currently being sold in New York State are indemnity policies. Indemnity policies are those that pay a specific dollar amount for each day you spend in a nursing facility or for each home   14  health or home care visit. Some of these policies pay the daily benefit amount regardless of the charges, others will pay covered charges, or a percentage of covered charges up to the daily benefit amount.  Over time, as nursing home and home care charges increase, the daily dollar amounts which are payable under these policies do not increase, however, insurers selling these policies are required at the time of sale to also offer an ""inflation protection"" benefit. All Partnership approved policies must include an inflation protection benefit of at least 5% compounded annually unless the policy is purchased at age 80 or above. This benefit increases the daily benefit amount over time to help keep pace with inflation and increased expenses. Without the   15  ""inflation protection"" benefit, you will be paying a larger amount of money out-ofpocket should you need to avail yourself of nursing home care or home care.  Some insurers also offer an option to increase the daily benefit amounts and maximum policy benefit at a future time. Under this option, you have the ability to increase the amounts every specified number of years. Unlike an inflation protection benefit purchased at the same time as the policy, if you opt to increase the daily benefit amounts and maximum policy benefit under this option, your premiums will increase based on your attained age at the time you opt to increase the benefits.   16  CLASSIFICATIONS OF INSURANCE POLICIES COVERING LONG TERM CARE SERVICES New York State has established minimum standards for insurance policies covering long term care services. The Department has established four different classifications for these policies:     Long Term Care Insurance Nursing Home and Home Care Insurance Nursing Home Insurance Only Home Care Insurance Only   17  Long Term Care Insurance  policies provide the broadest coverage of  long term care services. The Department requires that these policies cover for at least 24 consecutive months, the following benefits:   Coverage of all levels of care in a nursing home of at least: $100 per day for policies sold in the New York City Metropolitan area (the counties of Bronx, Kings, Nassau, New York, Queens, Richmond, Suffolk, Rockland and Westchester); and $70 per day for all other parts of New York State.  AND  Coverage of home care of at least 50% of the daily indemnity amount provided for care in a nursing home.   18  Nursing Home and Home Care Insurance  combines the benefits  of Nursing Home Insurance Only and Home Care Insurance Only. This policy is for those persons who want some coverage for nursing home and home care services but who cannot afford Long Term Care Insurance.  The Insurance Department requires that these policies cover, for at least a period of 12 consecutive months, the following benefits:  Coverage of custodial care services of at least $50 a day while confined in a nursing home. AND  Coverage of custodial care services of at least $25 per day in a private home.   19  Nursing Home Insurance Only  is for those persons who either:     Have no desire or intention to receive long term care services in their home; Have the financial resources to self-pay for home care services, but desire financial protection against the greater cost of nursing home care.  Nursing Home Insurance Only must provide at least twelve consecutive months of coverage of custodial care services of at least $50 a day while confined in a nursing home.  IF THERE IS ANY CHANCE THAT YOU MAY REQUIRE INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR HOME HEALTH CARE SERVICES IN THE FUTURE, A NURSING HOME INSURANCE ONLY POLICY MAY NOT BE THE BEST TYPE OF LONG TERM CARE COVERAGE FOR YOU.   20  Home Care Insurance Only  is a very limited policy. This type of  policy should only be considered by those persons who either:  Have no desire or intention of entering a nursing home, and would be able to obtain long term care services in their home. Have already purchased a nursing home policy and wish to add a home care benefit.    Home Care Insurance Only must provide at least twelve consecutive months of coverage of custodial care services of at least $25 per day in a private home.  IF THERE IS ANY CHANCE THAT YOU MAY REQUIRE NURSING HOME SERVICES IN THE FUTURE, A HOME CARE INSURANCE ONLY POLICY IS MOST LIKELY NOT THE BEST TYPE OF LONG TERM CARE COVERAGE FOR YOU.   21  THE NEW YORK STATE PARTNERSHIP FOR LONG TERM CARE In 1993, the New York State Partnership for Long Term Care was initiated in New York State in order to encourage more people to purchase long term care insurance policies. The Partnership Program allows those persons who purchase Partnership-approved long term care policies to qualify for Medicaid without spending down their assets once the benefits under the long term care policy are exhausted. Although there is no spend down of assets requirement under the Partnership Program, income limits will still apply and contributions toward the cost of care under regular Medicaid rules may be required.  In order for long term care insurance policies to be approved under the Partnership Program, they must contain at least the following benefits:  Coverage of all levels of care in a nursing home of at least $163 per day for 2003, and increasing by 5% compounded annually. The lifetime maximum nursing home benefit must be for at least three years and the insured must be allowed to substitute home care benefits on the basis of two home care days for one nursing home day. Home care coverage must be provided in an amount that is 50% of the minimum required nursing home care benefit and is payable when services are provided in the insured's home, in a group setting such as an adult day care center, or where human assistance is needed to aid the insured in necessary travel, such as to a physician's office. The home care benefit must cover skilled nursing care, home health care, personal care and assisted living care.     22    Respite care must be provided for at least 14 days annually, and must be payable at the nursing home daily benefit amount. Alternate care benefits are payable when the insured is in a hospital awaiting the availability of nursing home or home care services. Benefit payments are in the amount of the nursing home daily benefit amount. Inflation protection must be included so that benefits increase by at least 5% compounded annually for your lifetime. Inflation protection benefits are not mandatory if the policy is purchased at age 80 or older. Waiting periods of more than 100 days are not permitted. (The Waiting period is the number of days you must receive long term care services before benefits will be paid under the policy.)        All Partnership approved policies will prominently display the Project logo shown below.  In order to purchase a Partnership-approved long term care policy, an applicant must meet all underwriting rules of the insurance company. When benefits under the policy are nearly exhausted, an application for Medicaid   23  must be filed by you or your representative. As long as your income is not more than the cost of your medical care, you will be eligible for all Medicaid benefits, without regard to the amount or type of your assets.  If you are considering the purchase of a Partnership long term care policy, but intend to move outside of New York, you should be aware that while the benefits under the long term care policy will still be payable, the asset protection under the Medicaid Program only applies if you remain a New York State resident.  For more information on the Long Term Care Partnership Program, you should obtain a copy of the ""Consumer Booklet  Affordable Financing for Long Term Care,"" which was prepared by the New York State Partnership for Long Term Care and is available from the Office of Medicaid Management, New York State Department of Health or the New York State Insurance Department at 1-888-NYSPLTC (1-888-697-7582).   24  FAVORABLE TAX TREATMENT OF CERTAIN POLICIES COVERING LONG TERM CARE SERVICES In 1996 the Federal government amended the Internal Revenue Code to allow favorable tax treatment of long term care policies which qualify under the law. Generally, benefits you receive from tax qualified policies will not be considered as taxable income under either federal or state law. The premiums charged for tax qualified policies are treated as medical expenses for purposes of itemized deductions up to certain dollar limits that are indexed annually. A list of insurers selling tax-qualified policies is included at the end of this book.  In 1997 New York State passed legislation that allows favorable state tax treatment of premiums paid for policies which qualify under the federal law and meet New York minimum standards. Long term care premium tax credit legislation was passed in 2000 and took effect in taxable years beginning in 2002.  Any policy covering long term care services that was approved in New York and issued before January 1, 1997, also qualifies for favorable tax treatment with certain limited exceptions.  You should consult with an attorney, accountant or tax advisor regarding the tax implications of purchasing a tax qualified policy.  Remember, not all long term care policies qualify for favorable tax treatment (see Appendix E).   25  FACTORS TO CONSIDER BEFORE PURCHASING INSURANCE COVERING LONG TERM CARE SERVICES     Are you eligible for Medicaid? If so, Medicaid will pay your long term care expenses. How much can you afford to pay out-of-pocket for long term care expenses? How much can you afford to pay for an insurance policy covering long term care services? If you are planning to retire, will your reduced income be adequate to meet the annual costs of the premium?    All long term care policies are medically underwritten, (i.e., your physical/mental condition and health history will be evaluated), so if you intend to purchase a policy, don't wait until you have a medical condition that could make long term care coverage more expensive or unavailable to you. In most cases, the premium for a policy will be lower when purchased at a younger age. Also, insurance policies covering long term care services are only offered at certain ages. What types of long term care services would best meet your own personal needs and preferences? What are the costs of these services in the locality where you would be receiving     them?   26  COMPARING INSURANCE POLICIES COVERING LONG TERM CARE SERVICES All individual policies covering long term care services in New York State must be guaranteed renewable. This means that you have the right to continue the policy as long as the premiums are paid on a timely basis. An insurer cannot  terminate the policy if your health declines. The insurer also cannot make any change in any provision of the policy while the insurance is in force without your agreement. An insurer cannot change the premium charged for the policy unless it receives the approval of the Insurance Department, and unless it applies to all members of a class covered by the policy.  All policies covering long term care services place certain limits on benefits and may exclude certain benefits completely. In choosing a policy that will best meet   27  your own personal needs, it is important to understand the limitations and benefit exclusions which are contained in these policies. The most common exclusions and limits that are used in insurance policies covering long term care services are described below:  Maximum Policy Benefit:  The maximum policy benefit is the period  of time or dollar amount limit for which long term care benefits will be paid under the policy. Insurance policies covering long term care services contain maximums of from one to ten years, lifetime benefits, or a dollar amount limit. Most of the maximum policy benefits with dollar amount limits are calculated by multiplying the number of years of benefits chosen, times 365 days, times the daily benefit amount chosen. Once the benefit limit or time limit is reached under these policies, no other benefits will be paid for your continuous need for long term care services. It is important to note that in some long term care policies the maximum policy benefit is not the same for all benefits listed in the policy. For example, some nursing home and home care policies have separate maximum benefits for nursing home and home care. Certain policies also contain a separate benefit limit for each particular period of care (generally successive days of care in a nursing home or   28  while receiving home care without a break in the care for a period of time specified in the policy).  Elimination or Waiting Period  : The elimination or waiting period is  the number of days you must receive long term care services before benefits will be paid under the policy. During the elimination or waiting period you will have to privately pay for the care you receive. A new elimination or waiting period may be imposed for each period of care. Shorter periods increase the cost of coverage.  Preexisting Condition Limitation  : A preexisting condition is a  condition for which medical advice was given or treatment was recommended by, or received from, a licensed health care provider within six months before the effective date of coverage of the insured person. Some of the policies covering long term care services contain a preexisting condition limitation. This limitation is the period of time after you buy the policy that benefits will NOT be payable for care related to the preexisting condition. Some policies apply preexisting condition limitations only for medical conditions that are not disclosed on the application. Therefore, it is very important that you answer all questions on the application as   29  completely as possible. Policies covering long term care services may not contain a preexisting condition limitation of more than six months after the effective date of coverage.  Policy Exclusions services are:   : Specific exclusions are listed in all long term care  policies. Some of the more common exclusions in policies covering long term care  Mental illness, however, the policy may NOT exclude or limit benefits for Alzheimer's Disease, senile dementia, or demonstrable organic disease. Intentionally self-inflicted injuries. Alcoholism and drug addiction. Care in government nursing facilities unless a charge is made in which you are obligated to pay. Coverage while the insured is outside the United States and its possessions.        30  Daily Benefit Amount:  Most of the policies covering long term care  services currently being sold do not cover the full charge for a nursing facility or home health agency. Each indemnity policy limits payment to a daily benefit amount, which is the dollar amount payable per day based on the type of care being provided. Any charges above the daily benefit amount must be paid by you. Many indemnity policies cover provider charges up to the daily benefit amount.   31  OPTIONAL LONG TERM CARE BENEFITS  The New York State Insurance Department requires that at the time of sale of policies covering long term care services, certain optional benefits must be offered. These options (and the types of policies they must be offered with) follow:  An  Inflation Protection Benefit  must be offered with ""Long Term Care  Insurance,"" ""Nursing Home Insurance Only,"" ""Home Care Insurance Only"" and ""Nursing Home and Home Care Insurance"". Policies approved under the New York State Partnership for Long Term Care must contain an inflation protection benefit of at least 5% compounded annually, unless the policy is purchased at or after age 80. Remember, a daily benefit amount which is adequate today may not be adequate ten years from now. In an indemnity policy an inflation protection  benefit increases the daily benefit amount and/or maximum policy benefit over time to help keep pace with inflation and increased expenses.   32  A  Nonforfeiture Benefit  must be offered with ""Long Term Care  Insurance"" policies. The nonforfeiture benefit is designed to ensure that if you lapse your policy (i.e., stop paying premiums) after a specified number of years, you retain some benefits from the policy. There are currently two common types of nonforfeiture benefits being offered with certain insurance policies covering long term care services. These are referred to as a ""Reduced Paid-Up Benefit"" and a ""Shortened Benefit Period."" A brief description of these benefits follow:   Reduced Paid-Up Benefit:  If you purchase a reduced paid-up  benefit, it will provide that if you lapse your policy after a specified number of years, the policy will continue with reduced daily benefit amounts (some insurers apply this nonforfeiture benefit only to nursing home benefits).   Shortened Benefit Period:  If you purchase a shortened benefit  period, it will provide that if you lapse your policy after a specified number of years, the policy will continue to cover the same benefits (amounts and frequency in effect at the time of lapse) that would have been covered under your policy until the nonforfeiture benefit amount is exhausted. A similar nonforfeiture benefit that was offered in the past was known as an ""Extended Term Benefit"". In other words, the ""Reduced Paid-Up Benefit"" provides reduced benefits for the original term of the policy, and the ""Shortened Benefit Period"" provides full benefits for a reduced period of time.  NOTE: ALL OF THE OPTIONAL BENEFITS NOTED ABOVE INCREASE THE COST OF THE BASIC POLICY.   33  CONTINUING CARE RETIREMENT COMMUNITIES Continuing care retirement communities (CCRCs) provide another option for meeting your long term care needs. This option may be very expensive and is only practical for those persons with higher than average incomes and significant assets  to protect. CCRCs are residential communities that offer seniors a place to live that offer a variety of services and care, including long term care services. These communities provide, not only housing, but also organized social events, dining facilities, sports facilities, special interest clubs, outings and vacation opportunities. They also provide home care services, nursing facility services, adult home services and access to physician and other professional services for their residents. Entrance fees for CCRCs may be substantial, and depending on the size and type of the dwelling chosen by the resident, can range in price from approximately   34  $200,000 to $1 million. There is also an additional monthly fee that typically ranges from approximately $2,000 to $5,000. CCRCs in New York State offer two different types of life care contracts for their residents. One type is all-inclusive (Type A), and the other provides modified (Type B) services:  Type A Contracts:  Type A contracts provide housing, residential  services, many amenities and unlimited, specific health-related services, including long term care services. If the resident's health deteriorates to the point that they need long term care services or admission to the nursing home, all of the services covered under the contract are provided without an increase in the monthly fee (except for normal operating costs and inflation adjustments). The monthly fee also will not increase due to the amount of services the resident requires.  Type B Contracts:  Type B contracts provide housing, residential  services and many amenities. This contract differs from the Type A contract in the amount of long term care services that will be provided before an adjustment is made in the amount of the monthly fee paid by the resident. For example, under this type of contract, the CCRC could allow residents a specified number of days in a nursing home without a change in the monthly fee. Once this limit is reached, the   35  resident could be required to pay for continued nursing home services on a full per diem basis or a discounted per diem basis. Currently there are seven operational CCRC's in New York State.

Some insurers will not issue a policy if you have an existing medical condition, and others may issue a policy but charge a higher premium. What is your age? The premiums for these policies are based on your age at the time of purchase. The older you are at the time you purchase a policy, the more expensive the policy will be. What type of policy do you want to buy to meet your long term care needs? Long Term Care Partnership Non-Partnership Non-Tax Qualified? It may be easier to qualify for benefits under a Nursing Home and Home Care Nursing Home Only Home Care Only  Do you want: Tax Qualified, non-tax qualified policy.  What Maximum Policy Benefit do you want? This is the total benefit available under the policy. Some insurers offer coverage for a certain number of years or unlimited coverage, others offer a dollar amount limit. The higher the number of years of benefits or the higher the dollar amount limit, the more expensive the coverage. In choosing this benefit you should keep in mind that it is estimated that the average nursing home stay is 2 years. What Elimination/Waiting Period do you want? This is the amount of time you must pay for services before you receive benefits under the policy. A longer period will reduce the cost of the coverage. Medicare may pay some or all of the first 100 days if skilled nursing care is required. What Daily Benefit Amount do you want for nursing home? This is the maximum amount per day that will be paid under the policy. Before choosing this amount, you should check to see the average cost of nursing homes in the county in which you reside, and consider how much you can self-pay per day. What Daily Benefit Amount do you want for home care? This is the maximum amount per day that will be paid under the policy. Before choosing this amount, you should check to see the average cost of home care services in the county in which you reside, and consider how much you can self-pay per day. Do you want an inflation protection benefit? It is important to realize that a daily benefit amount which is adequate today to meet nursing home and home care costs may not be adequate at the time you need to use the benefits. The inflation protection benefit increases the daily benefit amount and policy maximums over time to help keep pace with inflation and increased expenses. Depending on your age, this benefit can be expensive. These are the most common inflation protection benefits offered: Increase of 5% compounded 5% per year Option to increase annual cost of living increase annually. REQUIRED FOR benefits in the future at PARTNERSHIP POLICIES 5% compounded annually attained age rates. PURCHASED BEFORE AGE 80. Do you want to purchase a non-forfeiture benefit? This benefit is designed to ensure that if you lapse your policy (i.e., stop paying premiums) after a number of years, you retain some benefits from the policy. Most nonforfeiture benefits being offered provide either reduced benefits for the original term of the policy, or full benefits for a reduced period of time. This benefit is expensive.   43  APPENDIX C -- SELECTING AN INSURANCE COMPANY When selecting an insurance policy, you are also selecting an insurance company and you may wish to know how stable that company is financially. Many firms rate the financial soundness of insurance companies. Some provide the ratings free while other charge a fee, ranging from a small fee for an online rating to a larger amount for quarterly reports. Listed below are some of the firms along with their phone numbers: A.M. Best Insurance Review Moody's Investor's Service Standard & Poor's Weiss Research, Inc.

In fact, for the first time in the history of    the United States, there will be more older people than children. By 2030, it    is projected that one out of every five Americans will be over the age of 65.    The fastest growing segment of our older population is comprised of individuals    age 85 and older, and is expected to grow from four million people today to    19 million by 2050. In Nevada alone, there will be more than 34,000 seniors    over the age of 85 by the year 2030.     One of my top priorities in the United States Senate    is to invest in our future so that all Nevadans will be ensured a secure retirement.    I am ready to meet this challenge by working to implement a legislative agenda    that includes a new Medicare prescription drug benefit, nursing home reforms,    new efforts on long--term care and other initiatives that will meet the needs    of our growing senior population.      Saving Social Security and Medicare        Both Social Security and Medicare face immense challenges    brought on by the aging of the baby boom generation. Social Security, which    has made a secure, independent retirement possible for tens of millions of Americans,    and the Medicare Part A Hospital Insurance trust fund must be protected to provide    for seniors throughout the next century. Investing now, in both Social Security    and Medicare, will prevent larger problems later.     My goal is to strengthen, protect and modernize Social    Security and Medicare by focusing on specific areas most beneficial to Nevada�s    Seniors:         Save Social Security:  Reserve all of the Social      Security surpluses for Social Security. Work to achieve a broad consensus      for reforms necessary to extend Social Security solvency to at least 2075,      while reducing poverty among elderly widows, and eliminating the earnings      limit.       Strengthen Medicare:  Reserve one-third of the      projected on-budget surpluses for Medicare, ensuring that the Medicare Trust      Fund is secure. Work to enact further changes to strengthen and modernize      the Medicare program, including adding a prescription drug benefit. Work to      ensure that Medicare beneficiaries are well-informed about their coverage      and know how best to evaluate their options.       Add a Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit:  Make      prescription drugs accessible and affordable for all Medicare beneficiaries.      Prescription drugs are a standard part of adequate health insurance coverage      and should be covered by Medicare. Prescription drugs are the largest out-of-pocket      health care cost for older Americans, and three out of four Medicare beneficiaries      lack decent, dependable private-sector coverage of prescription drugs.       Pay Down the Debt:  Investing the budget surpluses      in Social Security and Medicare will reduce the national debt to its lowest      level since 1917 and save taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars in interest      expense.       Improving Long-Term Care Options:  Those who      require long-term care, and their caregivers, face significant costs for their      care, but few people have insurance to cover those costs. About five million      Americans of all ages have significant limitations due to illness or disability      and need assistance performing the activities of daily living. About two million      live in nursing homes, and approximately three million live in their communities      and are cared for by family and friends. Specific needs must be met to ensure      seniors receive top quality care.       Provide Long-Term Care Tax Credits:  Provide      tax credits for elderly and disabled individuals needing long-term care and      the family members who care for them.       Establish a National Family Caregiver Support Program:       Provide support services to caregivers and families of elderly relatives with      chronic conditions.       Provide Long-Term Care Insurance for Federal Employees:       Offer quality, affordable long-term care insurance for purchase by Federal      employees.       Expand Home and Community-Based Long-Term Care      Support:  Continue to support efforts to increase community-based long-term      care options as well as personal assistance services that emphasize consumer      choice, control and flexibility.      Fighting Crimes Against Seniors:          Over the last few years, violent and property crimes against most segments      of the population have decreased. However, the violent victimization rates      for persons 50 and older have remained the same. In addition to violent crime,      older Americans are increasingly the victims of crimes of a financial nature.      For example, the proliferation of telemarketing fraud has hit seniors particularly      hard.       Additional Tools to Fight Crimes Against Seniors:       Give law enforcement officials additional tools to prosecute criminals      who target seniors through deceptive mailings, Internet fraud, stock investment      schemes, home repair scams, home equity schemes, coercive telemarketing techniques      and other means.      Criminal Background Checks for Long-Term Care Workers:       Ensure that those who care for some of our most vulnerable citizens do      not have criminal records.       Reduce Unnecessary and Illegal Medicare Costs:       Crack down on fraud and abuse in the Medicare system.       Increase Penalties for Crimes Against Seniors:       Require the Sentencing Commission to provide any appropriate sentencing      enhancements for crimes targeting seniors.       Reauthorizing The Older Americans Act : The      Older Americans Act is the main legislative vehicle for delivering social      and nutritional services to older Americans. The Older Americans Act has not      been reauthorized since the Republicans took control of Congress in 1994,      leaving these programs vulnerable.      Reauthorize the Older Americans Act:  The Older      Americans Act includes a number of critical programs for older Americans,      ranging from home and community-based meals to transportation services. The      services funded by the Act include meals on wheels, counseling, elder abuse      prevention programs and a long-term care ombudsman program to investigate      the complaints of nursing home residents.        As we work toward doubling the National Institutes of    Health (NIH) budget over five years, Democrats are committed to doubling the    budget for the National Institute on Aging (NIA) over five years. In 1999, the    National Institute on Aging received $600 million. Increased research on conditions    affecting older Americans is essential to help provide better treatment, save    lives and increase the quality of life of this growing population.          Increase Funding for the National Institute on      Aging:  As part of the effort to double funding for NIH, double funding      for the National Institute on Aging.      Ensuring A Secure Retirement:   More and more      individuals and couples are choosing to live in continuing care retirement      communities (CCRCs) because of the community environment they provide. CCRCs      provide independent living, assisted living and nursing care, usually on the      same campus. Most Americans who live in CCRCs, other retirement communities      and nursing homes are cared for in an environment that nurtures both their      physical and mental health. However, certain reforms are still needed.       Right to Return Home:  Give seniors who reside      in CCRCs and long-term care facilities and who are covered by managed care      plans the right to return to their home facility for post-hospitalization      care instead of being forced to go to a facility in the managed care plans      network.       CCRC Residents as Creditor:  CCRC residents      pay up front fees and deposits. If a CCRC goes bankrupt, residents have no      standing to claim fees and deposits they have paid for future care. To provide      financial protection if a CCRC declares bankruptcy, designate CCRC residents      as creditors.      Reduce Inappropriate Use of Restraints:  Strengthen      existing safeguards to protect individuals in nursing homes from restraint-related      injury and death.      Expand Pension Benefit Coverage:  Create a new      plan to make it easier for small businesses to start private pension plans      that provide predictable and secure benefits, and for employees to save in      IRAs through payroll deductions. Permit employees to roll over benefits from      different types of retirement plans.      Strengthen Women�s Retirement Security:  Allow      workers to count time taken under the Family and Medical Leave Act toward      their retirement benefits, and require pension plans to let families choose      joint and survivor annuity options.       Strengthen Retiree Health Coverage:  Provide      protections for retirees whose employers drop their health coverage, and expand      access to affordable health care coverage for early retirees through a Medicare      buy-in and COBRA coverage.       Improving Specialized Care:   Too often, health      problems in older persons are misdiagnosed, overlooked or dismissed as the      normal function of aging because doctors are not trained to recognize how      diseases and impairments might appear differently in the elderly than in younger      persons. Less than one percent of the doctors in the United States complete      additional years of fellowship training in geriatrics. While almost all physicians      care for Medicare patients, many are not familiar with the latest advances      in aging research and medical management of the elderly.      Create Incentives for Physicians to Train in Geriatrics:       Forgive a portion of education debt incurred by medical students for each      year of advanced training required to obtain a certificate of added qualifications      in geriatric medicine.       Increase Efforts to Provide Graduate Medical Education      Payments to Geriatricians:  Create graduate medical education policies      that promote training in geriatrics by encouraging hospitals to continue or      expand existing training programs.

What are the guidelines on Advanced Life Support (ALS) assessment with “no services”?    We have two Advanced Life Support (ALS) non-emergency codes.  Why two and when do you use one or the other?    What makes up an Advanced Life Support (ALS) assessment? Is it determined by mechanism of injury?    We have been told that the only services that can bill Q3019 and Q 3020 are all Advanced Life Support (ALS) services.  We are required contractually to provide two ALS vehicles.  Can we bill for two trucks using the Q codes?    Did a Program Memorandum (PM) go out after 4/1/02 that clarified whether payment is based on condition of the patient on the scene versus at the time of the call to the dispatcher?    It appears that every ambulance service bills differently. This question is about the Specialty Care Transport (SCT) charge.    For a paramedic in our State to do an inter-facility transfer involving a patient with medications outside the standard protocols, about 16 hours additional State-mandated training is required.  Should these  be billed under the SCT code?    Why are all nursing home to physician offices denied as Transports NOT covered?  Are there cases where these transports are reasonable?    Question about an FAQ, which reads: - “Sometimes we have multiple transports for a covered service but it is not medically necessary for multiple ambulances; do the instructions for partial payment in MCM 5215.2 still apply?

Will Quality Improvement Organizations (QIOs) assist State Survey Agencies  (SSAs) in identifying deficiencies?    What types of situations pose a substantial risk to the public health?    Does working with the Quality Improvement Organization (QIO) give a home health agency the ability to shield information from the State Survey Agency (SSA)?    Does working with the Quality Improvement Organization (QIO) obviate a home health agency’s responsibility for correcting deficiencies?

When our client is a third party, do we need to obtain an Advanced Beneficiary Notice (ABN) and/or file a claim with Medicare for the domestic portion of the flight?    When our client is a third party,  if the insurance or assistance company simply charges the patient for the additional cost of the onward transport, how does that affect our requirements with regard to Medicare?    When our client is a third party, and when the patient pays us directly for the excess (overage cost) to proceed onward, how do we proceed with Medicare Billing, if applicable?    When the transport is an international service, because the transport is international, then our understanding is the cost for that flight would not be statutorily covered by         Medicare.  Is that correct?    Is there a transmittal specifically indicating that the J-codes are exempt from SNF-PPS when the ambulance transport is exempt?    In our State most companies maintain only an Advanced Life Support (ALS) vehicle. The local carrier is willing to adjust all claims for BLS after 04/01/02.  Is this OK?    If a company responds with an ALS vehicle because they do not have a BLS vehicle available, can they bill with the Q code or can they only bill with the Q code if no company in the vicinity has a BLS vehicle?    Is separate billing by a practitioner (physician) permissible when the professional service is furnished as part of the ambulance transport?

Why are the measures within each clinical indication going to be “rolled up” into one score?    How will information be collected from hospitals for the Hospital Quality Incentive Demonstration?    Will CMS calculate quality scores for every hospital in the Perspective Online database?    What does CMS do to improve the care provided to patients by hospitals?    How does the Premier Hospital Quality Incentive Demonstration project fit into the hospital patient perspectives on care project?    Does this program take the place of these state-run programs?  Will the hospital need to provide different information than what the state is requiring?    What is the differences between Hospital Quality Initiative and the Premier Hospital Quality Incentive Demonstration?    If you find that a hospital doesn’t meet the basic standards, will you be able to exclude them from Medicare or Medicaid?    Would it be appropriate for a hospital to append a modifier –25 to a CPT medical visit code, for multiple visits on same day?    Do the finger and toe modifiers apply to radiology CPT codes?    How do you report more than one EKG performed in the same day?    Will modifier –25 be used for all ER small laceration repairs, etc?    Explain the use of modifier –27.    Are the C codes specifically for manufacturer use?    Do the critical care Correct Coding Initiative (CCI) edits apply to hospitals?    Should the bilateral modifier be used when performing a hearing test or pulmonary function test on the lungs?    Does modifier –50 apply to surgery only?    If the same procedure was done on the great toe of the right foot and on the great toe of the left foot, how is it coded?    Can hospitals use modifier –51?    Should modifier –52 be used for a procedure that is defined as bilateral by the HCPCS code, when the provider was only able to do one side?    What code should be used in data element “Release of Information Code,” of the X12N 837 Institutional and Professional Claims, version 4010A1?    How should I handle the working aged status for the rest of 2003?    How long can I correct working aged status for 2003 and prior years?    How can I correct working aged periods that are created by the CMS systems after the final HUSP submission in February 2004?    Are there special rules for the first year?    What members do I have to survey?    Do I have to survey each member during the month of March?    What if a member retires after March?    What if a member leaves or joins my plan after March?    What if a beneficiary leaves my plan before I obtain the survey results?    How will CMS determine whether a non-respondent should be considered working aged if the beneficiary did not respond?    What are MCOs to do regarding beneficiaries that have enrolled into our organization?    The process states CMS will apply the status as reflected in the Common Working File as of March 2003 for non-respondents to the survey.  Will CMS consider adjustments to this status that are applied after this date?    May the insurer information on the CWF that indicates Medicare as Primary be used in lieu of the beneficiary survey?    How will members be handled that disenroll prior to 2004?    How will we know what members were considered to be in a Working Aged status for the purpose of the Working Aged Computation?    16. What MMR will the 2004 Working Aged payment adjustments be based on, i.e. June 2003, March 2003, etc.?    If the member retires in January 2004 and they were not on the March 2003 MMR, what will happen?    What should we do about members who enroll in our MCO after the March 2003 MMR?    What is the responsibility of MCOs for ongoing tracking and corrections beyond the yearly survey process?    Are there specific requirements regarding re-surveying or will any survey done within the time frame constitute acceptable documenation?    Must MCOs continue to survey new MCO members?  What are the reporting requirement if we do survey these new members?    Does CMS have a way for me to submit my Medicare Secondary Payer (MSP) questions and comments?    Will MCOs still have the ability to make CWF corrections?    How long will working aged flags be set for non-respondents that are waiting for carrier intervention?    What is the time period for MCOs to submit  retroactive corrections that cover periods before 2004?    CMS only accepting corrections to the working aged status before the cut-off date in December 2004 seems to contradict ...    Why does CMS exclude payments for beneficiaries with hospice, ESRD, and disabled status?    Under the new process, will we have the same dollar amount reduced from each monthly payment?    Can only Medicare’s DRG codes be used on standard transactions?    How will fiscal intermediaries calculate APC payments if a hospital submits a roster bill for immunization services?    How often will the Correct Coding Initiative (CCI) edits be updated for FIs?    Medicare currently provides a Prosthetic/Orthotic fee schedule. Our hospital currently bills for these codes using revenue..?    Can providers bill for screening mammograms on the 13X claims when other services are done the same day, or    How should a hospital bill for a patient who has a ""series"" account (i.e. radiation oncology) who also receives additional services on a day during the series span?    Does HIPAA permit the use of V codes?  Is their use consistent with OASIS requirements?    Why are the publicly reported measures ‘improvement’ rather than ‘stabilization’ measures?    Will the home health agencies have a chance to review their quality measure data before it’s posted on Home Health Compare?    How and when will the national rollout of the Home Health Quality Initiative be implemented?    How many Medicare certified home health agencies provide home health care in the U.S. and its territories?    How were the home health agencies listed in the ads selected?    How often is the data for Home Health Compare updated?    How do I update the demographic information of my agency on Home Health Compare?    If a Corporate Office serves multiples states, what data do we see for each state?    Are survey agencies required by HIPAA to disclose to the facility which patient records were examined in order to assess facility compliance?    Are hospital-based rural health clinics (RHCs) or federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) subject to OPPS?    What revenue code should be assigned to a medical device that has been granted pass-through status?    May a hospital bill for outpatient PT, OT or SLP services it furnishes to its patients in its outpatient department?    May a hospital send its therapists  to other settings and bill for those services that they furnish as hospital services?    Circumstances a hospital may not bill Medicare for PT/OT/SLP services of the hospital.    May a hospital make an arrangement with another entity to provide PT/OT/SLP services to its outpatients?    What rules apply to psychiatric hospitals when it comes to billing for PT/OT/SLP services?    Do the HIPAA transactions and code sets standards apply to paper claims and other non-electronic transactions?    Has HHS approved any pilot studies for new code sets to be used with the HIPAA standard transactions?    May I use ABC codes for HIPAA standard transactions even though they are not on the list of approved code sets?    Is a health care claim appeal considered a HIPAA-adopted standard transaction?    Must a multi-functional single covered entity use a HIPAA transaction when transmitting within the same covered entity?    Can a health plan participating in the ABC code demonstration project use the codes with another insurance company that it contracts with?    Would a PPO's registration in the ABC code set demonstration also cover the practitioners that it contracts with?"

Medicaid is the largest program providing  medical and health-related services  to America's poorest people. The Federal statute identifies over 25 different eligibility categories for which federal funds are available. These statutory categories can be classified in to five broad coverage groups: Children, Pregnant Women; Adults in Families with Dependent children; individuals with disabilities, and individuals 65 or over.    Within broad national guidelines which the Federal government provides, each of the states: establishes its own eligibility standards; determines the type, amount, duration, and scope of services; sets the rate of payment for services; and administers its own program. Thus, the Medicaid varies considerably from state to state.    Medicaid Resources & Technical Information    State Medicaid programs and other professional entities require various pieces of information to help effectively perform their daily task of administering the Medicaid program.

(A) For cost-reporting purposes, the medicaid program requires each eligible provider, as defined in rule 5101:3-2-01 of the Administrative Code, to submit periodic reports which generally cover a consecutive twelve-month period of their operations. Cost reports must be filed within one hundred eighty days of the end of the hospital's cost-reporting year. Extensions of this one hundred eighty day period shall be granted if the health care financing administrationcenters for medicare and medicaid services (CMS) of the United States department of health and human services extends the date by which the hospital must submit its cost report for the hospital's cost-reporting period. Failure to submit all necessary items and schedules will only delay processing and may result in a reduction of payment or termination as a provider as described in paragraph (H) of this rule. Failure to submit cost reports on or before the dates specified shall be fined one hundred dollars for each day after the due date that the information is not submitted. Effective for medicaid cost reports filed for cost reporting periods ending in state fiscal year (SFY) 2003, and each cost reporting period thereafter, any hospital that fails to submit cost reports on or before the dates specified by the department shall be fined one thousand dollars for each day after the due date that the information is not reported. The hospital shall complete and submit the JFS 02930 in accordance with instructions contained in this rule. The JFS 02930 for SFY 20012002 and its instructions are shown in appendix A of this rule. The hospital's cost report must: (1) Be prepared in accordance with medicare principles governing reasonable cost reimbursement set forth in the providers' reimbursement manual ""HCFACMS Publications 15 and 15-1"", available at www.cms.hhs.gov/manuals/cmstoc.asp dated November 08, 2002 ; (2) Include all information necessary for the proper determination of costs payable under medicaid including financial records and statistical data; (3) Include as an attachment a copy of the medicare cost report which must be identical in all respects to the cost report submitted to the medicare fiscal intermediary.; (4) Include the cost report certification executed by an officer of the hospital attesting to the accuracy of the cost report. In addition, all subsequent revisions to the cost report must include an executed certification; (5) Effective for medicaid cost reports filed for cost reporting periods ending in SFY 2003, and each cost reporting period thereafter, the executed certification shall require the officer of the hospital to acknowledge that an independent party, a certified public accountant, has successfully verified the [ stylesheet: rule.xsl 2.13, authoring tool: i4i 1.409 Feb 7, 2002, (dv: 13, p: 7968, pa: 7562, ra: 35715, d: 31456)] print date: 04/04/2003 09:24 AM   5101:3-2-23  2  data reported on ""Schedule F"" of the cost report in accordance with the procedures included in the cost report instructions. (B) Hospitals having a distinct part psychiatric or rehabilitation unit recognized by medicare in accordance with the provisions of 42 CFR 412.25 effective October 1, 2002, 42 CFR 412.27 effective October 1, 1994, and 42 CFR 412.29 effective January 1, 2002, must identify distinct part unit costs separately within the cost report as described in paragraph (A) of this rule. (C) Ohio hospitals performing transplant services covered under medicaid as described in rule 5101:3-2-07.1 of the Administrative Code must identify transplant costs, charges, days, and discharges separately within the cost report as described in paragraph (A) of this rule. (D) Ohio hospitals performing ambulatory surgery within the hospital outpatient setting must identify ambulatory surgery costs and charges separately within the cost report as described in paragraph (A) of this rule. (E) Ohio hospitals providing services to medicaid managed care plan (MCP) enrollees must identify MCP costs and charges separately within the cost report as described in paragraph (A) of this rule. (F) It is not necessary to wait for the medicare (Title XVIII) audit in order to file the first interim cost report filing. The interim cost report filing can be audited by the Ohio department of job and family services prior to any applicable final adjustment and settlement. If an amount is due ODJFS as a result of the filing, payment must be forwarded, in accordance with the instructions in appendix A, at the time the cost report is submitted for it to be considered a complete filing. Any revised interim cost report must be received within thirty days of the provider's receipt of the interim cost settlement. A desk audit will be performed by the hospital audit section on all interim cost reports. An interim cost settlement by the department does not preclude the finding of additional cost exceptions in a final settlement for the same cost-reporting period. (1) If an amended medicare cost report is filed with the medicare fiscal intermediary, a copy of the amended medicare cost report must be filed with the hospital audit section. Information contained in the amended medicare cost report will be incorporated into the interim cost report, as originally filed, if received prior to interim settlement; otherwise, it is subject to the provisions of paragraph (F) of this rule. (2) Adjustments may be made to the interim cost report as described in rule 5101:3-2-24 of the Administrative Code.   5101:3-2-23  3  (G) Out-of-state providers of inpatient and/or outpatient services to eligible Ohio Title XIX recipients will not be required to file the cost report identified in this rule unless the outpatient billings for services furnished within their reporting period equal or exceed three hundred thousand dollars. (H) Delinquent filing of medicaid cost reports Hospitals that fail to submit cost reports timely as defined in paragraph (A) of this rule will receive a delinquency letter from the department and are subject to notification that thirty days following the date on which the cost report was due, payments for hospital services will be suspended. Suspension of payments will be terminated on the fifth working day following receipt of the delinquent cost report. Claims affected by suspension of payment are not considered to be clean claims as ""clean claims"" are defined in rule 5101:3-1-19.3 of the Administrative Code. At the beginning of the third month following the month in which the hospital cost report became overdue, if the cost report has not yet been submitted, termination of the provider from the program will be recommended in accordance with Chapter 5101:3-1 of the Administrative Code. (I) Termination of reasonable cost reimbursement for inpatient hospital services furnished by hospitals subject to prospective payment and certain outpatient hospital services. As identified in rule 5101:3-2-07.1 of the Administrative Code, certain hospitals are subject to prospective payment for inpatient services provided on and after October 1, 1984. The hospital must submit on an annual basis a cost report representative of the fiscal year period for the hospital. As identified in rule 5101:3-2-21 of the Administrative Code, certain outpatient services are no longer subject to reasonable cost reimbursement effective with services delivered on or after July 1, 1988. Hospitals must continue to submit on an annual basis a cost report representative of the fiscal reporting period for the hospital, regardless of whether such costs are for services not subject to reasonable cost reimbursement.   5101:3-2-23  4  Effective: R.C. 119.032 review dates:  03/27/2003 03/01/2006  CERTIFIED ELECTRONICALLY Certification 03/17/2003 Date  Promulgated Under: Statutory Authority: Rule Amplifies: Prior Effective Dates:  119.03 5111.02 5111.01, 5111.02 4/7/77, 12/30/77, 3/21/81, 11/11/82, 1/1/84, 10/1/84, 7/29/85, 10/1/85 (Emer.), 12/22/85, 10/19/87, 4/23/88, 8/1/88 (Emer.), 10/21/88, 2/22/89 (Emer.), 5/8/89, 11/5/89, 5/25/90, 5/1/91, 5/1/92, 10/1/93 (Emer.), 11/15/93, 1/20/95, 3/16/96, 7/1/96, 7/1/97, 4/26/99, 7/15/99, 10/18/99, 5/1/00, 5/17/2001   ACTION: Final 5101:3-2-23  ENACTED APPENDIX Appendix A 5101:3-2-23  DATE: 03/17/2003 12:32 PM  SFY 2002 MEDICAID COST REPORT GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS Please read and DRG-exempt and instructions.

Verify the mathematical accuracy of Hospital's logs, by using at least the methodologies described below. If the logs were totaled manually, request adding machine tapes and match a sample of 10 entries on two of the tapes to the corresponding entries on the patient logs. If the logs were totaled with the use of an electronic spreadsheet, verify the accuracy of the formula(s) used. If the log entries were taken directly from the hospital's mainframe computer system, select one of the categories in Step 3 and tally the entries. If the logs do not foot according to any of the above alternatives, return the logs, and, if appropriate, the tapes to Hospital for correction. 5. From the hospital logs, select a random sample of entries from each of the ten data elements listed in Step 3, and verify the appropriateness of the write-off. The appropriateness of the write-off for each account selected shall be determined in accordance with Ohio Administrative Code (OAC) 5101:2-7-07.17 and the hospital's policies regarding the documentation of applicants' incomes. The size of the required sample will vary according to which of three tiers the Hospital is placed in, using data from the current cost reporting period: If the hospital reports total uncompensated care charges for patients without insurance that is less than $5.0 million, the size of the sample shall be at a minimum, 32 accounts: four in each of the six data categories identified in Step 3 for patients with no insurance and two in each of the categories for patients with insurance. If the hospital reports total uncompensated care charges for patients without insurance that is greater than $5.0 million but less than $10.0 million, the size of the sample shall be at a minimum, 64 accounts: eight in each of the six data categories identified in Step 3 for patients with no insurance and four in each of the categories for patients with insurance. If the hospital reports total uncompensated care charges for patients without insurance that is greater than $10.0 million, the size of the sample shall be at a minimum, 96 accounts: 12 in each of the six data categories identified in Step 3 for patients with no insurance and six in each of the categories for patients with insurance. 6. Obtain itemized statements from the Hospital for each of the patient accounts identified in the random selection of data elements identified in Step 5. Match the itemized statement to its corresponding entry in Hospital's log. Verify that patient accounts were correctly logged and entered in Schedule F, based on insurance status. From the itemized statement, verify the patient's name, the date(s) of service, and whether the account is inpatient or outpatient and corresponds with the log entry. Subtract from the itemized statement any charges for services that can not be counted as ""basic, hospital level"" as described in OAC 5101:2-7-07.17 and OAC 5101:3-2-02, Appendix A. Verify that the sum of any subtraction of non-hospital level charges matches or does not exceed the entry for net charges in Hospital's log. 7. Obtain a copy of the Hospital's internal policy outlining its procedures for documenting applications for HCAP qualifying charity care or write-off. 8. Obtain copies of the documentation the Hospital used to determine eligibility for each of the patient accounts identified in the random selection of data elements identified in Step 5. Verify that the hospital's documentation practices are supported by its policy statement, obtained in Step 7, and are in accordance with OAC 5101:3-2-07.17.

Verify that the patient accounts logged as eligible for Disability Assistance (DA) were in fact eligible for DA on the date(s) of service. For accounts of patients <100 % FPL, verify that Hospital used the appropriate Federal Poverty Income Guidelines that were in effect for the date(s) of service, and verify that the patient's income and family size on the date(s) of service were correctly calculated according OAC 5101:2-7-07.17.  Appendix A  10. Request a list of pending-Medicaid accounts from Hospital. Verify that no accounts that have been approved for Medicaid were included in any log or Schedule F entry. If any Medicaid eligible accounts are included, ask the Hospital to remove all Medicaid eligible accounts from the logs and Schedule F. The external reviewer shall issue a review report to the hospital, that includes any required corrective action on the part of the hospital.

Should you have any questions regarding this clearance, please do not hesitate to contact Ogbe Aideyman of my staff at 466-6420 or at aideyo@odjfs.state.oh.us. Thank you.   5101:3-2-23  Cost reports .  (A) For cost-reporting purposes, the medicaid program requires each eligible provider, as defined in rule 5101:3-2-01 of the Administrative Code, to submit periodic reports which generally cover a consecutive twelve-month perio d of their operations. Cost reports must be filed within one hundred eighty days of the end of the hospital's cost-reporting year. Extensions of this one hundred eighty day period shall be granted if the health care financing administrationcenters for medicare and medicaid services (CMS) of the United States department of health and human services extends the date by which the hospital must submit its cost report for the hospital's cost-reporting period. Failure to submit all necessary items and schedules will only delay processing and may result in a reduction of payment or termination as a provider as described in paragraph (H) of this rule. Failure to submit cost reports on or before the dates specified shall be fined one hundred dollars for each day after the due date that the information is not submitted. Effective for medicaid cost reports filed for cost reporting periods ending in state fiscal year (SFY) 2003, and each cost reporting period thereafter, any hospital that fails to submit cost reports on or before the dates specified by the department shall be fined one thousand dollars for each day after the due date that the information is not reported. The hospital shall complete and submit the JFS 02930 in accordance with instructions contained in this rule. The JFS 02930 for SFY 20012002 and its instructions are shown in appendix A of this rule. The hospital's cost report must: (1) Be prepared in accordance with medicare principles governing reasonable cost reimbursement set forth in the providers' reimbursement manual ""HCFA CMS Publications 15 and 15-1"" , available at www.cms.hhs.gov; (2) Include all information necessary for the proper determination of costs payable under medicaid including financial records and statistical data; (3) Include as an attachment a copy of the medicare cost report which must be identical in all respects to the cost report submitted to the medicare fiscal intermediary .; (4) Include the cost report certification executed by an officer of the hospital attesting to the accuracy of the cost report. In addition, all subsequent revisions to the cost report must include an executed certification; (5) Effective for medicaid cost reports filed for cost reporting periods ending in SFY 2003, and each cost reporting period thereafter, the executed certification shall require the officer of the hospital to acknowledge that an independent party, a certified public accountant, has successfully verified the data reported on ""Schedule F"" of the cost report in accordance with the procedures included in the cost report instructions. (B) Hospitals having a distinct part psychiatric or rehabilitation unit recognized by medicare in accordance with the provisions of 42 CFR 412.25 effective October 1, 2002, 42 CFR 412.27 effective October 1, 1994, and 42 CFR 412.29 effective January 1, 2002, must identify distinct part unit costs separately within the cost report as described in paragra ph (A) of this rule. (C) Ohio hospitals performing transplant services covered under medicaid as described in rule 5101:3-207.1 of the Administrative Code must identify transplant costs, charges, days, and discharges separately within the cost report as described in paragraph (A) of this rule.   (D) Ohio hospitals performing ambulatory surgery within the hospital outpatient setting must identify ambulatory surgery costs and charges separately within the cost report as described in paragraph (A) of this rule. (E) Ohio hospitals providing services to medicaid managed care plan (MCP) enrollees must identify MCP costs and charges separately within the cost report as described in paragraph (A) of this rule. (F) It is not necessary to wait for the medicare (Title XVIII) audit in order to file the first interim cost report filing. The interim cost report filing can be audited by the Ohio department of job and family services prior to any applicable final adjustment and settlement. If an amount is due ODJFS as a result of the filing, payment must be forwarded, in accordance with the instructions in appendix A, at the time the cost report is submitted for it to be considered a complete filing. Any revised interim cost report must be received within thirty days of the provider's receipt of the interim cost settlement. A desk audit will be performed by the hospital audit section on all interim cost reports. An interim cost settlement by the department does not preclude the finding of additional cost exceptions in a final settlement for the same cost-reporting period. (1) If an amended medicare cost report is filed with the medicare fiscal intermediary, a copy of the amended medicare cost report must be filed with the hospital audit section. Information contained in the amended medicare cost report will be incorporated into the interim cost report, as originally filed, if received prior to interim settlement; otherwise, it is subject to the provisions of paragraph (F) of this rule. (2) Adjustments may be made to the interim cost report as described in rule 5101:3-2-24 of the Administrative Code. (G) Out-of-state providers of inpatient and/or outpatient services to eligible Ohio Title XIX recipients will not be required to file the cost report identified in this rule unless the outpatie nt billings for services furnished within their reporting period equal or exceed three hundred thousand dollars. (H) Delinquent filing of medicaid cost reports Hospitals that fail to submit cost reports timely as defined in paragraph (A) of this rule will receive a delinquency letter from the department and are subject to notification that thirty days following the date on which the cost report was due, payments for hospital services will be suspended. Suspension of payments will be terminated on the fifth working day following receipt of the delinquent cost report. Claims affected by suspension of payment are not considered to be clean claims as ""clean claims"" are defined in rule 5101:3-1-19.3 of the Administrative Code. At the beginning of the third month following the month in which the hospital cost report became overdue, if the cost report has not yet been submitted, termination of the provider from the program will be recommended in accordance with Chapter 5101:3-1 of the Administrative Code. (I) Termination of reasonable cost reimbursement for inpatient hospital services furnished by hospitals subject to prospective payment and certain outpatient hospital services. As identified in rule 5101:3-2-07.1 of the Administrative Code, certain hospitals are subject to prospective payment for inpatient services provided on and after October 1, 1984. The hospital must submit on an annual basis a cost report representative of the fiscal year period for the hospital. As identified in rule 5101:3-2-21 of the Administrative Code, certain outpatient services are no longer subject to reasonable cost reimbursement effective with services delivered on or after July 1, 1988. Hospitals must continue to submit on an annual basis a cost report representative of the fiscal reporting perio d for the hospital, regardless of whether such costs are for services not subject to reasonable cost reimbursement.   5101:3-2-23  Appendix A  SFY 2002 MEDICAID COST REPORT GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS Please read and DRG-exempt and instructions.

Verify the mathematical accuracy of Hospital's logs, by using at least the methodologies described below. If the logs were totaled manually, request adding machine tapes and match a sample of 10 entries on two of the tapes to the corresponding entries on the patient logs. If the logs were totaled with the use of an electronic spreadsheet, verify the accuracy of the formula(s) used. If the log entries were taken directly from the hospital's mainframe computer system, select one of the categories in Step 3 and tally the entries. If the logs do not foot according to any of the above alternatives, return the logs, and, if appropriate, the tapes to Hospital for correction. 5. From the hospital logs, select a random sample of entries from each of the ten data elements listed in Step 3, and verify the appropriateness of the write-off. The appropriateness of the write-off for each account selected shall be determined in accordance with Ohio Administrative Code (OAC) 5101:2-7-07.17 and the hospital's policies regarding the documentation of applicants' incomes. The size of the required sample will vary according to which of three tiers the Hospital is placed in, using data from the current cost reporting period: If the hospital reports total uncompensated care charges for patients without insurance that is less than $5.0 million, the size of the sample shall be at a minimum, 32 accounts: four in each of the six data categories identified in Step 3 for patients with no insurance and two in each of the categories for patients with insurance. If the hospital reports total uncompensated care charges for patients without insurance that is greater than $5.0 million but less than $10.0 million, the size of the sample shall be at a minimum, 64 accounts: eight in each of the six data categories identified in Step 3 for patients with no insurance and four in each of the categories for patients with insurance. If the hospital reports total uncompensated care charges for patients without insurance that is greater than $10.0 million, the size of the sample shall be at a minimum, 96 accounts: 12 in each of the six data categories identified in Step 3 for patients with no insurance and six in each of the categories for patients with insurance. 6. Obtain itemized statements from the Hospital for each of the patient accounts identified in the random selection of data elements identified in Step 5. Match the itemized statement to its corresponding entry in Hospital's log. Verify that patient accounts were correctly logged and entered in Schedule F, based on insurance status. From the itemized statement, verify the patient's name, the date(s) of service, and whether the account is inpatient or outpatient and corresponds with the log entry. Subtract from the itemized statement any charges for services that can not be counted as ""basic, hospital level"" as described in OAC 5101:2-7-07.17 and OAC 5101:3-2-02, Appendix A. Verify that the sum of any subtraction of non-hospital level charges matches or does not exceed the entry for net charges in Hospital's log. 7. Obtain a copy of the Hospital's internal policy outlining its procedures for documenting applications for HCAP qualifying charity care or write-off. 8. Obtain copies of the documentation the Hospital used to determine eligibility for each of the patient accounts identified in the random selection of data elements identified in Step 5. Verify that the hospital's documentation practices are supported by its policy statement, obtained in Step 7, and are in accordance with OAC 5101:3-2-07.17.

Verify that the patient accounts logged as eligible for Disability Assistance (DA) were in fact eligible for DA on the date(s) of service. For accounts of patients <100 % FPL, verify that Hospital used the appropriate Federal Poverty Income Guidelines that were in effect for the date(s) of service, and verify that the patient's income and family size on the date(s) of service were correctly calculated according OAC 5101:2-7-07.17.  Appendix A  10. Request a list of pending-Medicaid accounts from Hospital. Verify that no accounts that have been approved for Medicaid were included in any log or Schedule F entry. If any Medicaid eligible accounts are included, ask the Hospital to remove all Medicaid eligible accounts from the logs and Schedule F. The external reviewer shall issue a review report to the hospital, that includes any required corrective action on the part of the hospital.

Fraud increases the cost of health care for everyone. Anyone who intentionally makes a false statement or a false claim in order to obtain FEHB benefits or increase the amount of FEHB benefits is subject to prosecution for FRAUD. This could result in CRIMINAL PENALTIES. Please review all medical bills, medical records and claims statements carefully. If you find that a provider, such as a doctor, hospital or pharmacy, charged your plan for services you did not receive, billed for the same service twice, or misrepresented any other information, take the following actions:        Call the provider and ask for an explanation  sometimes the problem is a simple error.        If the provider does not resolve the matter, or if you remain concerned, call your plan at 1- 800/ 634- 4395, or our TDD# 1- 800/ 822- 1215, and explain the situation.        If the matter is not resolved after speaking to your plan (and you still suspect fraud has been committed), call or write:       The Health Care Fraud Hotline       202/ 418- 3300 The Office of Personnel Management Office of the Inspector General Fraud Hotline       1900 E Street, N. W., Room 6400 Washington, D. C. 20415       The inappropriate use of membership identification cards, e. g., to obtain services for a person who is not an eligible family member or after you are no longer enrolled in the Plan, is also subject to review by the Inspector General and may result in an adverse administrative action by your agency.       General Information       Confidentiality Medical and other information provided to the Plan, including claim files, is kept confidential and will be used only: 1) by the Plan and its subcontractors for internal administration of the       Plan, coordination of benefit provisions with other plans, and subrogation of claims; 2) by law enforcement officials with authority to investigate and prosecute alleged civil or criminal actions; 3) by OPM to review a disputed claim or perform its contract administration functions; 4) by OPM and the General Accounting Office when conducting audits as required by the FEHB law; or 5) for bona fide medical research or education. Medical data that does not identify individual members may be disclosed as a result of the bona fide medical research or education.       If you are a new member       Use this brochure as a guide to coverage and obtaining benefits. There may be a delay before you receive your identification card and member information from the Plan. Until you receive your ID card, you may show your copy of the SF 2809 enrollment form or your annuitant confirmation letter from OPM to a provider or Plan facility as proof of enrollment in this Plan. If you do not receive your ID card within 60 days after the effective date of your enrollment, you should contact the Plan.       If you made your open season change by using Employee Express and have not received your new ID card by the effective date of your enrollment, call the Employee Express HELP number to request a confirmation letter. Use that letter to confirm your new coverage with Plan providers.       If you are a new member of this Plan, benefits and rates begin on the effective date of your enrollment, as set by your employing office or retirement system. As a member of this Plan, once your enrollment is effective, you will be covered only for services provided or arranged by a Plan doctor except in the case of emergency as described on page 16. If you are confined in a hospital on the effective date, you must notify the Plan so that it may arrange for the transfer of your care to Plan providers. See ""If you are hospitalized"" on page 4.       FEHB plans may not refuse to provide benefits for any condition you or a covered family member may have solely on the basis that it was a condition that existed before you enrolled in a plan under the FEHB Program.       4       General Information continued       If you are hospitalized       If you change plans or options, benefits under your prior plan or option cease on the effective date of your enrollment in your new plan or option, unless you or a covered family member are confined in a hospital or other covered facility or are receiving medical care in an alternative care setting on the last day of your enrollment under the prior plan or option. In that case, the confined person will continue to receive benefits under the former plan or option until the earliest of (1) the day the person is discharged from the hospital or other covered facility ( a move to an alternative care setting does not constitute a discharge under this provision), or (2) the day after the day all inpatient benefits have been exhausted under the prior plan or option, or (3) the 92nd day after the last day of coverage under the prior plan or option. However, benefits for other family members under the new plan will begin on the effective date. If your plan terminates participation in the FEHB Program in whole or in part, or if the Associate Director for Retirement and Insurance orders an enrollment change, this continuation of coverage provision does not apply; in such case, the hospitalized family member's benefits under the new plan begin on the effective date of enrollment.       Your responsibility       It is your responsibility to be informed about your health benefits. Your employing office or retirement system can provide information about: when you may change your enrollment; who family members are; what happens when you transfer, go on leave without pay, enter military service, or retire; when your enrollment terminates; and the next open season for enrollment. Your employing office or retirement system will also make available to you an FEHB Guide, brochures and other materials you need to make an informed decision.       Things to keep in mind        The benefits in this brochure are effective on January 1 for those already enrolled in this Plan; if you changed plans or plan options, see If you are a new member above. In both cases, however, the Plan's new rates are effective the first day of the enrollee's first full pay period that begins on or after January 1 (January 1 for all annuitants).        Generally, you must be continuously enrolled in the FEHB Program for the last five years before you retire to continue your enrollment for you and any eligible family members after you retire.        The FEHB Program provides Self Only coverage for the enrollee alone or Self and Family coverage for the enrollee, his or her spouse, and unmarried dependent children under age 22. Under certain circumstances, coverage will also be provided under a family enrollment for a disabled child 22 years of age or older who is incapable of self- support.        An enrollee with Self Only coverage who is expecting a baby or the addition of a child may change to a Self and Family enrollment up to 60 days after the birth or addition. The effective date of the enrollment change is the first day of the pay period in which the child was born or became an eligible family member. The enrollee is responsible for his or her share of the Self and Family premium for that time period; both parent and child are covered only for care received from Plan providers, except for emergency benefits. You will not be informed by your employing office (or your retirement system) or your Plan when a family member loses eligibility.        You must direct questions about enrollment and eligibility, including whether a dependent age 22 or older is eligible for coverage, to your employing office or retirement system. The Plan does not determine eligibility and cannot change an enrollment status without the necessary information from the employing agency or retirement system.        An employee, annuitant, or family member enrolled in one FEHB plan is not entitled to receive benefits under any other FEHB plan.        Report additions and deletions (including divorces) of covered family members to the Plan promptly.        If you are an annuitant or former spouse with FEHB coverage and you are also covered by Medicare Part B, you may drop your FEHB coverage and enroll in a Medicare prepaid plan when one is available in your area. If you later change your mind and want to reenroll in FEHB, you may do so at the next open season, or whenever you involuntarily lose coverage in the Medicare prepaid plan or move out of the area it serves.        Most Federal annuitants have Medicare Part A. If you do not have Medicare Part A, you may enroll in a Medicare prepaid plan, but you will probably have to pay for hospital coverage in addition to the Part B premium. Before you join the plan, ask whether they will provide hospital benefits and, if so, what you will have to pay.       5       General Information continued        You may also remain enrolled in this Plan when you join a Medicare prepaid plan.        Contact your local Social Security Administration (SSA) office for information on local Medicare prepaid plans (also known as Coordinated Care Plans or Medicare HMOs) or request it from SSA at 1- 800/ 638- 6833. Contact your retirement system for information on dropping your FEHB enrollment and changing to a Medicare prepaid plan. See page 11 for information on the Medicare prepaid plan offered by this Plan.        Federal annuitants are not required to enroll in Medicare Part B (or Part A) in order to be covered under the FEHB Program nor are their FEHB benefits reduced if they do not have Medicare Part B (or Part A).       Coverage after enrollment ends       When an employee's enrollment terminates because of separation from Federal service or when a family member is no longer eligible for coverage under an employee or annuitant enrollment, and the person is not otherwise eligible for FEHB coverage, he or she generally will be eligible for a free 31- day extension of coverage. The employee or family member may also be eligible for one of the following:       Former spouse coverage       When a Federal employee or annuitant divorces, the former spouse may be eligible to elect coverage under the spouse equity law. If you are recently divorced or anticipate divorcing, contact the employee's employing office (personnel office) or retiree's retirement system to get more facts about electing coverage.       Certificate of Creditable Coverage       Under Federal law, if you lose coverage under the FEHB Program, you should automatically receive a Certificate of Group Health Plan Coverage from the last FEHB Plan to cover you. This certificate, along with any certificates you receive from other FEHB plans you may have been enrolled in, may reduce or eliminate the length of time a preexisting condition clause can be applied to you by a new non- FEHB insurer. If you do not receive a certificate automatically, you must be given one on request.       Temporary continuation of coverage (TCC)       If you are an employee whose enrollment is terminated because you separate from service, you may be eligible to temporarily continue your health benefits coverage under the FEHB Program in any plan for which you are eligible. Ask your employing office for RI 79- 27, which describes TCC, and for RI 70- 5, the FEHB Guide for individuals eligible for TCC. Unless you are separated for gross misconduct, TCC is available to you if you are not otherwise eligible for continued coverage under the Program. For example, you are eligible for TCC when you retire if you are unable to meet the five- year enrollment requirement for continuation of enrollment after retirement.       Your TCC begins after the initial free 31- day extension of coverage ends and continues for up to 18 months after your separation from service (that is, if you use TCC until it expires 18 months following separation, you will only pay for 17 months of coverage). Generally, you must pay the total premium (both the Government and employee shares) plus a 2 percent administrative charge. If you use your TCC until it expires, you are entitled to another free 31- day extension of coverage when you may convert to nongroup coverage. If you cancel your TCC or stop paying premiums, the free 31- day extension of coverage and conversion option are not available.       Children or former spouses who lose eligibility for coverage because they no longer qualify as family members (and who are not eligible for benefits under the FEHB Program as employees or under the spouse equity law) also may qualify for TCC. They also must pay the total premium plus the 2 percent administrative charge. TCC for former family members continues for up to 36 months after the qualifying event occurs, for example, the child reaches age 22 or the date of the divorce. This includes the free 31- day extension of coverage. When their TCC ends (except by cancellation or nonpayment of premium), they are entitled to another free 31- day extension of coverage when they may convert to nongroup coverage.       NOTE: If there is a delay in processing the TCC enrollment, the effective date of the enrollment is still the 32nd day after regular coverage ends. The TCC enrollee is responsible for premium payments retroactive to the effective date and coverage may not exceed the 18 or 36 month period noted above.       6       General Information continued       Notification and election requirements       Separating employees  Within 61 days after an employee's enrollment terminates because of separation from service, his or her employing office must notify the employee of the opportunity to elect TCC. The employee has 60 days after separation (or after receiving the notice from the employing office, if later) to elect TCC.       Children  You must notify your employing office or retirement system when a child becomes eligible for TCC within 60 days after the qualifying event occurs, for example, the child reaches age 22 or marries.       Former spouses  You or your former spouse must notify the employing office or retirement system of the former spouse's eligibility for TCC within 60 days after the termination of the marriage. A former spouse may also qualify for TCC if, during the 36- month period of TCC eligibility, he or she loses spouse equity eligibility because of remarriage before age 55 or loss of the qualifying court order. This applies even if he or she did not elect TCC while waiting for spouse equity coverage to begin. The former spouse must contact the employing office within 60 days of losing spouse equity eligibility to apply for the remaining months of TCC to which he or she is entitled.       The employing office or retirement system has 14 days after receiving notice from you or the former spouse to notify the child or the former spouse of his or her rights under TCC. If a child wants TCC, he or she must elect it within 60 days after the date of the qualifying event (or after receiving the notice, if later). If a former spouse wants TCC, he or she must elect it within 60 days after any of the following events: the date of the qualifying event or the date he or she receives the notice, whichever is later; or the date he or she loses coverage under the spouse equity law because of remarriage before age 55 or loss of the qualifying court order.       Important: The employing office or retirement system must be notified of a child's or former spouse's eligibility for TCC within the 60- day time limit. If the employing office or retirement system is not notified, the opportunity to elect TCC ends 60 days after the qualifying event in the case of a child and 60 days after the change in status in the case of a former spouse.       Conversion to individual coverage       When none of the above choices are available  or chosen  when coverage as an employee or family member ends, or when TCC coverage ends (except by cancellation or nonpayment of premium), you may be eligible to convert to an individual, nongroup contract. You will not be required to provide evidence of good health and the plan is not permitted to impose a waiting period or limit coverage for preexisting conditions. If you wish to convert to an individual contract, you must apply in writing to the carrier of the plan in which you are enrolled within 31 days after receiving notice of the conversion right from your employing agency. A family member must apply to convert within the 31- day free extension of coverage that follows the event that terminates coverage, e. g., divorce or reaching age 22. Benefits and rates under the individual contract may differ from those under the FEHB Program.       7       Facts about BlueCHOICE       This Plan is a comprehensive medical plan, sometimes called a health maintenance organization (HMO). When you enroll in an HMO, you are joining an organized system of health care that arranges in advance with specific doctors, hospitals and other providers to give care to members and pays them directly for their services. Benefits are available only from Plan providers, except during a medical emergency. Members are required to select a personal doctor from among participating Plan primary care doctors. Most specialty care requires a referral from your selected primary care doctor. There are no claim forms when Plan doctors are used.       Your decision to join an HMO should be based on your preference for the plans benefits and delivery system, not because a particular provider is in the Plans network. You cannot change plans because a provider leaves the HMO.       Because the Plan provides or arranges your care and pays the cost, it seeks efficient and effective delivery of health services. By controlling unnecessary or inappropriate care, it can afford to offer a comprehensive range of benefits. In addition to providing comprehensive health services and benefits for accidents, illness and injury, the Plan emphasizes preventive benefits such as office visits, physicals, immunizations and well- baby care. You are encouraged to get medical attention at the first sign of illness.       Information you have a right to know       All carriers in the FEHB Program must provide certain information to you. If you do not receive information about this Plan, you can obtain it by calling the Carrier at 1- 800/ 634- 4395 or TDD 1- 800/ 822- 1215, or you may write to the Plan at P. O. Box 66828, St. Louis, MO 63166- 6828. Information that must be made available to you includes:        Disenrollment rates for 1997.        Compliance with State and Federal licensing or certification requirements and the dates met. If noncompliant, the reason for noncompliance.        Accreditations by recognized accrediting agencies and the dates received.        Carriers type of corporate form and years in existence.        Whether the carrier meets State, Federal and accreditation requirements for fiscal solvency, confidentiality and transfer of medical records.       Who provides care to Plan members?       This Plan is an individual- practice prepayment Plan. All participating doctors practice in their own offices in the community. Covered benefits are available only from those doctors and from participating hospitals and participating pharmacies. The Plan arranges with doctors and hospitals to provide medical care for both the prevention of disease and the treatment of serious illness. For the treatment of rare or unusual medical cases, the Plan may provide services without geographic limitation.       You must select a primary care doctor for each covered family member from the over 809 participating doctors in the Plan's service area. For most care, you must contact your primary care doctor for a referral or authorization before seeing any other doctor, obtaining specialty or hospital services for nonemergency care. A wide variety of Board eligible and Board certified specialists are participating Plan doctors. Your Plan primary doctor admits you to a participating hospital where he/ she has admitting privileges for elective procedures.       Role of a primary care doctor       The first and most important decision each member must make is the selection of a primary care doctor. The decision is important since it is through this doctor that all other health services, particularly those of specialists, are obtained. It is the responsibility of your primary care doctor to obtain any necessary authorizations from the Plan before referring you to a specialist or making arrangements for hospitalization. Services of other providers are covered only when there has been a referral by the member's primary care doctor with the following exceptions: a woman may see her personal participating obstetrician/ gynecologist directly once in every 365- day period; members can also self- refer to BlueCHOICE network providers for a routine eye exam once in every 365- day period; for mental health and substance treatment and for newborn care (benefit limitations apply). In cases of self- referral, the Plan recommends that you check in advance with it or your primary care doctor to confirm that the services are covered and are medically necessary.       8       Facts about BlueCHOICE continued       Choosing your doctor       The Plan's provider directory lists general practitioners, pediatricians, and internists, with their locations and phone numbers, and notes whether or not the doctor is accepting new patients. Directories are updated on a regular basis and are available at the time of enrollment or upon request by calling the Client Service department at 1- 800/ 634- 4395 or TDD 1- 800/ 822- 1215; you can also find out if your doctor participates with this Plan by calling this number. If you are interested in receiving care from a specific provider who is listed in the directory, call the provider to verify that he or she still participates with the Plan and is accepting new patients. Important note: When you enroll in this plan, services (except for emergency benefits) are provided through the Plan's delivery system; the continued availability and/ or participation of any one doctor, hospital, or other provider, cannot be guaranteed.       Should you decide to enroll, you will be asked to complete a primary care doctor selection form and send it directly to the Plan, indicating the name of the primary care doctor( s) selected for you and each member of your family. Members may change their doctor selection any time by calling the Client Service department.       In the event a member is receiving services from a doctor who terminates a participation agreement, the Plan will provide payment for covered services until the Plan can make reasonable and medically appropriate provisions for the assumption of such services by a participating doctor.       Referrals for specialty care       Except in a medical emergency, or when a primary care doctor has designated another doctor to see patients when he or she is unavailable, you must receive a referral from your primary care doctor before seeing any other doctor or before obtaining most special services (see exceptions below). Referral to a participating specialist is given at the primary care doctor's discretion; if specialists or consultants are required beyond those participating in the Plan, the primary care doctor will make arrangements for appropriate referral.       When you receive a referral from your primary care doctor, you must return to the primary care doctor after the consultation. All follow- up care must be provided or arranged by the primary care doctor. On referrals, the primary care doctor will give specific instructions to the consultant as to what services are authorized. If additional services or visits are suggested by the consultant, you must first check with your primary care doctor. Do not go to the specialist unless your primary care doctor has arranged for, and the Plan has issued an authorization for, the referral in advance.       If you have a chronic, complex, or serious medical condition that causes you to see a Plan specialist frequently, your primary care doctor will develop a treatment plan with you and your health plan that allows an adequate number of direct access visits with that specialist. The treatment plan will permit you to visit your specialist without the need to obtain further referrals.       Exceptions You will only need your primary care physician authorization, not a written referral, to receive benefits for inpatient hospital care, laboratory and X- ray services, mammography screenings       and obstetrical ultrasounds at BlueCHOICE facilities. Some types of care do not require a referral or an authorization. You still get benefits as long as you use a BlueCHOICE network provider for routine eye exams and refraction services, well- woman exams, mental health care, substance abuse treatment and newborn exams.       Authorizations Your primary care doctor must obtain authorization from the Plan's Medical Director before referring to or hospitalizing you using nonparticipating providers.       9       Facts about BlueCHOICE continued       For new members If you are already under the care of a specialist who is a Plan participant, you must still obtain a referral from a Plan primary care doctor for the care to be covered by the Plan. If the doctor       who originally referred you prior to your joining this Plan is now your Plan primary care doctor, you need only call to explain that you now belong to this Plan and ask that a ""referral form"" be sent to the specialist for your next appointment.       If you are selecting a new primary care doctor, and want to continue with this specialist, you must schedule an appointment so the primary care doctor can decide whether to treat the condition directly or refer you back to the specialist.       Hospital care If you require hospitalization, your primary care doctor or authorized specialist will make the necessary arrangements and continue to supervise your care.       Out- of- pocket maximum       Copayments are required for a few benefits. However, copayments will not be required for the remainder of the calendar year after your out- of- pocket expenses for services provided or arranged by the Plan reach 100% of annual premium per Self Only enrollment or 100% of annual premium per Self and Family enrollment per calendar year. This copayment maximum does not include costs of prescription drugs.       You should maintain accurate records of the copayments made, as it is your responsibility to determine when the copayment maximum is reached. You are assured a predictable maximum in out- of- pocket costs for covered health and medical needs. Copayments are due when service is rendered, except for emergency care.       Deductible carryover       If you changed to this Plan during open season from a plan with a deductible and the effective date of the change was after January 1, any expenses that would have applied to that plan's deductible will be covered by your old plan if they are for care you got in January before the effective date of your coverage in this Plan. If you have already met the deductible in full, your old plan will reimburse these covered expenses. If you have not met it in full, your old plan will first apply your covered expenses to satisfy the rest of the deductible and then reimburse you for any additional covered expenses. The old plan will pay these covered expenses according to this year's benefits; benefit changes are effective January 1.       Submit claims promptly       When you are required to submit a claim to this Plan for covered expenses, submit your claim promptly. The Plan will not pay benefits for claims submitted later than December 31 of the calendar year following the year in which the expense was incurred unless timely filing was prevented by administrative operations of Government or legal incapacity, provided the claim was submitted as soon as reasonably possible.       Experimental/ investigational determinations       A drug, device or biological product is experimental or investigational if the drug, device, or biological product cannot be lawfully marketed without approval of the U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and approval for marketing has not been given at the time it is furnished.       Other considerations       Plan providers will follow generally accepted medical practice in prescribing any course of treatment. Before you enroll in this Plan, you should determine whether you will be able to accept treatment or procedures that may be recommended by Plan providers.       10       Facts about BlueCHOICE continued       The Plans service area       The service area for this Plan, where Plan providers and facilities are located, is described below. You must live in the service area to enroll in this Plan, however only Illinois residents of Madison and St. Clair counties who work in Missouri may enroll in BlueCHOICE.       If you or a covered family member move outside the enrollment area, you may enroll in another approved plan. It is not necessary to wait until you move or for the open season to make such a change; contact your employing office or retirement system for information if you are anticipating a move.       Service area: Services from Plan providers are available only in the following areas: The St. Louis Area, including the Missouri counties of Crawford, Franklin, Gasconade, Jefferson, Lincoln, Montgomery, Pike, St. Charles, St. Francois, St. Louis (City and County), Ste. Genevieve, Warren and Washington; the Central Missouri Area counties of: Adair, Audrain, Boone, Callaway, Camden, Chariton, Cole, Cooper, Howard, Linn, Macon, Maries, Miller, Moniteau, Monroe, Morgan, Osage, Phelps, Pulaski, Putnam, Randolph; Schuyler, Sullivan, the Southwest Missouri Area counties of: Barry, Barton, Cedar, Christian, Dade, Dallas, Douglas, Greene, Hickory, Jasper, Laclede, Lawrence, McDonald, Newton, Ozark, Polk, Stone, Taney, Webster, Wright; the Southeast Missouri Area counties of: Butler, Carter, Ripley, Wayne and the Illinois counties of St. Clair and Madison.       Reciprocity HMO- USA (Out of State Physician Care)  As a BlueCHOICE customer, you have access to physician care through HMO- USA, a nationwide network of Blue Cross and Blue Shield       HMOs. HMO- USA is one of the largest HMO networks in the country, offering coverage in more than 200 U. S. cities. If you become ill while visiting one of these cities, contact the HMO- USA network at 1- 800/ 1- HMO- USA. This number is also found on the back of your ID card. The HMO- USA referral coordinator will schedule an appointment with an HMO- USA physician in the area from which you are calling. No office visit copay will be required and you will not need to file a claim.       11       General Limitations       Important notice Although a specific service may be listed as a benefit, it will be covered for you only if, in the judgment of your Plan doctor, it is medically necessary for the prevention, diagnosis, or       treatment of your illness or condition. No oral statement of any person shall modify or otherwise affect the benefits, limitations and exclusions of this brochure, convey or void any coverage, increase or reduce any benefits under this Plan or be used in the prosecution or defense of a claim under this Plan. This brochure is the official statement of benefits on which you can rely.       Circumstances beyond Plan control       In the event of major disaster, epidemic, war, riot, civil insurrection, disability of a significant number of Plan providers, complete or partial destruction of facilities, or other circumstances beyond the Plan's control, the Plan will make a good faith effort to provide or arrange for covered services. However, the Plan will not be responsible for any delay or failure in providing service due to lack of available facilities or personnel.       Arbitration of claims       Any claim for damages for personal injury, mental disturbance or wrongful death arising out of the rendition of or failure to render services under this contract must be submitted to binding arbitration.       Other sources of benefits       This section applies when you or your family members are entitled to benefits from a source other than this Plan. You must disclose information about other sources of benefits to the Plan and complete all necessary documents and authorizations requested by the Plan.       Medicare If you or a covered family member is enrolled in this Plan and Medicare Part A and/ or Part B, the Plan will coordinate benefits according to Medicares determination of which coverage is       primary. However, this Plan will not cover services, except those for emergencies, unless you use Plan providers. You must tell your Plan that you or your family member is eligible for Medicare. Generally, that is all you will need to do, unless your Plan tells you that you need to file a Medicare claim.       Group health insurance and automobile insurance       This coordination of benefits (double coverage) provision applies when a person covered by this Plan also has, or is entitled to benefits from, any other group health coverage, or is entitled to the payment of medical and hospital costs under no- fault or other automobile insurance that pays benefits without regard to fault. Information about the other coverage must be disclosed to this Plan.       When there is double coverage for covered benefits, other than emergency services from nonPlan providers, this Plan will continue to provide its benefits in full, but is entitled to receive payment for the services and supplies provided, to the extent that they are covered by the other coverage, no- fault or other automobile insurance or any other primary plan.       One plan normally pays its benefits in full as the primary payer, and the other plan pays a reduced benefit as the secondary payer. When this Plan is the secondary payer, it will pay the lesser of (1) its benefits in full, or (2) a reduced amount which, when added to the benefits payable by the other coverage, will not exceed reasonable charges. The determination of which health coverage is primary (pays its benefits first) is made according to guidelines provided by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. When benefits are payable under automobile insurance, including no- fault, the automobile insurer is primary (pays its benefits first) if it is legally obligated to provide benefits for health care expenses without regard to other health benefits coverage the enrollee may have. This provision applies whether or not a claim is filed under the other coverage. When applicable, authorization must be given this Plan to obtain information about benefits or services available from the other coverage, or to recover overpayments from other coverages.       CHAMPUS If you are covered by both this Plan and the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services (CHAMPUS), this Plan will pay benefits first. As a member of a prepaid       plan, special limitations on your CHAMPUS coverage apply; your primary care provider must authorize all care. See your CHAMPUS Health Benefits Advisor if you have questions about CHAMPUS coverage.       12       General Limitations continued       Medicaid If you are covered by both this Plan and Medicaid, this Plan will pay benefits first.       Workers compensation The Plan will not pay for services required as the result of occupational disease or injury for       which any medical benefits are determined by the Office of Workers Compensation Programs (OWCP) to be payable under workers compensation (under section 8103 of title 5, U. S. C.) or by a similar agency under another Federal or State law. This provision also applies when a third party injury settlement or other similar proceeding provides medical benefits in regard to a claim under workers compensation or similar laws. If medical benefits provided under such laws are exhausted, this Plan will be financially responsible for services or supplies that are otherwise covered by this Plan. The Plan is entitled to be reimbursed by OWCP (or the similar agency) for services it provided that were later found to be payable by OWCP (or the agency).       DVA facilities, DoD facilities, and Indian Health Service       Facilities of the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of Defense, and the Indian Health Service are entitled to seek reimbursement from the Plan for certain services and supplies provided to you or a family member to the extent that reimbursement is required under the Federal statutes governing such facilities.       Other Government agencies The Plan will not provide benefits for services and supplies paid for directly or indirectly by       any other local, State, or Federal Government agency.       General Exclusions       All benefits are subject to the limitations and exclusions in this brochure. Although a specific service may be listed as a benefit, it will not be covered for you unless your Plan doctor determines it is medically necessary to prevent, diagnose or treat your illness or condition. The following are excluded:        Care by non- Plan doctors or hospitals except for authorized referrals or emergencies (see Emergency Benefits);        Expenses incurred while not covered by this Plan;        Services furnished or billed by a provider or facility barred from the FEHB Program;        Services not required according to accepted standards of medical, dental, or psychiatric practice;        Procedures, services, drugs and supplies related to sex transformations; and        Procedures, services, drugs, and supplies related to abortions except when the life of the mother would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term.

A medical emergency is the sudden and unexpected onset of a condition or an injury that you believe endangers your life or could result in serious injury or disability, and requires immediate medical or surgical care.       Emergencies within the service area       If you are in an emergency situation, please call your primary care doctor. In extreme emergencies, if you are unable to contact your doctor, contact the local emergency system (e. g., the 911 telephone system) or go to the nearest hospital emergency room. Be sure to tell the emergency room personnel that you are a Plan member so they can notify the Plan. You or a family member should notify the Plan within 48 hours. It is your responsibility to ensure that the Plan has been timely notified.       If you need to be hospitalized, the Plan must be notified within 48 hours or on the first working day following your admission, unless it was not reasonably possible to notify the Plan within that time. If you are hospitalized in non- Plan facilities and Plan doctors believe care can be better provided in a Plan hospital, you will be transferred when medically feasible with any ambulance charges covered in full.       Benefits are available for care from non- Plan providers in a medical emergency only if delay in reaching a Plan provider would result in death, disability or significant jeopardy to your condition.

Emergencies outside the service area       Benefits are available for any medically necessary health service that is immediately required because of injury or unforeseen illness.       If you need to be hospitalized, the Plan must be notified within 48 hours or on the first working day following your admission, unless it was not reasonably possible to notify the Plan within that time.

Disputed claims review       Plan reconsideration If a claim for payment or services is denied by the Plan, you must ask the Plan, in writing and within six months of the date of the denial, to reconsider its denial before you request a review by OPM. (This time limit may be extended if you show you were prevented by circumstances beyond your control from making your request within the time limit.) OPM will not review your request unless you demonstrate that you gave the Plan an opportunity to reconsider your claim. Your written request to the Plan must state why, based on specific benefit provisions in this brochure, you believe the denied claim for payment or service should have been paid or provided.       Within 30 days after receipt of your request for reconsideration, the Plan must affirm the denial in writing to you, pay the claim, provide the service, or request additional information reasonably necessary to make a determination. If the Plan asks a provider for information it will send you a copy of this request at the same time. The Plan has 30 days after receiving the information to give its decision. If this information is not supplied within 60 days, the Plan will base its decision on the information it has on hand.       OPM review If the Plan affirms its denial, you have the right to request a review by OPM to determine whether the Plan's actions are in accordance with the terms of its contract. You must request the review within 90 days after the date of the Plan's letter affirming its initial denial.       You may also ask OPM for a review if the Plan fails to respond within 30 days of your written request for reconsideration or 30 days after you have supplied additional information to the Plan. In this case, OPM must receive a request for review within 120 days of your request to the Plan for reconsideration or of the date you were notified that the Plan needed additional information, either from you or from your doctor or hospital.       This right is available only to you or the executor of a deceased claimant's estate. Providers, legal counsel, and other interested parties may act as your representative only with your specific written consent to pursue payment of the disputed claim. OPM must receive a copy of your written consent with their request for review.       Your written request for an OPM review must state why, based on specific benefit provisions in this brochure, you believe the denied claim for payment or service should have been paid or provided. If the Plan has reconsidered and denied more than one unrelated claim, clearly identify the documents for each claim.       Your request must include the following information or it will be returned by OPM:        A copy of your letter to the Plan requesting reconsideration;        A copy of the Plan's reconsideration decision (if the Plan failed to respond, provide instead (a) the date of your request to the Plan or (b) the dates the Plan requested and you provided additional information to the Plan);        Copies of documents that support your claim, such as doctors' letters, operative reports, bills, medical records, and explanation of benefit (EOB) forms; and        Your daytime phone number.       24 CARE MUST BE RECEIVED FROM OR ARRANGED BY PLAN DOCTORS       How to Obtain Benefits continued       Medical documentation received from you or the Plan during the review process becomes a permanent part of the disputed claim file, subject to the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act and the Privacy Act.       Send your request for review to: Office of Personnel Management, Office of Insurance Programs, Contracts Division II, P. O. Box 436, Washington, DC 20044.       You (or a person acting on your behalf) may not bring a lawsuit to recover benefits on a claim for treatment, services, supplies or drugs covered by this Plan until you have exhausted the OPM review procedure, established at section 890.105, title 5, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). If OPM upholds the Plan's decision on your claim, and you decide to bring a lawsuit based on the denial, the lawsuit must be brought no later than December 31 of the third year after the year in which the services or supplies upon which the claim is predicated were provided. Pursuant to section 890.107, title 5, CFR, such a lawsuit must be brought against the Office of Personnel Management in Federal court.       Federal law exclusively governs all claims for relief in a lawsuit that relates to this Plan's benefits or coverage or payments with respect to those benefits. Judicial action on such claims is limited to the record that was before OPM when it rendered its decision affirming the Plan's denial of the benefit. The recovery in such a suit is limited to the amount of benefits in dispute.       Privacy Act statement  If you ask OPM to review a denial of a claim for payment or service, OPM is authorized by chapter 89 of title 5, U. S. C., to use the information collected from you and the Plan to determine if the Plan has acted properly in denying you the payment or service, and the information so collected may be disclosed to you and/ or the Plan in support of OPM's decision on the disputed claim.       25       How BlueCHOICE Changes January 1999       Do not rely on this page; it is not an official statement of benefits.       Program- wide changes: Several changes have been made to comply with the Presidents mandate to implement the recommendations of the Patient Bill of Rights.

Thank you.   5101:3-2-23  Cost reports .  (A) For cost-reporting purposes, the medicaid program requires each eligible provider, as defined in rule 5101:3-2-01 of the Administrative Code, to submit periodic reports which generally cover a consecutive twelve-month perio d of their operations. Cost reports must be filed within one hundred eighty days of the end of the hospital's cost-reporting year. Extensions of this one hundred eighty day period shall be granted if the health care financing administrationcenters for medicare and medicaid services (CMS) of the United States department of health and human services extends the date by which the hospital must submit its cost report for the hospital's cost-reporting period. Failure to submit all necessary items and schedules will only delay processing and may result in a reduction of payment or termination as a provider as described in paragraph (H) of this rule. Failure to submit cost reports on or before the dates specified shall be fined one hundred dollars for each day after the due date that the information is not submitted. Effective for medicaid cost reports filed for cost reporting periods ending in state fiscal year (SFY) 2003, and each cost reporting period thereafter, any hospital that fails to submit cost reports on or before the dates specified by the department shall be fined one thousand dollars for each day after the due date that the information is not reported. The hospital shall complete and submit the JFS 02930 in accordance with instructions contained in this rule. The JFS 02930 for SFY 20012002 and its instructions are shown in appendix A of this rule. The hospital's cost report must: (1) Be prepared in accordance with medicare principles governing reasonable cost reimbursement set forth in the providers' reimbursement manual ""HCFA CMS Publications 15 and 15-1"" , available at www.cms.hhs.gov; (2) Include all information necessary for the proper determination of costs payable under medicaid including financial records and statistical data; (3) Include as an attachment a copy of the medicare cost report which must be identical in all respects to the cost report submitted to the medicare fiscal intermediary .; (4) Include the cost report certification executed by an officer of the hospital attesting to the accuracy of the cost report. In addition, all subsequent revisions to the cost report must include an executed certification; (5) Effective for medicaid cost reports filed for cost reporting periods ending in SFY 2003, and each cost reporting period thereafter, the executed certification shall require the officer of the hospital to acknowledge that an independent party, a certified public accountant, has successfully verified the data reported on ""Schedule F"" of the cost report in accordance with the procedures included in the cost report instructions. (B) Hospitals having a distinct part psychiatric or rehabilitation unit recognized by medicare in accordance with the provisions of 42 CFR 412.25 effective October 1, 2002, 42 CFR 412.27 effective October 1, 1994, and 42 CFR 412.29 effective January 1, 2002, must identify distinct part unit costs separately within the cost report as described in paragra ph (A) of this rule. (C) Ohio hospitals performing transplant services covered under medicaid as described in rule 5101:3-207.1 of the Administrative Code must identify transplant costs, charges, days, and discharges separately within the cost report as described in paragraph (A) of this rule.   (D) Ohio hospitals performing ambulatory surgery within the hospital outpatient setting must identify ambulatory surgery costs and charges separately within the cost report as described in paragraph (A) of this rule. (E) Ohio hospitals providing services to medicaid managed care plan (MCP) enrollees must identify MCP costs and charges separately within the cost report as described in paragraph (A) of this rule. (F) It is not necessary to wait for the medicare (Title XVIII) audit in order to file the first interim cost report filing. The interim cost report filing can be audited by the Ohio department of job and family services prior to any applicable final adjustment and settlement. If an amount is due ODJFS as a result of the filing, payment must be forwarded, in accordance with the instructions in appendix A, at the time the cost report is submitted for it to be considered a complete filing. Any revised interim cost report must be received within thirty days of the provider's receipt of the interim cost settlement. A desk audit will be performed by the hospital audit section on all interim cost reports. An interim cost settlement by the department does not preclude the finding of additional cost exceptions in a final settlement for the same cost-reporting period. (1) If an amended medicare cost report is filed with the medicare fiscal intermediary, a copy of the amended medicare cost report must be filed with the hospital audit section. Information contained in the amended medicare cost report will be incorporated into the interim cost report, as originally filed, if received prior to interim settlement; otherwise, it is subject to the provisions of paragraph (F) of this rule. (2) Adjustments may be made to the interim cost report as described in rule 5101:3-2-24 of the Administrative Code. (G) Out-of-state providers of inpatient and/or outpatient services to eligible Ohio Title XIX recipients will not be required to file the cost report identified in this rule unless the outpatie nt billings for services furnished within their reporting period equal or exceed three hundred thousand dollars. (H) Delinquent filing of medicaid cost reports Hospitals that fail to submit cost reports timely as defined in paragraph (A) of this rule will receive a delinquency letter from the department and are subject to notification that thirty days following the date on which the cost report was due, payments for hospital services will be suspended. Suspension of payments will be terminated on the fifth working day following receipt of the delinquent cost report. Claims affected by suspension of payment are not considered to be clean claims as ""clean claims"" are defined in rule 5101:3-1-19.3 of the Administrative Code. At the beginning of the third month following the month in which the hospital cost report became overdue, if the cost report has not yet been submitted, termination of the provider from the program will be recommended in accordance with Chapter 5101:3-1 of the Administrative Code. (I) Termination of reasonable cost reimbursement for inpatient hospital services furnished by hospitals subject to prospective payment and certain outpatient hospital services. As identified in rule 5101:3-2-07.1 of the Administrative Code, certain hospitals are subject to prospective payment for inpatient services provided on and after October 1, 1984. The hospital must submit on an annual basis a cost report representative of the fiscal year period for the hospital. As identified in rule 5101:3-2-21 of the Administrative Code, certain outpatient services are no longer subject to reasonable cost reimbursement effective with services delivered on or after July 1, 1988. Hospitals must continue to submit on an annual basis a cost report representative of the fiscal reporting perio d for the hospital, regardless of whether such costs are for services not subject to reasonable cost reimbursement.   5101:3-2-23  Appendix A  SFY 2002 MEDICAID COST REPORT GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS Please read and DRG-exempt and instructions.

Verify the mathematical accuracy of Hospital's logs, by using at least the methodologies described below. If the logs were totaled manually, request adding machine tapes and match a sample of 10 entries on two of the tapes to the corresponding entries on the patient logs. If the logs were totaled with the use of an electronic spreadsheet, verify the accuracy of the formula(s) used. If the log entries were taken directly from the hospital's mainframe computer system, select one of the categories in Step 3 and tally the entries. If the logs do not foot according to any of the above alternatives, return the logs, and, if appropriate, the tapes to Hospital for correction. 5. From the hospital logs, select a random sample of entries from each of the ten data elements listed in Step 3, and verify the appropriateness of the write-off. The appropriateness of the write-off for each account selected shall be determined in accordance with Ohio Administrative Code (OAC) 5101:2-7-07.17 and the hospital's policies regarding the documentation of applicants' incomes. The size of the required sample will vary according to which of three tiers the Hospital is placed in, using data from the current cost reporting period: If the hospital reports total uncompensated care charges for patients without insurance that is less than $5.0 million, the size of the sample shall be at a minimum, 32 accounts: four in each of the six data categories identified in Step 3 for patients with no insurance and two in each of the categories for patients with insurance. If the hospital reports total uncompensated care charges for patients without insurance that is greater than $5.0 million but less than $10.0 million, the size of the sample shall be at a minimum, 64 accounts: eight in each of the six data categories identified in Step 3 for patients with no insurance and four in each of the categories for patients with insurance. If the hospital reports total uncompensated care charges for patients without insurance that is greater than $10.0 million, the size of the sample shall be at a minimum, 96 accounts: 12 in each of the six data categories identified in Step 3 for patients with no insurance and six in each of the categories for patients with insurance. 6. Obtain itemized statements from the Hospital for each of the patient accounts identified in the random selection of data elements identified in Step 5. Match the itemized statement to its corresponding entry in Hospital's log. Verify that patient accounts were correctly logged and entered in Schedule F, based on insurance status. From the itemized statement, verify the patient's name, the date(s) of service, and whether the account is inpatient or outpatient and corresponds with the log entry. Subtract from the itemized statement any charges for services that can not be counted as ""basic, hospital level"" as described in OAC 5101:2-7-07.17 and OAC 5101:3-2-02, Appendix A. Verify that the sum of any subtraction of non-hospital level charges matches or does not exceed the entry for net charges in Hospital's log. 7. Obtain a copy of the Hospital's internal policy outlining its procedures for documenting applications for HCAP qualifying charity care or write-off. 8. Obtain copies of the documentation the Hospital used to determine eligibility for each of the patient accounts identified in the random selection of data elements identified in Step 5. Verify that the hospital's documentation practices are supported by its policy statement, obtained in Step 7, and are in accordance with OAC 5101:3-2-07.17.

Page 15 of 42 JFS 02930 (Rev. 7/02) From the eligibility documentation outlined in Step 8, verify that the patients were residents of Ohio, and not eligible for Medicaid according to OAC 5101:2-7-07.17. Verify that the patient accounts logged as eligible for Disability Assistance (DA) were in fact eligible for DA on the date(s) of service. For accounts of patients <100 % FPL, verify that Hospital used the appropriate Federal Poverty Income Guidelines that were in effect for the date(s) of service, and verify that the patient's income and family size on the date(s) of service were correctly calculated according OAC 5101:2-7-07.17.  Appendix A  10. Request a list of pending-Medicaid accounts from Hospital. Verify that no accounts that have been approved for Medicaid were included in any log or Schedule F entry. If any Medicaid eligible accounts are included, ask the Hospital to remove all Medicaid eligible accounts from the logs and Schedule F. The external reviewer shall issue a review report to the hospital, that includes any required corrective action on the part of the hospital. External Data Validation Report Each hospital shall retain all Schedule F data validation review reports for every cost report year, for a period of three years, and shall make such reports available to the department upon request, within three business days of such request.

This document has not been officially approved by the Committee   and may not reflect the views of its Members.      Table of Contents .   Those who wish to use this document in the Acrobat PDF format, may do so through the generosity of Professor Paul A. Jargowsky, Ph.D at the University of Texas at Dallas  on his website.     The 1998 (16th edition) of the Green Book.     The 1996 (15th edition) of the Green Book.     The 1994 (14th edition) of the Green Book.      Notes for users:     The  Green Book  is compiled by the staff of the Committee on Ways and Means of the U.S. House of Representatives from many sources and it provides program descriptions and historical data on a wide variety of social and economic topics, including Social Security, employment, earnings, welfare, child support, health insurance, the elderly, families with children, poverty and taxation. It has become a standard reference work for those interested in the direction of social policy in the United States.   Persons who download these chapters for local use should be aware that many of these chapters have very wide tables of data (20 or more columns) which are difficult to format properly. Fonts with proportional spacing cause the numbers in the tables to be misaligned and normal width pages cause the right hand columns within rows to wrap to the next line. This makes the tables undecipherable. I suggest that after you have downloaded these pages, each file be formatted with a fixed-width font such as Courier and when wide tables are encountered that the page format be adjusted to 14 inch paper in landscape format.   For your convenience, a compressed copy of the  2000 Green Book (2000gb.zip) , (1.4 mb) or    a self-extracting compressed (98gb.exe) copy of the 1998 Green Book  (1,296 kb), or    a self-extracting compressed (96gb.exe) copy of the 1996 Green Book  (1,338 kb, or   or the  a self-extracting compressed (94.exe) copy of the 1994 Green Book  (1,081 kb) are available here.

GX241-33-16245345	Texas Department of Human Services                                        Adopt-A-Nursing Home                The  Adopt-A-Nursing Home  program     matches groups of volunteers with nursing homes to strengthen, enrich and enhance the     quality of life of residents.                    On average, 50% of Texas nursing home residents do not have         families or a surviving spouse, and about 60% have no regular visitors.            Any group (civic, school, religious, business, scouts, pet         therapy, friends or other) made up of at least 3 members may participate. Volunteers may         be of any age.            Each group commits to help with resident activities at least         four times a year. Activities include visiting residents, having parties, and taking field         trips.           As of August 31,1996, 403 nursing facilities statewide had         been adopted by 2,025 groups of volunteers.           For more information, contact your local nursing home, or         call 1-800-889-8595.                                                                     Contents       Previous Page       Next Page            Last Updated:  Wednesday, May 23, 2001            Documents in PDF format require the use of the free  Adobe Acrobat Reader  (Version 4), which can be downloaded from  Adobe Systems, Inc.

GX232-07-15923136	"ACTION: Original  DATE: 01/09/2003 4:20 PM  5101:3-2-23  Cost reports.  (A) For cost-reporting purposes, the medicaid program requires each eligible provider, as defined in rule 5101:3-2-01 of the Administrative Code, to submit periodic reports which generally cover a consecutive twelve-month period of their operations. Cost reports must be filed within one hundred eighty days of the end of the hospital's cost-reporting year. Extensions of this one hundred eighty day period shall be granted if the health care financing administrationcenters for medicare and medicaid services (CMS) of the United States department of health and human services extends the date by which the hospital must submit its cost report for the hospital's cost-reporting period. Failure to submit all necessary items and schedules will only delay processing and may result in a reduction of payment or termination as a provider as described in paragraph (H) of this rule. Failure to submit cost reports on or before the dates specified shall be fined one hundred dollars for each day after the due date that the information is not submitted. Effective for medicaid cost reports filed for cost reporting periods ending in state fiscal year (SFY) 2003, and each cost reporting period thereafter, any hospital that fails to submit cost reports on or before the dates specified by the department shall be fined one thousand dollars for each day after the due date that the information is not reported. The hospital shall complete and submit the JFS 02930 in accordance with instructions contained in this rule. The JFS 02930 for SFY 20012002 and its instructions are shown in appendix A of this rule. The hospital's cost report must: (1) Be prepared in accordance with medicare principles governing reasonable cost reimbursement set forth in the providers' reimbursement manual ""HCFACMS Publications 15 and 15-1"", available at www.cms.hhs.gov/manuals/cmstoc.asp dated November 08, 2002 ; (2) Include all information necessary for the proper determination of costs payable under medicaid including financial records and statistical data; (3) Include as an attachment a copy of the medicare cost report which must be identical in all respects to the cost report submitted to the medicare fiscal intermediary.; (4) Include the cost report certification executed by an officer of the hospital attesting to the accuracy of the cost report. In addition, all subsequent revisions to the cost report must include an executed certification; (5) Effective for medicaid cost reports filed for cost reporting periods ending in SFY 2003, and each cost reporting period thereafter, the executed certification shall require the officer of the hospital to acknowledge that an independent party, a certified public accountant, has successfully verified the [ stylesheet: rule.xsl 2.00, authoring tool: i4i 1.409 Feb 7, 2002, (dv: 13, p: 7968, pa: 6625, ra: 31736, d: 31456)] print date: 01/09/2003 04:22 PM   5101:3-2-23  2  data reported on ""Schedule F"" of the cost report in accordance with the procedures included in the cost report instructions. (B) Hospitals having a distinct part psychiatric or rehabilitation unit recognized by medicare in accordance with the provisions of 42 CFR 412.25 effective October 1, 2002, 42 CFR 412.27 effective October 1, 1994, and 42 CFR 412.29 effective January 1, 2002, must identify distinct part unit costs separately within the cost report as described in paragraph (A) of this rule. (C) Ohio hospitals performing transplant services covered under medicaid as described in rule 5101:3-2-07.1 of the Administrative Code must identify transplant costs, charges, days, and discharges separately within the cost report as described in paragraph (A) of this rule. (D) Ohio hospitals performing ambulatory surgery within the hospital outpatient setting must identify ambulatory surgery costs and charges separately within the cost report as described in paragraph (A) of this rule. (E) Ohio hospitals providing services to medicaid managed care plan (MCP) enrollees must identify MCP costs and charges separately within the cost report as described in paragraph (A) of this rule. (F) It is not necessary to wait for the medicare (Title XVIII) audit in order to file the first interim cost report filing. The interim cost report filing can be audited by the Ohio department of job and family services prior to any applicable final adjustment and settlement. If an amount is due ODJFS as a result of the filing, payment must be forwarded, in accordance with the instructions in appendix A, at the time the cost report is submitted for it to be considered a complete filing. Any revised interim cost report must be received within thirty days of the provider's receipt of the interim cost settlement. A desk audit will be performed by the hospital audit section on all interim cost reports. An interim cost settlement by the department does not preclude the finding of additional cost exceptions in a final settlement for the same cost-reporting period. (1) If an amended medicare cost report is filed with the medicare fiscal intermediary, a copy of the amended medicare cost report must be filed with the hospital audit section. Information contained in the amended medicare cost report will be incorporated into the interim cost report, as originally filed, if received prior to interim settlement; otherwise, it is subject to the provisions of paragraph (F) of this rule. (2) Adjustments may be made to the interim cost report as described in rule 5101:3-2-24 of the Administrative Code.   5101:3-2-23  3  (G) Out-of-state providers of inpatient and/or outpatient services to eligible Ohio Title XIX recipients will not be required to file the cost report identified in this rule unless the outpatient billings for services furnished within their reporting period equal or exceed three hundred thousand dollars. (H) Delinquent filing of medicaid cost reports Hospitals that fail to submit cost reports timely as defined in paragraph (A) of this rule will receive a delinquency letter from the department and are subject to notification that thirty days following the date on which the cost report was due, payments for hospital services will be suspended. Suspension of payments will be terminated on the fifth working day following receipt of the delinquent cost report. Claims affected by suspension of payment are not considered to be clean claims as ""clean claims"" are defined in rule 5101:3-1-19.3 of the Administrative Code. At the beginning of the third month following the month in which the hospital cost report became overdue, if the cost report has not yet been submitted, termination of the provider from the program will be recommended in accordance with Chapter 5101:3-1 of the Administrative Code. (I) Termination of reasonable cost reimbursement for inpatient hospital services furnished by hospitals subject to prospective payment and certain outpatient hospital services. As identified in rule 5101:3-2-07.1 of the Administrative Code, certain hospitals are subject to prospective payment for inpatient services provided on and after October 1, 1984. The hospital must submit on an annual basis a cost report representative of the fiscal year period for the hospital. As identified in rule 5101:3-2-21 of the Administrative Code, certain outpatient services are no longer subject to reasonable cost reimbursement effective with services delivered on or after July 1, 1988. Hospitals must continue to submit on an annual basis a cost report representative of the fiscal reporting period for the hospital, regardless of whether such costs are for services not subject to reasonable cost reimbursement.   5101:3-2-23  4  Effective: R.C. 119.032 review dates: 03/01/2006  Certification  Date  Promulgated Under: Statutory Authority: Rule Amplifies: Prior Effective Dates:  119.03 5111.02 5111.01, 5111.02 4/7/77, 12/30/77, 3/21/81, 11/11/82, 1/1/84, 10/1/84, 7/29/85, 10/1/85 (Emer.), 12/22/85, 10/19/87, 4/23/88, 8/1/88 (Emer.), 10/21/88, 2/22/89 (Emer.), 5/8/89, 11/5/89, 5/25/90, 5/1/91, 5/1/92, 10/1/93 (Emer.), 11/15/93, 1/20/95, 3/16/96, 7/1/96, 7/1/97, 4/26/99, 7/15/99, 10/18/99, 5/1/00, 5/17/2001   ACTION: Original  RESCINDED APPENDIX 5101:3-2-23  DATE: 01/09/2003 4:20 PM  SFY 2001 MEDICAID COST REPORT GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS Please read and follow all DRG-exempt and out-of-state instructions.

Verify the mathematical accuracy of Hospital's logs, by using at least the methodologies described below. If the logs were totaled manually, request adding machine tapes and match a sample of 10 entries on two of the tapes to the corresponding entries on the patient logs. If the logs were totaled with the use of an electronic spreadsheet, verify the accuracy of the formula(s) used. If the log entries were taken directly from the hospital's mainframe computer system, select one of the categories in Step 3 and tally the entries. If the logs do not foot according to any of the above alternatives, return the logs, and, if appropriate, the tapes to Hospital for correction. 5. From the hospital logs, select a random sample of entries from each of the ten data elements listed in Step 3, and verify the appropriateness of the write-off. The appropriateness of the write-off for each account selected shall be determined in accordance with Ohio Administrative Code (OAC) 5101:2-7-07.17 and the hospital's policies regarding the documentation of applicants' incomes. The size of the required sample will vary according to which of three tiers the Hospital is placed in, using data from the current cost reporting period: If the hospital reports total uncompensated care charges for patients without insurance that is less than $5.0 million, the size of the sample shall be at a minimum, 32 accounts: four in each of the six data categories identified in Step 3 for patients with no insurance and two in each of the categories for patients with insurance. If the hospital reports total uncompensated care charges for patients without insurance that is greater than $5.0 million but less than $10.0 million, the size of the sample shall be at a minimum, 64 accounts: eight in each of the six data categories identified in Step 3 for patients with no insurance and four in each of the categories for patients with insurance. If the hospital reports total uncompensated care charges for patients without insurance that is greater than $10.0 million, the size of the sample shall be at a minimum, 96 accounts: 12 in each of the six data categories identified in Step 3 for patients with no insurance and six in each of the categories for patients with insurance. 6. Obtain itemized statements from the Hospital for each of the patient accounts identified in the random selection of data elements identified in Step 5. Match the itemized statement to its corresponding entry in Hospital's log. Verify that patient accounts were correctly logged and entered in Schedule F, based on insurance status. From the itemized statement, verify the patient's name, the date(s) of service, and whether the account is inpatient or outpatient and corresponds with the log entry. Subtract from the itemized statement any charges for services that can not be counted as ""basic, hospital level"" as described in OAC 5101:2-7-07.17 and OAC 5101:3-2-02, Appendix A. Verify that the sum of any subtraction of non-hospital level charges matches or does not exceed the entry for net charges in Hospital's log. 7. Obtain a copy of the Hospital's internal policy outlining its procedures for documenting applications for HCAP qualifying charity care or write-off. 8. Obtain copies of the documentation the Hospital used to determine eligibility for each of the patient accounts identified in the random selection of data elements identified in Step 5. Verify that the hospital's documentation practices are supported by its policy statement, obtained in Step 7, and are in accordance with OAC 5101:3-2-07.17.

Verify that the patient accounts logged as eligible for Disability Assistance (DA) were in fact eligible for DA on the date(s) of service. For accounts of patients <100 % FPL, verify that Hospital used the appropriate Federal Poverty Income Guidelines that were in effect for the date(s) of service, and verify that the patient's income and family size on the date(s) of service were correctly calculated according OAC 5101:2-7-07.17.  Appendix A  10. Request a list of pending-Medicaid accounts from Hospital. Verify that no accounts that have been approved for Medicaid were included in any log or Schedule F entry. If any Medicaid eligible accounts are included, ask the Hospital to remove all Medicaid eligible accounts from the logs and Schedule F. The external reviewer shall issue a review report to the hospital, that includes any required corrective action on the part of the hospital.

This test project is called ""FEDMER"" - Federal Medical Evidence of Record.  The test region includes employees who live in the States of Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, Virginia, West Virginia and the District of Columbia.   For more background see Benefits Administration Letter 99-109, which announced the pilot and it is available through the OPM Web site ( http://www.opm.gov/asd ).  For an update, please refer to the attached Benefits Administration Letter 00-103.    We have asked human resources offices to identify FEDMER disability applications by putting a special cover or flag on the application package.  The special flag will allow the retirement operations staff to easily identify these cases for proper handling.  A sample copy of a FEDMER flag (RI 20-114) is attached.  This flag card is generally printed on pink paper, but they may also be on plain white paper.  You should handle FEDMER cases like any other disability retirement case. Your personnel office will attach a FEDMER flag on the front of every FEDMER case.  We ask that you leave the FEDMER flag attached to the front of the case when you ship it to OPM's Retirement Operations Center in Boyers, Pennsylvania.    Please be aware that FEDMER cases include additional documents such as original Social Security forms. There is also a photocopy of all Social Security forms, FERS disability forms and the medical evidence.  This means that there are two copies of the Social Security and FERS disability applications and the medical evidence.  Do not remove any of these documents from the case.   We thank you for your assistance.  If you have any questions, please email us at:  FEDMER@opm.gov .    And if you should have any questions about this or any other payroll office letter, please call us at 202-606-0606, or send email  FEDMER@opm.gov .             Robert A.

GX270-75-10198743	Department Of Insurance P .O. Box 517 Frankfort, Kentucky 40602-0517 GEORGE NICHOLS III PAUL E. PATTON  COMMISSIONER  GOVERNOR  Memo To: From: Date: Re: Interested Parties George Nichols III Commissioner November 16, 2000 Weiss Ratings, Inc.  The Department has received several inquiries regarding a report from Weiss Ratings, Inc. released on October 30, 2000. The report provided information about 572 HMOs including those in Kentucky. This report lists Bluegrass Family Health, Inc. as one of 11 health maintenance organizations that have failed to meet the guidelines recently adopted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) for the minimum capital level needed to maintain financial stability. The Department would like to take this opportunity to clarify some points in the report. Bluegrass Family Health does meet the minimum statutory requirements currently in effect in Kentucky. Weiss performed its analysis using the minimum capital levels adopted by the NAIC, namely Risk-Based Capital (RBC) standards. In preparing its report, Weiss Ratings considered the annual statement filings submitted to the NAIC as of December 31, 1999. At that time, Kentucky law required Bluegrass to have a minimum net worth of $1, 250,000. Bluegrass had $2,751,870, more than twice the required amount, at December 31, 1999. As of September 30, 2000, Bluegrass had significantly improved its net worth, at a reported $6,623,412.  An Equal Opportunity Employer M/F/D   Kentucky recently adopted the RBC standards through legislation enacted during the 2000 General Assembly. The legislation became effective on July 15, 2000 and will be phased in over a three year period, as structured in the original NAIC model Carriers are required to make their first RBC filing in Kentucky on March 1, 2001, for the year ending December 31, 2000. Because the carriers were aware of the Department's proposal to move to an RBC requirement, they had been calculating their net worth based on RBC to determine what level they would be at when the new requirements took effect in Kentucky. Even though they were not subject to the RBC standards, Bluegrass Family Health indicated their RBC numbers with their 1999 filing to the NAIC and this information was included by Weiss Ratings in its report. The Department continuously monitors all HMOs licensed in Kentucky to ascertain their financial solvency and ability to pay claims on behalf of their policyholders. If you would like information on a specific company, please send a written request to the attention of Margaret Shreve, P. O. Box 517, Frankfort, Kentucky 40601.

Fraud increases the cost of health care for everyone. Anyone who intentionally makes a false statement or a false claim in order to obtain FEHB benefits or increase the amount of FEHB benefits is subject to prosecution for FRAUD. This could result in CRIMINAL PENALTIES. Please review all medical bills, medical records and claims statements carefully. If you find that a provider, such as a doctor, hospital or pharmacy, charged your plan for services you did not receive, billed for the same service twice, or misrepresented any other information, take the following actions:    Call the provider and ask for an explanation - sometimes the problem is a simple error. If the provider does not resolve the matter, or if you remain concerned, call your plan at (410) 539-8622 and explain the situation. If the matter is not resolved after speaking to your plan (and you still suspect fraud has been committed), call or write: THE HEALTH CARE FRAUD HOTLINE 202/418-3300 The Office of Personnel Management Office of the Inspector General Fraud Hotline 1900 E Street, N.W., Room 6400 Washington, D.C. 20415 The inappropriate use of membership identification cards, e.g., to obtain services for a person who is not an eligible family member or after you are no longer enrolled in the Plan, is also subject to review by the Inspector General and may result in an adverse administrative action by your agency.  General Information Confidentiality Medical and other information provided to the Plan, including claim files, is kept confidential and will be used only: 1) by the Plan and its subcontractors for internal administration of the Plan, coordination of benefit provisions with other plans, and subrogation of claims; 2) by law enforcement officials with authority to investigate and prosecute alleged civil or criminal actions; 3) by OPM to review a disputed claim or perform its contract administration functions; 4) by OPM and the General Accounting Office when conducting audits as required by the FEHB law; or 5) for bona fide medical research or education. Medical data that does not identify individual members may be disclosed as a result of the bona fide medical research or education. Use this brochure as a guide to coverage and obtaining benefits. There may be a delay before you receive your identification card and member information from the Plan. Until you receive your ID card, you may show your copy of the SF 2809 enrollment form or your annuitant confirmation letter from OPM to a provider or Plan facility as proof of enrollment in this Plan. If you do not receive your ID card within 60 days after the effective date of your enrollment, you should contact the Plan. If you made your open season change by using Employee Express and have not received your new ID card by the effective date of your enrollment, call the Employee Express HELP number to request a confirmation letter. Use that letter to confirm your new coverage with Plan providers. If you are a new member of this Plan, benefits and rates begin on the effective date of your enrollment, as set by your employing office or retirement system. As a member of this Plan, once your enrollment is effective, you will be covered only for services provided or arranged by a Plan doctor except in the case of emergency as described on page 13, or when you self-refer for Point of Service benefits as described on page 18. If you are confined in a hospital on the effective date, you must notify the Plan so that it may arrange for the transfer of your care to Plan providers. See ""If you are hospitalized"" on page 4. FEHB plans may not refuse to provide benefits for any condition you or a covered family member may have solely on the basis that it was a condition that existed before you enrolled in a plan under the FEHB Program except as stated in any cosmetic surgery or dental benefits description in this brochure. 3  If you are a new member   General Information If you are hospitalized  continued  If you change plans or options, benefits under your prior plan or option cease on the effective date of your enrollment in your new plan or option, unless you or a covered family member are confined in a hospital or other covered facility or are receiving medical care in an alternative care setting on the last day of your enrollment under the prior plan or option. In that case, the confined person will continue to receive benefits under the former plan or option until the earliest of (1) the day the person is discharged from the hospital or other covered facility (a move to an alternative care setting does not constitute a discharge under this provision), or (2) the day after the day all inpatient benefits have been exhausted under the prior plan or option, or (3) the 92nd day after the last day of coverage under the prior plan or option. However, benefits for other family members under the new plan will begin on the effective date. If your plan terminates participation in the FEHB Program in whole or in part, or if the Associate Director for Retirement and Insurance orders an enrollment change, this continuation of coverage provision does not apply; in such case, the hospitalized family member 's benefits under the new plan begin on the effective date of enrollment. It is your responsibility to be informed about your health benefits. Your employing office or retirement system can provide information about: when you may change your enrollment; who family members are; what happens when you transfer, go on leave without pay, enter military service, or retire; when your enrollment terminates; and the next open season for enrollment. Your employing office or retirement system will also make available to you an FEHB Guide, brochures and other materials you need to make an informed decision.  The benefits you changed however, the begins on or in this brochure are effective on January 1 for those already enrolled in this Plan; if plans or plan options, see ""If you are a new member"" above. In both cases, Plan's new rates are effective the first day of the enrollee's first full pay period that after January 1 (January 1 for all annuitants).  Your responsibility  Things to keep in mind     Generally, you must be continuously enrolled in the FEHB Program for the last five years before you retire to continue your enrollment for you and any eligible family members after you retire. The FEHB Program provides Self Only coverage for the enrollee alone or Self and Family coverage for the enrollee, his or her spouse, and unmarried dependent children under age 22. Under certain circumstances, coverage will also be provided under a family enrollment for a disabled child 22 years of age or older who is incapable of self-support. An enrollee with Self Only coverage who is expecting a baby or the addition of a child may change to a Self and Family enrollment up to 60 days after the birth or addition. The effective date of the enrollment change is the first day of the pay period in which the child was born or became an eligible family member. The enrollee is responsible for his or her share of the Self and Family premium for that time period; both parent and child are covered only for care received from Plan providers, except for emergency or POS benefits. You will not be informed by your employing office (or your retirement system) or your Plan when a family member loses eligibility. You must direct questions about enrollment and eligibility, including whether a dependent age 22 or older is eligible for coverage, to your employing office or retirement system. The Plan does not determine eligibility and cannot change an enrollment status without the necessary information from the employing agency or retirement system. An employee, annuitant, or family member enrolled in one FEHB plan is not entitled to receive benefits under any other FEHB plan. Report additions and deletions (including divorces) of covered family members to the Plan promptly.         4   General Information   continued  If you are an annuitant or former spouse with FEHB coverage and you are also covered by Medicare Part B, you may drop your FEHB coverage and enroll in a Medicare prepaid plan when one is available in your area. If you later change your mind and want to reenroll in FEHB, you may do so at the next open season, or whenever you involuntarily lose coverage in the Medicare prepaid plan or move out of the area it serves. Most Federal annuitants have Medicare Part A. If you do not have Medicare Part A, you may enroll in a Medicare prepaid plan, but you will probably have to pay for hospital coverage in addition to the Part B premium. Before you join the plan, ask whether they will provide hospital benefits and, if so, what you will have to pay. You may also remain enrolled in this Plan when you join a Medicare prepaid plan. Contact your local Social Security Administration (SSA) office for information on local Medicare prepaid plans (also known as Coordinated Care Plans or Medicare HMOs) or request it from SSA at 1-800/638-6833. Contact your retirement system for information on dropping your FEHB enrollment and changing to a Medicare prepaid plan. See page 20 for information on the Medicare prepaid plan offered by this Plan.    Federal annuitants are not required to enroll in Medicare Part B (or Part A) in order to be covered under the FEHB Program nor are their FEHB benefits reduced if they do not have Medicare Part B (or Part A).  Coverage after enrollment ends  When an employee's enrollment terminates because of separation from Federal service or when a family member is no longer eligible for coverage under an employee or annuitant enrollment, and the person is not otherwise eligible for FEHB coverage, he or she generally will be eligible for a free 31-day extension of coverage. The employee or family member may also be eligible for one of the following:  Former spouse When a Federal employee or annuitant divorces, the former spouse may be eligible to elect coverage under the spouse equity law. If you are recently divorced or anticipate divorcing, contact the coverage employee's employing office (personnel office) or retiree's retirement system to get more facts about electing coverage.  Temporary continuation of coverage  If you are an employee whose enrollment is terminated because you separate from service, you may be eligible to temporarily continue your health benefits coverage under the FEHB Program in any plan for which you are eligible. Ask your employing office for RI 79-27, which describes TCC, and for RI 70-5, the FEHB Guide for individuals eligible for TCC. Unless you are separated for gross misconduct, TCC is available to you if you are not otherwise eligible for continued coverage under the Program. For example, you are eligible for TCC when you retire if you are unable to meet the five-year enrollment requirement for continuation of enrollment after retirement. Your TCC begins after the initial free 31-day extension of coverage ends and continues for up to 18 months after your separation from service (that is, if you use TCC until it expires 18 months following separation, you will only pay for 17 months of coverage). Generally, you must pay the total premium (both the Government and employee shares) plus a 2 percent administrative charge. If you use your TCC until it expires, you are entitled to another free 31-day extension of coverage when you may convert to nongroup coverage. If you cancel your TCC or stop paying premiums, the free 31-day extension of coverage and conversion option are not available. Children or former spouses who lose eligibility for coverage because they no longer qualify as family members (and who are not eligible for benefits under the FEHB Program as employees or under the spouse equity law) also may qualify for TCC. They also must pay the total premium plus the 2 percent administrative charge. TCC for former family members continues for up to 36 months after the qualifying event occurs, for example, the child reaches age 22 or the date of the divorce. This includes the free 31day extension of coverage. When their TCC ends (except by cancellation or nonpayment of premium), they are entitled to another free 31-day extension of coverage when they may convert to nongroup coverage. 5   General Information  continued  NOTE: If there is a delay in processing the TCC enrollment, the effective date of the enrollment is still the 32nd day after regular coverage ends. The TCC enrollee is responsible for premium payments retroactive to the effective date and coverage may not exceed the 18 or 36 month period noted above.  Notification and election requirements  Separating employees - Within 61 days after an employee's enrollment terminates because of separation from service, his or her employing office must notify the employee of the opportunity to elect TCC. The employee has 60 days after separation (or after receiving the notice from the employing office, if later) to elect TCC. Childre n - You must notify your employing office or retirement system when a child becomes eligible for TCC within 60 days after the qualifying event occurs, for example, the child reaches age 22 or marries. Former spouses - You or your former spouse must notify the employing office or retirement system of the former spouse's eligibility for TCC within 60 days after the termination of the marriage. A former spouse may also qualify for TCC if, during the 36-month period of TCC eligibility, he or she loses spouse equity eligibility because of remarriage before age 55 or loss of the qualifying court order. This applies even if he or she did not elect TCC while waiting for spouse equity coverage to begin. The former spouse must contact the employing office within 60 days of losing spouse equity eligibility to apply for the remaining months of TCC to which he or she is entitled. The employing office or retirement system has 14 days after receiving notice from you or the former spouse to notify the child or the former spouse of his or her rights under TCC. If a child wants TCC, he or she must elect it within 60 days after the date of the qualifying event (or after receiving the notice, if later). If a former spouse wants TCC, he or she must elect it within 60 days after any of the following events: the date of the qualifying event or the date he or she receives the notice, whichever is later; or the date he or she loses coverage under the spouse equity law because of remarriage before age 55 or loss of the qualifying court order. Important: The employing office or retirement system must be notified of a child's or former spouse's eligibility for TCC within the 60-day time limit. If the employing office or retirement system is not notified, the opportunity to elect TCC ends 60 days after the qualifying event in the case of a child and 60 days after the change in status in the case of a former spouse.  Conversion to individual coverage  When none of the above choices are available - or chosen - when coverage as an employee or family member ends, or when TCC coverage ends (except by cancellation or nonpayment of premium), you may be eligible to convert to an individual, nongroup contract. You will not be required to provide evidence of good health and the plan is not permitted to impose a waiting period or limit coverage for preexisting conditions. If you wish to convert to an individual contract, you must ap ply in writing to the carrier of the plan in which you are enrolled within 31 days after receiving notice of the conversion right from your employing agency. A family member must apply to convert within the 31-day free extension of coverage that follows the event that terminates coverage, e.g., divorce or reaching age 22. Benefits and rates under the individual contract may differ from those under the FEHB Program.  6   Facts about this Plan This Plan is a health maintenance organization (HMO) that offers a point of service, or POS, product. Whenever you need services, you may choose to obtain them from your personal doctor within the Plan's provider network or go outside the network for treatment. Within the Plan's network you are encouraged to select a personal doctor who will provide or arrange for your care and you will pay minimal amounts for comprehensive benefits. When you choose a non-Plan doctor or other non-Plan provider, you will pay a substantial portion of the charges and the benefits available may be less comprehensive. See page 17 for more information.  Who provides care to Plan members?  CHP is a Mixed Model Plan (MMP) offering a choice of individual community doctors and multispecialty medical groups conveniently located. Each family member may choose his or her primary care doctor or Medical Center. CHP also features a Point of Service benefit that allows members to receive non-emergency benefits, on a fee-for-service basis, outside of the Standard HMO Benefits. See pages 18 and 19.  Role of a primary care doctor  The first and most important decision each member must make is the selection of a primary care doctor. The decision is important as it is through this doctor that all other services, particularly those of specialists, are obtained. It is the responsibility of your primary care doctor to obtain any necessary authorizations from the Plan before referring you to a specialist or making arrangements for hospitalization. Services of other providers are covered only when there has been a referral by the member 's primary care doctor or when you use POS benefits, with the following exception: members may see a Plan optometrist for their annual eye exam without first obtaining a referral. The Plan's provider directory lists primary care doctors (family practitioners, pediatricians, and internists), with their locations and phone numbers, and notes whether or not the doctor is accepting new patients. Directories are updated and are available at the time of enrollment or upon request by calling the Member Services Department at 410/539-8484; you can also find out if your doctor participates with this Plan by calling this number. If you are interested in receiving care from a specific provider who is listed in the directory, call the provider to verify that he or she still participates with the Plan and is accepting new patients. Important note: When you enroll in this Plan, services (except for emergency or POS benefits) are provided through the Plan's delivery system; the continued availability and/or participation of any one doctor, hospital, or other provider cannot be guaranteed. If you enroll, you will be asked to complete a primary care doctor selection form and send it directly to the Plan, indicating the name of the primary care doctor(s) selected for you and each member of your family. Members may change their doctor selection by notifying the Plan 30 days in advance. If you are receiving services from a doctor who leaves the Plan, the Plan will pay for covered services until the Plan can arrange with you for you to be seen by another participating doctor.  Choosing your doctor  Referrals for specialty care  Except in a medical emergency, or when a primary care doctor has designated another doctor to see patients when he or she is unavailable, or when you choose to use the Plan's POS benefits, you must receive a referral form your primary care doctor before seeing any other doctor or obtaining special services. Referral to a participating specialist is given at the primary care doctor 's discretion; if specialists or consultants are required beyond those participating in the Plan, the primary care doctor will make arrangements for appropriate referrals. When you receive a referral from your primary care doctor, you must return to the primary care doctor after the consultation. All follow-up care must be provided or authorized by the primary care doctor. On referrals, the primary care doctor will give specific instructions to the consultant as to what services are authorized. If additional services or visits are suggested by the consultant, you must first check with your primary care doctor. Do not go to the specialist unless your primary care doctor has arranged for, and the Plan has issued, an authorization for the referral, in advance, in order to be eligible for Standard HMO Benefits of this Plan. Members who wish to self-refer to a doctor of their choice can use the Point of Service benefits and receive the benefits described on pages 18 and 19.  Authorizations  Your primary care doctor must obtain authorization from the Medical Director before you may be hospitalized, referred for specialty care or obtain follow-up care from a specialist. 7   Facts about this Plan For new members  continued  If you are already under the care of a specialist who is a Plan participating doctor, you must still obtain a referral from a Plan primary care doctor for the care to be covered by Standard HMO Benefits. If the doctor who originally referred you prior to your joining the Plan is now your Plan primary care doctor, you need to call and explain that you now belong to this Plan and ask that a ""referral form"" be sent to the specialist for your next appointment. If you are selecting a new primary care doctor, you must schedule an appointment so the primary care doctor can decide whether to treat the condition directly or refer you back to the specialist.  Hospital care Out-of-pocket maximum Deductible carryover  If you require hospitalization, your primary care doctor or authorized specialist will make the necessary arrangements and continue to supervise your care. Your out-of-pocket expenses for benefits provided under Standard HMO Benefits are limited to the stated copayments which are required for a few benefits. The Plan has established an out-of-pocket maximum for benefits provided under the Point of Service benefit. See page 19 for details. If you changed to this Plan during open season from a plan with a deductible and the effective date of the change was after January 1, any expenses that would have applied to that plan's deductible will be covered by your old plan if they are for care you got in January before the effective date of your coverage in this Plan. If you have already met the deductible in full, your old plan will reimburse these covered expenses. If you have not met it in full, your old plan will first apply your covered expenses to satisfy the rest of the deductible and then reimburse you for any additional covered expenses. The old plan will pay these covered expenses according to this year 's benefits; benefit changes are effective January 1. When you are required to submit a claim to this Plan for covered expenses, submit your claim promptly. The Plan will not pay benefits for claims submitted later than December 31 of the calendar year following the year in which the expense was incurred unless timely filing was prevented by administrative operations of Government or legal incapacity, provided the claim was submitted as soon as reasonably possible. Plan providers will follow generally accepted medical practice in prescribing any course of treatment. Before you enroll in this Plan, you should determine whether you will be able to accept treatment or procedures that may be recommended by Plan providers. The service area for this Plan, where Plan providers and facilities are located, is different from the enrollment area listed on the front cover of this brochure (the area in which you must live or work to enroll in the Plan). In addition, you may enroll in this Plan if you work in the Service Area. Benefits for care outside the service area are limited to emergency services, as described on page 13, and to services covered under Point of Service benefits, as described on page 19. If you or a covered family member move outside the enrollment area, you may enroll in another approved plan. It is not necessary to wait until you move or for the open season to make such a change; contact your employing office or retirement system for information if you are anticipating a move.  Submit claims promptly  Other considerations The Plan's Service and Enrollment Areas  General Limitations Important notice Although a specific service may be listed as a benefit, it will be covered for you only if, in the judgment of your Plan doctor, it is medically necessary for the prevention, diagnosis, or treatment of your illness or condition. No oral statement of any person shall modify or otherwise affect the benefits, limitations and exclusions of this brochure, convey or void any coverage, increase or reduce any benefits under this Plan or be used in the prosecution or defense of a claim under this Plan. This brochure is based on text included in the contract between OPM and this Plan and is intended to be a complete statement of benefits available to FEHB members. You should use this brochure to determine your entitlement to benefits. However, if conflicts are discovered between the language of this brochure and the contract,  8   General Limitations Circumstances beyond Plan control Other sources of benefits Medicare  continued  the contract will control. In the event of major disaster, epidemic, war, riot, civil insurrection, disability of a significant number of Plan providers, complete or partial destruction of facilities, or other circumstances beyond the Plan's control, the Plan will make a good faith effort to provide or arrange for covered services. However, the Plan will not be responsible for any delay or failure in providing service due to lack of available facilities or personnel. This section applies when you or your family members are entitled to benefits from a source other than this Plan. You must disclose information about other sources of benefits to the Plan and complete all necessary documents and authorizations requested by the Plan. If you or a covered family member is enrolled in this Plan and Part A, Part B, or Parts A and B of Medicare, benefits will be coordinated with Medicare according to Medicare's determination of which coverage is primary. Generally, you do not need to take any action after informing the Plan of your or your family member 's eligibility for Medicare. Your Plan will provide you with further instructions if a Medicare claim needs to be filed. This coordination of benefits (double coverage) provision applies when a person covered by this Plan also has, or is entitled to benefits from, any other group health coverage, or is entitled to the payment of medical and hospital costs under no-fault or other automobile insurance that pays benefits without regard to fault. Information about the other coverage must be disclosed to this Plan. When there is double coverage for covered benefits, other than emergency services from non-Plan providers, this Plan will continue to provide its benefits in full, but is entitled to receive payment for the services and supplies provided, to the extent that they are covered by the other coverage, no-fault or other automobile insurance or any other primary plan. One plan normally pays its benefits in full as the primary payer, and the other plan pays a reduced benefit as the secondary payer. When this Plan is the secondary payer, it will pay the lesser of (1) its benefits in full or (2) a reduced amount which, when added to the benefits payable by the other coverage, will not exceed reasonable charges. The determination of which health coverage is primary (pays its benefits first) is made according to guidelines provided by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. When benefits are payable under automobile insurance, including no-fault, the automobile insurer is primary (pays its benefits first) if it is legally obligated to provide benefits for health care expenses without regard to other health benefits coverage the enrollee may have. This provision applies whether or not a claim is filed under the other coverage. When applicable, authorization must be given this Plan to obtain information about benefits or services available from the other coverage, or to recover overpayments from other coverages.  Group health insurance and automobile insurance  CHAMPUS  If you are covered by both this Plan and the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services (CHAMPUS), this Plan will pay benefits first. As a member of a prepaid plan, special limitations on your CHAMPUS coverage apply. To receive standard HMO benefits, your primary care provider must authorize all care; you may self-refer for eligible POS services. See your CHAMPUS Health Benefits Advisor if you have questions about CHAMPUS coverage. If you are covered by both this Plan and Medicaid, this Plan will pay benefits first.  Medicaid  The Plan will not pay for services required as the result of occupational disease or injury for which any Workers' compensation medical benefits are determined by the Office of Workers Compensation Programs (OWCP) to be  payable under workers' compensation (under section 8103 of title 5, U.S.C.) or by a similar agency under another Federal or State law. This provision also applies when a third party injury settlement or other similar proceeding provides medical benefits in regard to a claim under workers' compensation or similar law. If medical benefits provided under such law are exhausted, this Plan will be financially responsible for services or supplies that are otherwise covered by this Plan. The Plan is entitled to be reimbursed by OWCP (or the similar agency) for services it provided that were later found to be payable by OWCP (or the agency). 9   General Limitations DVA facilities, DoD facilities, and Indian Health Service Other Government agencies  continued  Facilities of the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of Defense, and the Indian Health Service are entitled to seek reimbursement from the Plan for certain services and supplies provided to you or a family member to the extent that reimbursement is required under the Federal statutes governing such facilities. The Plan will not provide benefits for services and supplies paid for directly or indirectly by any other local, State, or Federal Government agency.  Liability insurance andIf a covered person is sick or injured as a result of the act or omission of another person or party, the Plan requires that it be reimbursed for the benefits provided in an amount not to exceed the amount of third party actions the recovery, or that it be subrogated to the person's rights to the extent of the benefits received under the Plan, including the right to bring suit in the person's name. If you need more information about subrogation, the Plan will provide you with its subrogation procedures.  General Exclusions All benefits are subject to the limitations and exclusions in this brochure. Although a specific service may be listed as a benefit, it will not be covered for you unless your Plan doctor determines it is medically necessary to prevent, diagnose or treat your illness or condition. The following are excluded:        Care by non-Plan doctors or hospitals except for authorized referrals or emergencies (see Emergency Benefits) or eligible self-referred services obtained under Point of Service Benefits; Expenses incurred while not covered by this Plan; Services furnished or billed by a provider or facility barred from the FEHB Program; Services not required according to accepted standards of medical, dental, or psychiatric practice; Procedures, treatments, drugs or devices that are experimental or investigational; Procedures, services, drugs and supplies related to sex transformations; and Abortions, except when the life of the mother would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term  Medical and Surgical Benefits What is covered A comprehensive range of preventive, diagnostic and treatment services is provided by Plan doctors and other Plan providers.

Hospitalization for medical treatment of substance abuse is limited to emergency care, diagnosis, treatment of medical conditions, and medical management of withdrawal symptoms (acute detoxification) if the Plan doctor determines that outpatient management is not medically appropriate. See page 15 for nonmedical Substance Abuse Benefits.  Personal comfort items, such as telephone and television  Blood and blood derivatives  Custodial care, rest cures, domiciliary or convalescent care  Acute inpatient detoxification  What is not covered  Emergency Benefits What is a medical emergency? A medical emergency is the sudden and unexpected onset of a condition or an injury that requires immediate medical or surgical care. Some problems are emergencies because, if not treated promptly, they might become more serious; examples include deep cuts and broken bones. Others are emergencies because they are potentially life-threatening, such as heart attacks, strokes, poisonings, gunshot wounds, or sudden inability to breathe. There are many other acute conditions that the Plan may determine are medical emergencies - what they all have in common is the need for quick action. If you are in an emergency situation, please call your primary care doctor. In extreme emergencies, if you are unable to contact your doctor, contact the local emergency system (e.g., the 911 telephone system) or go to the nearest hospital emergency room. Be sure to tell the emergency room personnel that you are a Plan member so they can notify the Plan. You or a family member must notify the Plan within 48 hours. It is your responsibility to ensure that the Plan has been timely notified. If you need to be hospitalized, the Plan must be notified within 48 hours or on the first working day following your admission, unless it was not reasonably possible to notify the Plan within that time. If 13  Emergencies within the service area   Emergency Benefits  continued  you are hospitalized in non-Plan facilities and Plan doctors believe care can be better provided in a Plan hospital, you will be transferred when medically feasible with any ambulance charges covered in full.

Other services must be treated by or referred to specialists by your primary care doctor. Read this brochure carefully to get a clear understanding. For eligible non-emergency POS services, the Plan pays 80% of usual, customary, and reasonable (UCR) charges for covered services after you pay a $250 calendar year deductible per person or $750 per family. Coinsurance is the amount you pay for all covered non-emergency POS services you receive; you pay 20% of the UCR of all incurred covered services and may be balance billed by doctors and hospitals for the difference between billed charges and the UCR. The deductible is the dollar amount you pay for non-emergency POS services before the Plan pays its portion (80% of UCR). You must submit a claim to the Plan within 90 days from the date of service to receive payment for services obtained through the Point of Service benefit. Failure to submit the claim, in writing to the Plan within this time limit will result in denial of claims payment. Claim forms may be obtained by calling 410/539-8484. POS services are those medical services that are provided without a Plan-approved referral primary care Plan doctor. If you choose to make an appointment with a non-Plan doctor or doctor without an appropriate referral from your selected primary care Plan doctor, you are POS services. You should remember that the highest benefit available is provided through benefits. from your a Plan receiving HMO  Point of Service Benefits are subject to the limitations and exclusions shown elsewhere in this brochure. For example, you will be covered for up to 60 days of skilled nursing care whether you use Plan providers, non-Plan providers, or any combination thereof. Although a specific service may be listed as a benefit, it will not be covered for you unless the Plan determines it is medically necessary for the prevention, diagnosis, or treatment of your illness or condition.  Pre-Authorization  In order to receive Point of Service coverage for inpatient hospitalization services, skilled nursing facility services hospice services, home health services, and all surgical procedures (inpatient and outpatient), these services must be pre-authorized by the Plan when not an emergency. Failure to obtain pre-authorization for these services will result in a 20% reduction in coverage in addition to the 20% coinsurance, for a total of 40% of the UCR charges.  What is covered under POS Medical and Surgical Benefits At your option, you can choose to self-refer for the following services instead of getting a referral from your primary care doctor; you pay 20% of covered charges after deductible.             Physician office, home or hospital visits Specialist care and consultation Allergy testing and treatment Complete obstetrical(maternity) care for all covered females including prenatal, delivery and postnatal care Voluntary sterilization Diagnostic laboratory and X-ray tests Surgical procedures (Pre-authorization is required for all surgical procedures whether inpatient or outpatient services).

Preauthorization is required; you pay 20% of UCR charges after the calendar year deductible is satisfied. Failure to obtain pre-authorization for these services will result in a 20% reduction in benefits in addition to the 20% coinsurance, for a total of 40% of the UCR charges. Emergency benefits are covered under Standard HMO Benefits regardless of the location from which the services are rendered (see Emergency Benefits on page 13). The POS Benefit has a member out-of pocket maximum based on the amount of coinsurance member(s) pay. Once out-of-pocket expenses for members(s) reach $2,500 per year per Self Only enrollment or $7,500 per year per Self and Family enrollment, the Plan will pay 100% of the usual, customary and reasonable (UCR) charges for POS benefits for the remainder of the calendar year. Member deductibles, member coinsurance, charges for non-covered benefits, charges and copays incurred under Standard HMO Benefits, charges above UCR amounts, and the penalty for failing to obtain pre-authorization for the inpatient services listed under the pre-authorization provision do not apply towards the $2,500 or $7,500 maximum.

Disputed Claims Review Plan reconsideration  If a claim for payment or services is denied by the Plan, you must ask the Plan, in writing and within six months of the date of the denial, to reconsider its denial before you request a review by OPM. (This time limit may be extended if you show you were prevented by circumstances beyond your control from making your request within the time limit.) OPM will not review your request unless you demonstrate that you gave the Plan an opportunity to reconsider your claim. Your written request to the Plan must state why, based on specific benefit provisions in this brochure, you believe the denied claim for payment or service should have been paid or provided. 19   Non-FEHB Benefits Available to Plan Members  The benefits described on this page are neither offered nor guaranteed under the contract with the FEHB Program, but are made available to all enrollees and family members of this Plan. The cost of the benefits described on this page is not included in the FEHB premium and any charges for these services do not count toward any FEHB deductibles, POS maximum benefits, or out-of-pocket maximums. These benefits are not subject to the FEHB disputed claims procedure.  Expanded Vision Care - 20% discount on lenses and eye glass frames at Plan doctors. Contact the Member Services Department at (410)539-8484 for more information. Fitness Centers - Discount fitness programs at area fitness centers.

Contact the Marketing Department at (410)539-8484 for more information. Medicare prepaid plan enrollment - This Plan offers Medicare recipients the opportunity to enroll in the Plan through Medicare. As indicated on page x, annuitants and former spouses with FEHB coverage and Medicare Part B may elect to drop their FEHB coverage and enroll in a Medicare prepaid plan when one is available in their area. They may then later reenroll in the FEHB Program. Most Federal annuitants have Medicare Part A. Those without Medicare Part A may join this Medicare prepaid plan but will probably have to pay for hospital coverage in addition to the Part B premium. Before you join the plan, ask whether the plan covers hospital benefits and, if so, what you will have to pay. Contact your retirement system for information on dropping your FEHB enrollment and changing to a Medicare prepaid plan. Contact us at (410) 539-8484 for information on the Medicare prepaid plan and the cost of that enrollment.  Benefits on this page are not part of the FEHB contract 20   How to Obtain Benefits  continued  Within 30 days after receipt of your request for reconsideration, the Plan must affirm the denial in writing to you, pay the claim, provide the service, or request additional information reasonably necessary to make a determination. If the Plan asks a provider for information it will send you a copy of this request at the same time. The Plan has 30 days after receiving the information to give its decision. If this information is not supplied within 60 days, the Plan will base its decision on the information it has on hand.  OPM review  If the Plan affirms its denial, you have the right to request a review by OPM to determine whether the Plan's actions are in accordance with the terms of its contract. You must request the review within 90 days after the date of the Plan's letter affirming its initial denial. You may also ask OPM for a review if the Plan fails to respond within 30 days of your written request for reconsideration or 30 days after you have supplied additional information to the Plan. In this case, OPM must receive a request for review within 120 days of your request to the Plan for reconsideration or of the date you were notified that the Plan needed additional information, either from you or from your doctor or hospital. This right is available only to you or the executor of a deceased claimant's estate. Providers, legal counsel, and other interested parties may act as your representative only with your specific written consent to pursue payment of the disputed claim. OPM must receive a copy of your written consent with their request for review. Your written request for an OPM review must state why, based on specific benefit provisions in this brochure, you believe the denied claim for payment or service should have been paid or provided. If the Plan has reconsidered and denied more than one unrelated claim, clearly identify the documents for each claim. Your request must include the following information or it will be returned by OPM:   A copy of your letter to the Plan requesting reconsideration; A copy of the Plan's reconsideration decision (if the Plan failed to respond, provide instead (a) the date of your request to the Plan or (b) the dates the Plan requested and you provided additional information to the Plan); Copies of documents that support your claim, such as doctors' letters, operative reports, bills, medical records, and explanation of benefit (EOB) forms; and Your daytime phone number.

If OPM upholds the Plan's decision on your claim, and you decide to bring a lawsuit based on the denial, the lawsuit must be brought no later than December 31 of the third year after the year in which the services or supplies upon which the claim is predicated were provided. Pursuant to section 890.107, title 5, CFR, such a lawsuit must be brought against the Office of Personnel Management in Federal court. 21   How to Obtain Benefits  continued  Federal law exclusively governs all claims for relief in a lawsuit that relates to this Plan's benefits or coverage or payments with respect to those benefits. Judicial action on such claims is limited to the record that was before OPM when it rendered its decision affirming the Plan's denial of the benefit. The recovery in such a suit is limited to the amount of benefits in dispute. Privacy Act statement - If you ask OPM to review a denial of a claim for payment or authorized by chapter 89 of title 5, U.S.C., to use the information collected from you determine if the Plan has acted properly in denying you the payment or service, and collected may be disclosed to you and/or the Plan in support of OPM's decision on service, OPM is and the Plan to the information so the disputed claim.  How Chesapeake Health Plan Changes - 1997 Do not rely on this page; it is not an official statement of benefits.  Benefit Changes    Under the Plan's Standard HMO Benefits, home visits by nurses and health aides are covered at no charge. Previously, home visits by nurses and health aides were subject to a $10 copay per visit. Family planning services are no longer covered under the Plan's POS benefit, and must be obtained through the Plan's Standard HMO Benefits. Previously, family planning services were covered under both the Standard HMO Benefits and the POS benefit. Under the Plan's Standard HMO Benefits, the Plan has established a mail order prescription drug program. Members may obtain maintenance drugs for up to a 90 day supply at a $5 copay per prescription or refill. Previously, the Plan did not offer a mail order prescription drug benefit. The Plan has an out-of-pocket maximum for its POS benefit. Please see page 19 for specific details. This was previously not addressed. The Plan's POS benefit has been clarified to show that failure to obtain required preauthorization will result in a 20% reduction in benefits in addition to the 20% member coinsurance, for a total reduction of 40% of the UCR charges. Previously, this provision incorrectly stated that if pre-authorization is not obtained, benefits will not be paid by the Plan. Prescription drugs are not covered under the Plan's POS benefit and are only available under Standard HMO Benefits. Acupuncture is not a covered benefit of this Plan under either Standard HMO Benefits or POS benefits. This was previously not addressed. The Plan's Standard HMO Benefit for the treatment of infertility has been clarified to show that fertility drugs are covered under the Plan's prescription drug benefit. Fertility drugs were previously addressed only under the Plan's prescription drug benefit. The use of a Plan identification card to obtain benefits after you are no longer enrolled in the Plan is a fraudulent action subject to review by the Inspector General. Medical data that does not identify individual members may be disclosed as a result of bona fide medical research or education. General Information When a family member is hospitalized on the effective date of an enrollment change and continues to receive benefits under the old plan, benefits under the new plan will begin for other family members on the effective date of the new enrollment.      Clarifications             22   How Chesapeake Health Plan Changes - 1997  continued  An enrollee with Self Only coverage who is expecting a baby or the addition of a child may change to a Self and Family enrollment up to 60 days after the birth or addition. Annuitants and former spouses with FEHB coverage, and who are covered by Medicare Part B, may join a Medicare prepaid plan if they do not have Medicare Part A, but they will probably have to pay for hospital coverage. They may also remain enrolled under an FEHB plan when they enroll in a Medicare prepaid plan. Federal annuitants are not required to enroll in Medicare Part B (or Part A) in order to be covered under the FEHB Program nor are their FEHB benefits reduced if they do not have Medicare Part B (or Part A). Temporary continuation of coverage (TCC) for employees or family members who lose eligibility for FEHB coverage includes one free 31-day extension of coverage and may include a second. How these are coordinated has been clarified; notification and election requirements have also been clarified. ""Conversion to individual coverage"" does not require evidence of good health and the plan is not permitted to impose a waiting period or limit coverage for preexisting conditions; benefits and rates under the individual contract may differ from those under the FEHB Program.   The benefit ""Nonexperimental implants"" is now termed ""The insertion of internal prosthetic devices"". This Plan has been redesignated a ""Health Maintenance Organization with a Point of Service (or POS) Product."" It offers its members the option of using either Plan or non-Plan providers each time they require medical care. See Point of Service Benefits on page 17 for additional charges that apply to services from non-Plan providers and limitations on covered benefits when they are received from non-Plan providers. This section was formerly titled ""Opt-out Benefits."" The Plan has expanded its service and enrollment area to include the Virginia Cities of Alexandria, Fairfax, Falls Church, Fredericksburg, and Manassas/Manassas Park, as well as the Virginia Counties of Arlington, Fairfax, Fauquier, Loudoun, Prince William, and Stafford. In addition, Frederick County Maryland is now part of the Plan's service area. Previously, Frederick County was limited to the Plan's enrollment area. Enrollees who change their FEHB enrollments using Employee Express may call the Employee Express HELP number to obtain a letter confirming that change if their ID cards do not arrive by the effective date of the enrollment change. The Plan will not pay for services required as the result of occupational disease or injury for which any medical benefits are determined by the Office of Workers Compensation Programs (OWCP) or an equivalent agency to be payable under workers' compensation or similar Federal or State law. The Plan is entitled to be reimbursed by OWCP or the equivalent agency for services it provided that were later found to be payable by OWCP or the agency. Disputed claims If your claim for payment or services is denied by the Plan, and you decide to ask OPM to review that denial, you must first ask the Plan to reconsider their decision. You must now request their reconsideration within six months of the denial (previously, you had one year to do this). This time limit may be extended if you show you were prevented by circumstances beyond your control from making your request within the time limit. Providers, legal counsel, and other interested parties may act as your representative in pursuing payment of a disputed claim only with your written consent. Any lawsuit to recover benefits on a claim for treatment, services, supplies or drugs covered by this Plan must be brought against the Office of Personnel Management in Federal court and only after you have exhausted the OPM review procedure. 23  Other changes           Summary of Benefits for Chesapeake Health Plan - 1997 Do not rely on this chart alone.

Benefits from high deductible plans F and J will not begin until out-of-pocket expenses are [$1500]. Out-of-pocket expenses for this deductible are expenses that would ordinarily be paid by the policy.

GX268-44-5044333	Accident and Health  Home Farm Owners  HMO  Life Annuity  Auto  The 2000 consumer complaint ratios of insurance companies/carriers illustrate how some companies generate more complaints per $1 million of premiums than others. The ratios provide helpful information to consumers interested in evaluating their insurance companies/carriers, and to state regulators in targeting companies/carriers requiring closer review. In the tables below, a complaint ratio of 4.40, for example, means that the company had approximately 4.40 complaints per $1 million worth of business. Total complaint numbers are also listed, together with premium volume and market share. In this report, a complaint is defined as written correspondence expressing a grievance against an insurer. No judgment is made in the ratios as to whether the complaint is justified. Private passenger automobile protests are included in the number of complaints. Federal Employees Health Benefit Plan premiums are not included in this report because the complaints are not counted against the company/carrier. Where available, complaint ratios for previous years are provided. These can be used to determine whether a company/carrier has a history of consistently high or low ratios or an upward or downward trend. The report includes companies/carriers with at least five (5) complaints or one percent (1%) insurance. Therefore, the report looks at only those companies/carriers with significant numbers than examining every insurer that writes business in Colorado. Due to advanced technology additional life insurance companies with marketshares of 1% or hig her are listed on this year's health maintenance organizations, all have been included in the report. of the premium volume in of complaints or significant in identifying marketshares report. Additionally, due to a particular line of market share, rather for all life products, the small number of  Tables are included for the lines of insurance that account for the greatest numbers of complaints and premiums written. On average, private passenger automobile insurance generates the highest complaint ratios, followed by accident and health and homeowners/farmowners insurance. Life insurance companies and health maintenance organizations have lower averag e complaint ratios, and significant differences can be seen between companies within these lines. Health maintenance organizations have internal and external review processes in their contracts, which have historically reduced the number of complaints rep orted to the Division of Insurance. Large differences can be seen among competing companies, and small differences should not be considered meaningful. Complaint ratios which are based on less than $1 million in premium are highly variable and may not be adequate measures of a company's performance. Consumers are cautioned against relying only on complaint ratios when evaluating companies. Premiums, benefits, financial condition, and level of service should all be considered when selecting an insurance company.
